    "abstract": "Objective To summarise the range and frequency of significant adverse events associated with acupuncture in order to provide evidence on which to base continuing efforts to improve the safety of acupuncture practice. Methods Searches were conducted of computerised databases, previous reviews of case reports, population surveys, prospective surveys of acupuncture practice and relevant sections of textbooks for primary and secondary reports to indicate the range of significant adverse events associated with acupuncture. Data from prospective surveys of acupuncture were combined to estimate the incidence of serious adverse events. Results A total of 715 adverse events was included. There were 90 primary reports of trauma, and 186 secondary reports; the most common were pneumothorax and injury to the central nervous system. Infection accounted for 204 primary reports and 91 secondary reports. Over 60% of these cases were hepatitis B. The next most common infection was of the external ear, as a complication of auricular acupuncture. The 144 miscellaneous events mainly comprised seizures and drowsiness judged severe enough to cause a traffic hazard. There were 12 primary reports of deaths. According to the evidence from 12 prospective studies which surveyed more than a million treatments, the risk of a serious adverse event with acupuncture is estimated to be 0.05 per 10 000 treatments, and 0.55 per 10 000 individual patients. Conclusions The risk of serious events occurring in association with acupuncture is very low, below that of many common medical treatments. The range of adverse events reported is wide and some events, specifically trauma and some episodes of infection, are likely to be avoidable.",

    "abstract": "Most controlled trials of acupuncture have used minimal, superficial, sham, or ‘placebo’ acupuncture. It has recently been demonstrated that light touch of the skin stimulates mechanoreceptors coupled to slow conducting unmyelinated (C) afferents resulting in activity in the insular region, but not in the somatosensory cortex. Activity in these C tactile afferents has been suggested to induce a ‘limbic touch’ response resulting in emotional and hormonal reactions. It is likely that, in many acupuncture studies, control procedures that are meant to be inert are in fact activating these C tactile afferents and consequently result in the alleviation of the affective component of pain. This could explain why control interventions are equally effective as acupuncture in alleviating pain conditions that are predominantly associated with affective components such as migraine or low back pain, but not those with a more pronounced sensory component, such as osteoarthritis of the knee or lateral epicondylalgia.",

    "abstract": "The STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) were published in five journals in 2001 and 2002. These guidelines, in the form of a checklist and explanations for use by authors and journal editors, were designed to improve reporting of acupuncture trials, particularly the interventions, thereby facilitating their interpretation and replication. Subsequent reviews of the application and impact of STRICTA have highlighted the value of STRICTA as well as scope for improvements and revision. To manage the revision process a collaboration between the STRICTA Group, the CONSORT Group and the Chinese Cochrane Centre was developed in 2008. An expert panel with 47 participants was convened that provided electronic feedback on a revised draft of the checklist. At a subsequent face-to-face meeting in Freiburg, a group of 21 participants further revised the STRICTA checklist and planned dissemination. The new STRICTA checklist, which is an official extension of CONSORT, includes 6 items and 17 subitems. These set out reporting guidelines for the acupuncture rationale, the details of needling, the treatment regimen, other components of treatment, the practitioner background and the control or comparator interventions. In addition, and as part of this revision process, the explanations for each item have been elaborated, and examples of good reporting for each item are provided. In addition, the word 'controlled' in STRICTA is replaced by 'clinical', to indicate that STRICTA is applicable to a broad range of clinical evaluation designs, including uncontrolled outcome studies and case reports. It is intended that the revised STRICTA checklist, in conjunction with both the main CONSORT statement and extension for non-pharmacological treatment, will raise the quality of reporting of clinical trials of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "For clinical trials of acupuncture, it would be desirable to have a sham procedure that is indistinguishable from the real treatment, yet inactive. A sham needle has been designed which telescopes instead of penetrating the skin. The Park Sham Device involves an improved method of supporting the sham needle and requires validation. The objective of these studies was to test whether the sham procedure using the new device was 1) indistinguishable from the same procedure using real needles in acupuncture naïve subjects, and 2) inactive, where the specific needle sensation (de qi) is taken as a surrogate measure of activity. The studies were designed as subject and assessor blind, randomised controlled trials. Study 1) included 58 patients enrolled in a clinical trial of acupuncture for acute stroke. Study 2) included 63 healthy, acupuncture naïve, adult volunteers. The interventions used were real or sham acupuncture using the Park Sham Device. Study 1) was set in a district general hospital, and study 2) in a university laboratory. The outcome measure in study 1) was the form of treatment that patients believed they had received. In study 2) the outcome measure was experience of de qi, as judged by three acupuncture experts. No patient in either group(study 1) believed he or she had been treated with the sham needle. In 40 volunteers (study 2) for whom experts achieved consensus, the relative risk of experiencing de qi with real acupuncture to that with sham acupuncture was 15.38 (95% CI 2.26 to 104.86). The inter-rater reliability of all 13 experts (study 2), calculated from their judgements on 10 subjects selected by randomisation, was 0.52 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.61). In conclusion, the results suggest that the procedure using the new device is indistinguishable from the same procedure using real needles in acupuncture naïve subjects, and is inactive, where the specific needle sensation (de qi) is taken as a surrogate measure of activity. It is therefore a valid control for acupuncture trials. The findings also lend support to the existence of de qi, a major concept underlying traditional Chinese acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a mechanistic account of back pain which attempts to incorporate all of the most important recent advances in spinal research. Anatomical and pain-provocation studies show that severe and chronic back pain most often originates in the lumbar intervertebral discs, the apophyseal joints, and the sacroiliac joints. Psychosocial factors influence many aspects of back pain behaviour but they are not important determinants of who will experience back pain in the first place. Back pain is closely (but not invariably) associated with structural pathology such as intervertebral disc prolapse and endplate fractures, although age-related biochemical changes such as those revealed by a ‘dark disc’ on MRI have little clinical relevance. All features of structural pathology (including disc prolapse) can be re-created in cadaveric specimens by severe or repetitive mechanical loading, with a combination of bending and compression being particularly harmful to the spine. Structural disruption alters the mechanical environment of disc cells in a manner that leads to cell-mediated degenerative changes, and animal experiments confirm that surgical disruption of a disc is followed by widespread disc degeneration. Some people are more vulnerable to spinal degeneration than others, largely because of their genetic inheritance. Age-related biochemical changes and loading history can also affect tissue vulnerability. Finally the concept of ‘functional pathology’ is introduced, according to which, back pain can arise because postural habits generate painful stress concentrations within innervated tissues, even though the stresses are not high enough to cause physical disruption.",

    "abstract": "From the author's direct involvement in clinical research, the conclusion has been drawn that clinically relevant long-term pain relieving effects of acupuncture (&gt;6 months) can be seen in a proportion of patients with nociceptive pain. The mechanisms behind such effects are considered in this paper. From the existing experimental data some important conclusions can be drawn: Much of the animal research only represents short-term hypoalgesia probably induced by the mechanisms behind stress-induced analgesia (SIA) and the activation of diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC). Almost all experimental acupuncture research has been performed with electro-acupuncture (EA) even though therapeutic acupuncture is mostly gentle manual acupuncture (MA). Most of the experimental human acupuncture pain threshold (PT) research shows only fast and very short-term hypoalgesia, and, importantly, PT elevation in humans does not predict the clinical outcome. The effects of acupuncture may be divided into two main components – acupuncture analgesia and therapeutic acupuncture. A hypothesis on the mechanisms of therapeutic acupuncture will include: Peripheral events that might improve tissue healing and give rise to local pain relief through axon reflexes, the release of neuropeptides with trophic effects, dichotomising nerve fibres and local endorphins. Spinal mechanisms, for example, gate-control, long-term depression, propriospinal inhibition and the balance between long-term depression and long-term potentiation. Supraspinal mechanisms through the descending pain inhibitory system, DNIC, the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA-axis. Is oxytocin also involved in the long-term effects? Cortical, psychological, “placebo” mechanisms from counselling, reassurance and anxiety reduction.",

Methods Searches of the major biomedical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClNAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) were conducted between February and July 2004. Specialist complementary medicine databases were also searched and efforts made to identify unpublished research. No language restrictions were imposed and translations were obtained where necessary. Study methodology was appraised and clinical commentaries obtained for studies reporting clinical outcomes. Results Twelve controlled trials were located, of which 10 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Four RCTs focused on acupuncture in generalised anxiety disorder or anxiety neurosis, while six focused on anxiety in the perioperative period. No studies were located on the use of acupuncture specifically for panic disorder, phobias or obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalised anxiety disorder or anxiety neurosis, it is difficult to interpret the findings of the studies of acupuncture because of the range of interventions against which acupuncture was compared. All trials reported positive findings but the reports lacked many basic methodological details. Reporting of the studies of perioperative anxiety was generally better and the initial indications are that acupuncture, specifically auricular acupuncture, is more effective than acupuncture at sham points and may be as effective as drug therapy in this situation. The results were, however, based on subjective measures and blinding could not be guaranteed. Conclusions Positive findings are reported for acupuncture in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder or anxiety neurosis but there is currently insufficient research evidence for firm conclusions to be drawn. No trials of acupuncture for other anxiety disorders were located. There is some limited evidence in favour of auricular acupuncture in perioperative anxiety. Overall, the promising findings indicate that further research is warranted in the form of well designed, adequately powered studies.",

    "abstract": "The paper describes the type and frequency of adverse events and transicnt reactions following consultations with professional acupuncturists. In a postal survey, involving 1,848 professional acupuncturists, all of whom were members of the British Acupuncture Council and practising in the UK, details of adverse events and transient reactions following treatment were recorded on standardised self-report forms. A sample size of 30,000 treatments was sought, and piloting indicated that a four-week period was required. Practitioners also provided information on themselves, including age, sex, length of training and years of practice. A total of 574 practitioners responded. 31% of the total population. These practitioners reported on adverse events and transient reactions associated with 34,407 treatments. No serious adverse events were reported, where these were defined as requiring hospital admission, prolonging hospital stays, permanently disabling, or resulting in death (95% CI: 0 to 1.1 per 10,000 treatments). A total of 43 significant minor adverse events were reported, a rate of 1.3 per 1,000 treatments (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.7). These included severe nausea and actual fainting (12), unexpected, severe and prolonged aggravation of symptoms (7), prolonged and unacceptable pain and bruising (5) and psychological and emotional reactions (4). There were three avoidable events: two patients had needles left in by mistake, and one patient had moxa burns to the skin, also caused by practitioner error. The acupuncturists also recorded 10,920 mild transient reactions occurring in 5136 treatments. 15% (95% CI: 14.6 to 15.3) of the 34,407 total. In terms of local reactions, there were reports of mild bruising (1.7%), pain (1.2%) and bleeding (0.4%). Practitioners reported that patients experienced an aggravation of existing symptoms after 2.8% of treatments. The most common mild transient reactions to treatment were feeling relaxed (11.9%) and feeling energised (6.6%). In this prospective survey of 34,407 treatments, practitioners reported no serious adverse events. This conclusion was based on data collected from one in three members of the British Acupuncture Council. Given that the whole membership delivers between one and a half and two million treatments a year, this is important evidence on public health and safety. When compared with medication routinely prescribed in primary care, the results suggest that acupuncture is a relatively safe treatment modality.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is increasingly used, so it is important to establish whether its benefits outweigh its risks. Numerous case reports of adverse events show that acupuncture is not free of risk, but accurate data from prospective investigations is scarce. A prospective survey was undertaken using intensive event monitoring. Forms were developed for reporting minor events each month and significant events as they occurred. The sample size was calculated to identify any adverse events that occurred more frequently than once in 10,000 consultations. Acupuncturists were recruited from two professional organisations in the UK. Seventy-eight acupuncturists, all doctors or physiotherapists, reported a total of 2178 events occurring in 31,822 consultations, an incidence of 684 per 10,000 consultations. The most common minor adverse events were bleeding, needling pain, and aggravation of symptoms; aggravation was followed by resolution of symptoms in 70% of cases. There were 43 significant minor adverse events reported, a rate of 14 per 10,000, of which 13 (30%) interfered with daily activities. One patient suffered a seizure (probably reflex anoxic) during acupuncture, but no adverse event was classified as serious. Avoidable events included forgotten patients, needles left in patients, cellulitis and moxa burns. In conclusion, the incidence of adverse events following acupuncture performed by doctors and physiotherapists can be classified as minimal; some avoidable events do occur. Acupuncture seems, in skilled hands, one of the safer forms of medical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Western medical acupuncture is a therapeutic modality involving the insertion of fine needles; it is an adaptation of Chinese acupuncture using current knowledge of anatomy, physiology and pathology, and the principles of evidence based medicine. While Western medical acupuncture has evolved from Chinese acupuncture, its practitioners no longer adhere to concepts such as Yin/Yang and circulation of qi, and regard acupuncture as part of conventional medicine rather than a complete \"alternative medical system\". It acts mainly by stimulating the nervous system, and its known modes of action include local antidromic axon reflexes, segmental and extrasegmental neuromodulation, and other central nervous system effects. Western medical acupuncture is principally used by conventional healthcare practitioners, most commonly in primary care. It is mainly used to treat musculoskeletal pain, including myofascial trigger point pain. It is also effective for postoperative pain and nausea. Practitioners of Western medical acupuncture tend to pay less attention than classical acupuncturists to choosing one point over another, though they generally choose classical points as the best places to stimulate the nervous system. The design and interpretation of clinical studies is constrained by lack of knowledge of the appropriate dosage of acupuncture, and the likelihood that any form of needling used as a usual control procedure in \"placebo controlled\" studies may be active. Western medical acupuncture justifies an unbiased evaluation of its role in a modern health service.",

    "abstract": "Many different styles of acupuncture practice exist, and lack of agreement on the optimal acupuncture treatment for any particular condition may mean that some patients do not receive the best treatment. This uncertainty also makes the negative results of sham controlled trials difficult to interpret. Unless we can be sure that both adequate acupuncture and an inactive sham were used in a particular trial, then that trial should not be interpreted as dismissing acupuncture for that condition. Acupuncture practice clearly involves much more than needling procedures, but there is a strong argument for elucidating the role of those needling procedure first. The components of acupuncture needling procedures have been described in the STRICTA document, but it is also clear that the patient's perception of needling is relevant for the outcome of treatment. We therefore recommend the concept of ‘dose’ of acupuncture needling, which should include both the stimulus given to the patient, and certain aspects of the patient's perceptions and response that are known to be linked to the subsequent therapeutic response. We propose the following definition of dose: the physical procedures applied in each session, using one or more needles, taking account of the patient's resulting perception (sensory, affective and cognitive) and other responses (including motor). The dose may be affected by the state of the patient (eg nervous, immune and endocrine systems); different doses may be required for different conditions. The constituents of an adequate dose can be established initially by clinical opinion and subsequently by empirical evidence from experimental studies, which may be either clinical or basic research studies. Systematic reviews which do not consider the adequacy of the acupuncture treatment may have unreliable conclusions. Out of 47 recent systematic reviews, only six have applied some criteria for adequacy. Five used a rating system or conducted a subgroup analysis, and one excluded studies from the analysis altogether if they did not meet criteria for adequacy. Research into what constitutes an adequate dose of acupuncture has long been neglected and is now urgent. Clinical studies that compare the effects of different treatment protocols are probably the most reliable source of evidence, and may also demonstrate a dose-response relationship.",

AEs evaluated as certain, probable or possible in the causality assessment were all mild/moderate in severity, with needling pain being the most frequent. Severe AEs or deaths were few and all considered unlikely to have been caused by acupuncture. Total AE incidence was 1.9%, and the incidence of AEs evaluated as certainly, probably or possibly causally related to acupuncture was 1.3%.Acupuncture during pregnancy appears to be associated with few AEs when correctly applied.",

We aimed to conduct an updated review to determine if LLLT (including laser acupuncture) has specific benefits in chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP).Electronic databases were searched for randomised trials using sham controls and blinded assessment examining the intervention of LLLT in adults with CNLBP. Primary outcomes were pain and global assessment of improvement with up to short-term follow-up. Secondary outcomes were disability, range of back movement, and adverse effects. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Subgroup analyses were based on laser dose, duration of baseline pain, and whether or not laser therapy used an acupuncture approach.15 studies were selected involving 1039 participants. At immediate and short-term follow-up there was significant pain reduction of up to WMD (weighted mean difference) -1.40 cm (95% CI -1.91 to -0.88 cm) in favour of laser treatment, occurring in trials using at least 3 Joules (J) per point, with baseline pain <30 months and in non-acupuncture LLLT trials. Global assessment showed a risk ratio of 2.16 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.90) in favour of laser treatment in the same groups only at immediate follow-up.We demonstrated moderate quality of evidence (GRADE) to support a clinically important benefit in LLLT for CNLBP in the short term, which was only seen following higher laser dose interventions and in participants with a shorter duration of back pain. Rigorously blinded trials using appropriate laser dosage would provide greater certainty around this conclusion.",

Acupuncture is widely used as a complementary and alternative treatment for patients with GORD. Objective To explore the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of GORD. Methods Four English and four Chinese databases were searched through June 2016. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture (MA/EA) for GORD versus or as an adjunct to Western medicine (WM) were selected. Data extraction and quality evaluation were performed by two authors independently and RevMan 5.2.0 was used to analyse data. Results A total of 12 trials involving 1235 patients were included. Meta-analyses demonstrated that patients receiving MA/EA combined with WM had a superior global symptom improvement compared with those receiving WM alone (relative risk (RR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26; p=0.03; six studies) with no significant heterogeneity (I 2 =0%, p=0.41). Recurrence rates of those receiving MA/EA alone were lower than those receiving WM (RR 0.42,95% CI 0.29 to 0.61; p&lt;0.001; three studies) with low heterogeneity (I 2 =7%, p=0.34), while global symptom improvement (six studies) and symptom scores (three studies) were similar (both p&gt;0.05). Descriptive analyses suggested that acupuncture also improves quality of life in patients with GORD. Conclusion This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for GORD. However, due to the small sample size and poor methodological quality of the included trials, further studies are required to validate our conclusions.

    "abstract": "Chronic muscle pain (myalgia) is a common problem throughout the world. Seemingly simple, it is actually a difficult problem for the clinician interested in determining the aetiology of the pain, as well as in managing the pain. The two common muscle pain conditions are fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome. Fibromyalgia is a chronic, widespread muscle tenderness syndrome, associated with central sensitisation. It is often accompanied by chronic sleep disturbance and fatigue, visceral pain syndromes like irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis. Myofascial pain syndrome is an overuse or muscle stress syndrome characterised by the presence of trigger points in muscle. The problem these syndromes pose lies not in making the diagnosis of muscle pain. Rather, it is the need to identify the underlying cause(s) of persistent or chronic muscle pain in order to develop a specific treatment plan. Chronic myalgia may not improve until the underlying precipitating or perpetuating factor(s) are themselves managed. Precipitating or perpetuating causes of chronic myalgia include structural or mechanical causes like scoliosis, localised joint hypomobility, or generalised or local joint laxity; and metabolic factors like depleted tissue iron stores, hypothyroidism or Vitamin D deficiency. Sometimes, correction of an underlying cause of myalgia is all that is needed to resolve the condition.",

    "abstract": "A pragmatic, single blind, randomised, controlled trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that superficial dry needling (SDN) together with active stretching is more effective than stretching alone, or no treatment, in deactivating trigger points (TrPs) and reducing myofascial pain. Forty patients with musculoskeletal pain, referred by GPs for physiotherapy, fulfilled inclusion/ exclusion criteria for active TrPs. Subjects were randomised into three groups: group 1(n = 14) received superficial dry needling (SDN) and active stretching exercises (G1); group 2 (n = 13) received stretching exercises alone (G2); and group 3 (n = 13) were no treatment controls (G3). During the three-week intervention period for G1 and G2, the number of treatments varied according to the severity of the condition and subject/clinician availability. Assessment was carried out pre-intervention (M1, post-intervention (M2), and at a three-week follow up (M3). Outcome measures were the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) of the primary TrP, using a Fischer algometer. Ninety-one per cent of assessments were blind to grouping. At M2 there were no significant inter-group differences, but at M3, G1 demonstrated significantly improved SFMPQ versus G3 (p = 0 .043) and significantly improved PPT versus G2 (p = 0 .011). There were no differences between G2 and G3. The mean PPT and SFMPQ scores correlated significantly in G1 only, though no significant inter-group differences were demonstrated. Numbers of patients requiring further treatment following the trial were: 6 (G1); 12 (G2); 9 (G3).SDN followed by active stretching is more effective than stretching alone in deactivating TrPs (reducing their sensitivity to pressure), and more effective than no treatment in reducing subjective pain. Stretching without prior deactivation may increase TrP sensitivity.",

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of two different modes of trigger point acupuncture on pain and quality of life in chronic low back pain patients compared to standard acupuncture treatment. Methods Thirty five consecutive out-patients (25 women, 10 men; age range: 65–81 years) from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Meiji University of Oriental Medicine, with non-radiating low back pain for at least six months and normal neurological examination, were randomised to one of three groups over 12 weeks. Each group received two phases of acupuncture treatment with an interval between them. Nine patients dropped out during the course of the study. The standard acupuncture group (n=9) received treatment at traditional acupuncture points for low back pain, while the other acupuncture groups received superficial (n=9) or deep (n=9) treatments on trigger points. Outcome measures were VAS pain intensity and Roland Morris Questionnaire. Results After treatment, the group that received deep needling to trigger points reported less pain intensity and improved quality of life compared to the standard acupuncture group or the group that received superficial needling to trigger points, but the differences were not statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in pain intensity between the treatment and interval in the group that received deep needling to trigger points (P&lt;0.01), but not in the standard acupuncture group or the group that received superficial needling to trigger points. Conclusion These results suggest that deep needling to trigger points may be more effective in the treatment of low back pain in elderly patients than either standard acupuncture therapy, or superficial needling to trigger points.",

In an attempt to improve standards, an international group of experienced acupuncturists and researchers devised a set of recommendations, designating them STRICTA: STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture. In a further consensus-building round, the editors of several journals helped redraft the recommendations. These follow the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) format, acting as an extension of the CONSORT guidelines for the specific requirements of acupuncture studies. Participating journal editors are publishing the STRICTA recommendations and requesting prospective authors to adhere to them when preparing reports for publication. Other journals are invited to adopt these recommendations. The intended outcome is that interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture will be more adequately reported, thereby facilitating an improvement in critical appraisal, analysis and replication of trials.",

    "abstract": "The problem of providing an acupuncture placebo that is indistinguishable from genuine needling has appeared insurmountable. However, the authors have developed an apparatus, the Park sham needle unit, which is intended to match what an acupuncture-naïve subject expects to see and experience with needling, but is intended not to produce the specific needling sensation (deqi) that is felt with true needling. This can still not be regarded as a true placebo since skin contact must be made for verisimilitude and there may thus be some physiological stimulation. Nonetheless this form of sham acupuncture should be considered an advance on all previously used methods. The apparatus consists of a blunted needle, the shaft of which telescopes into the handle when tapped, so that, while the needle appears to have been inserted, it does not actually pierce the skin. The needle is held in place by a standard guide tube contained within a fitted sheath with basal ring that is secured to the skin with double sided sticky tape.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) occurs in 10 to 20% of cancer patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy. A mixture of sensory, sensorimotor and autonomic nervous system dysfunction can occur, resulting in deterioration in function and worsened quality of life. A major feature is discomfort and pain. Early termination of treatment and dose reduction of chemotherapy may be necessary. The clinical course is variable and depends on the chemotherapy agents and their cumulative dose. Although symptoms can resolve completely, in most patients CIPN is either only partially reversible or completely irreversible. Current management for CIPN is symptomatic using membrane stabilising medications and antidepressants. The use of nerve growth factors is still experimental. Dysaesthesia and pain involving the feet and hands are described in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western biomedicine. In TCM, the pathogenesis is related to the inability to direct Qi and Blood to the extremities, and is associated with Qi, Blood, Yang and Kidney deficiencies. Acupuncture is moderately effective in treating diabetic neuropathy. However, to date, there is no report of the usefulness of acupuncture for CIPN. We report the result of a pilot prospective case series of five patients treated with an acupuncture protocol that aims to correct Qi, Blood and Yang deficiencies and directs Qi and Blood to the extremities, with the goal of improving the symptoms of CIPN. The responses were encouraging, and cannot be easily explained by the known neurophysiological mechanisms of acupuncture.",

Methods Patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were randomised to one of three treatment groups. Group A had acupuncture alone, group B had acupuncture but continued on their symptomatic medication, and group C used their symptomatic medication for the first five weeks and then had a course of acupuncture added. Patients receiving acupuncture were treated twice weekly over five weeks. Needles were inserted (with manual and electrical stimulation) in acupuncture points for pain and stiffness, selected according to traditional acupuncture theory for treating Bi syndrome. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer before treatment, after five weeks’ treatment and at one month follow up, using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) questionnaire for osteoarthritis of the knee. Results The 30 patients in our study were well matched for age, body mass index, disease duration, baseline VAS pain score and baseline WOMAC scores. Repeated measure analyses gave a highly significant improvement in pain (VAS) after the courses of acupuncture in groups A (P=0.012) and B (P=0.001); there was no change in group C until after the course of acupuncture, when the improvement was significant (P=0.001). Similarly significant changes were seen with the WOMAC pain and stiffness scores. These benefits were maintained during the one month after the course of acupuncture. Patients’ rating of global assessment was higher than that of the acupuncturist. Conclusion We conclude that manual and electroacupuncture causes a significant improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee, either on its own or as an adjunct therapy, with no loss of benefit after one month.",

Patients' quality of life can be seriously impaired through loss of sensation, pain or mobility problems. Conventional medications routinely used to manage neuropathic symptoms have poor side-effect profiles and there is little or no evidence justifying their use to treat chemotherapy-related neurotoxicities. There are studies suggesting that acupuncture may be an effective therapy in treating PN across a number of different aetiologies. Design A retrospective service evaluation.Patients (n=18) were referred for acupuncture by the medical staff and/ornurse specialists or they self-referred for treatment. A course of six weekly acupuncture sessions was offered to them, and their details were recorded on an evaluation form prior to session one. Points were selected by acupuncturists, based on patient presentation, and needles remained in situ for 30-45 min. Treatments took place in outpatient clinics, chemotherapy day case ward or a drop-in clinic based in a physiotherapy gym. The evaluation form was completed at the end of session 6 by a therapist who had not been involved in patient care.82% (n=14) of patients reported an improvement in symptoms following their course of acupuncture; one patient with advanced disease died during the 6 weeks. Some patients derived additional benefits from the treatment including a reduction in analgesic use and improved sleeping patterns. The most common acupoints used were SP6 (n=18), ST36 (n=18) and LV3 (n=14).Although these results are encouraging, they are uncontrolled.

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the leading health risk factors worldwide and is associated with several other risk factors and health problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and malignancies. Current conventional therapeutic strategies for obesity cannot achieve adequate weight control in all patients, so complementary types of treatment are also performed. Acupuncture, one of the oldest healing practices, represents the most rapidly growing complementary therapy which is recognised by both the National Institutes of Health and the WHO. A previous review concluded that acupuncture was superior to lifestyle advice, to sham acupuncture and to conventional medication. In this narrative review, the possible mechanisms of actions and the results of recent experimental and clinical studies with different forms of acupuncture (eg, body, auricular, manual and electroacupuncture) are presented. In particular, the effects of acupuncture on anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers are discussed. Both experimental and clinical current data suggest that acupuncture exerts beneficial effects on the mechanisms of obesity. Some data suggest that electroacupuncture may be more effective than manual acupuncture; however, the most effective frequency remains controversial. Combination of different forms of acupuncture with diet and exercise seems to be necessary for achieving and maintaining weight loss. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of this complementary method for obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment for chronic low back pain (cLBP); however, its therapeutic mechanisms remain controversial, partly because of the absence of an objective way of measuring subjective pain. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has demonstrated aberrant default mode network (DMN) connectivity in patients with chronic pain, and also shown that acupuncture increases DMN connectivity in pain-modulator and affective-emotional brain regions of healthy subjects. Objective This study sought to explore how cLBP influences the DMN and whether, and how, the altered DMN connectivity is reversed after acupuncture for clinical pain. Methods RsfMRI data from 20 patients with cLBP, before and after 4 weeks of treatment, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (without treatment) were analysed using independent components analyses to determine connectivity within the DMN, and combined with correlation analyses to compute covariance between changes in DMN connectivity and changes in clinical pain. Visual analogue scale data were assessed to rate clinical pain levels. Results Less connectivity within the DMN was found in patients with cLBP than in healthy controls, mainly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus. After acupuncture, patients’ connectivities were restored almost to the levels seen in healthy controls. Furthermore, reductions in clinical pain were correlated with increases in DMN connectivity. Conclusions This result suggests that modulation of the DMN by acupuncture is related to its therapeutic effects on cLBP. Imaging of the DMN provides an objective method for assessment of the effects of acupuncture-induced analgesia.",

Meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed and the magnitude of the overall effect size was calculated for the anxiety outcome. Revised STRICTA (the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) criteria were used to appraise the acupressure procedures, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies.Of 39 potentially relevant studies, seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria for review while five studies met the criteria for meta-analysis. All studies reported the positive effect of acupressure on relieving anxiety from the anticipation of surgery or treatment. EX-HN3 (Yintang), HT7 (Shenmen) were the commonest points selected and two studies used bilateral points. The acupressure procedure was generally well reported and studies had a low risk of bias. The combined results of the five trials showed a greater overall reduction in anxiety in the acupressure group than in the sham controls (standardised mean differences (SMD)=-1.11; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.61; p<0.0001 heterogeneity: I(2)=75%; χ(2)=16.17; p=0.003; r=0.485).Acupressure seems to be effective in providing immediate relief of pretreatment anxiety among adults, and has a medium effect size. However, conflicting results were found for the improvements on physiological indicators. More rigorous reporting, including allocation concealment procedure, is needed to strengthen the results.",

    "abstract": "Although Western medical acupuncture (WMA) is commonly practised in the UK, a particular approach called dry needling (DN) is becoming increasingly popular in other countries. The legitimacy of the use of DN by conventional non-physician healthcare professionals is questioned by acupuncturists. This article describes the ongoing debate over the practice of DN between physical therapists and acupuncturists, with a particular emphasis on the USA. DN and acupuncture share many similarities but may differ in certain aspects. Currently, little information is available from the literature regarding the relationship between the two needling techniques. Through reviewing their origins, theory, and practice, we found that DN and acupuncture overlap in terms of needling technique with solid filiform needles as well as some fundamental theories. Both WMA and DN are based on modern biomedical understandings of the human body, although DN arguably represents only one subcategory of WMA. The increasing volume of research into needling therapy explains its growing popularity in the musculoskeletal field including sports medicine. To resolve the debate over DN practice, we call for the establishment of a regulatory body to accredit DN courses and a formal, comprehensive educational component and training for healthcare professionals who are not physicians or acupuncturists. Because of the close relationship between DN and acupuncture, collaboration rather than dispute between acupuncturists and other healthcare professionals should be encouraged with respect to education, research, and practice for the benefit of patients with musculoskeletal conditions who require needling therapy.",

This study explores publication trends in clinical and experimental studies of EA (1975-2011) for pain and non-pain research; EA use for different clinical conditions (1974-2012); and the relation of EA research, including stimulation frequency, to opioid peptide mechanisms. Appropriate PubMed 'all fields' searches were conducted, identified studies were classified using PubMed filters and manually, and data extracted into tables. A total of 2916 clinical studies were located, of which 19% involved EA. Additionally, 3344 animal studies were located, of which 48% involved EA. The publication rate of EA studies per year has risen over time, but the percentage of studies of pain has fallen from 60% to 25%. The conditions most commonly treated with EA are musculoskeletal, neurological, obstetric and gastrointestinal, along with intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. EA studies, particularly with low frequency stimulation, are more likely to support the role of endogenous opioid mechanisms than manual acupuncture studies, and opioid release is more likely in the central nervous system than the circulation. EA is increasingly used in clinical and especially experimental research, particularly for non-pain conditions. Acupuncture does release endogenous opioids, but this probably depends on 'dosage', with the evidence more consistent and convincing for EA than for manual acupuncture. Different frequencies of EA appear to activate different endogenous opioid mechanisms.",

Objective To evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic effectiveness of a multimodal programme (PNE, eccentric exercise (EccEx) and stretching) in the short term for patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, and to determine whether the clinical outcomes achieved decline over time. Methods A one-way repeated measures study was performed in a clinical setting in 36 patients presenting with lateral epicondylitis. The patients received one session of US-guided PNE per week over 4–6 weeks, associated with a home programme of EccEx and stretching. The main outcome measures were severity of pain, disability (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire), structural tendon changes (US), hypervascularity and patients’ perceptions of overall outcome. Measurements at 6, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up included recurrence rates (increase in severity of pain or disability compared with discharge), perception of overall outcome and success rates. Results All outcome measures registered significant improvements between pre-intervention and discharge. Most patients (n=30, 83.3%) rated the overall outcome as ‘successful’ at 6 weeks. The ultrasonographic findings showed that the hypoechoic regions and hypervascularity of the extensor carpi radialis brevis changed significantly. At 26 and 52 weeks, all participants (n=32) perceived a ‘successful’ outcome. Recurrence rates were null after discharge and at follow-up at 6, 26 and 52 weeks. Conclusions Symptoms and degenerative structural changes of chronic lateral epicondylitis are reduced after US-guided PNE associated with EccEx and stretching, with encouragingly low recurrences in the mid to long term.

Methods A total of 60 patients were randomly selected in a Spanish National Health Service Public Hospital and divided into three groups: 6 sessions of DN with 3 sessions of PNE (TrPDN + PNE group, n = 21), 6 sessions of DN alone (TrPDN group, n = 20), or 10 sessions of usual care (CUC group, n = 19).

Results TrPDN + PNE and DN alone were associated with greater reductions in pain intensity and disability compared to CUC (p &lt; 0.01). TrPDN + PNE resulted in greater improvements in kinesiophobia, pain anxiety, and pain-related beliefs than DN alone and CUC (p &lt; 0.01).

The objective of this review was to explore the relationship between the ‘dose’ of the acupuncture intervention and menstrual pain outcomes. Methods Eight databases were systematically searched for trials examining penetrating body acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhoea published in English up to September 2015. Dose components for each trial were extracted, assessed by the two authors and categorised by neurophysiological dose (number of needles, retention time and mode of stimulation), cumulative dose (total number and frequency of treatments), needle location and treatment timing. Results Eleven trials were included. Components of acupuncture dose were well reported across all trials. The relationship between needle location and menstrual pain demonstrated conflicting results. Treatment before the menses appeared to produce greater reductions in pain than treatment starting at the onset of menses. A single needle during menses may provide greater pain reduction compared to multiple needles. Conversely, multiple needles before menses were superior to a single needle. Electroacupuncture may provide more rapid pain reduction compared to manual acupuncture but may not have a significantly different effect on overall menstrual pain. Conclusions There appear to be relationships between treatment timing and mode of needle stimulation, and menstrual pain outcomes. Needle location, number of needles used and frequency of treatment show clear dose-response relationships with menstrual pain outcomes. Current research is insufficient to make definitive clinical recommendations regarding optimum dose parameters for treating primary dysmenorrhoea.",

Both groups received a session including strengthening, stretching and reconditioning exercises following the principles of the Bobath concept. Patients in the Bobath plus dry needling group also received a single session of ultrasound-guided dry needling of the tibialis posterior. Spasticity (Modified Modified Ashworth Scale), function (Fugl-Meyer Scale) and stability limits (computerised dynamic posturography using the SMART EquiTest System) were collected before and 10 min after treatment by a blinded assessor. The parameters of the stability limits included movement velocity (MVL), maximum excursion (MXE), end-point excursion (EPE) and directional control (DCL). A greater number of individuals receiving Bobath plus dry needling exhibited a decrease in spasticity after treatment (P<0.001). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that patients receiving Bobath plus dry needling exhibited greater improvements in the balance (0.8, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.4), sensory (1.7, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.7) and range of motion (3.2, 95% CI 2.0 to 4.4) domains of the Fugl-Meyer Scale than those receiving Bobath only. ANCOVA also found that subjects receiving dry needling showed a greater increase in MVL non-affected forward direction, EPE non-affected direction, MXE backward and MXE affected/non-affected, DCL backward and DCL affected backward direction, than those who did not receive it. The inclusion of deep dry needling into a treatment session following the Bobath concept was effective at decreasing spasticity and improving balance, range of motion and the accuracy of maintaining stability in patients who had experienced a stroke.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative electroacupuncture (EA) on intraoperative and postoperative analgesic (alfentanil and morphine) requirement in patients scheduled for gynaecologic lower abdominal surgery. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group I (control group) –received placebo EA for 45 minutes before induction of general anaesthesia (GA); Group II –preoperative EA instituted 45 minutes before induction of GA; Group III – 45 minutes of postoperative EA. The Bispectral Index monitor was used intraoperatively to monitor the hypnotic effect of anaesthetic drugs, and alfentanil was titrated to maintain the blood pressure and pulse rate within ±15% of basal values. Postoperative pain was managed by intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Patients in Group II (0.44 ± 0.15μg/kg/min) received less alfentanil than those in Group III (0.58 ± 0.22μg/kg/min) (p=0.024), but not significantly less than those in Group I (0.51 ± 0.21μg/kg/min) (p=0.472). Postoperative morphine consumption was numerically lower in Group II compared with the other groups; however, the difference was statistically significant only during the period of 6–12 hours between Group II [0.03 (0.05) mg/kg] and Group I [0.10 (0.11) mg/kg] (p=0.015), and Group II and Group III [0.08 (0.10) mg/kg] (p=0.010). The 24-hour cumulative morphine consumption for Group II (0.52 ± 0.19mg/kg) was less than that for either Group I (0.68 ± 0.38mg/kg) or Group III (0.58 ± 0.27mg/kg), but the difference did not reach significance. In conclusion, preoperative EA leads to a reduced intraoperative alfentanil consumption, though this effect may not be specific, and has a morphine sparing effect during the early postoperative period.",

A significant number of students had knowledge about CAM that was erroneous. Lack of scientific support was considered to be the main barrier to implementation of CAM. Attitudes to CAM were positive, with 92% believing that CAM includes ideas and methods from which conventional medicine can benefit, 86% wishing to know more about CAM and 91% stating that CAM would play an important role in their future medical practice.As the public's use of various healing practices outside conventional medicine accelerates, ignorance about these practices by the country's future medical practitioners risks broadening the communication gap between the public and the profession that serves them. The majority of medical students recognise this risk and are keen to bridge this gap.",

    "abstract": "Ninety percent of my patients with myofascial trigger point (MTrP) pain have this alone and are treated with superficial dry needling. Approximately 10% have concomitant MTrP pain and nerve root compression pain. These are treated with deep dry needling. Superficial Dry Needling (SDN) The activated and sensitised nociceptors of a MTrP cause it to be so exquisitely tender that firm pressure applied to it gives rise to a flexion withdrawal reflex (jump sign) and in some cases the utterance of an expletive (shout sign). The optimum strength of SDN at a MTrP site is the minimum necessary to abolish these two reactions. With respect to this patients are divided into strong, average and weak responders. The responsiveness of each individual is determined by trial and error. It is my practice to insert a needle (0.3mm × 30mm) into the tissues immediately overlying the MTrP to a depth of 5–10mm and to leave it in situ long enough for the two reactions to be abolished. For an average reactor this is about 30secs. For a weak reactor it is several minutes. And for a strong reactor the insertion of the needle and its immediate withdrawal is all that is required. Following treatment muscle stretching exercises should be carried out, and any steps taken to eliminate factors that might lead to the reactivation of the MTrPs. Deep Dry Needling (DDN) This in my practice is only used either when primary MTrP activity causes shortening of muscle sufficient enough to bring about compression of nerve roots. Or when there is nerve compression pain usually from spondylosis or disc prolapse and the secondary development of MTrP activity. Unlike SDN, DDN is a painful procedure and one which gives rise to much post-treatment soreness.",

    "abstract": "A review is made of recent studies on myofascial trigger points (MTrP) and their mechanism is discussed. Clinical and basic science studies have shown that there are multiple MTrP loci in a MTrP region. A MTrP locus contains a sensory component (sensitive locus) and a motor component (active locus). A sensitive locus is a point from which tenderness or pain, referred pain, and local twitch response can be elicited by mechanical stimulation. Sensitive loci (probably sensitised nociceptors) are widely distributed in the whole muscle, but are concentrated in the endplate zone. An active locus is a site from which spontaneous electrical activity can be recorded. Active loci appear to be dysfunctional endplates since spontaneous electrical activity is essentially the same as the electrical activity reported by neurophysiologists as that recorded from an abnormal endplate. A MTrP is always found in a taut band which is histologically related to contraction knots caused by excessive release of acetylcholine in abnormal endplates. Both referred pain and local twitch response are mediated through spinal cord mechanisms, as demonstrated in both human and animal studies. The pathogenesis of MTrPs appears to be related to integration in the spinal cord of response to the disturbance of nerve endings and abnormal contractile mechanism at multiple dysfunctional endplates. There are many similarities between MTrPs and acupuncture points including their location and distribution, pain and referred pain patterns, local twitch responses (de qi), and possible spinal cord mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Successful management of myofascial trigger point (MTrP) pain depends on the practitioner finding all of the MTrPs from which the pain is emanating, and then deactivating them by one of several currently used methods. These include deeply applied procedures, such as an injection of a local anaesthetic into MTrPs and deep dry needling (DDN), and superficially applied ones, including an injection of saline into the skin and superficial dry needling (SDN) at MTrP sites. Reasons are given for believing that DDN should be employed in cases where there is severe muscle spasm due to an underlying radiculopathy. For all other patients SDN is the treatment of choice. Following MTrP deactivation, correction of any postural disorder likely to cause MTrP reactivation is essential, as is the need to teach the patient how to carry out appropriate muscle stretching exercises. It is also important that the practitioner excludes certain biochemical disorders.",

In the majority of large RCTs recently conducted in Germany, acupuncture was significantly more effective than doing nothing but not than sham acupuncture. Only for one study of chronic knee pain was acupuncture superior to sham. Brain imaging with functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful but is still in its early stages. Several studies have shown differences between the way the deep central areas of the brain respond to genuine acupuncture compared with sham. Acupuncture can clearly produce complex changes that are relevant to pain transmission and perception, though it is still uncertain how specific these are. Similar changes have been seen after the application of placebo cream and after hypnosis. A previous paper discussed the likely central role of the limbic system in acupuncture, evidenced by euphoria and out of body experiences. There may be a good deal of common ground between acupuncture, placebo treatments, hypnosis, and even manipulative treatments. This understanding could offer a way out of the sterile debate about whether acupuncture is merely a placebo: acupuncture could be one effective way of stimulating responses within these deep areas of the brain, though not the only way.",

Both acupuncture and sham acupuncture were performed at the most painful point on the lower back of the subjects. For the acupuncture group, a stainless steel needle was inserted to a depth of 20mm and manually stimulated (sparrow pecking method) for 20 seconds, while for the sham treatment a guide tube without a needle was placed at the point and tapped on the skin. Changes in low back pain were evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Schober test. Participants were also asked if they felt the needling sensation or not. The therapy and the evaluation were independently performed by two different acupuncturists. Results VAS score and the Schober test score showed significant improvement after treatment as compared with the sham group (P=0.02, 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the needling sensation between the acupuncture and sham group.

This paper presents a summary of the main randomised controlled trials performed as part of these projects, and the associated economic analyses. Overall the results show that acupuncture is effective in practice for a range of chronic conditions, and it seems likely to have acceptable cost utility (at least at a rate of euro35 per session). Sham acupuncture, in the form of minimal off-point needling in a therapeutic context, also appears to be effective, being no different to prophylactic medication in migraine, and superior to guideline-based standard care in chronic low back pain. In patients recruited to acupuncture trials, the response to treatment does not differ between those that agree to be randomised and those that do not. This suggests that the results of the pragmatic Acupuncture in Routine Care studies are applicable to patients from the general population who express a preference for acupuncture. In conclusion, acupuncture appears to be effective in a range of chronic conditions and it seems to have acceptable cost-effectiveness in Western health economic terms. These programmes of research do not confirm the hypothesis that needling at specific points is essential to achieve satisfactory clinical effects of acupuncture. Sham acupuncture, in the form of minimal off-point needling in a therapeutic context, is unlikely to be an inactive placebo. In April 2006, the German health authorities decided that acupuncture would be included into routine reimbursement by social health insurance funds for chronic low back pain and chronic osteoarthritis of the knee.",

Methods Acupuncture naive patients with symptomatic and radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly allocated to a course of either acupuncture or non-penetrating sham acupuncture using a sheathed ‘placebo’ needle system. Acupuncture points for pain and stiffness were selected according to acupuncture theory for treating Bi syndrome. Both manual and electrical stimulation were used. Response was assessed using the WOMAC index for osteoarthritis of the knee, self reported pain scale, the EuroQol score and plasma β-endorphin. The effectiveness of blinding was assessed. Results There were 34 patients in each group. The primary end point was the change in WOMAC pain score after the course of treatment. Comparison between the two treatment groups found a significantly greater improvement with acupuncture (mean difference 60, 95% CI 5 to 116, P=0.035) than with sham. Within the acupuncture group there was a significant improvement in pain (baseline 294, mean change 95, 95% CI 60 to 130, P&lt;0.001) which was not seen by those who had sham acupuncture (baseline 261, mean change 35, 95% CI-10 to 80, P=0.12). Similar effects within group, but not between groups, were seen with the secondary end points of WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function, and self reported pain. One month after treatment the between group pain difference had been lost (mean difference 46; 95% CI −9 to 100, P=0.10) although the acupuncture group was still benefiting compared to baseline (mean difference 59; 95% CI 16 to 102, P=0.009). The EuroQol score, a generic measure of health related quality of life, was not altered by the treatments. A minority of patients correctly guessed their treatment group (41% in the acupuncture group and 44% in the control group). Plasma β-endorphin levels were not affected by either treatment. Conclusions Acupuncture gives symptomatic improvement for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, and is significantly superior to non-penetrating sham acupuncture.

Previous studies have suggested that myofascial trigger points may cause significant functional weakness and reduced range of motion, with referred pain. Trigger point dry needling has been successful in treating athletes with myofascial pain and impingement symptoms but with only subjective improvement and not during a competitive phase. These cases support the use of dry needling in elite athletes during a competitive phase with short-term pain relief and improved function in shoulder injuries. It may help maintain rotator cuff balance and strength, reducing further pain and injury.",

    "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) is used clinically for the treatment of constipation. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays an important role in colonic motility; however it is unknown whether alterations in colonic 5-HT are associated with EA. In this study, the effect and mechanism of EA at acupuncture points LI11 and ST37 were examined using a cold saline-induced rat model of constipation.A rat constipation model was induced by cold saline gavage in 24 Sprague-Dawley rats. A further six rats were included as a Control group. The constipated rats were divided into four groups (n=6 each): a Constipation group that remained untreated; a Constipation+LI11 group that received EA at LI11; a Constipation+ST37 groups that received EA at ST37; and a Constipation+LI11+ST37 group that received EA at both LI11 and ST37. After EA treatment, faecal water content, defaecation frequency, and gastrointestinal (GI) transit were measured, as well as the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in colonic tissues (by Western blot analysis) and 5-HT in both faeces and colonic tissues (by ELISA).All three EA-treated groups demonstrated significant improvements in faecal water content, defaecation frequency and GI transit (p<0.05). In addition, TPH and 5-HT expression were both increased by EA at LI11 and/or ST37 (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the three EA groups for any outcomes.EA at LI11 and/or ST37 had a positive effect on objective markers of constipation in a rat model. In addition, EA increased 5-HT and TPH in the colonic tissues.",

Methods A prospective, randomised and controlled study was conducted at Unimed Hospital Centre in Joinville, SC, Brazil. The day before the surgery, 32 patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomised into two groups: patients from the treatment group received preoperative EA at bilateral points (LI4–LI11, LR3–ST36, PC6–TE5) for 30 min with alternating frequencies of 3 and 15 Hz. Patients from the control group received sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Use of fentanyl during the postoperative period was measured. Results 10 patients were excluded because of hemodynamic and ventilatory instability leaving 13 (10 male) in the treatment group and 9 (4 male) in the control group. The average total doses of fentanyl given were 13.1±2.2 and 16.3±1.6 μg/kg in the treatment and control groups respectively (p&lt;0.002). The doses of patient controlled analgesia were 4.1±2.0 and 6.9±1.7 μg/kg in the treatment and control groups respectively (p&lt;0.003). The number of boluses issued also differed (treatment 13.9±7.0 vs control 24.8±7.0, p&lt;0.002). Pain intensity scores differed between the groups (treatment 2.5±1.1 vs control 4.0±2.0, p&lt;0.04). One patient from the control group experienced drowsiness that justified a change in fentanyl infusion, as decided by the anaesthetist. Conclusion Preoperative electro-acupuncture in conventional cardiac surgery may reduce the postoperative consumption of fentanyl.",

Acupuncture has been reported to diminish pruritus, but self-administered acupressure has not been previously evaluated. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure on the severity of eczema in a pilot trial. Methods Adult patients with AD were randomised to an intervention group (acupressure with standard of care) or a control group (standard of care alone). Subjects in the intervention group performed acupressure using a 1.2 mm acupellet at the LI11 point, applying pressure for 3 min three times per week for 4 weeks. The severity of itching and AD at baseline and at 4 weeks were measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Results Fifteen subjects were enrolled, 12 of whom completed the study between November 2009 and May 2011. There was no significant change between baseline and follow-up survey scores within the control group. In the investigation group there was a decrease in the VAS score (p=0.05) and EASI lichenification (p=0.03), although without significant change in the overall EASI score. Comparison of the scores between groups showed a greater decrease in VAS in the experimental group than in the control group (p=0.04), and a decrease in the IGA (p=0.03) and EASI lichenification score (p=0.03). The overall EASI scores were unchanged. Conclusion Subjects using acupressure at LI11 for 4 weeks had improvement in pruritus and lichenification. Acupressure may prove to be an easily administered alternative treatment, but larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",

    "abstract": "Background The Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) is a tool to measure needle sensations. The aims of the present study were to develop a Chinese version and to assess its psychometric properties. Methods This study was a methodological and exploratory study. The English version of the MASS was translated into Chinese using standardised translation procedures. Content validity was conducted by nine acupuncture experts. The prefinal Chinese version (C-MASS) was then administered to 30 acupuncture-naïve, healthy subjects. Electroacupuncture was performed on the right LI4 and LI11 acupoints for 30 min. A test–retest reliability measurement was administered 1–2 weeks later. Construct validity was examined by comparing results from C-MASS and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). The construct validity was further assessed by the principle component analysis. Results C-MASS demonstrated a content validity ratio on relevance and importance from −0.04 to 1.00. Convergent validity was demonstrated by its significant association with the sensory dimension of SF-MPQ (γ=0.63, p&lt;0.05). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by its low association with the affective dimension of SF-MPQ (γ=−0.3, p=0.111). A five-factor structure of C-MASS was established by factor analysis. C-MASS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.71) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.92). Since the descriptor ‘sharp pain’ was not a valid needle sensation related to deqi, this was removed from C-MASS. We renamed the scale as the Modified MASS-Chinese version (C-MMASS). Conclusions A 12-descriptor C-MMASS was established and shown to be a reliable and valid tool in reporting needle sensations associated with deqi among healthy young Chinese people.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used widely to treat various chronic pain diseases, however, the underlying mechanisms of EA are still not fully understood.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, including an untreated healthy Control group (n=14), a True-spinal nerve ligation (SNL) group that underwent SNL and remained untreated (n=25), a True-SNL+EA group that underwent SNL followed by EA treatment (n=25), and a Sham-SNL group that underwent sham surgery and remained untreated (n=15). SNL was performed unilaterally at L5 and EA was applied to ST36 and BL60 bilaterally once per day. Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) were measured ipsilaterally at baseline and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after ligation. Activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SCDH were examined bilaterally by immunofluorescence staining, and concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin (IL-6) were measured in the ipsilateral SCDH by ELISA.SNL significantly decreased PWTs and activated glial cells in the superficial laminae of the ipsilateral SCDH. In rats with SNL, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity peaked at 7 days and was maintained until 14 days post-ligation, while anti-integrin alphaM (OX-42) immunoreactivity peaked at 3 days and declined gradually. EA significantly alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, EA reduced microglial activation (OX-42 positive ratios) in the lumbar SCDH at 3 days post-ligation and suppressed astrocyte activation (GFAP positive ratios) at all time points observed.EA stimulation alleviates SNL-induced neuropathic pain, at least in part through inhibition of spinal glial activation. Moreover, inhibition of spinal microglia and astrocyte activation may contribute to the immediate effects and maintenance of EA analgesia, respectively.",

Acupuncture has protective effects, although the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) has an impact on the pathogenesis of AD.To test the hypothesis that electroacupuncture (EA) confers therapeutic benefits through activation of PPAR-γ in a rat model of AD.80 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=20 each): Control (healthy control group), Sham (sham-operated group), AD (untreated AD model group), and AD+EA (AD model group treated with EA). The AD model was induced in the latter two groups by injection of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-40 into the hippocampal CA1 area bilaterally. EA was administered at GV20 and BL23 six times per week for 4 weeks. The rats' behaviour was examined using the Morris water maze test, and protein expression of Aβ, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau), PPAR-γ, and hyperphosphorylated p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) in the hippocampal CA1 region was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.EA significantly improved cognitive deficits and reduced Aβ and p-Tau Ser404 protein concentrations in the hippocampal CA1 region. AD decreased PPAR-γ and increased p-p38MAPK, while EA significantly upregulated PPAR-γ expression and significantly downregulated p-p38MAPK expression.Acupuncture at GV20 and BL23 might have a beneficial effect on rats with AD via activation of PPAR-γ and inhibition of p-p38MAPK expression.",

AMCI is associated with a higher risk of progression. In recent years, interest in acupuncture as a potential treatment for AMCI has grown. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for AMCI. Methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture versus medical treatment for AMCI were identified using the following databases from inception to July 2015: PubMed; Medline; CENTRAL; Chinese Scientific Journal Database; The Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register; China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); and Wanfang database. Data were extracted from RCTs meeting the inclusive criteria according to Cochrane methods. Meta-analyses were conducted using Rev Man V.5.3 software. Results Five trials involving 568 subjects were included. Meta-analysis showed that participants receiving acupuncture had better outcomes than those receiving nimodipine with greater clinical efficacy rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.65; p&lt;0.01), mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores (mean difference (MD) 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.28; p&lt;0.01), and picture recognition score (MD 2.12, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.75; p&lt;0.01). Meta-analysis also showed acupuncture in conjunction with nimodipine significantly improved MMSE scores (MD 1.09, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.89; p&lt;0.01) compared to nimodipine alone. Three trials reported adverse events. Methodological quality of the included studies was judged to be generally poor. Conclusions Acupuncture appears effective for AMCI when used as an alternative or adjunctive treatment; however, caution must be exercised given the low methodological quality of included trials. Further, more rigorously designed studies are needed.",

Although a few studies showed specificity to acupuncture points, information is still lacking to be able to draw a clear conclusion about the relationship between de qi and acupuncture points. Also, greater de qi was elicited in real acupuncture than placebo acupuncture in many studies. The relationship between de qi and treatment effects was controversial.It seems that real acupuncture induced greater de qi than sham acupuncture, and the relationship between de qi, acupuncture points and treatment effects was controversial. However, the current literature evaluating de qi is not sufficient to derive clear conclusions. Further studies with more objective indices and rigorous methodologies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Objective To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of chronic knee pain (CKP). Methods We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTERAL, CINAHL and four Chinese medical databases from their inception to June 2017. We included randomised controlled trials of acupuncture as the sole treatment or as an adjunctive treatment for CKP. The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale and 11-point numeric rating scale. Secondary outcome measurements included the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and adverse events. The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria and the STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture) checklist. Results Nineteen trials were included in this systematic review. Of these, data from 17 studies were available for analysis. Regarding the effectiveness of acupuncture alone or combined with other treatment, the results of the meta-analysis showed that acupuncture was associated with significantly reduced CKP at 12 weeks on WOMAC pain subscale (mean difference (MD) −1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.98 to −0.26, I 2 =62%, 3 trials, 608 participants) and VAS (MD −10.56, 95% CI −17.69 to −3.44, I 2 =0%, 2 trials, 145 patients). As for safety, no difference was found between the acupuncture and control groups (risk ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.17, I 2 =29%). Conclusion From this systematic review, we conclude that acupuncture may be effective at relieving CKP 12 weeks after acupuncture administration, based on the current evidence and our protocol. However, given the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the included trials, we are currently unable to draw any strong conclusions regarding the effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic knee pain. In addition, we found that acupuncture appears to have a satisfactory safety profile, although further studies with larger numbers of participants are needed to confirm the safety of this technique. Strengths Systematic review without language restrictions. Limitations Only a few high-quality and consistent trials could be included in this review.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports a rare iatrogenic complication of acupuncture-induced haemothorax and comments on the importance and need for special education of physicians and physiotherapists in order to apply safe and effective acupuncture treatment. A 37-year-old healthy woman had a session of acupuncture treatments for neck and right upper thoracic non-specific musculoskeletal pain, after which she gradually developed dyspnoea and chest discomfort. After some delay while trying other treatment, she was eventually transferred to the emergency department where a chest X-ray revealed a right pneumothorax and fluid collection. She was admitted to hospital and a chest tube inserted into the right hemithorax (under ultrasound guidance) drained 800 mL of bloody fluid (haematocrit (Hct) 17.8%) in 24 h and 1200 mL over the following 3 days. Her blood Hct fell from 39.0% to 30.8% and haemoglobin from 12.7 to 10.3 g/dL. The patient recovered completely and was discharged after 9 days of hospitalisation. When dyspnoea, chest pain and discomfort occur during or after an acupuncture treatment, the possibility of secondary (traumatic) pneumo- or haemopneumothorax should be considered and the patient should remain under careful observation (watchful waiting) for at least 48 h. To maximise the safety of acupuncture, specific training should be given for the safe use of acupuncture points of the anterior and posterior thoracic wall using dry needling, trigger point acupuncture or other advanced acupuncture techniques.",

Post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences between baseline and post-intervention follow-up time points in pain (immediate: Cohen's d=1.72, p&lt;0.001; 1 week: d=3.24, p&lt;0.001), jaw opening (immediate: d=0.77, p&lt;0.001; 1 week: d=1.02, p&lt;0.001) and PPT in the masseter (immediate: d=1.02, p&lt;0.001; 1 week: d=1.64, p&lt;0.001) and temporalis (immediate: d=0.91, p=0.006; 1 week: d=1.8, p&lt;0.001). A dependent t-test showed a significant improvement in jaw functioning, reflected by a large reduction in 1-week JDC scores relative to baseline (d=3.15, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Deep DN of active MTrPs in the masseter and temporalis in patients with myofascial TMD and SB was associated with immediate and 1-week improvements in pain, sensitivity, jaw opening and TMD-related disability.

To enhance the quality of reporting, consensus-based reporting guidelines are commonly used.To update and extend previous research by evaluating the more recent impact of STRICTA (STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture) and CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) guidelines on the quality of reporting of acupuncture trials.By random sampling, approximately 45 trials from each of five 2-year time periods between 1994 and 2015 were included in the study. Using scoring sheets based on the STRICTA and CONSORT checklist items (range 0 to 7 and 0 to 5, respectively), the distribution of items reported over time was investigated, with changes shown using scatterplots. The primary analysis used a before-and-after t-test to compare time periods. A meta-analysis investigated whether or not trials published in journals that endorsed STRICTA were associated with better reporting.The study included 207 trials. Improved reporting of items over time was observed, as represented by changes in the scatterplot slope and intercept. The mean STRICTA score increased from 4.27 in the 1994-1995 period to 5.53 in 2014-2015, an 18% improvement. The mean CONSORT score rose from 1.01 in the 1994-1995 period to 3.32 in 2014-2015, an increment of 46%. There was proportionately lower reporting for items related to practitioner background (STRICTA) and for randomisation implementation and allocation concealment (CONSORT). Trials published in journals that endorsed STRICTA had statistically significantly superior reporting of both STRICTA and CONSORT items overall.This study has provided evidence of an improvement in reporting of STRICTA and CONSORT items over the time period from 1994 to 2015. Journals that endorse STRICTA have a better record in terms of reporting quality. Some evidence suggests that the publication of STRICTA has had a positive impact on reporting quality.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neuroinflammation refers to a wide range of immune responses occurring in the brain or spinal cord. It is closely related to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, for which it potentially represents a new direction for treatment. Electroacupuncture (EA) is one method of acupuncture treatment, which can be used as an adjuvant therapy for many diseases. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms of EA in the reduction of neuroinflammation, summarizes relevant basic research and outlines future directions for investigation. Findings: A growing body of basic research has shown that EA can ameliorate neuroinflammation centrally (in animal models of ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s disease and vascular dementia) and peripherally (e.g. after a surgical insult or injection of lipopolysaccharide) and that its effects involve different molecular mechanisms, including activation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway and P2 type purinergic receptors, inhibition of nuclear factor κB, and mitigation of damage secondary to oxidative stress and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome activation. Conclusions: EA is capable of regulating multiple cell signal transduction pathways to alleviate neuroinflammation in animal models. Although the findings of animal studies are encouraging, further prospective clinical trials are needed to verify the efficacy of EA for the treatment of neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on cognitive recovery and synaptic remodeling in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion and explore the possible mechanism. Method: Focal cerebral ischemia was modeled in healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats by MCAO. The MCAO rats were classified into four groups: sham, MCAO, MCAO + GB20 (receiving EA at GB20) and MCAO + NA (receiving EA at a “non-acupoint” location not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point location about 10 mm above the iliac crest). Neurological deficit scores and behavior were assessed before and during the treatment. After intervention for 7 days, the hippocampus was dissected to analyze growth-associated protein (GAP)-43, synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 expression levels by Western blotting. Bioinformatic analysis and primary hippocampal neurons with calcium-voltage gated channel subunit alpha 1B (CACNA1B) gene overexpression were used to screen the target genes for EA against MCAO. Results: Significant amelioration of neurological deficits and learning/memory were found in MCAO + GB20 rats compared with MCAO or MCAO + NA rats. Protein levels of GAP-43, SYN and PSD-95 were significantly improved in MCAO + GB20–treated rats together with an increase in the number of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. CACNA1B appeared to be a target gene of EA in MCAO. There were increased mRNA levels of CACNA1B, calmodulin (CaM), Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding (CREB) and increased phosphorylation of CaM, CaMKII and CREB in the hippocampal region in MCAO + GB20 versus MCAO and MCAO + NA groups. CACNA1B overexpression modulated expression of the CaM–CaMKII–CREB axis. Conclusion: EA treatment at GB20 may ameliorate the negative effects of MCAO on cognitive function in rats by enhancing synaptic plasticity. EA treatment at GB20 may exert this neuroprotective effect by regulating the CACNA1B–CaM–CaMKII–CREB axis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) is characterized by neuropathic pain (NP). Although the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) has been widely recognized in clinical practice, the mechanism of EA in the treatment of CSR remains unknown. We previously reported that 7 days of EA improved behavioral markers of NP, attenuated increases in α-synuclein, synapsin 1 and 2, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 and growth-associated protein (GAP)-43, and improved ultrastructural changes within synapses in a rat model of CSR. Herein, we present supplemental data from the same cohort of animals examining the timing of behavioral improvement within the first week (through additional measurements at 3 and 5 days into the EA treatment) and new data on the effects of EA on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) levels. Methods: As previously reported, the rats were divided into four groups at random: normal, sham, CSR and CSR + EA. EA at bilateral LI4 and LR3 was administered once a day for 7 days (20 min each) in the CSR + EA group after the CSR model was established by inserting a fishing line under the laminae. Behavioral assessments were carried out prior to initiation of EA and at 3, 5 and 7 days into the 7-day treatment course. Concentrations ofγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ultraviolet colorimetry, respectively, and AMPAR (glutamate receptor (GluR)1 and GluR2 membrane protein) expression was determined using Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression and average optical density (AOD) of NMDAR1 (NR1), NMDAR2A (NR2A) and NMDAR2B (NR2B). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe changes in synaptic ultrastructure. Results: EA significantly improved the pressure pain threshold (PPT) and mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) 5 days into the intervention, although effects were less pronounced than at 7 days (at completion of treatment). However, significant effects on gait scores were not seen prior to 7 days. As previously reported, EA also improved markers of synaptic ultrastructure. In the spinal cord, GluR1 membrane protein expression was decreased, GluR2 membrane protein expression was increased, and the GluR1/GluR2 ratio was decreased. Protein and mRNA expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B was significantly decreased. GABA concentration was markedly increased, while Glu concentration was markedly decreased. Conclusion: Evidence of EA analgesia (higher PPT and MWT scores) was seen after 5 days of EA, while positive effects on motor function required 7 days of treatment. The underlying mechanism may be related to inhibition of AMPAR and NMDAR expression, regulation of the concentration of related neurotransmitters and improvement of spinal cord synaptic plasticity. This study establishes a preliminary theoretical foundation for the use of EA in the clinical treatment of CSR.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by examining the hypothalamic miRNA-29a-3p, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 / phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / protein kinase B (AKT) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 pathway, as well as metabolic molecules including proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP), with the goal of revealing the molecular mechanisms by which EA mitigates T2DM. Methods: T2DM was induced by high-fat diet exposure followed by streptozotocin (STZ) injection, and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) was administered to evaluate whether the effects of EA were mediated through the hypothalamic IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. T2DM was induced in 36 rats that were assigned to model, EA and EA + LY294002 groups ( n = 12 each). An additional 12 rats formed a healthy control group. Food intake, body weight and serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured. Hypothalamic micro (mi)RNA-29a-3p expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while insulin receptor signaling pathway intermediates and metabolic molecules were analyzed using Western blotting, qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: After the EA intervention, T2DM rats showed a significant decrease in both food intake and body weight. In addition, there were reductions in serum concentrations of FBG, insulin, TC, TG and LDL. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index also significantly declined. EA significantly decreased hypothalamic miRNA-29a-3p expression and enhanced IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/STAT3 pathway activity, while regulating POMC, NPY and AgRP expression. These effects of EA were at least partially reversed by LY294002 administration, which supports our hypothesis that EA mitigates T2DM via the hypothalamic IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusion: EA may improve hypothalamic IR by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/STAT3 pathway and regulating POMC, NPY and AgRP, thereby reducing food intake, correcting metabolic imbalance and mitigating T2DM. The effect of EA on the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway may involve miRNA-29a-3p downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Since hormone replacement therapy given for long periods is now recognised to produce serious side effects, patients with troublesome vasomotor symptoms are increasingly using non-hormonal treatment including acupuncture. Several randomised controlled trials have shown that acupuncture reduces menopausal symptoms in patients experiencing the normal climacteric. It may have this effect by raising serotonin levels which alter the temperature set point in the hypothalamus. Vasomotor symptoms can be extreme in breast cancer patients and patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing anticancer therapy. The safety of some herbal medicines and phytoestrogens has been questioned, as they could potentially interfere adversely with the bioavailability of tumouricidal drugs. A previous study reports short term benefit from acupuncture, and the aim of this report is to describe our approach to long term treatment.After piloting several approaches, six weekly treatments were given initially at LI4, TE5, LR3 and SP6 and two upper sternal points, but avoiding any limb with existing lymphoedema or prone to developing it. If there were no contraindications, patients were given clear instructions on how to perform self acupuncture using either semi-permanent needles or conventional needling at SP6, weekly for up to six years, for long term maintenance.A retrospective audit of electronic records was carried out by a doctor not involved in treatment. A total of 194 patients were treated, predominantly with breast and prostate cancer. One hundred and eighty two patients were female. The number of pre-treatment hot flushes per day was estimated by the patient: in the 159 cases providing adequate records, the mean was 16 flushes per day. Following treatment, 114 (79%) gained a 50% or greater reduction in hot flushes and 30 (21%) a less than 50% reduction. Treatment was abandoned in those who responded poorly or not at all. The duration of treatment varied from one month to over six years with a mean duration of nine months. Seventeen patients (9%) experienced minor side effects over the six year period, mostly minor rashes; one patient described leg swelling but this was likely to be due to a concurrent fracture.Acupuncture including self acupuncture is associated with long-term relief of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients. Treatment is safe and costs appear to be low. An algorithm is presented to guide clinical use. We recommend the use of self acupuncture with needles at SP6 in preference to semi-permanent needles in the first instance, but poor responders use indwelling studs if they fail to respond adequately to self acupuncture with regular needles. Point location may be of less importance than the overall 'dose', and an appropriate minimum dose may be required to initiate the effect.",

Methods Fifteen healthy volunteers who gave informed consent underwent repetitive eccentric exercise of the third finger of one hand (0.1Hz repetitions, three sets at five minute intervals) until exhaustion. Physical examination, pressure pain threshold, and electrical pain threshold of the skin, fascia and muscle were measured immediately afterwards and for seven days. Needle electromyogram (EMG) was also recorded in a subgroup of participants. Results Pressure pain thresholds decreased to a minimum on the second day after the exercise, then gradually returned to baseline values by the seventh day. On the second day, a ropy band was palpated in the exercised forearm muscle and the electrical pain threshold of the fascia at the palpable band was the lowest among the measured loci and tissues. Needle EMG activity accompanied with dull pain sensation was recorded only when the electrode was located on or near the fascia of the palpable band on the second day of exercise. Conclusion These results suggest that eccentric exercise may yield a useful model for the investigation of the myofascial trigger points and/or acupuncture points. The sensitised nociceptors at the fascia of the palpable band might be a possible candidate for the localised tender region.",

The aim of this study was to describe Chinese acupuncture patients’ perceived sensations of, and beliefs about, acupuncture needling. Methods We developed a questionnaire and conducted a survey study at two time periods among 200 subjects at six outpatient acupuncture clinics in Beijing, China. Results Respondents were 55% female and had a mean age of 41 years. The most common types of needling sensations reported by subjects were the terms ‘distended’(94%), ‘sore’(81%), ‘electric’(81%) and ‘numb’ (78%). Eighty-nine percent of subjects reported that the needling sensation travelled away from the puncturing points or travelled among the needling points. Eighty-two percent of subjects believed that the needling sensation was very important for acupuncture treatment, and 68% further indicated that the stronger the needling sensation, the more effective the therapy. Eighty-one percent of subjects found the acupuncture process to be very comfortable and relaxing. Conclusion Chinese acupuncture patients described the common characteristics of de qi and its migratory nature. The sensations were believed to be important in producing clinical efficacy by most patients. Measuring the sensations described as de qi in future prospective studies will help us understand the degree to which this phenomenon has an effect on the physiological outcome and clinical response to acupuncture. There appears to be a limit to the number of sensations that can be discriminated by each individual patient, and further development of the questionnaire is planned.",

Laser stimulation, regarded here as a modality of acupuncture, is non-invasive and therefore free of infection risk; and it is acceptable to patients with needle phobia. The technique is relatively easily learned by community-based general practitioners. It is also amenable to sham control and therefore double-blinding in clinical trials. A double-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted to test the efficacy of low level laser acupuncture in mild to moderate depression. Methods Thirty patients with depression were randomised to receive either active or inactive laser treatment. The laser unit could be switched to one of two settings. One switch position delivered active laser acupuncture and the other was inactive (sham). In the active mode, 0.5J was delivered to each of six to eight individually tailored acupuncture sites per visit. All patients were treated twice weekly for four weeks then weekly for a further four weeks. The patients and the acupuncturist were both blinded to conditions. Outcome was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline, weeks four and eight during treatment, and at 4 and 12 weeks following the treatment. Results At the end of the treatment period, Beck Depression Inventory scores fell from baseline by 16.1 points in the intervention group and by 6.8 points in the sham control group (P&lt;0.001). The difference showed only a trend four weeks later, but was again significant after 12 weeks (P=0.007). Laser acupuncture was well tolerated with transient fatigue as the most common adverse effect. Conclusion Laser acupuncture may be worth further investigation as a treatment for mild to moderate depression in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Background Colic causes crying in 10–30% of infants and is one of the primary reasons parents seek health care. Treatments are generally not totally effective and some cause side effects. In this study we aimed to test the effect of light needling (minimal acupuncture) on crying. Methods Forty children (median six weeks of age) with excessive crying unresponsive to conventional therapies, were recruited from 21 Child Welfare Clinics within an area of western Sweden, and quasi-randomised to control or light needling treatment. Parents were unaware of which group their child was assigned to. Children were given light needling acupuncture on one point (LI4) on both hands for approximately 20 seconds on four occasions, or received the same care except needling. Parental assessment questionnaires were used pre- and post-treatment to assess crying intensity, frequency, duration of crying and pain related behaviour throughout the day in six hour periods. Results Light needling resulted in a significant reduction in the rated crying intensity (assessed by a numeric rating scale, 0 to 10). For example, during the morning time period 0600–1200 hours, the median (range) rated crying intensity changed from 6 (1 to 9) pre-treatment to 2 (0 to 5) post-treatment (P=0.002), in the light needling group. The corresponding ratings for the children in the control group was 6 (0 to 10) and 5 (0 to 10) respectively. The difference between the groups was significant (P=0.016). There were also significant differences between the groups for the afternoon (1200–1800 hours), and evening (1800–midnight) time periods. Pain related behaviour like facial expression, was also significantly less pronounced in the light needling group as compared to the control group post-treatment, (P=0.027). The parents rated the light needling as more effective in improving symptoms than the control group (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Four treatments with light needling on one point in the hand may alleviate crying and pain related behaviour without any noted side effects.",

And from that one can hypothesise a plausible mechanism of action as to how acupuncture achieves its therapeutic effects in terms of contemporary Western medicine. These mechanisms of action include intramuscular stimulation for treating muscular pain and nerve stimulation for treating neuropathies.

Methods Sham needles were developed by blunting true acupuncture needles. Whiplash injured patients (&lt;16 weeks duration) were randomly allocated to receive either true acupuncture or the “placebo” sham needle control. The true and sham needling interventions were delivered using the same standardised procedure. Patients were informed that they would receive either real or placebo needles, and asked (i) to state which treatment they believed they had received (treatment belief); (ii) to complete the four item Borkovec and Nau self-assessment credibility scale. Results were compared between groups and the analysis explored whether a patient's previous experience of acupuncture was related to their treatment belief. Other outcomes of the study will be reported elsewhere. Results 20 patients received the true acupuncture and 21 received the sham. There was no significant difference between the treatment beliefs of the two groups (χ 2 = 1.51; p&gt;0.2) nor in the mean item scores on the Borkovec and Nau credibility scale (t test, p values ranged from 0.38 to 0.87).

Conclusion Within the context of this pilot study, the sham acupuncture intervention was found to be a credible control for acupuncture. This supports its use in a planned, definitive, randomised controlled trial on a similar whiplash injured population.",

    "abstract": "Objective The study sought to explore the possibility of using acupuncture and massage therapy for relieving neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI). Design 30 individuals with SCI and neuropathic pain were assigned to treatment of either massage or acupuncture, with 15 individuals in each group. Both groups received treatment twice weekly for 6 weeks. Treatments were evaluated at the end of treatment and 2 months later (follow-up). Results Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Within the groups, ratings of present pain, general pain, pain unpleasantness and coping improved significantly at the end of treatment after acupuncture compared to baseline values, and following massage therapy ratings of pain interference on the Multidimensional Pain Inventory improved. At follow-up no significant improvements were seen. Between-group differences were seen regarding ratings of worst pain intensity at the end of treatment, and regarding pain unpleasantness and coping with pain at follow-up, both in favour of acupuncture. At the end of treatment, eight of the 15 individuals receiving acupuncture and nine receiving massage reported an improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale, and at follow-up six patients in the acupuncture group and one patient in the massage group still reported a favourable effect from the treatment. Few side effects were reported and neither dropout from the study did this due to adverse events. Conclusion Neuropathic pain following SCI is often only partially responsive to most interventions. Results from this study indicate, however, that both acupuncture and massage therapy may relieve SCI neuropathic pain. For this reason, larger randomised controlled trials are warranted for assessing the long-term effects of these treatments.",

Methods We identified full economic evaluations such as cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the consequences and costs of acupuncture for any medical condition. Eleven electronic databases were searched up to March 2011 without language restrictions. Eligible RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane criteria for risk of bias and a modified version of the checklist for economic evaluation. The general characteristics and the results of each economic analysis such as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. Results Of 17 included studies, nine were CUAs that measured quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and eight were CEAs that assessed effectiveness of acupuncture based on improvements in clinical symptoms. All CUAs showed that acupuncture with or without usual care was cost-effective compared with waiting list control or usual care alone, with ICERs ranging from ¢3011/QALY (dysmenorrhoea) to ¢22 298/QALY (allergic rhinitis) in German studies, and from £3855/QALY (osteoarthritis) to £9951/QALY (headache) in UK studies. In the CEAs, acupuncture was beneficial at a relatively low cost in six European and Asian studies. All CUAs were well-designed with a low risk of bias, but this was not the case for CEAs. Conclusions Overall, this review demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture. Despite such promising results, any generalisation of these results needs to be made with caution given the diversity of diseases and the different status of acupuncture in the various countries.",

Methods This was a double-blind sham laser controlled trial performed in general practices in Perth, Western Australia. The participants were 144 adults with chronic non-specific LBP. They were randomised to receive eight once-weekly treatments. Laser machines (20 mW, 840 nm diode, power density 0.1 W/cm 2 ) stimulated points in three treatment groups: sham (0 joules/point), low dose (0.2 J/point) and high dose (0.8 joules/point). Participants were followed-up at 1 and 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months post treatment. Primary outcomes were pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)) and disability (Oswestry Disability Inventory (ODI)) at 6 weeks post treatment. Secondary outcomes included numerical rating scale for limitation of activity, global assessment of improvement, analgesic usage and adverse effects after treatment. Results The analysis showed no difference between sham and the laser groups at 6 weeks for pain or disability. There was a significant reduction in mean pain and disability in all groups at 6 weeks (p&lt;0.005); NPRS: sham (−1.5 (95% CI −2.1 to −0.8)), low dose (−1.3 (−2.0 to −0.8)), high dose (−1.1 (−1.7 to −0.5)).

    "abstract": "Different mechanisms have been described for the effects of acupuncture on fertility. Acupuncture may mediate neurotransmitter release, which results in the stimulation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion. The production of neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioids may also inhibit central nervous system outflow and biological stress response. Acupuncture may also stimulate blood flow to the uterus by inhibiting uterine central sympathetic nerve activity. Despite some evidence suggesting beneficial effects of acupuncture on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) success rates, recent clinical trials could not duplicate these effects, especially in patients who are infertile with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are undergoing IVF.A total of 62 women with PCOS undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) at Shayamehr IVF Clinic in Tehran (Iran) participated in a randomised, controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: there were 31 women each in the acupuncture (group I) and control groups (group II). Acupuncture based on traditional Chinese medicine was performed in group I versus no adjunctive treatment in group II. All acupuncture procedures were performed in five sessions: start of downregulation, start of stimulation, 2 days before ovum pick-up, and immediately before and after embryo transfer. We measured the rate of oocytes in metaphase II, the fertilisation rate and the quality of embryos.Our results showed a statistically higher mean of good quality embryos in group I compared with group II (p=0.044). However, the mean number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved and fertilisation rate were similar between the two groups. We also could not find any significant differences among clinical, biochemical or ongoing pregnancy rates.Acupuncture at an early stage of oocyte recruitment may have a beneficial effect on embryo quality. However, it seems to have no significant effect on other IVF/ICSI outcomes of women with PCOS.(IRCT ID: 201011275181N4).",

Methods In a blinded clinical trial, 92 patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated into either a multipoint TEAS (n=46) or a sham TEAS group (n=46). All patients received total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and sufentanil. The target concentration of sufentanil was adjusted and recorded according to mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS). Patients in the TEAS group received TEAS 30 min before anaesthesia induction and this was maintained throughout the operation at four pairs of acupuncture points. Postoperative pain, recovery and side effects were evaluated. Results Eighty-eight patients completed the study. Continuous monitoring of MAP, HR and BIS showed stable values with no significant differences between the two groups (p&gt;0.05). Sufentanil target plasma concentration in TEAS patients was significantly lower at some time points during supratentorial craniotomy, and total sufentanil consumption was significantly higher in the sham group (p&lt;0.05). Postoperative recovery and pain were significantly improved by TEAS (p&lt;0.001), without the postoperative side effects. Conclusions Multipoint TEAS at both proximal and distal points combined with TIVA can significantly decrease intraoperative sufentanil requirements, increase pain relief on postoperative day 1 and improve postoperative recovery of patients during supratentorial tumour resection, with no significant increase of side effects. These findings suggest that multipoint TEAS may be clinically effective as an adjunct to analgesia in intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative pain treatment and may speed recovery.

    "abstract": "Background The use of acupuncture has gained popularity in the USA. The number of acupuncture users and licensed acupuncturists increased by 50% and 100%, respectively, between 2002 and 2012, coinciding with increasing acknowledgement of the importance and efficacy of acupuncture over this time period. Methods This paper presents new findings from the complementary health approaches section of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (n=33 373 respondents). In particular, data on the use of acupuncture and user characteristics were compared against data collected from an earlier survey in 2002. Statistical analyses included weighted distribution, logistical regression and Pearson's χ 2 tests. Results The profile of the most common acupuncture users comprised the following sociodemographics age 41–65 years (47.4%); female gender (69.6%); and non-Hispanic (85.3%) and/or white (78.1%) ethnicity. Respondents also tended to be US citizens (92.1%) with some college education (57.1%) and in very good to excellent health (60.8%). The proportion of respondents using acupuncture for treatment of a specific health problem, as opposed to promotion of general wellness, was 84.7% in 2002 and 55.3% in 2012. Conclusions Our data suggest a growing development of acupuncture in the USA. We anticipate that the findings of our analysis of the changes in acupuncture use over the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012 will provide information for users, acupuncturists, researchers and the general public to help better understand the status of acupuncture and reasons for its usage, and to anticipate future trends for acupuncture use in the USA.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is a therapeutic treatment that is characterised by the insertion of a needle at a particular location on the body. Acupuncture stimulation includes sensory-discriminative and affective-social touch dimensions. In this review, we discuss the role of touch during acupuncture stimulation with an emphasis on the therapeutic, sensory-discriminative and affective-social aspects. In the discriminative dimension, de qi, which is associated with needling, includes a combination of various sensations, such as heaviness, numbness, soreness and distension. Achieving the appropriate de qi sensation appears to be fundamental to the therapeutic outcome following acupuncture treatment. In the affective dimension, the acupuncture procedure typically includes gentle manual touch stimulation, which induces feelings of calm and well-being, perhaps by activating C tactile fibres. Enhanced activity of C tactile afferents may induce a 'limbic touch' response, resulting in emotional and hormonal reactions. Because acupuncture is a 'therapist intensive' and complex intervention, it is necessary to understand the role of social touch between the practitioner and patient. Both sensory-discriminative and affective-social touch aspects play an important role in the therapeutic effect of acupuncture treatment in clinical practice.",

The measurements used were: visual analogue scale (VAS) for cumulative pain (before intervention, VAS1) and immediate pain (after intervention, VAS2); function (Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire (RM)); quality of life (SF-36); improvement rating; and number of anti-inflammatory tablets taken. The primary endpoint was a decrease of at least 2 cm in VAS1. Results Pain VAS improved significantly in the IG from day 14 onwards compared with the SG, but the difference did not reach the prespecified clinically relevant value of 2 cm. The IG was significantly superior to the SG in the following outcomes: cumulative pain, function, pain (SF-36) and vitality (SF-36) at days 14, 21 and 28 (p&lt;0.05); limitation in physical aspects (SF-36) at all times (p=0.007 and p=0.02); and functional capacity (SF-36) at days 21 and 28 (p&lt;0.05). The IG also took significantly fewer anti-inflammatory tablets than the SG (p=0.004) at all evaluation times and the improvement rating was better than the SG (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Yamamoto's new scalp acupuncture was more effective than sham treatment with regard to decrease in pain and anti-inflammatory intake as well as improving functional status and quality of life for patients with ANLBP.

    "abstract": "Background Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can correct various metabolic disorders such as hyperglycaemia, overweight, hyperphagia, hyperlipidaemia, inflammation, altered activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and insulin signalling defects, all of which contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Objective To review human and animal studies investigating acupuncture as a treatment for insulin resistance, and to evaluate its potential to increase insulin sensitivity. Methods PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between January 2008 and October 2015. Search terms used were ‘acupuncture’, ‘insulin resistance’, ‘insulin sensitivity’, and ‘blood glucose’. Additional secondary sources of information included reference lists from retrieved papers and pertinent papers identified by hand searches of relevant journals not found in the database. Results In total, 31 articles were included in this review and comprised studies of the following insulin resistant conditions: obesity (n=9); diabetes mellitus (n=12); polycystic ovarian syndrome (n=7); skeletal muscle atrophy (n=1); ischaemic heart disease (n=1); and fatty liver disease (n=1). Of these articles, seven were human trials and 24 animal experiments. Collectively, the studies suggest that electroacupuncture (EA) at low intensity and low frequency can reduce insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity in a range of different insulin-resistant conditions. Conclusions EA, used alone or in combination with other therapies, such as Chinese herbs or diet-exercise interventions, has the potential to be an effective treatment for insulin resistance. Additional controlled clinical studies of acupuncture are needed in subjects with diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, muscle atrophy, and fatty liver disease.",

Objective To assess the immediate neurophysiological and clinical effects of DN in patients with upper trapezius MTrPs. Methods This was a prospective, clinical trial study of 20 patients with upper trapezius MTrPs and 20 healthy volunteers (matched for height, weight, body mass index and age), all of whom received one session of DN. Primary outcome measures were neuromuscular junction response (NMJR) and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity (PI) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). Data were collected at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Results At baseline, SSR amplitude was higher in patients versus healthy volunteers (p&lt;0.003). With respect to NMJR, a clinically abnormal increment and normal reduction was observed in patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. Moreover, PPT of patients was less than healthy volunteers (p&lt;0.0001). After DN, SSR amplitude decreased significantly in patients (p&lt;0.01), but did not change in healthy volunteers. A clinically important reduction in the NMJR of patients and increment in healthy volunteers was demonstrated after DN. PPT increased after DN in patients, but decreased in healthy volunteers (p&lt;0.0001). PI improved after DN in patients (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The results of this study showed that one session of DN targeting active MTrPs appears to reduce hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and irritability of the motor endplate. DN seems effective at improving symptoms and deactivating active MTrPs, although further research is needed. Trial registration number IRCT20130316128.",

Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in the upper and lower extremities is the major adverse side effect and represents the main dose-limiting factor of this drug. The aim of this single-arm study was to evaluate the feasibility and effects of laser acupuncture (LA) in the treatment of OIPN in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers. Methods 17 gastrointestinal cancer survivors (14 colorectal and 3 gastric cancers), who had been treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies, were recruited. Low-level laser stimulation (50 mW) bilaterally at PC6, PC7, PC8, P9, LU11, SP6, KI3, BL60, KI1, and KI2 was administered for 20 min/point for 12 sessions over 4 weeks. The pain quality assessment scale (PQAS), chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity questionnaire (CINQ), oxaliplatin-specific neurotoxicity scale (OSNS), quantitative touch-detection threshold (using von Frey filaments), and cold-triggered pain withdrawal latency (using the cold-water immersion test) were measured before and after completion of the 12 treatment sessions. Results PQAS, CINQ, and OSNS scores, as well as touch-detection threshold and cold-trigger pain withdrawal latency all improved significantly after LA in the cancer patients with OIPN (p&lt;0.05). LA significantly relieved both oxaliplatin-induced cold and mechanical allodynia and also decreased the incidence and severity of neurotoxicity symptoms in the patients’ upper and lower extremities and impact on their daily activities (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Following treatment with LA, neurotoxicity symptoms were significantly improved in cancer patients with OIPN. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role of LA as a therapeutic option in the management of OIPN.",

However, the endogenous opioid-mediated analgesic mechanism of distant acupuncture associated with pain control is still unclear. This aims of this study were to evaluate the changes in enkephalin and β-endorphin in serum, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and muscle induced by acupuncture at distant myofascial trigger spots (MTrSs, similar to human MTrPs) in rabbits, to explore its underlying remote analgesic mechanism.Acupuncture at MTrSs of a distant muscle (gastrocnemius) was performed either for one session or five daily sessions in rabbits. The levels of enkephalin and β-endorphin in proximal muscle (biceps femoris), serum, DRGs and spinal cords (L5-S2) were then determined by immunoassay immediately and 5 days after treatment.Immediately after treatment, acupuncture comprising both one dose and five doses significantly enhanced spinal enkephalin expression and serum β-endorphin levels (p<0.05). However, only five-dose acupuncture significantly enhanced the β-endorphin levels in the biceps femoris and DRGs (p<0.05), while 1-dose acupuncture did not (p>0.05). Furthermore, 5 days after treatment, significantly increased levels of spinal enkephalin and serum β-endorphin persisted in animals that received 5-dose acupuncture (p<0.05).This study demonstrates that interactions within the endogenous opioid system may be involved in the remote effects of acupuncture treatment and could be a potential analgesic mechanism underlying MTrP pain management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture reveal no significant differences between acupuncture and so-called placebo acupuncture. There is a strong tendency to replace the term “placebo” by the term “sham,” because any needling stimulates a certain physiological response. However, neither concept accounts for the great diversity of results in RCTs comparing verum acupuncture and sham (placebo) acupuncture. Some trials have shown little or no difference, while other studies have found statistically significant differences. Objective: Verum acupuncture and sham (placebo) acupuncture may achieve similar results to the extent that they share active constituents. We identified these common active constituents as dermatomes: the segmental structure of the human body. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that the more verum and sham (placebo) acupuncture share the same dermatomes, the closer the clinical outcomes will be, and vice versa. Methods: All major databases were searched for RCTs that tested acupuncture versus sham (placebo) acupuncture. The dermatome charts of Hansen and Schliack were used to verify verum and sham (placebo) needling locations. Reported clinical outcomes were assessed in relation to the percentage of overlap between the dermatomes stimulated by acupuncture and sham (placebo) acupuncture. Results: Our literature search yielded a total of 1738 references. Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The effects of sham (placebo) acupuncture varied according to the dermatomes stimulated: high overlap with those stimulated by verum acupuncture resulted in almost identical efficacy, while low overlap resulted in significant differences in efficacy. Clinical outcomes were similar when verum acupuncture and sham (placebo) acupuncture shared the same dermatomes (p &lt; 0.01). Discussion: The findings of this review confirm our hypothesis. Acupuncture studies that employed verum and sham locations on overlapping dermatomes helped to create a mediocre to negative picture of acupuncture’s efficacy. The segmental structure of the body with its interconnected reflex system offers an additional neurophysiological explanation for the effectiveness of acupuncture applied to structures segmentally innervated by the spinal and visceral nervous system. Further comparative acupuncture studies should be based on knowledge of segmental anatomy. In testing verum acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, the chosen sham acupuncture needling locations should be situated on non-overlapping dermatomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dry needling (DN) versus pressure release over scalene muscle trigger points (TrPs) on pain, related disability, and inspiratory vital capacity in individuals with neck pain. Methods: In this randomized, single-blind trial, 30 patients with mechanical neck pain and active TrPs in the scalene musculature were randomly allocated to trigger point dry needling (TrP-DN; n = 15) or pressure release (n = 15) groups. The DN group received a single session of DN of active TrPs in the anterior scalene muscles, and the pressure release group received a single session of TrP pressure release over the same muscle lasting 30 s. The primary outcome was pain intensity as assessed by a numerical pain rate scale (NPRS, 0–10). Secondary outcomes included disability (neck disability index, NDI) and inspiratory vital capacity. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 day (immediately post), 1 week, and 1 month after the treatment session. Data were expressed as mean score difference (Δ) and standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Patients receiving DN exhibited a greater decrease in pain intensity than those receiving TrP pressure release at 1 month (Δ 1.2 (95% CI–1.8, –0.6), p = 0.01), but not immediately (1 day) or 1 week after. Patients in the DN group exhibited a greater increase in inspiratory vital capacity at all follow-up time points (Δ 281 mm (95% CI 130, 432) immediately after, Δ 358 mm (95% CI 227, 489) 1 week after, and Δ 310 mm (95% CI 180, 440) 1 month after treatment) than those in the pressure release group (p = 0.006). Between-group effect sizes were large at all follow-up time points (1.1 &gt; SMD &gt; 1.3) in favor of DN. Conclusion: This trial suggests that a single session of DN over active TrPs in the scalene muscles could be effective at reducing pain and increasing inspiratory vital capacity in individuals with mechanical neck pain. Future studies are needed to further confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture is a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its clinical effects and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Emerging evidence suggests autophagy is involved in β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance. We hypothesised that electroacupuncture (EA) treatment of AD involves the autophagy pathway in rats. Methods We injected 2μl Aβ 1–40 bilaterally into the hippocampi of 42 rats to establish AD. Rats remained untreated (AD group, n=14) or received 24 EA treatments at GV20+BL23 over 28 days from day 7 post-injection with/without co-treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor (AD+EA+3-MA and AD+EA groups, respectively, n=14 each). Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) testing. Hippocampi were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin/transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) to assess neuronal morphology/apoptosis, respectively. Protein expression of Beclin-1, LC3 and Aβ 1-40 was examined. Results In the MWM test, the AD+EA group showed an improvement in parameters consistent with improved learning/memory compared to untreated AD rats, and 3-MA attenuated these effects. EA mitigated cellular apoptosis resulting from Aβ infusion in the CA1 region and enhanced LC3II/LC3I ratios and Beclin-1 expression. Numerous autophagosome precursors and enlarged autophagosomes were observed by TEM in the hippocampi of EA-treated rats. Reduced Aβ levels, and co-localisation of Aβ and LC3II, were observed following EA treatment by immunofluorescence staining. EA+3-MA treated rats had much higher TUNEL-positive neurons, lower LC3II/LC3I ratios and Beclin-1 expression, and elevated Aβ levels compared with EA alone. Conclusions EA reduces neuronal apoptosis, enhances degradation of Aβ, and improves learning/memory in AD rats by upregulating the autophagy pathway.",

Previous studies have reported that acupuncture can modulate female hormone levels, improve menstrual disorders, alleviate depression and improve pregnancy rates. However, studies of acupuncture for diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) are lacking. Objective To carry out a prospective observational study aimed at assessing the effect of EA on the reproductive hormone levels of patients with DOR seeking fertility support and consider its safety. Methods Eligible patients with DOR received EA for 12 weeks: five times a week for 4 weeks followed by three times a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level at week 12. Mean luteinising hormone (LH) and serum oestradiol (E2) levels, FSH/LH ratios and symptom scale scores were simultaneously observed. Results Twenty-one patients with DOR were included in the final analysis. Mean FSH levels fell from 19.33±9.47 mIU/mL at baseline to 10.58±6.34 mIU/mL at week 12 and 11.25±6.68 mIU/mL at week 24. Change in mean FSH from baseline was −8.75±11.13 mIU/mL at week 12 (p=0.002) and −8.08±9.56 mIU/mL at week 24 (p=0.001). Mean E2 and LH levels, FSH/LH ratios and irritability scores were improved at weeks 12 and/or 24. Approximately 30% patients reported subjective increases in menstrual volume after treatment. Conclusions EA may modulate reproductive hormone levels and the effects seem to persist for at least 12 weeks after treatment with no significant side effects. EA may improve the ovarian reserve of patients with DOR, though further research is needed. Trial Registration Number NCT02229604; Results.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment for post-stroke depression (PSD). Methods: This study was a single-center, single-blinded, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. In total, 65 patients with PSD were randomly allocated into EA and sham EA groups. Treatment was administered at GV20, Sishencong, SP6, LR3 and BL18 in both groups. The EA group received EA treatment, while the sham EA group received sham EA treatment using the Park device. Treatment was given three times a week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Secondary outcomes included the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Daily Living Index (BI) and depression scale of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, week 2 after treatment, week 4 after treatment and week 8 of follow-up. Safety assessment was conducted at each visit for 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Significant differences in HRSD, SDS, NIHSS, BI and TCM scale scores were found in the EA group before and after acupuncture treatment (all p &lt; 0.001). Compared with the sham EA group, HRSD scores improved significantly in the EA group at the end of week 2 (F = 31.33, p &lt; 0.001), week 4 (F = 35.58, p &lt; 0.001) and week 8 after treatment onset (F = 25.03, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, significant improvements were observed in SDS, NIHSS and BI scores. Two participants in the EA group suffered a local hematoma, while no adverse events were reported in the sham EA group. Conclusion: EA appears to be an efficacious and safe treatment for PSD. According to our results, EA may alleviate depressive symptoms, and improve neurological function and capabilities with respect to activities of daily living (ADLs).

Although case reports do not produce reliable data on the frequency of adverse events, information on sources of application errors can be extracted to increase the quality of acupuncture in education and therapy.

A total of 61 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated randomly into two groups to be treated or not by acupuncture. Twenty-seven patients formed the study group and 34 the control group. They reported the severity of pain using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10, and their capacity to perform general activities, to work, and to walk. We also assessed the use of analgesic drugs. Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed five times, at two-week intervals. All women completed the study. In the study group the average pain during the study period showed a larger reduction (4.8 points) than the control group (−0.3 points) (P&lt;0.0001). Average pain scores decreased by at least 50% over time in 21 (78%) patients in the acupuncture group and in five (15%) patients in the control group (P&lt;0.0001). Maximum pain and pain at the moment of interview were also less in the acupuncture group compared with the control group. The capacity to perform general activities, to work and to walk was improved significantly more in the study group than in the control group (P&lt;0.05). The use of paracetamol was lower in the acupuncture group (P&lt;0.01). These results indicate that acupuncture seems to alleviate low back and pelvic pain during pregnancy, as well as to increase the capacity for some physical activities and to diminish the need for drugs, which is a great advantage during this period.",

The study was designed as an evaluator-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT). The study was performed at the Tsukuba College of Technology Clinic in Japan. Twenty subjects, who suffered from low back pain (LBP) without sciatica, were recruited, using leaflets in Tsukuba city. Subjects were allocated to either an electroacupuncture (EA) group (10 patients) or a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) group (10 patients). The procedure for EA was in accordance with standard practice at our clinic. The main outcome measures were a pain relief scale (100 mm visual analogue scale: VAS) and a LBP score recommended by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA Score). Mean VAS value during the 2-weeks experimental period of the EA group was significantly smaller than that of the TENS group (65 mm vs 86 mm; 95% CI, 4.126 - 37.953). JOA Score in the EA group improved significantly while that in the TENS group showed no change. Although some placebo effect may be included, EA appeared more useful than TENS in the short-term effect on low back pain. We suggest that more realistic acupuncture interventions based on standard practice should be employed in pragmatic RCTs.",

Acupuncture is the most widely practised non-medicinal treatment for headaches. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of laser acupuncture in this type of headache. Methods Fifty patients with chronic tension-type headache were randomly allocated to treatment or placebo groups. Patients in the treatment group received low energy laser acupuncture to LU7, LI4, GB14, and GB20 bilaterally. Points were irradiated for 43 seconds, and the intensity was 1.3J (~13J/cm 2 ). Ten sessions were given, three per week. The placebo group was treated in a similar way except that the output power of the equipment was set to zero. The outcome variables were headache intensity (VAS), duration of attacks, and number of days with a headache per month, by daily diary, assessed monthly to three months after treatment. Results There were significant differences between groups (P&lt;0.001) in changes from baseline in months one, two and three, in median score for headache intensity (treatment group -5, -3 and -2, placebo group -1, 0 and 0), median duration of attacks (treatment group -6, -4 and -4, placebo group -1, 0 and 0 hours), and median number of days with headache per month (treatment group -15, -10 and -8, placebo group -2, 0 and 0).

Methods As part of recruitment to a large-scale prospective survey of the safety of acupuncture, 9408 consecutive patients each completed one survey form soon after receiving treatment with acupuncture, and returned it directly to the research centre. On this form, patients were asked to report on a range of possible short term reactions relating to their most recent acupuncture treatment using a checklist of options. Results At least one short term reaction to acupuncture during or immediately after treatment was reported by 94.6% (CI 94.2 to 95.1) of patients, an average of 1.8 reactions per patient. The most common experiences reported were feeling ‘relaxed’ (79.1%) followed by feeling ‘energised’ (32.7%). A total of 24.4% of patients reported ‘tiredness’ or ‘drowsiness’, with obvious implications for safety if the patient intended to drive after treatment. ‘Negative’ reactions, such as pain and bruising at the site of needling, were reported by 29.7% of patients who were more likely to be female patients (OR 1.58), patients under the age of 40 (OR 1.62), patients who had consulted their GP or hospital specialist beforehand (OR 1.30), patients consulting their acupuncturist for the first time (OR 1.24), and patients treated by an acupuncturist with less than two years’ experience since qualification (OR 1.24). Only 13 patients were unwilling to have acupuncture again as a result of these short term reactions. Conclusion In this large cross-sectional study, extensive patient reports showed that ‘positive’ reactions to acupuncture treatment were very common. Tiredness, drowsiness and a range of ‘negative’ reactions were also frequently reported. Almost all patients were willing to experience these reactions again.",

Myofascial trigger points have only rarely been described in horses, and studies of their electrophysiological characteristics have not previously been published. The objective of this study was to explore the electromyographic (EMG) and other characteristics of myofascial trigger points in equine muscle, and to compare them with normal muscle tissue.Four horses with chronic pain signs and impaired performance were examined. They had previously been examined at the second author's practice, and showed signs compatible with the diagnosis of myofascial trigger points in their cleidobrachialis (brachiocephalic) muscle, ie localised tender spots in a taut band of skeletal muscle which produced a local twitch response on snapping palpation. They had therefore been selected for treatment with acupuncture. Needle EMG activity and twitch responses were recorded at 25 positions at the trigger point and at a nearby control point during the course of each horse's acupuncture treatment.All subjects demonstrated objective signs of spontaneous electrical activity, spike activity and local twitch responses at the myofascial trigger point sites within taut bands. The frequency of these signs was significantly greater at myofascial trigger points than at control sites (P<0.05).Equine myofascial trigger points can be identified, and have similar objective signs and electrophysiological properties to those documented in human and rabbit skeletal muscle tissue. The important differences from findings in human studies are that referred pain patterns and the reproduction of pain profile cannot be determined in animals.",

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a common cause of chronic widespread pain. The benefit of medication is often limited by its side effects, and the improvements obtained with exercise and education are inconsistent. Many patients seek acupuncture treatment, which is reported to be helpful in some cases. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and benefits of acupuncture offered in the setting of a tertiary referral clinic.An open, uncontrolled observational study was conducted among patients who met the usual fibromyalgia criteria and who had a pain score of at least 30 on a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients were allowed to continue other treatments but not to introduce new ones. Acupuncture was given using a Western approach according to a protocol developed by consensus. Patients were offered eight treatments in eight weeks. Outcome measures included VAS of pain intensity and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (range 0 - 100), and were taken before and after treatment, and at 14, 20 and 34 weeks from enrolment.Twenty four eligible patients were enrolled in a 12 month period. Baseline mean pain VAS score for these 24 patients was 74 (SD 18) and mean Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score 78 (SD 12.4). Only 14 patients completed the course of treatment within about 10 weeks. Compliance was poor in the remaining patients because of difficulty attending clinic, and in two cases because of exacerbation of pain. Completion of outcome measures was variable and therefore the analysis of data is limited. Five patients scored at least 20% reduction in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score which is a clinically relevant improvement. Two of these scored at least 50% reduction.Acupuncture appears to offer symptomatic improvement to some patients with fibromyalgia in a tertiary clinic who have failed to respond to other treatments. In view of its safety, further acupuncture research is justified in this population.",

The placebo run-in gave us an opportunity to use the sham device on all participants, who were then re-randomised to receive genuine acupuncture or to continue treatment with the device. The blinding was successful both at the end of the run-in and at the conclusion of the trial despite the re-randomisation. We also report our experience with the sham needle in neuroimaging experiments where the magnetic machinery poses considerable challenges for acupuncture research.",

    "abstract": "Background The double blind, non-penetrating placebo needle is effective in masking patients who are not informed that they may receive a placebo needle. In this study, we aimed to examine whether such needles are effective in masking subjects who have been so informed. Methods One hundred and fourteen informed, consenting, healthy volunteers were recruited. An experienced acupuncturist applied one of the following needle pairs – penetrating/non-penetrating, non-penetrating/non-penetrating, penetrating/penetrating – randomly at bilateral TE5 points in subjects who were informed that they would receive either a non-penetrating or a penetrating needle. After the application of a pair of needles, the subjects reported for each arm on whether they identified the needle as non-penetrating or penetrating. The patients also rated skin penetration/penetration-like pain and the deep dull pain ( de qi) associated with the needle application on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The chi squared goodness of fit test was used to determine the probability of the number of correctly and incorrectly identified needles. Statistical comparisons for VAS scores for skin penetration pain and de qi were made using Mann-Whitney's U test. Results Of the 114 non-penetrating needle applications, the subjects identified 64 incorrectly and 50 correctly, fitting a probability of 0.5 (χ 2 =1.72, P=0.19). Most interestingly, the subjects identified 36 (32%) of 114 penetrating needle applications incorrectly. Skin penetration/penetration-like pain and de qi scores did not differ significantly (P=0.87 and P=0.17, respectively) between the 114 non-penetrating and 114 penetrating needles. Conclusions The non-penetrating placebo needle was effective in masking fully informed subjects. When used together with the matched penetrating needle, it has potential for use in double blind (patient and practitioner blind) studies.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is an ancient therapy with a variety of different explanatory models. A cascade of physiological effects has been reported, both in the peripheral and the central nervous system, following the insertion of a needle or light tapping of the skin. Clinical trials testing the specific claims of acupuncture have generally tried to focus on testing the efficacy of applying specific techniques and/or specified points. However, different conditions may respond differently to different modes of stimulation. Recently, it was demonstrated that both superficial and deep needling (with de qi/Hibiki) resulted in amelioration of patellofemoral pain and unpleasantness. The pleasurable aspect of the acupuncture experience has largely been ignored as it has been considered secondary to its pain alleviating effects. This aspect of acupuncture treatment is likely to be related to activation of self-appraisal and the reward system. When a patient seeks a therapist there are expectations of a specific effect. These expectations are partly based on self-relevant phenomena and self-referentia introspection and constitute the preference. Also, when asked about the effect of the treatment, processes that orientate pre-attentive anticipatory or mnemonic information and processes that mediate self-reflection and recollection are integrated together with sensory detection to enable a decision about the patient's perception of the effect of acupuncture treatment. These ‘self-appraisal’ processes are dependent on two integrated networks: a ventral medial prefrontal cortex paralimbic limbic ‘affective’ pathway and a dorsal medial prefrontal cortex cortical hippocampal ‘cognitive’ pathway. The limbic structures are implicated in the reward system and play a key role in most diseases and illness responses including chronic pain and depression, regulating mood and neuromodulatory responses (eg sensory, autonomic, and endocrine). The pleasurable and neuromodulatory aspects of acupuncture as well as ‘placebo needling’ may partly be explained by the activation or deactivation of limbic structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, and their connections with the hypothalamus. In patients with patellofemoral pain, the effects of superficial and deep needling remained for six months. These long term pain-alleviating effects have been attributed to activation of pain inhibiting systems in cortical and subcortical pathways. When considering long term effects the cortical cerebellar system needs to be taken into account. The cortical cerebellar system is probably central to the development of neural models that learn and eventually stimulate routinely executed (eg motor skills) and long term (eg pain alleviation) cognitive processes. These higher order cognitive processes are initially mediated in prefrontal cortical loci but later shift control iteratively to internal cerebellar representations of these processes. Possibly part of the long term healing effects of acupuncture may be attributed to changes in the cerebellar system thereby sparing processing load in cortical and subcortical areas. As cortical and subcortical structures are activated and/or de-activated following stimulation of receptors in the skin, disregarding site, ‘placebo or sham needling’ does not exist and conclusions drawn on the basis that it is an inert control are invalid. ‘Self’ may be seen as a shifting illusion, ceaselessly constructed and deconstructed, and the effect of acupuncture may reflect its status (as well as that of the therapist).",

Methods A pragmatic, open, block-randomised controlled trial. The results were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The study was conducted without extra resources in a normal setting at the day-surgery department of Lovisenberg Diakonale Hospital in Oslo. 154 children with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1–2, weighing at least 10 kg, were included. Children with concomitant gastrointestinal diseases, emesis or antiemetic treatment &lt;24 h preoperatively, rash or local infection over the actual acupuncture points were excluded together with patients whose parents’ informed consent could not be obtained. The intervention group received acupuncture at pericardium 6 bilaterally, at a depth of approximately 0.7 cm with a median of 21 min during anaesthesia, followed by acupressure wristbands for 24 h and standard treatment. The control group received standard treatment. The primary end point was the occurrence of vomiting or retching during 24 h postoperatively. Results Children in the acustimulation group experienced less retching and vomiting than the control group—46.8% versus 66.2% (p=0.015). The effect of acustimulation was specifically pronounced in girls and children aged 1–3 years. Conclusion This trial indicates the effectiveness of acustimulation as an adjunct to standard treatment. The results should encourage and promote the implementation of acustimulation for postoperative vomiting in children undergoing adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy.",

    "abstract": "Background Although acupuncture sensation (also known as de qi) is a cornerstone of traditional acupuncture therapy, most research has accepted the traditional method of defining acupuncture sensation only through subjective patient reports rather than on any quantifiable physiological basis. Purpose To preliminarily investigate the frequency of key sensations experienced while needling to specific, quantifiable tissue levels (TLs) guided by ultrasound (US) imaging. Methods Five participants received needling at two acupuncture points and two control points at four TLs. US scans were used to determine when each TL was reached. Each volunteer completed 32 sets of modified Southampton Needle Sensation Questionnaires. Part one of the study tested sensations experienced at each TL and part two compared the effect of oscillation alone versus oscillation + rotation. Results In all volunteers, the frequency of pricking, sharp sensations was significantly greater in shallower TLs than deeper (p=0.007); the frequency of sensations described as deep, dull and heavy, as spreading, and as electric shocks was significantly greater in deeper TLs than shallower (p=0.002). Sensations experienced did not significantly differ between real and control points within each of three TLs (p&gt;0.05) except TL 4 (p=0.006). The introduction of needle rotation significantly increased deep, dull, heavy sensations, but not pricking and sharp sensations; within each level, the spectrum of sensation experienced during both oscillation + rotation and oscillation alone did not significantly differ between acupuncture and control points. Conclusion The preliminary study indicates a strong connection between acupuncture sensation and both tissue depth and needle rotation. Furthermore, the new methodology has been proven feasible. A further study with an objective measurement is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Insertion of an acupuncture needle into an acupuncture point typically generates a range of sensations called 'de qi'. Most acupuncturists are taught that obtaining de qi is important when treating patients with pain but this can be quite uncomfortable for patients.This study assesses the importance of the strength of de qi, on the clinical outcome in osteoarthritic pain.This study was part of a larger randomised, single-blind, multifactorial trial involving three interventions: real acupuncture (RA), Streitberger needle (SN) and mock electrical stimulation for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee. Patients were treated twice a week for 4 weeks. The two outcomes relevant to this study were pain reduction assessed by visual analogue scale and the Park needling sensation questionnaire, both measured at completion of the study. Two arms of the trial were analysed (RA and SN). Reduction in pain was correlated against strength of de qi for both RA and SN. Those who felt de qi were compared with those who did not.147 patients were recruited to the study (140 completed) with a mean pain reduction of 15.2 mm and mean de qi score of 6.2. There was no significant correlation between the strength of de qi and improvement in pain (p=0.49). There was also no significant difference in pain relief (p=0.52) between those who felt de qi and those who did not using the de qi subscale of the Park questionnaire.These data suggest that the presence and intensity of de qi has no effect on the pain relief obtained for patients with OA. This result may have implications for both acupuncture treatment and for future trial methodology.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To determine the effect of acupuncture in treating hot flushes in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. Methods The study was a randomised single-blind sham-controlled clinical trial. Perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with moderate or severe hot flushes were randomised to receive real or sham acupuncture. Both groups underwent a 4-week run-in period before the treatment. The real acupuncture group received 11 acupuncture treatments for 7 weeks, and the control group underwent sham acupuncture on non-acupuncture points during the same period. Both groups were followed for 8 weeks after the end of treatment period. Changes from baseline in the hot flush scores at week 7, measured by multiplying the hot flush frequency and severity, were the primary outcome. Hot flush frequency, severity and menopause-related symptoms measured with the Menopause Rating Scale Questionnaire were regarded as secondary outcomes. Results 54 participants were randomised into the real acupuncture group (n=27) and the sham acupuncture group (n=27). The mean change in hot flush scores was −6.4±5.2 in the real acupuncture group and −5.6±9.2 in the sham group at week 7 from values at the start of the acupuncture treatment (10.0±8.1 vs 11.7±12.6), respectively (p=0.0810). No serious adverse events were observed during the whole study period. Conclusions Compared to sham acupuncture, acupuncture failed to show significantly different effects on the hot flush scores but showed partial benefits on the hot flush severity. Further consideration is needed to develop appropriate strategies for distinguishing non-specific effects from observed overall effectiveness of acupuncture for hot flushes. Whether acupuncture has point-specific effects for hot flushes should be also considered in designing future researches.",

Methods A sham cupping device was developed by establishing a small hole to reduce the negative pressure after suction such that inner pressure could not be maintained in the cup. We enrolled 34 healthy participants to evaluate the validity of the sham cupping device as a placebo control. The participants were informed that they would receive either real or sham cupping and were asked which treatment they thought they had received. Other sensations and adverse events related to cupping therapy were investigated. Results 17 patients received real cupping therapy and 17 received sham cupping.

There was a tendency for subjects to feel that real cupping created a stronger sensation than sham cupping (48.9±21.4 vs 33.3±20.3 on a 100mm visual analogue scale). There were only mild to moderate adverse events observed in both groups. Conclusion We developed a new sham cupping device that seems to provide a credible control for real cupping therapy by producing little or no negative pressure.

Methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture treatment with non-acupuncture treatment of dysphagia in patients with a stroke were identified from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CBM disc (China Biological Medicine Database). Eligible investigations were included and data on the effectiveness of acupuncture were extracted and synthesised by meta-analysis using RevMan 5.1.4. Results were expressed as OR for dichotomous data; 95% CIs were also calculated. Results Seventy-two RCTs (3208 patients in the treatment group and 2926 patients in the control group) were identified.

In the sham group needles were inserted in eight areas that did not correspond to known acupuncture points.The clinical pregnancy rate in the acupuncture group was significantly higher than that in the control and sham groups (35.7% vs 7.1% vs 10.7%; p=0.0169).In this study, acupuncture and moxibustion increased pregnancy rates when used as an adjuvant treatment in women undergoing IVF, when embryo implantation had failed.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To examine whether acupuncture could improve cognitive deficits and reduce the loss of neurons in mice models of ageing. Methods Male 7.5-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and age-matched senescence-resistant inbred strains 1 (SAMR1) were divided into four groups (n=15 per group): SAMP8 acupuncture group (Pa), SAMP8 non-acupuncture point control group (Pn), SAMP8 control group (Pc) and SAMR1 normal control group (Rc). The behaviours were examined by the Morris water maze test and the neuron density in the hippocampus was estimated by the optical fractionator technique. Results The Morris water maze test demonstrated that the cognitive deficits of SAMP8 mice were improved by acupuncture treatment. Neuronal loss was found in hippocampal regions CA1 (−24%), CA3 (−18%) and DG (−28%) of Pc compared with Rc. The neuron number in hippocampal CA3 and DG of the Pa group was significantly increased by therapeutic acupuncture compared with the Pc group. Conclusions Acupuncture improved the cognitive impairment of middle-aged SAMP8 mice which could be attributed to the reduced neuron loss in hippocampal regions CA3 and DG. These results suggest that reducing neuron loss in the hippocampus by acupuncture is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment diseases.",

Methods Seven electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials which investigated the effects of acupuncture compared with no treatment, placebo or conventional therapies on cognitive function or other clinical outcomes in patients with VMCI. The quality of the trials selected was evaluated according to the ‘risk of bias’ assessment provided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RevMan V.5.1 software was employed for data analysis. Results Twelve trials with 691 participants were included. The methodological quality of all included trials was unclear and/or they had a high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed acupuncture in conjunction with other therapies could significantly improve Mini-Mental State Examination scores (mean difference 1.99, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.88, random model, p&lt;0.0001, 6 trials). No included trials mentioned any adverse events of the treatment.

Methods A total of 68 women undergoing FET were randomised to receive TEAS or mock TEAS at acupuncture points CV3, CV4 and SP6 and Zigong bilaterally. Both groups had six sessions per cycle for three menstrual cycles prior to the scheduled FET. Each session lasted 30 min and was repeated every other day. 3D power Doppler ultrasound parameters, HOXA10 protein expression and rates of embryo implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth were compared. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in endometrial thickness or endometrial volume. The ultrasonographic endometrial triple-line pattern was present more often in the TEAS group (p=0.002). The TEAS group had a greater endometrial and subendometrial vascularisation index (VI) than the mock TEAS group (p=0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) on 3D ultrasound and increased endometrial HOXA10 expression (p=0.001) immediately prior to FET.

    "abstract": "Plantar heel pain (plantar fasciitis) is a common and disabling condition. A variety of treatment options are available to patients with plantar heel, however the evidence for these treatments is generally weak and the best way to manage plantar heel pain remains unclear. Trigger point dry needling is increasingly used as an adjunct therapy for musculoskeletal pain. In patients with plantar heel pain this technique is thought to improve muscle activation patterns, increase joint range of motion and alleviate pain. However, there have been no randomised controlled trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of dry needling for plantar heel pain.In order to develop a treatment protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of dry needling for plantar heel pain we conducted a three stage modified Delphi process using a web-based survey technique. Over a series of three iterations, 30 experts (participants) worldwide indicated their level of agreement on specific issues relating to the use of dry needling for plantar heel pain including their treatment rationale, needling details and treatment regimen. Consensus for a dry needling protocol for plantar heel pain was achieved when >60% of participants (IQR ≤ 1.0 category on 5-point Likert scale) agreed the protocol was adequate.The response rate was 75% (n=30), 100% (n=30) and 93% (n=28) in the first, second and third rounds respectively. Round 1 helped generate a list of 10 items that were deemed important for developing a dry needling protocol for plantar heel pain. These 10 items were subsequently presented in Round 2. Of these, 5 of the 10 items met the criteria to be included in a dry needling protocol for plantar heel pain that was presented in the final round, Round 3. Items that did not meet the criteria were either removed or amended and then presented in Round 3. In the final round, 93% of participants (IQR range = 1) agreed the proposed dry needling protocol for plantar heel pain was adequate. The protocol can now be used in future research projects designed to evaluate the effectiveness of dry needling for plantar heel pain.",

The differential effects of the two techniques are of interest. We examine this in relation to brain effects of activation of LR8, a putative acupuncture point for depression, using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods Sixteen healthy participants were randomised to receive low intensity laser acupuncture to LR8 on one side and needle acupuncture to the contralateral LR8. Stimulation was in an on-off block design and brain patterns were recorded under fMRI. Results Significant activation occurred in the left precuneus during laser acupuncture compared with needle acupuncture and significant activation occurred in the left precentral gyrus during needle acupuncture compared with laser acupuncture. Conclusions Laser and needle acupuncture at LR8 in healthy participants produced different brain patterns. Laser acupuncture activated the precuneus relevant to mood in the posterior default mode network while needle acupuncture activated the parietal cortical region associated with the primary motor cortex. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the clinical relevance of these effects.",

Methods Forty Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (CG) and experimental group (EG). The CG was further randomly subdivided into CG1 and CG2 subgroups. The CG2 was used for palpating the taut band and CG1 as a blank. EG was subdivided into three groups according to recovery times: 4 weeks (4W), 8 weeks (8W) and 12 weeks (12W); these groups consisted of eight rats each. All CG rats received no intervention, whereas the intervention in EG rats was by a blunt strike to the vastus medialis and eccentric exercise for 8 weeks. The taut bands with spontaneous electrical activity were then detected in the muscle to guide a muscle biopsy. The histopathological findings were investigated under optical and electron microscopes in all groups. Results Under optical microscopy, the differently augmented sizes of round fibres (contracture knots) with deep staining in the transverse section and fusiform shapes in a longitudinal view were clearly seen in CG2 and EGs with a large diameter; the number of contracture knots was significantly more in EGs than in CGs. Under an electron microscope, the mitochondria in EGs significantly decreased with abnormal structures. The sarcomeres were significantly shortened in the 8W and 12W EGs. Conclusion An injury can cause activation of MTrSs in a muscle and an activated level of MTrPs depending on the number of contracture knots in muscle with impaired energy production.",

We examined (1) the effects of MA on MBF in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in normal rats; (2) the effects of MA on MBF in the TA injected with saline or hCGRP8-37 (low: 2×10(-4) mol/litre; high: 2×10(-3) mol/litre), a competitive CGRP receptor antagonist, in rats; and (3) the effects of MA on MBF in the TA in capsaicin-treated rats.

As in any procedure involving needling, vagal reactions have been reported during PNE. Objective To examine for changes in autonomic activity during the US-guided PNE technique on healthy patellar tendons by measurement and analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Methods Twenty-two male footballers were randomly allocated to: a control group (11 players), for whom HRV was recorded for 10 min, both at rest and during an exhaustive US examination of the patellar tendon and adjacent structures; and an experimental group (11 players), for whom HRV was recorded for 10 min, both at rest and during application of US-guided PNE on the patellar tendon. The following HRV parameters were assessed: mean NN interval, mean heart rate, time domain parameters (SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50), diameters of the Poincaré plot (SD1, SD2), stress score, and sympathetic/parasympathetic ratio. Results There were no differences between groups in any baseline measurements, nor were there any significant differences between control group measurements (baseline vs intervention). The experimental group exhibited statistically significant increases in SDNN/SD1 (p=0.02/p=0.03) and SD2 (p=0.03), indicating increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic activity, respectively. Conclusions US-guided PNE was associated with an autonomic imbalance characterised by greater parasympathetic activity, which could potentially result in a vasovagal reaction. Care should be taken to monitor for adverse reactions during US-guided PNE and simple HRV indicators may have a role in early detection.",

The participants were women with PCOS (diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria) undergoing IVF or ICSI. Eligible trials were those with intervention groups receiving manual acupuncture (MA) or electroacupuncture (EA), and control groups receiving sham acupuncture, no treatment or other treatments. Outcomes included the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), live birth rate (LBR), ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and adverse events (AEs). For statistical pooling, the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% (confidence interval) CI was calculated using a random effects model.Four RCTs including 430 participants were selected. All trials compared acupuncture (MA/EA) against no treatment. Acupuncture significantly increased the CPR (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71) and OPR (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81) and decreased the risk of OHSS (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.94); however, there was no significant difference in the LBR (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.58). None of the RCTs reported on AEs.Acupuncture may increase the CPR and OPR and decrease the risk of OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing IVF or ICSI. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology in this particular population.",

Ten rats were used as a healthy control group. The remaining 50 rats were injected stereotaxically with ibotenic acid into the right nucleus basalis magnocellularis and injected intraperitoneally with D-galactose. AD was successfully modelled in 36 rats, which were randomly divided into three groups (n=12 each): the AD group, which remained untreated; the AD+HT7 group, which received 20 sessions of acupuncture at HT7 over 1 month; and the AD+Sham group, which received acupuncture at a distant non-acupuncture point. Total reaction time (TRT) was measured by Y-maze and (18)F-FDG-PET scans were conducted on day 1 and 30. PET images were processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 8.0.Pre-treatment, TRT was greater in all AD groups versus controls (mean±SD 24.10±2.48 vs 41.34±5.00 s). Post-treatment, TRT was shortened in AD+HT7 versus AD+Sham and AD groups (p<0.0001, two-way analysis of variance). Glucose metabolic activity in the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe was decreased in AD rats compared with healthy controls and relatively elevated after HT7 acupuncture. Compared with sham acupuncture, HT7 needling had a greater positive influence on brain glucose metabolism.Needling at HT7 can improve memory ability and cerebral glucose metabolic activity of the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and frontal/temporal lobes in an AD rat model.",

There is currently no standard acupuncture protocol in the literature to treat this syndrome. Objectives To achieve consensus among a group of acupuncture practitioners on the pathology and recommended treatment of PLP and devise an acupuncture protocol for the treatment of this condition. Methods A classical Delphi approach was used using two parallel online Delphi studies. One study focused on participants with past experience of treating PLP (TPLP, n=7) and the other on practitioners with no past experience (NTPLP, n=16). Two hypothetical case studies were provided and participants were asked for responses on how they would treat these patients. Three rounds were included. Participants were also invited to rate and comment on the finalised protocol. Round 1 data were analysed using content analysis. In subsequent rounds an a priori criterion for defining consensus was set at ≤1.75 IQR. A group median of 5–6 was considered to mean ‘agree’. Results 19 participants completed all Delphi rounds (12 NTPLP, 7 TPLP). 108 NTPLP and 76 TPLP statements were generated and circulated in round 2; 53% of the NTPLP statements and 62% of the TPLP statements met consensus in round 2 and 45% of the NTPLP statements and 44% of the TPLP statements met consensus in round 3. Participants all agreed with the final protocol developed. Conclusions The protocol developed does not claim to be best practice but provides a preliminary consensus from practitioners practising acupuncture for the treatment of PLP.",

It is a chronic inflammatory process characterised by airway obstruction and progressive lung inflammation, associated with difficulty breathing and insensitivity to corticosteroid therapy. Although there is some preliminary evidence to suggest a beneficial effect of acupuncture on COPD, its mechanism of action has not been investigated. Our aim was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture in a rat model of COPD induced by exposure to cigarette smoke (CS).Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the smoke of 15 cigarettes for 1 h/day, 6 days/week for 3 months to induce COPD and treated with acupuncture at BL13 (Feishu), BL23 (Shenshu) and Dingchuan (COPD+Acupuncture, n=15), sham acupuncture (COPD+Sham, n=15) or left untreated (n=15). Exposed rats were compared with controls not exposed to CS (control, n=15). Pulmonary function was measured, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by ELISA. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) protein and mRNA expression were examined in lung tissue and in bronchus.Acupuncture treatment appeared to protect pulmonary function and reduce the COPD-induced inflammatory response by decreasing cell inflammation and the production of TNF-α and IL-8. Acupuncture also enhanced HDAC2 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting a possible direct effect on protein structure through post-translational modifications.Our results suggest that acupuncture regulates inflammatory cytokines and contributes to lung protection in a rat model of smoke-induced COPD by modulating HDAC2.",

Methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MA versus sham/placebo or no intervention in patients with MPS in the following databases from inception to January 2016: PubMed; Cochrane Library; Embase; Web of Science; and China Biology Medicine. Two reviewers independently screened the literature extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies according to the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (V.5.1.0). Then, a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results Ten RCTs were combined in a meta-analysis of MA versus sham, which showed a favourable effect of MA on pain intensity after stimulation of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs; standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.90, 95% CI −1.48 to −0.32; p=0.002) but not traditional acupuncture points (p&gt;0.05). Benefit was seen both after a single treatment (SMD −1.05, 95% CI −1.84 to −0.27; p=0.009) and course of eight sessions (weighted mean difference (WMD) −1.96, 95% CI −2.72 to −1.20; p&lt;0.001). We also found a significant increase in pressure pain threshold following MA stimulation of MTrPs (WMD 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.67; p=0.004). Two of the included studies reported mild adverse events (soreness/haemorrhage) secondary to MA. Conclusions Through stimulation of MTrPs, MA might be efficacious in terms of pain relief and reduction of muscle irritability in MPS patients.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other interventions that may have a therapeutic effect, or no intervention, for the treatment of CFS, were searched for in the following databases up to March 2018: Pubmed; Embase; the Cochrane Library; Web of Science; Wanfang database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); Chinese Biomedicine (CBM) database; and VIP database. Risk of bias was determined using the Cochrane tool. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan V.5.3 software. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was adopted for levels of evidence. Results: Sixteen studies with 1346 subjects were included. Most studies had low methodological quality. Meta-analyses showed a favourable effect of acupuncture on overall response rate compared with sham acupuncture (four studies, 281 participants, RR=2.08, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.1, I 2 =64%, low certainty) and Chinese herbal medicine (three studies, 290 participants, RR=1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, I 2 =0%, low certainty). Acupuncture also appeared to significantly reduce fatigue severity measured by Chalder’s Fatigue Scale and the Fatigue Severity Scale compared with other types of control. Conclusion: Our review indicated that acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture and other interventions (Chinese herbal medicine, mainly), but no firm conclusion could be reached owing to limited data, poor quality and potentially exaggerated effect size evaluation.

EA mobilizes energy stores, but its effect on hepatic lipid metabolism is unknown, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.To examine the effect of EA on hepatic lipid accumulation in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, and to explore potential underlying mechanisms.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal diet (control group, n=10) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity. Those exhibiting diet-induced obesity were subdivided into two groups, one receiving EA (DIO+EA group, n=10) and one left untreated (DIO group, n=10) and observed for a further 4 weeks. Body, liver and fat pad weight were measured, and liver injury was assessed histologically as well as by measuring serum values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Hepatic triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol were quantified by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Expression of liver AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1) was measured by Western blotting.EA treatment led to a reduction in body, liver and fat pad weight in DIO rats. This was accompanied by decreases in hepatic TG and total cholesterol values, fatty droplet accumulation, and serum concentrations of ALT and AST. Furthermore, EA treatment restored phosphorylation levels of AMPK (Thr(172)) and ACC (Ser(79)) inhibited by HFD, and increased CPT-1 expression.EA reduces HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, an effect that appears to be mediated through AMPK signalling pathways. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms by which EA may reduce obesity.",

Methods: A prospective pilot randomised controlled trial of unmarried women with PCOS was conducted from November 2012 to March 2016. Participants were assigned to the acupuncture group (receiving EA for 16 weeks) or the control group (receiving sham acupuncture for 16 weeks), with 27 patients in each group. The pre-specified primary outcomes and all secondary outcomes, with the exception of serum levels of neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (AD), serotonin (5-HT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), will be reported separately. Additional outcome measures selected for this secondary analysis included anxiety and depression scale scores (Zung-SAS and Zung-SDS), 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) scale scores, PCOS Quality of Life (PCOSQOL) scale scores and Chinese Quality of Life (CHQOL) scale scores. Results: After the16-week intervention, an increase in serum NE and reduction in 5-HT were observed in the acupuncture group (P=0.028 and P=0.023, respectively). The serum level of GABA decreased in both groups after the interventions (both P&lt;0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the levels of any neurotransmitters (p&gt;0.05). After EA treatment, SAS and SDS scores were decreased in the acupuncture group (P=0.007 and P=0.027, respectively) and were lower than those of the control group (P=0.003 and P=0.004, respectively).

Results: This study found that between-group differences in pain intensity were statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). Pain decreased after the first intervention in the DN+MT group (3.47±0.25 points on the NPRS) and even more so after the second intervention (4.76±0.24 points on the NPRS). After 4 weeks, pain intensity differed from baseline by 4.89±0.27 points on the NPRS. Statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001) in PPT were also found between the intervention group and the control group. After the first intervention, a significant increase in PPT within the DN+MT group (3.09±0.8 kg/cm 2 ) was observed. Cervical ROM also showed highly statistically significant differences. After 4 weeks, a statistically significant reduction (P&lt;0.001) in NDI was observed between the two groups. Conclusion: Our results show that DN+MT is efficacious and significantly better than SDN+MT at reducing pain intensity, PPT, neck disability and cervical ROM in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain. Level of evidence: 1b.",

    "abstract": "Background: Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in Europe, represents one of the most common causes of disability in adult patients, and involves considerable short- and long-term social and healthcare costs. The effectiveness of deep dry needling (DDN) on affected arm functionality was assessed throughout 8 weeks of treatment in patients with stroke in the subacute phase. Methods: Eighty patients were included in this two-group non-randomised study after a propensity score analysis was carried out. Both groups received standard physiotherapy treatment on the affected arm. The needling group also received six sessions of DDN during the 8-week period. Patients were evaluated before and after each session using the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FM UE) scale, the modified modified Ashworth scale (MMAS), the resistance to passive movement scale (REPAS) and a 10-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS 10). The Brunnstrom recovery stage was recorded at the beginning and at the end of the study, and the EuroQoL quality of life survey was completed at the beginning of the study, after the first month of treatment and at the end of the study. Results: Patients treated with DDN showed a reduction in spasticity measured using the REPAS (p &lt; 0.001) and the MMAS (p &lt; 0.05). There was also an improvement in the Brunnstrom recovery stages (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The addition of a specific DDN treatment to a standard physiotherapy treatment appeared to lead to a higher reduction in spasticity in the affected arm; however, it did not provide additional changes in functionality, pain and quality of life. Further studies with a randomised controlled trial design are required to confirm our findings.",

Methods: The Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical (VIP), Wanfang, and Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) databases were electronically searched from their inception to 10 April 2019. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale were used as outcomes to assess effectiveness with respect to cognitive function. Assessment of risk of bias (ROB) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3. Results: A total of 28 trials with 2144 participants were included in the qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. Four of the 28 trials (14%) were assessed as being at overall low ROB, 24 of the 28 trials (86%) were assessed as having overall high ROB. The quality of evidence for both MoCA and MMSE were deemed to be very low by the GRADE criteria. Results indicated that acupuncture groups may be benefiting more than non-acupuncture groups with respect to variation of MoCA scores (merged mean difference (MMD): 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18 to 3.13, p &lt; 0.00001; heterogeneity: χ 2 = 35.52, p = 0.0007, I 2 = 63%), and the heterogeneity decreased in both subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. In addition, acupuncture groups might be benefiting more than non-acupuncture groups in terms of changes in MMSE score (MMD = 2.97, 95% CI = 2.13 to 3.80, p &lt; 0.00001; heterogeneity: χ 2 = 269.75; p &lt; 0.00001; I 2 = 92%), and the heterogeneity decreased in subgroup analysis. Only one RCT addressed adverse events, and the symptoms were mild and did not affect treatment and evaluation. Conclusion: Acupuncture could be effective and safe for PSCI. Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the high ROB of included trials and very low quality of evidence for assessed outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving non-motor symptoms, of which gastrointestinal disorders are the most common. In light of recent results, intestinal dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown potential effects, although the underlying mechanism remains mostly unknown. We speculated that EA could relieve the behavioral defects of PD, and that this effect would be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota.Mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, PD + MA (manual acupuncture), and PD + EA. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was used to establish the mouse model of PD. Rotarod performance tests, open field tests, and pole tests were carried out to assess motor deficiencies. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine the survival of dopaminergic neurons. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to investigate the alterations of the gut microbiome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to characterize the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.We found that EA was able to alleviate the behavioral defects in the rotarod performance test and pole test, and partially rescue the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) chemically induced by MPTP in mice. Moreover, the PD + MA mice showed a tendency toward decreased intestinal microbial alpha diversity, while EA significantly reversed it. The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae was significantly increased in PD + MA mice, and the alteration was also reversed by EA. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were substantially increased in the SN of PD + MA mice, an effect that was reversed by EA.These results suggest that EA may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of inflammation in the SN of mice with PD, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PD and its treatment.",

Methods: C57BL/B6 mice were used to establish a CIA model and were treated with electroacupuncture (EA) at ST36 and SP6. At the end of the experiment, knee joints were harvested for hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining to detect knee synovitis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess the expression of macrophage markers. The degree of bone destruction was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (CT), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and safranin-O fast green staining. Peripheral blood transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Synovial membrane proteins were quantitatively analyzed by mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were identified and the R software package was used to analyze the data. Results: Compared with the model group, the arthritis index ( P &lt; 0.05) and inflammatory infiltration decreased ( P &lt; 0.05), cartilage destruction was inhibited ( P &lt; 0.01), the number of osteoclasts decreased ( P &lt; 0.05), knee bone erosion was alleviated and the M1/M2 macrophage ratio decreased ( P &lt; 0.01) in the EA group. The results of bioinformatics analysis showed that the differential genes between the EA and model groups were mainly enriched in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Differentially expressed proteins were mostly enriched in the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and autophagy pathways. Conclusions: EA prevents bone erosion, reduces the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in synovial tissue, inhibits the TLR and autophagy pathways and reduces synovial invasion in a mouse model of CIA.",

Methods: 40 KOA model rats were divided into control, untreated model, EA-treated model and celecoxib-treated model groups (n=10 each). Articular cartilage of the knee joint was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB)-PAS, and Moran/Mankin scores were used to evaluate articular cartilage injury across groups. Moreover, toll-like receptor (TLR)4/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway (TN-P)-related protein levels in the articular cartilage were detected using Western blotting. Oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in the synovial fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MicroRNA (miRNA/miR) expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: Compared with the control group, Moran scores increased and Mankin scores decreased in the KOA model rats. In addition, compared with those in the control group, levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and interleukin (IL)-10 were significantly decreased, while levels of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were significantly increased, in the synovial fluid of the KOA model group. Protein levels of TLR4, anti-myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and p65 NF-κB phosphorylation were significantly increased in the articular cartilage of the KOA model group. EA and celecoxib treatment reversed the trends of these protein levels. Moreover, expression of miR-15a/127/140/146a/216a-5p and miR-27a-3p in the articular cartilage were markedly increased in KOA rats, while EA and celecoxib treatment reduced their expression. Conclusions: EA reduces inflammation, oxidative stress and cartilage damage in KOA model rats, likely through regulation of the miRNA/TLR4/NF-κB pathway.",

Notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritus are the two terms used for what is believed to be a form of neuropathy. The clinical observations reported here suggest that other localised cases of pruritus exist that share common clinical features, and the term neurogenic pruritus is suggested to encompass these under one clinical condition. Acupuncture has been used to treat skin conditions, of which pruritus is one symptom. This retrospective study looked at the symptomatic relief of neurogenic pruritus in 16 patients using acupuncture. In 12 cases the affected dermatomes of the body were innervated by cervical spinal nerves, seven innervated by dorsal spinal nerves and four innervated by the lumbar spinal nerves. Seven patients had areas affected by two different regions of the spine. Restricted neck or back movements were noted in patients as were areas of paravertebral spasm or tenderness of the muscles. Total resolution of symptoms as judged by VAS occurred in 75% of patients. Relapse occurred in 37% of patients within 1-12 months following treatment. Acupuncture appeared to be effective in alleviating the distressing symptom of itching in patients presenting with neurogenic pruritus.",

This small, randomised, controlled trial was designed as a pilot to test procedures in preparation for a multi-centre trial investigating the effect of acupuncture as a treatment for tension headache. Ten volunteers suffering from episodic, tension-type headache were recruited by local newspaper articles. Patients were randomised to receive either brief needling to tender areas or selected traditional points (Group A), or pressure from a cocktail stick supported within a guide tube to defined, non-tender and non-acupuncture areas (Group B). The patients’ view of the treatment sites was obstructed so that no indication could be gained as to which form of treatment was being given. Throughout the period of the trial, duration, frequency and intensity of headaches were recorded, from which the mean weekly headache index was calculated. There was no difference between the changes in weekly headache index in the two groups, comparing scores before and after treatment. However, Group A experienced a considerably higher number of headache-free weeks than Group B. The credibility of the two procedures was tested using a standard credibility questionnaire and a “final verdict”. One subject in Group B concluded that she had not received genuine acupuncture, but overall there was no statistical difference between the credibility of treatment in the two groups.",

A 48 year old man with a long history of back pain presented with a two week history of increasing pain following a third session of acupuncture. Examination revealed tenderness in the right lumbosacral area and laboratory investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers with negative blood cultures. A bone scan and MRI scan showed evidence of septic arthritis of the right L5/S1 facet joint. An x ray computed tomography guided biopsy was carried out which isolated staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics. A repeat MRI scan demonstrated persistent septic arthritis with adjacent early abscess formation. Surgical debridement of the facet joint was therefore performed. The patient had resolution of his symptoms and the inflammatory markers returned to normal. He regained a full range of movement of the lumbar spine. Very few cases have been reported of lumbar facet joint septic arthritis and this condition is rare in association with acupuncture treatment. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained and if conservative management fails then debridement can result in an acceptable outcome.",

However, many patients with IBS are self referring for acupuncture, therefore it is of interest to know whether acupuncture is effective or not. The aim of this study was to establish variability in the primary outcome measure to enable a sample size to be calculated for a full scale trial, and to explore feasibility and design criteria. Methods A pragmatic randomised controlled trial compared 10 sessions of acupuncture plus usual GP care with usual GP care alone. Thirty patients were recruited from four GP databases in Birmingham, UK, and randomised one-to-two to acupuncture or usual care alone. The primary outcome was the IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS) at three months (maximum score 500). Analysis was by intention-to-treat, and multiple imputation was used for missing data. Results From the databases, 189 patients with IBS were identified, of whom 30 were eligible and consented to randomisation. At three months, a statistically and clinically significant difference between groups of 138 points (SD 90) in favour of acupuncture was observed on the IBS SSS (95% CI: 66 to 210; P=0.001) using multiple imputation. For a full scale trial, we estimate that a sample size of 108 patients per arm is required, based on a minimum clinically significant change of 50 points, drawn from a primary care population of 140 000. Conclusions We established the feasibility of a full scale trial, successfully recruiting patients and calculating the sample size required. The results of our pilot analysis suggest that more definitive research into acupuncture for IBS is merited. A pragmatic trial design will not be able to distinguish between acupuncture specific effects and placebo effects; however, it is the design of choice to determine cost effectiveness.",

Our primary aim was to examine whether PC6 acupuncture during a period of chemotherapy could complement pharmacological treatment of nausea in cancer patients in the palliative stage of their disease. Method We conducted a prospective observational pilot study to measure changes in nausea, and also explored the relationship between nausea, pain and constipation. Twelve patients suffering from nausea and four nausea free patients participated in the study. The nausea free patients were included because they had been troubled by nausea in a previous course of chemotherapy, despite medication with antiemetic drugs, and were about to start a new course of treatment. The patients rated their intensity of nausea, pain and constipation on a numerical rating scale before each of 10 treatment sessions with PC6 acupuncture over the course of three weeks, and at two follow ups during the following week. Results Fifteen patients completed the study. Compared to before treatment, the patients scored a significantly reduced intensity of nausea before the last treatment session (P&lt;0.01) and at the first follow up (P&lt;0.05). Three out of four nausea free patients were still nausea free before the last treatment session with acupuncture. No relationship could be found between nausea, pain and constipation before, during or after the treatment period had finished. Conclusion The study demonstrated that acupuncture treatment in cancer patients can be associated with a significantly reduced intensity of nausea during a period of chemotherapy in their final phase of life.",

    "abstract": "Background Concerns have been expressed about potential toxicity of the smoke produced by the burning of moxa in traditional Chinese medicine. With the advent of strict anti-smoking legislation in the UK, it was decided to test the volatiles produced by moxibustion and compare them with current agreed safe exposure levels. Method Moxa, in the form of cigar shaped moxa “sticks” or “rolls”, was tested under International Organization for Standardization conditions in a tobacco testing laboratory, and the quantities of a number of pre-determined volatiles measured. The smoke tested was “sidestream smoke”, the smoke which arises from the burning tip of the moxa. The test results were then scaled up to reflect normal use and to provide direct comparisons with agreed national safety standards for both short- and long-term exposure levels. Results Levels of only two volatiles produced were equivalent or greater than the safe exposure levels, as was the carbon monoxide level reported, both as a consequence of using worst case assumptions for comparison. Under normal operating conditions neither volatile nor carbon monoxide would present a safety hazard. One group of chemicals tested, the aromatic amines, with known carcinogenic properties have no agreed safety levels. Results for these in the study compared favourably with background levels reported in urban environments. Conclusion There are no immediate concerns arising from the continued use of moxa as a therapeutic modality in traditional Chinese medicine. Further testing may be required to establish whether current recommendations for ventilation and cleansing of treatment room surfaces may need to be revised. Stronger recommendations may also be necessary on the inadvisability of using moxa on broken skin.",

No electrophysiological evidence exists as to the excitability of muscle spindle afferents at myofascial trigger points MTrPs. The purpose of this current study was to explore whether an H-reflex response could be elicited from intramuscular electrical stimulation. If so, to assess the possibility of increased reflex response at MTrPs.The H-reflex latency and the conduction velocity were first determined from electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in 13 healthy subjects. Then an intramuscular monopolar needle electrode was inserted randomly into a latent MTrP or a non-MTrP in the gastrocnemius muscle. Electrical stimuli at different intensities were delivered via the intramuscular recording electrode to the MTrP or non-MTrP.The average conduction velocity (44.3 +/- 1.5 m/s) of the electrical stimulation of tibial nerve was similar (p>0.05) with the conduction velocity (43.9 +/- 1.4 m/s) of intramuscular electrical stimulation. The intramuscular H-reflex at MTrPs was higher in amplitude than non-MTrPs (p<0.001). The reflex threshold was lower for MTrPs than non-MTrPs (p<0.001).The current study provides first electrophysiological evidence that intramuscular electrical stimulation can evoke H-reflex, and that higher H-reflex amplitude and lower H-reflex threshold exist at MTrPs than non-MTrPs respectively, suggesting that muscle spindle afferents may be involved in the pathophysiology of MTrPs.",

Methods The design was a double blind, two-group parallel randomised controlled trial. The active intervention was an 830 nm (infrared), 10 mW, Ga-Al-As laser diode laser for acupuncture and a sham control. The primary outcome measures were changes in pain (visual analogue scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index) at the end of 5–10 treatment sessions. Secondary outcomes were patient global assessment, psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and subjective wellbeing (Personal Wellbeing Index). Follow up was performed at 6 weeks and 6 months after completion of treatment. Results 100 participants were enrolled and treated in a general practice setting. Per protocol analysis of the primary outcome measures using ANOVA suggested that although there was a significant overall improvement in pain and disability after the course of treatments (p&lt;0.01), there was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in both the primary and most secondary outcome measures. Conclusion This study did not show a specific effect for LA using infrared laser at 0.2 Joules per point for chronic low back pain. The overall intervention appeared effective because of placebo and other factors. As there was some concern about baseline inequality between the groups further research using tighter inclusion criteria should attempt to replicate the result and examine if a dose response may exist.",

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation is capable of regulating autonomic nerve function. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the effect of auricular acupuncture (AA) is mediated by the vagus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of AA on gastrointestinal (GI) motility and the relationship of this effect with the vagus nerve.50 rats were divided into five groups for observation of the effects of different types of acupuncture and influencing factors: control, AA, somatic acupuncture (SA), atropine and atropine+AA. The acupuncture points used for AA were ST (Stomach) and SI (Small intestine), while the acupuncture point used for SA was ST36. Electroacupuncture was performed for 15 min. A model of reduced GI motility was established using ethanol, and GI transit rate was used to measure GI motility. Heart rate variability (HRV) and the effect of atropine administration were investigated to study the relationship between AA and vagal activity.The GI transit rate increased in both the AA and SA groups compared with control, and no significant difference was found between their effects. In addition, after atropine administration, AA was found to be ineffective in influencing the GI transit rate. In the HRV analysis, no significant differences were found in the absolute low frequency normalised units, high frequency normalised units or the low frequency/high frequency component ratio in the AA or SA groups compared with control. After administration of atropine AA still had no effect on HRV.The function of AA in improving GI motility is similar to that of SA, and this effect can be blocked by the presence of atropine, indicating that this effect is regulated by the vagus. However, HRV did not reflect the acupuncture-induced changes in vagal nerve function.",

Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the benefit of acupuncture because few studies have employed controls or had physiological outcome measures. Objective To determine the feasibility of a sham, or minimally invasive, acupuncture as a control for studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for chronic pelvic pain. Methods Participants were recruited from a double-blind randomised trial comparing acupuncture with a sham procedure for patients with CP/CPPS. Acupuncture or sham procedures were performed over a 10-week period. Sham acupuncture involved placement of short needles at sites 0.5 cm away from true acupuncture points (CV1, CV4, SP6 and SP9). Participants were asked to determine their procedure allocation at the end of treatment. A total of 35participants also agreed to have blood analyses for cortisol, β-endorphin and leucine-enkephalin. Results Thirty-five (78%) of the 45 participants randomised to the sham treatment thought they had received acupuncture compared with 27 (61%) of the 44 participants randomised to acupuncture (p=0.11). Biochemical data showed no differences between the groups immediately after treatment. Thirty-two (73%) of 44 acupuncture participants met the predefined clinical response criterion compared with 21 (47%) of 45 sham acupuncture participants (p=0.017, relative risk 1.81, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1). At the end of the study, β-endorphin and leucine-enkephalin levels were both higher in the acupuncture group (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions Minimally penetrating acupuncture was found to be a valid sham control and may prove useful for evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture for other conditions.

    "abstract": "Plantar heel pain (PHP) is a common complaint, yet there are no definitive guidelines for its treatment. Acupuncture is increasingly used by podiatrists, and there is a need for evidence to validate this practice. It is acknowledged that PHP and acupuncture are both complex phenomena.A systematic review (PROSPERO no. CRD42012001881) of the effectiveness of acupuncture for PHP is presented. Quality of the studies was assessed by independent assessors with reference to Quality Index (QI), 'STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture' (STRICTA) and 'CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials' (CONSORT) criteria. Pooling of data, or even close comparison of studies, was not performed.Five randomised controlled trials and three non-randomised comparative studies were included. High quality studies report significant benefits. In one, acupuncture was associated with significant improvement in pain and function when combined with standard treatment (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). In another, acupuncture point PC7 improved pain and pressure pain threshold significantly more than LI4. Other papers were of lower quality but suggest benefits from other acupuncture approaches.There is evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture for PHP. This is comparable to the evidence available for conventionally used interventions, such as stretching, night splints or dexamethasone. Therefore acupuncture should be considered in recommendations for the management of patients with PHP. Future research should recognise the complexity of PHP, of acupuncture and of the relationship between them, to explore the optimum use and integration of this approach. There is a need for more uniformity in carrying out and reporting such work and the use of STRICTA is recommended.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between the anatomical location of traditional acupuncture points and their clinical indications as stated in two textbooks of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The following relationships are noted: (1) The acupuncture points in the trunk and their stated effects on the internal organs in the trunk have a segmental relationship--that is, acupuncture points within certain spinal segments in the trunk affect the functioning of the organs that receive autonomic innervation from the same spinal segments. This is consistent with the concept of segmental acupuncture and the idea that acupuncture may act via the somatic sympathetic reflex with a spinal pathway to affect the trunk organs. (2) The acupuncture points in the trunk and extremities have a musculoskeletal effect that is local or regional, but not distal. This is consistent with some of the models of acupuncture mechanisms on musculoskeletal effects in the Western medical acupuncture approach. (3) The acupuncture points on the head and neck preferentially affect the nearest organ. This presumably reflects the belief in TCM that acupuncture can somehow regulate the functioning of the proximal organ. No clear relationship can be identified between the myotome level of the acupuncture points in the extremities and their non-musculoskeletal clinical indications.",

    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture combined with Madopar for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), compared to the use of Madopar alone. Methods A systematic search was carried out for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and Madopar for the treatment of PD published between April 1995 and April 2015. The primary outcome was total effectiveness rate and secondary outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. Data were pooled and analysed with RevMan 5.3. Results were expressed as relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Results Finally, 11 RCTs with 831 subjects were included. Meta-analyses showed that acupuncture combined with Madopar for the treatment of PD can significantly improve the clinical effectiveness compared with Madopar alone (RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.38, P&lt;0.001). It was also found that acupuncture combined with Madopar significantly improved the UPDRS II (SMD=−1.00, 95% CI −1.71 to −0.29, P=0.006) and UPDRS I–IV total summed scores (SMD=−1.15, 95% CI −1.63 to −0.67, P&lt;0.001) but not UPDRS I (SMD=−0.37, 95% CI −0.77 to 0.02, P=0.06), UPDRS III (SMD=−0.93, 95% CI −2.28 to 0.41, P=0.17) or UPDRS IV (SMD=−0.78, 95% CI −2.24 to 0.68, P=0.30) scores. Accordingly, acupuncture combined with Madopar appeared to have a positive effect on activities of daily life and the general condition of patients with PD, but was not better than Madopar alone for the treatment of mental activity, behaviour, mood and motor disability. In the safety evaluation, it was found that acupuncture combined with Madopar was associated with significantly fewer adverse effects including gastrointestinal reactions (RR=0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65, P&lt;0.001), on–off phenomena (RR=0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.66, P=0.004) and mental disorders (RR=0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.92, P=0.04) but did not significantly reduce dyskinesia (RR=0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.16, P=0.14). Conclusion Acupuncture combined with Madopar appears, to some extent, to improve clinical effectiveness and safety in the treatment of PD, compared with Madopar alone. This conclusion must be considered cautiously, given the quality of most of the studies included was low. Therefore, more high-quality, multicentre, prospective, RCTs with large sample sizes are needed to further clarify the effect of acupuncture combined with Madopar for PD.",

    "abstract": "Background Spontaneous electrical activity (SEA) is a feature of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), which can either be latent or active. However, SEA at different stages of recovery from MTrPs remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal changes in the nature of SEA after generation of MTrPs in a rat model. Methods 32 rats were divided into four groups: 24 rats were assigned to experimental groups (EGs), which underwent the MTrP modelling intervention and 8 were allocated to a control group (CG). All EG rats received a blunt strike to the left vastus medialis combined with eccentric exercise for 8 weeks. After modelling, the EG rats were subdivided into three groups with total recovery times of 4, 8 and 12 weeks (EG-4w, EG-8w and EG-12w, respectively). Taut bands (TBs) with and without the presence of active MTrPs were identified in the left hind limb muscles of all rats, verified by SEA and further examined with electromyography recordings. Myoelectrical signals were also categorised into one of five types. Results CG rats had fewer TBs than EG rats and EGs showed variable frequencies of SEA. SEA frequencies were higher in EG-4w than in EG-8w and EG-12w groups (240.57±72.9 vs 168.14±64.5 and 151.63±65.4, respectively, p&lt;0.05) and were significantly greater in all EGs than in the CG (55.75±21.9). Relative to CG rats, amplitudes and durations of electrical potentials in the EG were only increased in the EG-8w and EG-12w groups. Types IV and V myoelectrical signals were never seen in latent MTrPs and type V signals did not occur in EG-4w rats. Conclusions Increasing recovery periods following a MTrP modelling intervention in rats are characterised by different frequencies and amplitudes of SEA from TBs. Trial Registration Number 2014012.",

Methods We conducted a randomised controlled trial of acupuncture compared with treatment as usual. Twenty women with stable unilateral intransient lymphoedema present for at least 6 months were recruited from Sydney, Australia. The women received 12 acupuncture treatments administered to body and arm points on the non-lymphoedematous limb over 8 weeks, twice weekly for 4 weeks then once weekly for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included an assessment of interest to participate in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria and compliance with treatment attendance. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks and included extracellular fluid, lymphoedema symptoms, well-being and safety. Results Acupuncture was an acceptable intervention in women with upper limb lymphoedema. Compliance with the treatment protocol was high, with nine women completing all 12 treatments. Outcome forms were completed by 17 women at 8 weeks. No major adverse occurrences, as defined by the study protocol, were reported from the acupuncture group although one woman found the needling uncomfortable, and no study participant experienced an increase in swelling of &gt;10%. There was no change in extracellular fluid or any patient-reported outcome measurement. Conclusions Lymphoedema is a persistent symptom experienced by women recovering from breast cancer. Our study suggests that acupuncture may stabilise symptoms and no major safety concerns were identified, so further research is needed.

Two reviewers independently performed the data extraction. The level of homogeneity was assessed, and studies were appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, the STRICTA guidelines for acupuncture reporting and the NICMAN scale for acupuncture quality.Ten studies with 432 participants were included: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two pilot RCTs, three uncontrolled clinical trials, one quasi-RCT and one prospective case series. Improvements in DPN pain symptoms were reported by all studies. Heterogeneity of outcome measures prevented a meta-analysis. Variations were found in needle retention time and point selection, as well as total number and frequency of treatments. Common acupuncture point selections were ST36 and SP6. Half of the studies used local point selection. Studies conducted outside China had better acupuncture reporting and quality according to the STRICTA checklist and NICMAN scales, respectively. Risk of bias was high or unclear in the majority of studies for all domains except attrition bias.Acupuncture for DPN appears to improve symptoms. However, the application of acupuncture varies greatly, and the quality of included studies was generally low. Available studies have varying methodologies and different outcome measures.

Further SEM images were taken after each of these needles underwent a standard manipulation with an acupuncture needling practice gel. A comparison of forces and torques during the needling process was also carried out.The SEM images revealed significant surface irregularities and inconsistencies at the needle tips, especially for needles from one of the two brands. Metallic lumps and small, loosely attached pieces of material were observed on the surfaces of some needles. Some of the lumps and pieces of material seen on the needle surfaces disappeared after the acupuncture manipulation. If these needles had been used on patients, the metallic lumps and small pieces of material could have been deposited in human tissues, which could have caused adverse events such as dermatitis. Malformed needle tips might also cause other adverse effects including bleeding, haematoma/bruising, or strong pain during needling. An off-centre needle tip could result in the needle altering its direction during insertion and consequently failing to reach the intended acupuncture point or damaging adjacent tissues.These findings highlight the need for improved quality control of acupuncture needles, with a view to further enhancing the safety and comfort of acupuncture users.",

Methods 50 participants with a clinical and radiological diagnosis of LSS were randomised to receive acupuncture combined with usual care (acupuncture group), or usual care alone (control group). Participants in the acupuncture group were offered 12–16 sessions of manual acupuncture±electroacupuncture over 6 weeks and maintained their usual self-management. The control group was provided with physical therapy as required and maintained their usual self-management. The primary outcome was the change in back-specific functional status, as measured by the Oswestry disability index (ODI) at the 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included symptoms and other relevant domains. Outcome assessors were not blinded. Results 39 participants (78%) completed the trial with 524 treatment visits. There were no significant differences between the two groups in back-specific function (ODI: mean difference −2.5, 95% CI −8.9 to 3.8). Pain in the back and/or leg showed small improvements at 3 months, while there were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. The total number of adverse events was 61 (12% of 524 treatment visits). All but one were minor and transient. The one severe adverse event was deemed to be unrelated to acupuncture. Conclusions The study was feasible. Acupuncture combined with usual care did not confer significant functional improvements over usual care alone.

Subjects: Thirty-four subjects with non-specific neck pain, aged over 18 years with an active myofascial trigger point in sternocleidomastoid, participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Methods: TrP-DN inside or (1.5 cm) outside of the active myofascial trigger point of sternocleidomastoid.

Conclusion: Acupuncture had no significant effect on the primary outcome of VAS score compared with control treatment; however, positive effects on secondary outcomes (THI and TSI score) were observed in acupuncture versus control groups. Due to the low quality and small sample size of the included trials, the level of evidence was insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. Further rigorous and high-quality studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to confirm the efficacy/effectiveness of acupuncture for tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "Objective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation and downstream transduction pathways are crucial for pain signalling. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common pain syndrome of unclear aetiology that is often drug-refractory but may benefit from treatment with electroacupuncture (EA). We examined the contributions of NMDAR signalling to FM pain and EA responses in a mouse model. Methods A model of FM was established by acid saline injection in 32 mice and subgroups (n=8 each) were treated with EA (2 Hz, 15 min daily for 4 days) or minimal acupuncture (MA). Expression of NMDAR subunits, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB) and their corresponding phospho-activated forms were measured by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results Acid saline injection induced significant mechanical hyperalgesia (paw withdrawal threshold 2.18±0.27 g, p&lt;0.05 vs controls), which was reversed by EA (4.23±0.33 g, p&lt;0.05 vs FM group) but not by MA (2.37±0.14 g, p&lt;0.05 vs EA group). Expression levels of phosphorylated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (pNR)1 and pNR2B were significantly increased in the dorsal root ganglion of FM model mice (132.21±14.4% and 116.69±3.22% of control values), whereas NR1 and NR2B levels were unchanged (97.31±3.79% and 97.07%±2.27%, respectively). Expression levels of pCaMKIIα and pCREB were also higher in the FM group, and these changes were reversed by EA but not by MA. Similar changes in expression were observed in spinal cord neurons. Conclusions Reduced NMDAR−CaMKIIα−pCREB signalling is implicated in the positive effects of EA in FM. NMDAR signalling components may represent promising therapeutic targets for FM treatment.",

Methods 58 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned into four groups that received single needle acupuncture (SNA, n=15) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS, n=13) as active controls, or enhanced acupuncture by way of three needle acupuncture (TNA, n=17) or SNA plus manual stimulation (SNA+MS, n=13). Treatment-associated sensations were evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Central responses were recorded before, during, and after treatment at LI4 on the left hand using resting state fMRI. Results TNA and SNA+MS induced DMN-insula activity and extensive DMN activity compared to SNA, despite comparable levels of de qi sensation. The TNA and SNA+MS groups exhibited a delayed and enhanced modulation of the DMN, which was not observed followed SNA and TENS. Furthermore, TNA increased precuneus activity and increased the DMN-related activity of the cuneus and left insula, while SNA+MS increased activity in the right insula. Conclusions The results showed that conventional methods to enhance the acupuncture dose induce different DMN modulatory effects. TNA induces the most extensive DMN modulation, compared with other methods. Conventional methods of enhancing the acupuncture dose could potentially be applied as a means of modulating brain activity.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) plays a significant facilitatory role in descending modulation in migraine pathophysiology, and that activation of 5-HT7R in the descending pathway is involved in migraine central sensitisation.To investigate the ability of electroacupuncture (EA) to ameliorate central sensitisation via modulation of 5-HT7R in the descending pain pathways using a rat model of migraine induced by repetitive dural electrical stimulation (DES).64 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal group; DES group (receiving dural electrical stimulation only); DES+GB20 group (DES model group treated with EA at GB20); and DES+Sham group (DES model group treated with EA at a non-traditional (sham) acupuncture point). The presence of cutaneous allodynia was determined by measuring facial and hind-paw withdrawal latencies to electronic von-Frey. The expression of 5-HT7R in the descending pathways (periaqueductal grey, raphe magnus nucleus, and trigeminal nucleus caudalis) was assessed using immunofluorescence and Western blotting.Facial and hind-paw withdrawal thresholds were significantly increased in the DES+GB20 group compared with the untreated DES group. The expression of 5-HT7R was significantly decreased in the DES+GB20 group compared with the DES group (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), P<0.05). No significant differences in behaviour or expression were found between the rats in the DES+Sham group and the untreated DES group (one-way ANOVA, P>0.05).EA at GB20 may ameliorate central sensitisation in migraine by inhibiting the activation of 5-HT7 receptors in the descending pain pathway in a rat model of migraine.",

Methods A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. EA at LI11 and ST36 was started at 24 h (MCAO + EA group) after ischemic stroke modeling. Untreated model (MCAO) and sham-operated (Sham) groups were included as controls. The neurological deficits of all groups were assessed using modified neurologic severity scores (mNSS) at 24 h and 14 days after MCAO. To further investigate the effect of EA on infarct volume and brain function, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to estimate the size of the brain lesions and neural activities of each group at 14 days after ischemic stroke. Results EA treatment of MCAO rats led to a significant reduction in the infarct volumes accompanied by functional recovery, reflected in improved mNSS outcomes and motor functional performances. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the left motor cortex and left cerebellum posterior lobe, right motor cortex, left striatum and bilateral sensory cortex were decreased in MCAO group but increased after EA treatment. Conclusion EA at LI11 and ST36 could enhance the functional connectivity between the left motor cortex and the motor function-related brain regions, including the motor cortex, sensory cortex and striatum, in rats.

    "abstract": "Objective: We aimed to explore the feasibility of evaluating the comparative effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) relative to manual acupuncture (MA) for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in Beijing from September 2017 to January 2018. A total of 60 participants with KOA were randomly allocated to either EA ( n = 30) or MA ( n = 30) groups. Participants in the EA group were treated with EA at six to seven local traditional acupuncture points or ah shi points, and two to three distal points. Participants in the MA group had the same schedule as the EA group except that the electrical apparatus featured a working power indicator without actual current output, constituting a sham EA procedure, in order to blind participants. Both groups received 24 sessions over 8 weeks. The primary outcome was response rate, defined as a change of ⩾50% from baseline in the total scores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) after 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included pain, stiffness, function, quality of life, and acupuncture-related adverse events (AEs) at 4 and 8 weeks. Results: Of 60 participants randomized, 53 (88%) completed the study. Response rates were 43% for the EA group and 30% for the MA group by the intention-to-treat analysis. Although significant differences were observed in WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function scores within both groups, between-group differences at 8 weeks did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio = 1.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.593–5.162)). Rates of AEs were low and similarly distributed between groups. Conclusion: Both EA and MA interventions in KOA were feasible and appeared safe. Whether or not EA may have a stronger impact on pain and function requires further evaluation through larger, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials.

    "abstract": "Background Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture exert significant, non-specific effects on treatment outcomes when compared to no-treatment controls. A recently developed framework (mechanisms in orthodox and complementary and alternative medicine—MOCAM) suggests that the non-specific effects of acupuncture originate from multiple domains (e.g. patient characteristics, acupuncturist skill/technique, the patient–acupuncturist relationship, and the acupuncture environment). However, it remains to be determined precisely how these domains influence the non-specific effects of treatment among patients receiving acupuncture and sham acupuncture in clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize existing qualitative evidence on how trial participants randomized to acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups experience non-specific effects, regardless of the types of medical condition investigated. Methods This systematic review included primary qualitative studies embedded in randomized controlled trials designed to investigate acupuncture or sham acupuncture interventions. Eligible studies published in English were derived from a search of five international databases. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Using a framework synthesis approach, the identified MOCAM framework was adapted based on the synthesis of the available qualitative evidence. Results A total of 20 studies of high methodological quality were included. Our proposed model indicated that the effects of acupuncture may be increased by maintaining a professional status, applying a holistic treatment approach, practicing empathy, and providing patients with an appropriate explanation of the theory behind acupuncture and sham acupuncture. From the patient’s perspective, the efficacy of treatment can be increased by following the lifestyle modification advice provided by acupuncturists, maintaining a positive attitude toward treatment efficacy, actively engaging with acupuncturists during consultation, and making behavioral changes based on experience gained during the trial. Conclusion The results of this study may provide a basis for improving and standardizing key components of non-specific effects in acupuncture treatment, and for improving the isolation of specific effects in future clinical trials involving acupuncture and sham acupuncture.",

Analysis of acupuncture treatments from clinical studies may provide us with a potential rule when selecting traditional acupuncture points (hereafter abbreviated as “points”) in treatment protocols for pain control. The aim of this study was to investigate which points were most commonly used to treat pain in randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Methods We searched acupuncture treatment regimens in RCTs included in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for pain management. We analysed information on point selection (more than 10 RCTs included) from seven eligible systematic reviews on pain control. The frequency of the points used was calculated and visualised using a human body template. Results The points most commonly used across diseases were SP6, ST36, LI4 and LR3. However, the most frequently used points varied across individual conditions. For example, the most frequently used points to treat migraine were GB20, LR3, GV20, Taiyang, LI4 and TE5, while the most frequently used points to manage dysmenorrhoea were SP6, CV4, SP8, LR3 and BL32. Both regional and distal points were used for pain management with acupuncture. Conclusions Our findings suggest that local and segmental/extra-segmental neuromodulation appear to be the most common phenomena for pain control in acupuncture research. Analysis of information on point selection using a data-driven approach may unveil the hidden patterns of traditional acupuncture point utilisation in clinical practice.",

A lack of insurance coverage for acupuncture could present a barrier for both patients and providers. The objective of this scoping review was to assess the existing literature on acupuncture insurance coverage in the United States and to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities. Methods: We utilized the Arksey and O’Malley framework to guide our scoping review methodology. We followed a pre-determined study protocol for the level-one abstract and level-two full text screenings. We synthesized information into subject-area domains and identified knowledge gaps. Results: We found a lack of published data on acupuncture coverage in 44 states, especially in the Midwest and the South. Where data were available, a large proportion of acupuncture users did not have insurance coverage. Consumer demand, state mandates, and efforts to reduce opioid use were motivations to cover acupuncture. Licensed acupuncturists were less likely to be reimbursed and were reimbursed at lower rates compared to physicians. Reported barriers encountered when implementing coverage included a lack of providers, challenges determining when to offer non-pharmacologic treatments, and a lack of evidence for clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: We found a lack of recent publications and data comparing regional coverage in the United States. A key challenge is that commercial insurance plan data are not in the public domain. Further research should assess insurance coverage implementation for acupuncture and measure the impact of policy changes on acupuncture utilization and rates of opioid overuse.",

Acupuncture, as a traditional physical therapy method, could affect various metabolic disorders such as obesity, hyperplasia, gout, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in clinical practice. Moreover, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to decrease body weight in rats with PCOS; however, the mechanism of weight loss and the relationship between adipose tissue and gut microbiota remain unclear.To explore the effect and mechanism of EA on white and brown adipose tissues and gut microbiota, and its follow-up effect on reproductive function, in a rat model of PCOS.Daily EA treatment was administered at ST29 and SP6 in a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced PCOS-like rat model (PCOS + EA group). Effects of EA on in vivo and in vitro adipose volume and weight, organ weight coefficients, body weight, hormonal profiles, and estrous cyclicity were measured, and compared with untreated PCOS model rats (PCOS group) and healthy rats (control group). Microbial DNA was extracted from the fecal samples to analyze group abundance and diversity.EA improved estrous cyclicity, decreased body weight, decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat content, and increased brown adipose tissue weight. EA also normalized serum DHT and progesterone levels and improved glucose tolerance. There were few significant differences in the composition or diversity of the gut microbiota between control, PCOS, and PCOS + EA groups, except for the relative abundances of Tenericutes at the phylum level and Prevotella_9 at the genus level, which were significantly different in the PCOS group before and after EA treatment. Both are important microflora, strongly related to body weight.EA regulated the metabolic disorders and improved reproductive function in this PCOS-like rat model by adjusting visceral fat and brown fat, as well as intestinal flora.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Pulmonary vascular remodeling is the main pathological feature of COPD. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key regulator of angiogenesis, mediates activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which regulates the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells and plays important roles in pulmonary angiogenesis and remodeling in COPD. Here, the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) with respect to regulation of microvascular remodeling induced by VEGF/PI3K/Akt was evaluated in a rat model of COPD.Rats were randomly assigned to blank, COPD model, EA and sham acupuncture (SA) groups. Rats in the EA group received EA at GV14, BL13 and BL23 three times per week, while those in the SA group, as a control, received shallow and minimal electrostimulation at sites 5-10 mm away from the traditional acupuncture point locations. After 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, the optimal treatment duration was determined according to the results of lung function, lung pathology and inflammatory factor levels. Then, microvessel density, protein levels and mRNA expression of selected VEGF/PI3K/Akt pathway intermediates were determined by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and mRNA qRT-PCR, respectively.EA improved lung function and lung tissue histopathology, with the best effect after 8 weeks of treatment, as noted by reduced density of lung microvessels and expression of angiogenesis-related factors (VEGF and endothelin (ET)-1). EA-treated COPD rats exhibited reduced VEGF, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), ET-1 mRNA and VEGF, VEGFR2, phosphorylated (p)-VEGFR2, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p-mTOR at the protein level in comparison with untreated and SA-treated COPD model rats.EA had beneficial effects on COPD in this animal model including reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling via mechanisms possibly related to the VEGF/PI3K/Akt pathway.",

We aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of manual acupuncture (MA) treatment of RA using adjuvant-induced arthritic (AIA) rats and to explore the underlying mechanisms.The anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions of MA at ST36 (Zusanli) in AIA rats were assessed using paw withdrawal latency and swelling, histological examination and cytokine detection by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The cell-cell communication (CCC) network was analyzed with a multiplex immunoassay of 24 immune factors expressed in the inflamed joints, and the macrophage and Treg populations and associated cytokines regulated by MA were investigated using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), ELISA and flow cytometry.MA markedly decreased heat hyperalgesia and paw swelling in AIA rats. MA-treated rats also exhibited decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β) coupled with increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1) in the ankle joints at protein and mRNA levels. CCC network analysis confirmed that macrophages are of critical importance and are potential therapeutic targets in RA. Repeated treatment with MA triggered a macrophage phenotypic switch in the paws, with fewer M1 macrophages. Prominent increases in the Treg cell population and TGF-β1 in the popliteal lymph nodes demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of MA. Furthermore, a selective TGF-β1-receptor inhibitor, SB431542, attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of MA and MA-induced suppression of the levels of M1-released cytokines.These findings provide novel evidence that the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of MA on RA act through phenotypic modulation involving the inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization and an increase in the Treg cell population, highlighting the potential therapeutic advantages of acupuncture in controlling pain and ameliorating inflammatory conditions.",

Methods: A randomized, double-blinded sham-controlled trial was conducted; 60 patients were randomized into an experimental (DN) or sham (sham DN) group. Baseline data including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected. SWE and pain pressure thresholds (PPTs) at the MTrP and a control point located 3 cm laterally were the main outcomes assessed before and 10 min after the interventions. Results: Patients receiving DN interventions experienced greater increases in the control point PPTs immediately after receiving the intervention compared with sham DN ( p &lt; 0.05), but no differences were found for the MTrP ( p &gt; 0.05). Post-intervention PPT improvements were found at both locations for both groups ( p &lt; 0.01).

The authors conclude that the cun measurement system does not provide accurate estimates for contemporary Australian adults with respect to hand and lower leg measurements nor, to a lesser extent, with respect to measurements of the forearm. Consequently, it is recommended that methods of point location that are less reliant on the cun measurements (such as the proportional method) should be used in preference to the cundependent directional method.",

Therefore, a randomised trial to compare the effectiveness of acupuncture with advice and exercises on the symptomatic treatment of OA of the hip was carried out. Thirty-two patients awaiting a total hip arthroplasty were randomly allocated to either the experimental group, (A), to have six sessions of acupuncture each lasting up to 25 minutes, or the control group, (B), to be given advice and exercises for their hip over a six week period. Group A consisted of three men and 13 women, and group B consisted of four men and eight women. The average age in group A was 66 years and in group B it was 68 years. Patients were assessed for pain and functional ability, using a modified version of the WOMAC questionnaire, pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment and at eight weeks post-treatment. The pre-treatment WOMAC scores in the two groups were similar (p=0.85). There was a significant improvement in group A (decrease in WOMAC score) immediately post-treatment (p=0.002) and this was maintained at the eight-week follow-up (p=0.03). There were no significant changes in group B. When the changes in WOMAC scores were compared between groups, a significantly greater improvement was found between pre-treatment and immediately post-treatment in group A, compared with group B (p=0.02). The changes between pre-treatment and the eight-week follow-up also showed a significant improvement in group A compared with group B (p=0.03). In conclusion, this trial supports the hypothesis that acupuncture is more effective than advice and exercises in the symptomatic treatment of OA of the hip.",

This was achieved by reporting on the physical sensations that are detected under the fingertips when the radial pulse is palpated, rather than attempting to translate these into the complex and typically ambiguously defined TCM pulse qualities. The study involved development of a standardised pulse taking procedure and development of concrete operational definitions for each of the characteristics of the pulse being measured. The inter-rater reliability of the pulse taking procedure and operational definitions was assessed by determining agreement levels between two independent pulse assessors for each characteristic. Inter-rater agreement averaged 80% between the two assessors in both the initial data collection (66 subjects) and in a replication collection (30 subjects) completed two months later. Demonstrating reliability of the procedure represents an essential first step for examining the validity of TCM pulse diagnosis assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, as an important and unique part of traditional Chinese medicine, has played a major role in the health care of the Chinese people, occupying a significant place in the history of traditional Chinese medicine. This can be seen from the following four points: 1. Acupuncture - One of the Earliest Healing Arts in China Many primary sources show that acupuncture, perhaps together with moxibustion, emerged as one of the earliest healing methods in the history of Chinese medicine. It has been arguably a foremost therapeutic method ever since its development. In the history of Western medicine certain legendary figures, in ancient Greece for example, have been cited as originators of the art of medicine. Similarly in ancient China, three legendary characters have been regarded as the founders of Chinese medicine. The earliest is Fu Xi, also called Bao Xi, a legendary tribe leader who was believed to have made many innovations, such as the production of nine kinds of needles. 1 The second is Shen Nong, the Divine Husbandry Man, who was said to have taught the art of husbandry, and discovered the curative virtues of herbs by tasting a hundred different varieties. 2 The third is Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor, who was said to have discussed medicine, including acupuncture, with his ministers and who, like Fu Xi, was credited with having made nine kinds of needles. 3 These legends reflect, to a certain extent, the historical facts of the early origins of Chinese medicine. We may think of the legendary figures as embodiments of ancient Chinese ancestors",

    "abstract": "Background Patients are attracted to acupuncture partly by its reputation for having low risks. The safety of acupuncture should be established by positive evidence. Methods Two prospective surveys were conducted among different groups of professionals in the UK, including doctors, physiotherapists and practitioners primarily trained in acupuncture. Participants monitored adverse events over a defined period of time, and reported minor and significant events on purpose designed forms. Results A total of 652 acupuncturists reported 6733 adverse reactions including tiredness in 66 229 patients, an adverse event rate of 10.2%. The most common events were tiredness (3%) bleeding or bruising (3%), aggravation of symptoms (2%) and pain at the needling site (1%). There were no serious adverse events. A total of 86 (0.1%) of the treatments was associated with an event that the practitioner judged to be significant though without persistent consequences for the patient's health. Conclusion The risks associated with acupuncture can be classified as negligible, and acupuncture is a very safe treatment in the hands of competent practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Auricular acupuncture is given as a treatment for drug dependence. Points are usually chosen on the assumption that the body is represented somatotopically in the ear, although there is no anatomical basis for this. In clinical trials, sham treatment is often given at points that are supposedly ‘incorrect’ for the condition, in the belief that they are inactive. The aim of this study was to explore whether there is any difference in the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture at ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ points. Methods Controlled trials of semi-permanent auricular acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation were systematically located, and the results combined in exploratory meta-analyses which took into account the study quality. Results Thirteen studies were included. Combining ten studies showed auricular acupuncture at ‘correct’ points to be more effective than control interventions, odds ratio 2.24 (95% CI 1.61, 3.10), a result which is confirmed in the four high validity studies. Other analyses showed inconsistent results between all studies and higher quality studies. Comparisons of three higher quality studies suggest that ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ point acupuncture is no different (odds ratio 1.22, CI 0.72, 2.07); and two studies showed that ‘incorrect’ point acupuncture may be more effective than other interventions (odds ratio 1.96, CI 1.00, 3.86). Conclusion Auricular acupuncture appears to be effective for smoking cessation, but the effect may not depend on point location. This calls into question the somatotopic model underlying auricular acupuncture and suggests a need to re-evaluate sham controlled studies which have used ‘incorrect’ points. Further experiments are necessary to confirm or refute these observational conclusions.",

    "abstract": "There are many differing opinions on what constitutes an optimal acupuncture dose for treating any particular patient with any particular condition, and only direct comparisons of different methods in a clinical trial will provide information on which reliable decisions can be made. This article reviews the recent research into acupuncture treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, to explore whether any aspects of treatment seem more likely to be associated with good outcome of treatment. Among four recent, high quality RCTs, one showed a much greater treatment response than the other three, and the possible factors are discussed. A recent systematic review included 13 RCTs, and this article discusses the possible explanations for differences in their outcomes. It is speculated that optimal results from acupuncture treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee may involve: climatic factors, particularly high temperature; high expectations of patients; minimum of four needles; electroacupuncture rather than manual acupuncture, and particularly, strong electrical stimulation to needles placed in muscle; and a course of at least 10 treatments. These factors offer some support to criteria for adequate acupuncture used in the recent review. In addition, ethnic and cultural factors may influence patients’ reporting of their symptoms, and different versions of an outcome measure are likely to differ in their sensitivity – both factors which may lead to apparent rather than real differences between studies. The many variables in a study are likely to be more tightly controlled in a single centre study than in multicentre studies.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, it has been thought that acupuncture might serve to wash out pain-generating metabolic end-products by improving blood circulation in muscles. We investigated the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) on muscle blood flow (MBF) of normal and denervated hindlimbs in rats.Sprague-Dawley rats (n=100) anaesthetised with urethane (1.2g/kg ip) were used. Manual acupuncture with sparrow pecking (SP) at different doses (1, 10 or 30 pecks) was given to the right ventral hindlimb muscles (tibial anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles) or the right dorsal hindlimb muscles (gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus muscles). MBF with or without MA was measured using the radiolabelled microsphere technique. The blood pressure was recorded through the right common carotid artery until MBF measurement started. Denervation of hindlimb was conducted by cutting the sciatic and femoral nerves.In normal rats, significantly increased MBF after MA were observed only in muscles which were penetrated by an acupuncture needle. The size of the increase depended on the number of times of pecking and seemed to be sustained at least until 60 minutes after MA. However, the increase was observed after both acute and chronic denervation. On the other hand, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) did not change significantly before, during or after MA.These results suggest that MA could increase muscle blood flow locally in a dose-dependent manner and that this increase may be caused by local vasodilators, as well as the axon reflex. A further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Point injection as a therapeutic technique is well documented, but its physiological effects have not been formally compared with traditional acupuncture. One aim of this study was to compare the effects of the two techniques at one acupuncture point, as a step towards understanding the mode of action of point injection and validating its clinical use. A second aim was to explore whether repeated point injection at the same site might provide a way of increasing the dose of stimulation, in the hope of identifying a dose response curve which could be an alternative strategy to placebo control in demonstrating the biological effects of acupuncture. Methods Sixty nine healthy subjects (age range 18–56 years, mean 29.9; 48 females) completed the study, which employed a counterbalanced experimental design with two stimulation sessions of LI4 approximately one week apart. One half of the participants received point injection first, and the other half received traditional acupuncture first. Baseline physiological data were recorded, then measurements were made before, during and after stimulation; each subject also reported needle sensation ( de qi). The measures were heart rate, derived pressure rate product and mean arterial pressure. Results Although stronger sensations of de qi were reported with point injection, no significant differences were found for mean heart rate (HR), pressure rate product (PRP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) before and after stimulation by the two techniques. No subject gender or age bias was encountered and previous exposure to acupuncture had no effect on outcome. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) made on data from a small subset (n=10) of this cohort also showed no significant differences in autonomic response. Conclusion Point injection and traditional acupuncture seem to provoke similar physiological responses, although the greater needle sensation seen with point injection might indicate it could have more powerful clinical effects. Further studies of repeated point injection are necessary to indicate whether this technique may provide a method of increased strength of point stimulation, as an alternative to traditional needling in acupuncture research.",

Needle sensation may be related to treatment outcome, although what constitutes adequate acupuncture needle sensation is not known. In this paper, we debate the possibility of using the self-report of the overall intensity of needle sensation as a predictor of analgesic outcome to acupuncture. We describe how our approach to establish criteria to determine adequacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation interventions in clinical trials has been used to inform our search for markers of adequacy of procedural technique for acupuncture. We describe previous research which has focused on developing tools to capture the nature of the descriptors used by patients when they self-report needle sensation and reveal that little attention has been given to its role in outcome. We demonstrate that needle sensation is a complex phenomenon with subjects using multiple descriptors to report their experience. We argue that the intensity of the overall experience of needle sensation may prove useful as a gross marker of the adequacy of acupuncture. We briefly describe our research which isolates individual components of needling technique, such as depth of needle penetration and bidirectional needle rotation, in order to assess their contribution to overall needle sensation intensity.",

Xerostomia is difficult to treat conventionally but there are reports that acupuncture can help. We conducted a feasibility study to examine the acceptability of a standardised group acupuncture technique and adherence to group sessions, together with acceptability of the objective and subjective measurements of xerostomia. Methods 12 males with established radiation induced xerostomia were treated in three groups of four. Each received eight weekly sessions of acupuncture using four bilateral acupuncture points (Salivary Gland 2; Modified Point Zero; Shen Men and one point in the distal radial aspect of each index finger (LI1)). Sialometry and quality of life assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment. A semi-structured interview was conducted a week after completing the intervention. Results Adherence to and acceptability of the treatment and assessments was 100%. There were objective increases in the amounts of saliva produced for 6/12 patients post intervention and the majority also reported subjective improvements. Mean quality of life scores for domains related to salivation and xerostomia also showed improvement. At baseline 92% (11/12) patients reported experiencing a dry mouth “quite a bit/very much” as compared to 42% (5/12) after the treatment. Qualitative data revealed that the patients enjoyed the sessions. Conclusion The pilot study shows that a standardised group technique is deliverable and effective. The tools for objective and subjective assessment are appropriate and acceptable. Further examination in a randomised trial is now warranted.",

Methods Patients receiving palliative care with estimated survival of at least 3 months were screened with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). Patients (n=20) with significant symptoms were randomised to receive weekly acupuncture or nurse-led supportive care for 4 weeks. ESAS scores were obtained before and after each treatment, and weekly for 6 weeks after treatment by telephone. Results 42 of 170 patients screened were eligible. 20 gave consent for recruitment. The compliance rate was 90% for acupuncture and 80% for nurse-led supportive care. Total symptom scores were reduced by an average of 22% after each acupuncture visit and by 14% after each supportive care visit. Compared with baseline, ESAS scores at the end of the follow-up period were reduced by 19% for the acupuncture arm and 26% for nurse-led supportive care. Conclusion Patients appear to benefit from incorporating acupuncture in the treatment of advanced incurable cancer. Acupuncture was well tolerated with no significant or unexpected side effects. Acupuncture had an immediate effect on all symptoms, whereas nurse-led supportive care had a larger impact 6 weeks after the final session. Both interventions appear helpful to this population and warrant further study.",

It concluded that use of acupuncture in addition to self-care can contribute to a clinically relevant reduction of hot flushes and increased health-related quality of life. This article reports on the TCM syndrome diagnoses and acupuncture points used and their relation to the treatment response, and on treatment reactions and adverse events. Methods The acupuncture group (n = 134) received 10 acupuncture treatment sessions and advice on self-care; the control group (n = 133) received advice on self-care only. The study acupuncturists met the current membership criteria of the Norwegian Acupuncture Society, and had at least 3 years’ experience of practising TCM acupuncture. They were free to diagnose and select acupuncture points for each participant, after initial discussion. Results Fifty per cent of the participants in the acupuncture group were diagnosed with Kidney Yin Xu as their primary TCM syndrome diagnosis. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the syndrome groups regarding the distribution of responders and non-responders, nor regarding the change in health-related quality of life scores. A core of common acupuncture points (SP6, HT6, KI7, KI6, CV4, LU7, LI4, and LR3) were used in all the syndromes, and in addition multiple idiosyncratic points. Core point selection and frequency of use did not differ between responders and non-responders. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion Factors other than the TCM syndrome diagnoses and the point selection may be of importance regarding the outcome of the treatment.",

Objective The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. Methods Male Wistar rats were fed HFD for 4 weeks and developed insulin resistance. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by clamp. The number of animals was seven, eight and seven in the control, HFD and HFD+EA groups, respectively. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle were measured by Western blotting analysis (n=7 in each group). EA stimulation was carried out 12 times over 4 weeks at an intensity of 1–3 mA and a frequency of 2/15 Hz in a conscious state without restraint. Results There was no significant difference in mean body weight and fasting blood glucose concentration between groups at the end of the experiment. The mean glucose infusion rate during the clamp was significantly lower in the HFD group than in controls (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle in the control and each group. Phosphorylated AMPKα (Thr 172 ) in skeletal muscle showed a significant increase immediately after the final EA stimulation when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Repeated application of EA is capable of improving diet-induced insulin resistance, probably through activation of AMPK signalling pathways in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that repeated application of EA may have beneficial effects on diet-induced insulin resistance.",

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, fully anonymised and analysed thematically.Group acupuncture was delivered with enthusiasm by nurses, was acceptable and popular with patients and recognised to be cost-efficient. Factors affecting acceptability were situational, interpersonal and intrapersonal. Situational factors included adequacy of the physical space used, flexibility of the appointment system and the changing and adaptable nature of the group. Interpersonal factors were mutual support, the exchange of information, the provision of mixed or single-sex sessions and the role of the acupuncture nurse. Intrapersonal factors that increased acceptability were less clear, but nurses expressed the view that the group setting was less suitable for patients with complex conditions or severe pain.Acceptability is very high and may be maximised by taking a number of factors into account: full information should be provided before treatment begins; flexibility should be maintained in the appointment system and different levels of contact between fellow patients should be fostered; sufficient space and staffing should be provided and single-sex groups used wherever possible.",

    "abstract": "Within the acupuncture literature there is debate on the safety of using specific acupuncture points during pregnancy. Termed ‘forbidden’ or contraindicated, they refer to acupuncture points that can be used to induce labour but may also include points with no known inducing or labour-enhancing effects. Recommendations range from avoiding these acupuncture points at any time in pregnancy to statements that despite the warnings in the literature, these points are not contraindicated during a normal pregnancy. This discussion paper examines the historical use of contraindicated points, the physiology of the pregnant body and the effect of these points during research trials. It is hoped that this will encourage further discussion and provide a background for practitioners to make informed choices about how they use these points in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Although the safety of acupuncture per se in pregnancy is reasonably well accepted, there remains debate regarding needling at points historically considered to be 'forbidden' during pregnancy. This article reviews the scientific literature on this topic.There is no objective evidence of harm following needling at forbidden points, summarised by the following four lines of evidence. (1) In 15 clinical trials (n=823 women receiving n=4549-7234 acupuncture treatments at one or more forbidden points) rates of preterm birth (PTB) and stillbirth following are equivalent to those in untreated control groups and consistent with background rates of these complications in the general population. (2) Observational studies, including a large cohort of 5885 pregnant women needled at forbidden points at all stage of pregnancy, demonstrate that rates of miscarriage, PTB, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM), and preterm contractions (preterm labour (PTL) or threatened PTL) are comparable with untreated controls and/or consistent with their anticipated incidence. (3) There is no reliable evidence that acupuncture/electroacupuncture (EA) can induce miscarriage/labour, even under otherwise favourable circumstances such as post-dates pregnancy or intrauterine fetal death. (4) Laboratory experiments using pregnant rats have demonstrated that repeated EA at forbidden points throughout gestation does not influence rates of post-implantation embryonic demise or cause miscarriage, fetal loss or resorption.These findings are reassuring and will help individualised risk:benefit assessment before treating pregnant women. Given the numerous evidence-based indications for obstetric acupuncture and lack of evidence of harm, risk:benefit assessments will often fall in favour of treatment.",

All subjects then received a (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) SPECT scan.All six subjects in the verum acupuncture at true acupuncture point group experienced de qi sensation; in contrast, all six subjects in the sham acupuncture at the sham point group responded with nothing other than non-sensation. Compared to the scan results from subjects who experienced non-sensation, SPECT scans from subjects with de qi sensation demonstrated significant activated points mainly located in brodmann areas 6, 8, 19, 21, 28, 33, 35, 37, 47, the parahippocampal gyrus, lentiform nucleus, claustrum and red nucleus; deactivated points were seen in brodmann areas 9 and 25.Verum acupuncture at true acupuncture points is more likely to elicit de qi sensation. De qi sensations mainly resulted in brain area activations, but not deactivations. These brain areas are related to the curative effect of Te5. The acupuncture needle sensations of de qi and sharp pain are associated with different patterns of activations and deactivations in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Although total knee replacement (TKR) is cost effective and successful in most cases, patient-reported outcome measures demonstrate 20% of people remain unsatisfied at 1 year after a technically successful procedure. Our group has previously shown that patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) awaiting surgery can achieve a short-term reduction in symptom severity when treated with acupuncture, and that a trend towards improved walking distance, as a measure of function, is achieved with preoperative supervised exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined acupuncture and physiotherapy on preoperative and postoperative pain and function. Methods A total of 56 patients awaiting TKR surgery were randomised to receive either combined physiotherapy and acupuncture or a standardised exercise and advice leaflet. Pain and function were measured primarily using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), with assessments at baseline prior to intervention, 6 and 12 weeks after intervention and at 3 months postoperatively. Results Due to the introduction of the 18-week waiting times target during this study, the required sample size was not achieved. There were no significant differences demonstrated between the control and treatment groups for OKS. Seven patients withdrew from surgery because of symptomatic improvement in their knees: six from the treatment group and one from the control group (OR 7.64, 95% CI 0.86 to 68.20). Conclusions This study demonstrated that the use of combined acupuncture and physiotherapy in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe knee OA preoperatively did not improve patient outcome postoperatively. As the study was underpowered, a larger trial is required to examine this result further.",

    "abstract": "Manual acupuncture (MA) is commonly used as a treatment for migraine in China. However, its specific clinical effects have been challenged on the basis that some of its effects may relate to psychological or 'placebo' mechanisms.To identify the effectiveness of verum MA compared with sham acupuncture for the treatment of migraine.Eight electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of verum versus sham MA on migraine. The quality of included trials was assessed using the 'risk of bias' tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Intervention. RevMan 5.2 software was used for data analysis.Ten trials with 997 participants were included. Most trials had high methodological quality and were at low risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed superior effects of verum MA over sham acupuncture on the total effective rate, reflected by a reduction in the 'not effective' rate (relative risk (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; p<0.0001, four trials) and a reduced recurrence rate (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.81; p=0.006, two trials), but no significant differences in headache intensity, frequency or duration, accompanying symptoms and use of medication. No severe adverse events related to acupuncture occurred during treatment with either verum or sham MA.Current clinical evidence suggests that verum acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in migraine, reflected by a higher total effective rate and decreased recurrence rate. Nevertheless, further large-scale RCTs with a rigorous design are required to confirm these findings in view of the relative paucity of eligible RCTs and small sample sizes of those included.",

    "abstract": "Background While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system. Methods We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only). HomeCageScan was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. Results Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour (p&lt;0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour (p&lt;0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups (p&lt;0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment (p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA and Model groups in behaviour or c-Fos immunoreactivity. Conclusions EA pretreatment ameliorates behavioural changes in a rat model of recurrent migraine, possibly via modulation of the brainstem descending pathways.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the primary sensory neurons of cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are involved in electroacupuncture (EA)-induced analgesia in a rat model of incisional neck pain.The pain model was established by making a longitudinal midline neck incision in 60 rats. Another 15 rats underwent sham surgery (normal group). Post-incision, 15 rats remained untreated (model group) and 45 rats underwent EA (frequency 2/100 Hz, intensity 1 mA) at bilateral LI18, LI4-PC6 or ST36-GB34 (n=15 each) for 30 min at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-surgery, followed by thermal pain threshold (PT) measurement. 30 min later, the rats were euthanased and cervical (C3-6) DRGs removed for measurement of immunoreactivity and mRNA expression of SP/CGRP and the GABAergic neuronal marker glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67).Thermal PT was significantly lower in the model group versus the normal group and increased in the LI18 and LI4-PC6 groups but not the ST36-GB34 group compared with the model group. Additionally, EA at LI18 and LI4-PC6 markedly suppressed neck incision-induced upregulation of mRNA/protein expression of SP/CGRP, and upregulated mRNA/protein expression of GAD67 in the DRGs of C3-6 segments.EA at LI18/LI4-PC6 increases PT in rats with incisional neck pain, which is likely related to downregulation of pronociceptive mediators SP/CGRP and upregulation of the inhibitory transmitter GABA in the primary sensory neurons of cervical DRGs.",

Methods Seventy healthy adult male albino Wistar rats weighing 250±50 g were divided into seven groups of 10 animals each. Groups I–III comprised healthy control rats which were untreated (I) or stimulated with laser acupuncture at 650 nm (II) and 980 nm (III), respectively. Groups IV–VII underwent induction of diabetes with a single intraperitoneal administration of STZ at 50 mg/kg. Animals with blood glucose levels of ≥200 mg/dL on the fifth day were used for the experiments and were left untreated (group IV), treated with glibenclamide (group V) or stimulated with laser acupuncture at 650 nm (group VI) and 980 nm (group VII), respectively. Laser acupuncture was applied at BL20 on alternate days for a total of 12 sessions over a 28-day period. Results After 28 days of treatment, STZ-induced diabetic rats stimulated with laser acupuncture at 650 and 980 nm had significantly lower glucose levels compared with untreated diabetic rats (242.0±65.0 and 129.8±33.2 vs 376.5±10.0 mg/dL, both p≤0.05).

Laser acupuncture treatment did not affect the blood count or biochemical profile and was not associated with any morphological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney or spleen. Conclusions Stimulation with laser acupuncture at 650 and 980 nm at BL20 in STZ-induced diabetic rats has antihyperglycaemic activity.

In an article on the hypothetical action of acupuncture in the treatment of tendinopathy in the December 2012 issue of the journal, Neal and Longbottom assert that tendinopathy and tendinalgia are debilitating conditions for which a gold standard treatment strategy does not exist.1 This is probably due to the fact that the pathophysiology of tendalgia is not well understood. However, Neal and Longbottom suggest that there is evidence—small in amount but high in quality—supporting the theory that acupuncture may be able to influence tendon healing by increasing blood flow via local vasodilation and increasing collagen proliferation, and that these effects are most likely the result of an increased release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from sensory nerve endings. Two pathways for the vasodilation of CGRP have been described: \n\n1. Nitric oxide (NO)-endothelium-independent pathways in which the binding of CGRP to the CGRP1 receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells induces an increase in intracellular cAMP and protein kinase A. This cascade results in opening …",

    "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) may have a role in the treatment of diarrhoea symptoms. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter and paracrine signalling molecule in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which initiates peristaltic, secretory, vasodilatory, vagal and nociceptive reflexes. In addition, according to the results of our previous report, EA stimulation mediates GI peristalsis by increasing expression of 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH).To investigate the effect of EA at acupuncture points ST25 and BL25 in a rat model of diarrhoea.A diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) model was induced by Folium Sennae in 24 rats, which remained untreated (n=6) or received EA at ST25 (n=6), BL25 (n=6) or the combination of ST25 and BL25 (n=6). A control group of healthy rats was also included (n=6). After treatment, changes in loose stool and small intestine transit rates, enterochromaffin (EC) cell number, expression of TPH, and faecal/colonic 5-HT contents were measured.Loose stool and small intestine transit rates, EC cell numbers, colonic TPH expression and faecal/colonic 5-HT content of IBS-D rats were significantly increased relative to controls (p<0.05) and all these parameters were improved by EA at ST25, BL25, or ST25 and BL25 in combination (all p<0.05 vs untreated IBS-D rats).EA at ST25 and/or BL25 had a positive effect on objective markers of diarrhoea in a IBS-D rat model and induced changes in EC cell number, colonic TPH and 5-HT contents. The effects of EA stimulation at ST25/BL25 on IBS-D rats may be mediated by excitation of sympathetic nerves.",

Emerging evidence supports the use of acupuncture as an effective pain management strategy for this condition, but its acceptability among cancer survivors is unknown. We evaluated breast cancer survivors’ preferences for acupuncture as compared with medication use and identified factors predictive of this preference. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among breast cancer survivors who were currently, or had been, taking an AI. The primary outcome was degree of preference for acupuncture as compared with medication for pain management. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) factors and health beliefs on treatment preference. Results Among 592 participants, 160 (27.0%) preferred acupuncture, 153 (25.8%) preferred medication and 279 (47.1%) had no clear preference. In a multivariate analysis that only included SES, higher education and white race were significantly associated with greater preference for acupuncture. When health beliefs were added, SES effects were attenuated, while greater expectation of acupuncture's effect, lower perceived barriers to its use, higher social norm (endorsement from family members and healthcare professionals) related to acupuncture and higher holistic health beliefs were associated with greater preference for acupuncture. Conclusion We found similar rates of preference for acupuncture versus medication among breast cancer survivors for pain management. Specific attitudes and beliefs predicted such preferences, highlighting the importance of a patient-centred approach to align patient beliefs and preferences with therapeutic options for more effective pain management.

Methods: In this study, we randomly divided 40 7.5-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) male mice into four groups: SAMP8, SAMP8+D, SAMP8+MA and SAMP8+D+MA. An additional 10 7.5-month-old SAMR1 male mice were included as a healthy control group (SAMR1). Mice in the SAMP8+D group were given donepezil at a dose of 0.65 µg/g/day; mice in the SAMP8+MA group underwent manual acupuncture at GV20, GV26 and Yintang for 20 min per day; mice in the SAMP8+D+MA received both donepezil and manual acupuncture; and mice in the SAMR1 and SAMP8 groups underwent restraint only to control for the effects of handling. After the 15-day treatment, the Morris water maze test, micro-PET(positron-emission tomography), H&amp;E (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, and immunohistochemistry were used to study the differences between donepezil (SAMP8+D), acupuncture (SAMP8+MA), and donepezil combined with acupuncture (SAMP8+D+MA) therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Results: We found that, compared with the untreated SAMP8 group, donepezil, manual acupuncture, and combined therapy with donepezil and manual acupuncture all improved spatial learning and memory ability, the level of glucose metabolism in the brain, and the content of Aβ amyloid in the cortex. Moreover, combined therapy outperformed treatment with donepezil or acupuncture individually in the SAMP8 mice. Conclusion: This study shows that the combination of manual acupuncture and donepezil in an Alzheimer’s disease animal model is superior to acupuncture and donezepil alone. However, randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to clarify the clinical efficacy of combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Randomised controlled trials of acupuncture performed using sham interventions to control for the placebo effect have mostly used two types of sham techniques: techniques with minimal insertion of acupuncture needles with no additional stimulation (shallow needling control) and techniques with sham acupuncture devices that do not penetrate the skin (sham device control). To achieve successful blinding, sham device controlled acupuncture trials also use the acupuncture base unit in the verum acupuncture group, but in the shallow needling control trials this is not necessary for the verum acupuncture treatment. Objective: In this study, we analysed the estimated comparative effectiveness of these two verum acupuncture modalities in studies of acupuncture for menopausal hot flashes that used two types of sham control treatments. Methods: We conducted a network meta-analysis that included randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for hot flashes. Electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and AMED, were searched through March 2017. Data were extracted using a predefined data extraction tool by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised controlled trials. A five-node network meta-analysis was conducted based on the frequentist framework. Results: Eight studies were included in this review. From the network meta-analysis, we found that verum acupuncture in the shallow needling controlled trials was more effective than verum acupuncture in the sham device controlled trials (SMD −7.27, 95% CI−9.11 to −5.43). Significant heterogeneity and inconsistency were not observed among the included studies or the comparisons. Conclusions: From this preliminary analysis, we found that different types of verum acupuncture may have different effect sizes with respect to the severity of menopausal hot flashes.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) can be caused by a variety of pathogenic factors. In China, acupuncture is widely used to treat SCI. We previously found that acupuncture can reduce apoptosis and promote repair after SCI. However, the antiapoptotic mechanisms by which acupuncture exerts its effects on SCI remain unclear. Our aim was to investigate the role of the PI3K/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 signalling pathways in acupuncture treatment of acute SCI. Eighty pure-bred New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into the following five groups (n=16 per group): control; model; elongated needle electroacupuncture (EA); EA+LY294002; and EA+PD98059. We established a spinal cord contusion model of SCI in all experimental groups except controls, in which only a laminectomy was performed. After SCI, three of the groups received EA once daily for 3 days. One hour before SCI, the two drug groups received LY294002 (Akt inhibitor; 10 μg, 20 μL) or PD98059 (ERK inhibitor; 3 μg, 20 μL) via intrathecal injection. At 48 h after SCI, animals were killed and spinal cord tissue samples were collected for transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assays, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays. EA significantly increased p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 expression, reduced cytochrome c and caspase-3 expression and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in the injured spinal cord segment. The opposite effects were seen after using Akt and ERK inhibitors. Acupuncture promotes the repair of SCI, possibly by activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signalling pathways and by inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",

Methods Eighty patients with chronic shoulder pain were randomly allocated to receive contralateral MA (n=38) for 4 weeks or to remain on a waiting list while receiving conventional orthopaedic therapy (n=42). Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were taken as the primary outcome measure and used for a priori power calculation. Secondary outcome measures for the assessment of shoulder mobility and quality of life included the Jobe test, the Constant-Murley (CM) score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, and the 36 item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis demonstrated significant pain relief with contralateral acupuncture, with mean differences in VAS scores compared to the waiting list group of −19.4 (−28.0 to −10.8) at 2 weeks, −40.4 (−49.0 to −31.8) at 4 weeks, −41.1 (−49.7 to −32.5) at 8 weeks, and −40.9 (−49.5 to −32.3) at 16 weeks.

Methods Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and four Chinese medical databases were searched from their inception to 1 June 2015. The dataset included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restrictions that compared acupuncture as an adjunct to medical treatment (effectiveness) or acupuncture versus medical treatment (comparative effectiveness) in stroke patients with hiccups. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the trials. Results Out of 436 potentially relevant studies, five met the inclusion criteria. When acupuncture was compared with other interventions (as sole or adjunctive treatment), meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in favour of cessation of hiccups within a specified time period (CHWST) following intervention when used as an adjunct (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.19, I 2 =0%), but not when used alone (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.47, I 2 =65%, ie, high heterogeneity). No safety information was reported in these studies. Conclusions Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from hiccups following stroke when used as an adjunct to medical treatment. However, due to the limited number of RCTs and poor methodology quality, we cannot reach a definitive conclusion, hence further large, rigorously designed trials are needed.",

Variations in plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma free fatty acid levels were studied at the midpoint and end of the experimental course. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), which are associated with glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is related to GLUT4 activation, were measured after EA treatment.We found that EA-metformin resulted in a better glucose-lowering effect, greater insulin sensitivity, lower plasma free fatty acid levels and higher levels of MAPK than metformin alone (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in expression of IRS-1 or PPAR-γ.The glucose-lowering effect and increased insulin sensitivity associated with EA-metformin administration is governed, at least in part, by its ability to stimulate the activation of GLUT4 via upregulation of MAPK expression.",

The study was conducted over 10 months in 2012-2013 at three ambulatory clinics. Two hundred and eighty-two children, age 1-11 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade ≤II, were included. To equalise expectancy effects, all parents were told that their child would receive acupuncture. However, children were randomly allocated to perioperative bilateral needling acupuncture at PC6, depth 7 mm, mean time 17 min (SD 5-45) during anaesthesia plus usual care, or to usual care only. The regional ethics committee approved this approach. Primary endpoints were nausea and vomiting 24 h postoperatively.This study did not demonstrate any effect of acupuncture (95% CI) compared with standard care. The overall vomiting in the acupuncture and usual-care groups was 44.2% and 47.9%, respectively. Nausea was experienced by 31.7% in the acupuncture group and by 32.6% in the usual-care group. The test power was acceptable for comparisons of vomiting.The findings suggest that when controlling for possible placebo effects standardised PC6 acupuncture needling during anaesthesia without further stimulation of PC6 is not effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in children after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. Future studies should investigate acupuncture treatment which balances adequate dose and technique and a feasible, child-friendly acupuncture treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01729052.",

    "abstract": "Objective Imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells is causally linked to the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that electroacupuncture (EA) confers therapeutic benefits in RA through activation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-dependent signalling and restoration of the Th17/Treg cell balance. Materials and Methods A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was induced in Sprague–Dawley rats by injection of bovine type II collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant on day 0 and day 7. Three days after the second injection, EA was given at acupuncture points GB39 and ST36 three times per week for 4 weeks. To block VIP signalling, [D-P-Cl-Phe(6)-Leu(17)]-VIP, a VIP receptor antagonist, was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before EA. Inflammatory and pathological responses in the joint were assessed. Synovial VIP receptor mRNA levels and Treg and Th17 cell frequencies in the spleen were determined. Results EA significantly reduced the severity of CIA, as evidenced by reduced paw volumes, arthritis scores and inflammation scores. EA significantly increased mRNA expression of the VIP receptor VPAC1 and led to an elevation in CD4 + FOXP3 + Treg cell frequency and a reduction in CD4 + IL17 + Th17 cell frequency. Pre-injection of a VIP receptor antagonist significantly reversed EA-induced expansion of Treg cells, but did not alter the frequencies of Th17 cells. Conclusions EA exerts anti-inflammatory effects in a collagen-induced rat model of arthritis. These effects appear to be mediated through activation of VIP signalling and re-establishment of the Th17/Treg cell balance.",

    "abstract": "Healthy term newborns commonly undergo painful procedures during routine follow-up visits. Non-pharmacological strategies have currently become more important than pharmacological analgesic agents in neonatal pain management. Acupuncture is a new non-pharmacological method for preventing pain in newborns.We aimed to investigate the effect of laser acupuncture (LA) at the Yintang point before heel lancing as a non-pharmacological intervention for procedural pain management in infants.Forty-two term newborns, who were undergoing heel lancing between postnatal days 3 to 8 as part of routine neonatal screening, were randomly assigned to the LA group or the oral sucrose group. In the LA group, 2 min before the heel lancing, 0.3 J of energy was applied to the Yintang point using a Laser PREMIO-30 unit for 30 s. In the sucrose group, each infant received 0.5 mL of 24% sucrose orally via syringe 2 min before the heel lancing. Each baby's behaviour was scored using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), assessed blinded to group.There were no significant differences between the LA and oral sucrose groups with respect to means for gestational week of age at birth, birth weight, actual weight, or Apgar score. Mean procedure time was significantly shorter in the LA group; however, mean crying time was longer and NIPS score was lower compared to the oral sucrose group.Our results indicate that 0.3 J of LA at the Yintang point before heel lancing is less effective than oral sucrose for reducing the discomfort of this procedure.KA14/09.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on osteoarthritis (OA) are well documented; however, the precise mechanisms of action have not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of EA on cartilage in an experimental animal model of OA induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and to examine for concomitant changes in the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the articular cartilage.Thirty-three-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following three groups (n=10 each): sham operated group (Control group), ACLT without treatment (ACLT group), and ACLT with EA treatment (ACLT+EA group). One week after ACLT, rats in the ACLT+EA group received 12 weeks of EA treatment. Histological analysis and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the effects of EA on cartilage morphology (quantified using modified Mankin scores) and expression of MAPKs (p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-Jun), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1), respectively.ACLT produced coarse cartilage surfaces, fibrous degeneration, and fissuring, all of which were suppressed by EA treatment. Although Mankin scores in the ACLT+EA group were significantly higher compared to the Control group (p<0.01), they were significantly lower than the (untreated) ACLT group (p<0.01). The increase in mRNA expression of p38, c-Jun, ERK1, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 observed in cartilage after ACLT was significantly inhibited by EA.EA appears to prevent the degeneration of articular cartilage, at least partly through regulation of MMP-13 and inhibition of MAPKs in the cartilage of rats with ACLT-induced OA.",

Aim To extend the trial follow-up to evaluate the effects of acupuncture at 24 months post-randomisation. Methods Patients in primary care with ongoing IBS were recruited to a two-arm pragmatic RCT of acupuncture for IBS. Participants were randomised to the offer of up to 10 weekly sessions of acupuncture plus usual care (n=116 patients) or to continue with usual care alone (n=117). The primary outcome was the self-reported IBS symptom severity score (IBS SSS) measured at 24 months post-randomisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat using an unstructured multivariate linear model incorporating all repeated measures. Results The overall response rate was 61%. The adjusted difference in mean IBS SSS at 24 months was −18.28 (95% CI −40.95 to 4.40) in favour of the acupuncture arm. Differences at earlier time points estimated from the multivariate model were: −27.27 (−47.69 to −6.86) at 3 months; −23.69 (−45.17 to −2.21) at 6 months; −24.09 (−45.59 to −2.59) at 9 months; and −23.06 (−44.52 to −1.59) at 12 months. Conclusions There were no statistically significant differences between the acupuncture and usual care groups in IBS SSS at 24 months post-randomisation, and the point estimate for the mean difference was approximately 80% of the size of the statistically significant results seen at 6, 9 and 12 months.

Six weeks of treatment were provided in the first three groups. Clinical outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression (HAMD-17) rating scale, Center for Epidemiologic Depression (CES-D) scale, WHO Quality of Life-Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire, and clinical remission rate.All 33 subjects were included in an intent-to-treat analysis.

An additional objective was to determine whether this method could induce the penetration of nerve growth factor (NGF) through the BBB. Methods A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was first established. We chose different stimulation time courses and observed the effects of EA treatment (100 Hz frequency; 2 mA intensity) at GV20 and GV26 on the BBB in rats recovering from MCAO 3 weeks after modelling. The rats were injected with 2% Evans blue (EB) saline. The brain water content was measured using a wet/dry weighing method. The degree of penetration of EB was detected using spectrophotometry and laser confocal microscopy. The rats were then injected with NGF, and the concentration of NGF in the brain tissues was measured using ELISA. Results The increase in the BBB permeability was most notable following the 8 min EA stimulation (P&lt;0.05), which may be advantageous for the targeted delivery of drugs (such as NGF) into the brain. Additionally, this effect did not appear to cause brain oedema (P&gt;0.05) in healthy or MCAO rats. Conclusions EA treatment for a certain stimulation time at GV20 and GV26 in MCAO rats can increase BBB permeability.",

This technique consists of the application of percutaneous electrical stimulation (PES) through an acupuncture needle-like electrode that is placed in close proximity to the nerve or motor point of the target muscle under ultrasound guidance. Objective: To examine the immediate effects of a stretching exercise, an eccentric exercise and US-guided PNM on the performance of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscle in young dancers. Methods: Randomised clinical trial. A total of 45 dancers were divided into three groups: Stretching group, Eccentric group and PNM group. The following performance parameters were assessed: range of motion (ROM) of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, balance test and unilateral heel raise fatigue test. Results: There were no differences between these groups in baseline measurements; at the end of the study, mean balance and endurance values were only significantly higher for the PNM group compared to the Stretching (p = 0.007 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and Eccentric groups (p = 0.003 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The effect sizes were large for the balance (d = 0.8) and endurance (d = 1.83) tests in the PNM group. Both the Stretching and Eccentric groups exhibited improvements in ROM compared to their baseline values (p = 0.009 and p = 0.004, respectively), whereas there was no significant temporal improvement noted for the PNM group. The effect sizes with respect to ROM values were moderate for stretching (d = 0.6) and eccentric (d = 0.7) exercises. Conclusion: An isolated PES intervention provides a greater immediate increase in balance and muscular strength than an active stretching and eccentric exercise of the FHL muscle in young ballet dancers.",

Methods: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 35 participants with KOA were randomized to receive self-administered acupressure (n = 17, two self-administered acupressure training sessions followed by self-practice for 6 weeks) or knee health education (n = 18, two health education sessions about KOA management followed by self-care for 6 weeks). Current pain intensity (primary outcome) was measured using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 (post-intervention). Secondary outcome measures included worst and least pain intensity, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), range of motion (ROM) of the knee joints and Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) scores for health-related quality of life. Results: Participants in both groups attended all training sessions. In the self-administered acupressure group, all subjects mastered the acupressure technique and passed a consistency check. Both groups showed a decreasing trend in current knee pain intensity measured using NRS post-intervention. A medium between-group effect size (0.40) was found, but between-group differences were not statistically significant. The other secondary outcome measures were also comparable between both groups post-intervention (all p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: A two-session self-administered acupressure training was acceptable to and feasible in participants with KOA. The data generated allowed for calculation of a sample size for a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to confirm whether self-acupressure is effective for pain management in KOA. Furthermore trials with adequate power and longer follow-up periods are warranted.",

Methods We randomly divided 29 subjects into two groups: Group A (receiving acupuncture at LR3 + KI3; 15 subjects) and group B (receiving acupuncture at LR3 and a sham location not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point; 14 subjects). Acupuncture was performed. Blood pressure (BP) changes were recorded and analyzed using SPSS 20.0 statistical software. We used a 3.0T MRI scanner and standard GE 8 channel head coil to collect whole brain fMRI data in both groups. Data analysis and processing was based on the R2009a MATLAB platform. REST 1.8 software was used to analyze the whole brain amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Results After acupuncture, a statistically significant reduction in BP at different time points was observed in group A. In group B, a statistically significant reduction was found only in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and was not sustained. Acupuncture at LR3 + KI3 specifically affected brain areas involved in BP regulation, as well as those involved in auditory sense, speech, vision, movement and sensation. Conclusion Acupuncture at LR3 + KI3 showed positive immediate and long-term effects on BP, particularly systolic blood pressure (SBP). After ALFF analysis, we concluded that LR3 + KI3 activates brain areas related to BP regulation. In addition, after acupuncture at LR3 + KI3, a highly targeted effect was observed in brain areas associated with BP. In addition, extracerebral areas involving vision, motion control, cognition and hearing were activated, which could potentially contribute to the mitigation of hypertensive complications in patients in an advanced stage of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Backgroud: Patients with multiple infarct dementia (MID) have subtle deficits that commonly go unnoticed, and are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Oxidative stress induced by ischaemic injury results in intracellular calcium accumulation and neuronal apoptosis, leading to cognitive impairment by triggering various cellular signal transduction pathways. Several studies have suggested that NF-κB in the presence of p53 has a pro-apoptotic function in various models, but the mechanism is unclear. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether acupuncture could protect cognitive function against cerebral multi-infarction (CMi) induced oxidative stress by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and its target gene p53. Methods: An animal model of CMi was established by injecting homologous blood emboli into the right internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats. After 2 weeks of acupuncture treatment, cognitive function was detected by novel object recognition. Electron spin resonance and Fluo-3 fuorescence imaging were used to test the generation of ROS and intracellular calcium accumulation, respectively. Expression of NF-κB and p53 was examined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Results: CMi induced spatial learning and memory impairment, overproduction of intracellular hydroxyl radicals, and elevations of Ca 2+ , which were ameliorated by verum acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture inhibited activation of NF-κB and its downstream target gene p53. Conclusion: These findings suggest that acupuncture could protect cognitive function against oxidative stress induced by CMi, which is partially associated with suppression of NF-κB-p53 activation.",

Objective: This study analysed the incidence of post-acupuncture pneumothorax requiring hospitalisation in a one-million-sample cohort derived from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods: We tracked this cohort between 1997 and 2012 and recorded all medical insurance information. Subjects were categorised according to gender, insurance amount, comorbidities, residential area, and number of acupuncture treatments. Pneumothorax risk was evaluated according to different demographic and medical variables by logistic regression analysis using an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Overall, 411 734 patients undergoing 5 407 378 acupuncture treatments were identified with data collected over the first 7 days after acupuncture. The incidence rates of iatrogenic pneumothorax were 0.87 per 1 000 000 acupuncture treatments overall and 1.75 per 1 000 000 acupuncture treatments in “at-risk” anatomical areas. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that a history of thoracic surgery (aOR 7.85, 95% CI 3.49 to 9.25), chronic bronchitis (aOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.87), emphysema (aOR 4.87, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.96), pneumonia (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.72), tuberculosis (aOR 3.65, 95% CI 1.39 to 9.56), and lung cancer (aOR 3.85, 95% CI 1.53 to 9.73) may increase the post-acupuncture risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Men had a higher risk of pneumothorax than women (aOR 3.41, 95% CI 1.36 to 8.57). The number of treatments was not associated with risk of pneumothorax. Conclusions: Patients with a history of lung disease including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, lung cancer and pneumonia, and a history of thoracic surgery, might have an increased post-acupuncture risk of pneumothorax. This information may possibly help physicians avoid post-acupuncture pneumothorax.",

    "abstract": "Background: There is evidence supporting electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but its characteristics have not been well investigated. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and characteristics of EA in MDD. Methods: 60 subjects were enrolled—35 in the EA group and 25 in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group based on their preferences—in an 8-week non-randomised controlled clinical trial. The 24-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-24) and clinical global impression (CGI) were adopted for clinical assessment. The Columbia suicide severity rating scale and adverse event form were used to measure safety and tolerability. The characteristics of EA and SSRIs were compared by analysing seven factors of the HAMD-24. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of HAMD-24 response rate after intervention (P&gt;0.05). Patients treated with EA demonstrated a significant reduction in CGI scores (P&lt;0.05) with fewer adverse events compared with SSRIs (P&lt;0.01). Although HAMD-24 factor analysis showed both EA and SSRIs could improve factor scores in cognitive impairment, diurnal variation, retardation, sleep disturbance, anxiety/somatisation and feelings of despair, EA showed greater improvement in anxiety/somatisation and feelings of despair than SSRIs (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: There was no significant difference between EA and SSRIs in the treatment of MDD with respect to our primary outcome. However, as a potential therapy for MDD, EA appeared to result in greater symptom improvement than SSRI treatment with respect to anxiety/somatisation and feelings of despair. The results of this secondary analysis should be interpreted cautiously given the inherent issues of multiple testing.",

    "abstract": "Whether electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at different frequencies has a similar effect on spared nerve injury (SNI) as other neuropathic pain models, and how EA at different frequencies causes distinct analgesic effects on neuropathic pain is still not clear.Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham SNI, SNI, 2 Hz, 100 Hz and sham EA groups. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were measured. EA was performed once a day on days 1 to 14 after SNI. The expressions of transient receptor potential cation subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and peripheral purinergic P2X receptor 3 (P2X3) were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. TRPV1 siRNA and P2X3 siRNA were administered by intrathecal injection. TRPV1 or P2X3 agonists were combined with EA.There were significant decreases in PWT, but no changes in PWL in the 14 days after SNI. EA using 2- or 100-Hz stimulation similarly increased PWT at every time point. The cytosol protein expression of P2X3 in the L4-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) increased, but the expression of TRPV1 decreased in the SNI model. Both these effects were ameliorated by EA, with 2-Hz stimulation having a stronger effect than 100-Hz stimulation. Blocking either TRPV1 or P2X3 specific siRNAs attenuated the decreased PWT induced by SNI. Administration of either a TRPV1 or P2X3 agonist inhibited EA analgesia.2- and 100-Hz EA similarly induced analgesic effects in SNI. This effect was related to up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively, of cytosol protein expression of P2X3 and TRPV1 in L4-L6 DRG, with 2 Hz having a better effect than 100 Hz.",

Its underlying neurobiological mechanisms have been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction and stress hormones. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a primary stress hormone, expressed in the hypothalamus and amygdala. Electroacupuncture (EA) can improve mood disorders, but its mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of EA on PTSD and explore the related mechanisms.We used single prolonged stress (SPS) mice to establish a PTSD model, and EA was performed after SPS or 7 days later for a week. Then we observed their fear and anxiety-like behavior through cue-induced fear condition tests, open field test and the elevated zero maze. CRH and CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) protein levels in the amygdala were measured in SPS mice after EA intervention.We found that EA at ST36 and GV20 improved fear and anxiety behavior in SPS mice. The amygdala CRH and CRHR1 protein levels increased in the SPS mice, and this effect was reversed by the EA intervention. CRHR1 inhibition by the CRHR1 antagonist NBI 27914 alleviated anxiety behavior in SPS mice.CRH/CRHR1 signaling in the amygdala may contribute to the anxiolytic effect of EA in SPS mice.",

    "abstract": "Background: To date, there has been little focus on research into acupuncture for insomnia after ischemic stroke. Insomnia is one of the most common sequelae after ischemic stroke, and it is the most unrecognized modifiable risk factor. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia after ischemic stroke. Methods: In this assessor-participant blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 144 ischemic stroke patients with insomnia meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition, DSM-5) criteria were assigned to verum or sham acupuncture treatment (n = 72 per group) for three sessions per week over 4 weeks. The outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), stroke-specific quality of life (SSQoL), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Multiple objective sleep variables were recorded using actigraphy. Assessment was conducted at baseline, and thereafter once biweekly for the 4-week treatment and at 4 weeks of follow-up. Results: The verum acupuncture group had significantly greater improvements than the sham acupuncture group in sleep quality from 2 weeks into treatment throughout the follow-up, indicated by ISI scores and actigraphic variable SE (sleep efficiency). This greater improvement was also observed in the PSQI after 4 weeks of treatment throughout follow-up, as well as actigraphic variable TST (total sleep time), SSQoL and HADS scores at the end of treatment, and SSQoL and depression scores at follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups in the actigraphic variable SA (sleep awakenings). Adverse events were mild in severity, and their incidence was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Acupuncture appears to be efficacious, in terms of improving insomnia, related quality of life, and affective symptoms, for patients with ischemic stroke.

    "abstract": "Background: Scalp acupuncture has been found to be effective at improving motor function after ischemic stroke, but few studies examining its central mechanisms of action have been carried out. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of scalp acupuncture on motor dysfunction and changes in spontaneous brain activity in patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: This was an evaluator- and analyst-blinded, multi-center randomized controlled trial. A total of 108 convalescent-stage ischemic stroke patients with motor dysfunction were allocated to receive either scalp acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (SR group) or rehabilitation treatment alone (RE group). Patients in both groups received treatment 5 times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). Secondary outcome measures included the modified Barthel index (mBI), modified Rankin scale (mRS) and values of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) acquired using a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technique. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in motor function, daily life ability and degree of disability, as measured by FMA, mRS and mBI ( p &lt; 0.05), and the SR group showed a significantly greater improvement ( p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the RE group, the areas where the fALFF values increased in the SR group were located in the cerebellum, praecuneus, precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and parietal lobe. The improvement in FMA scores had the strongest correlation with the baseline fALFF values of the ipsilateral precentral gyrus. Conclusion: Scalp acupuncture improved motor function in convalescent-period ischemic stroke patients, and effects were correlated with regulation of motor-relevant brain regions. The fALFF value of the ipsilateral precentral and postcentral gyri could be potential clinical indices for prognostication of motor dysfunction.

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a type of pathological aging, which seriously interferes with the fertility of affected women. Electroacupuncture (EA) may have a beneficial effect; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of EA on ovarian function in ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs) in a cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced mouse model of POF.Mice were divided into three groups: wild type (WT) group, CTX group and CTX + EA group. EA was administered under isoflurane anesthesia at CV4, ST36 and SP6 for 30 min every 2 days, 2-3 times per week for a total of 4 weeks. Effects of EA on ovarian weight and level of estrogen were examined. The mRNA and protein expression levels of cell cycle-associated proteins were detected and mRNA modifications were analyzed.EA significantly increased ovarian weight and reduced the proportion of atretic follicles in mice with CTX-induced POF (p < 0.05). EA increased the level of estrogen in the peripheral blood of mice and inhibited the modification of total mRNA N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C). A significant increase in the expression of P16 and N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) and a significant decrease in the expression of Cyclin D (CCND1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) were observed in the OGCs of POF mice (p<0.05). After EA, P16 and NAT10 expression was decreased, and CCND1 and CDK6 expression was increased. Finally, EA reduced the ac4C modification of P16 mRNA-specific sites in the OGCs of POF mice.This study demonstrated that EA promoted the repair of the ovarian microenvironment by inhibiting the ac4C modification of P16 mRNA to decrease its stability and expression intensity, and by altering the activity of the P16/CDK6/CCND1 axis in OGCs.",

It has been established that acupuncture has a clinical effects in the treatment of insomnia; however, research on the underlying neural circuits involved in these effects is limited.The modified multiple platform method (MMPM) was used to establish a rat model of chronic sleep deprivation (CSD). Forty rats were randomly divided into a control (Con) group, (untreated) CSD group, electroacupuncture-treated CSD group (CSD + EA) and estazolam-treated CSD group (CSD + Estazolam group) with n = 10 per group. In the CSD + EA group, EA was delivered at Yintang and unilateral HT7 (left and right treated every other day) with continuous waves (2 Hz frequency) for 30 min/day over 7 consecutive days. In the CSD + Estazolam groups, estazolam was administered by oral gavage (0.1 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. The open field test (OFT) was used to observe behavioral changes. Immunofluorescence assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to observe the effects of EA on the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine (DA) pathway. We also assessed the effects of EA on the expression of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in the NAc, which are the downstream targets of the VTA-NAc DA pathway.After CSD was established by MMPM, rats exhibited increased autonomous activity and increased excitability of the VTA-NAc DA pathway, with increased VTA and NAc DA content, increased D1R expression and decreased D2R expression in the NAc. EA appeared to reduce the autonomous ability of CSD rats, leading to lower DA content in the VTA and NAc, reduced expression of D1R in the NAc and increased expression of D2R. Most importantly, EA produced effects similar to estazolam with respect to the general condition of rats with CSD and regulation of the VTA-NAc DA pathway.The therapeutic effect of EA in chronic insomnia may be mediated by reduced excitability of the VTA-NAc DA pathway, with lower DA content in the VTA and NAc, downregulated expression of D1R in the NAc and increased expression of D2R.",

The present study was designed to investigate the hypnotic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of the cymba concha to stimulate the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN).Mice were intraperitoneally injected with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg·d) for 2 days to induce insomnia and subsequently received EA or manual acupuncture (MA) of the cymba concha for 30 min once daily for 5 consecutive days, or no treatment. The phenobarbital-induced sleep test was used to analyze the hypnotic effects and the open field test was used to analyze the locomotor activities and anxiolytic effects of EA/MA of the cymba concha. In addition, the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) in the hypothalamus and peripheral blood were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).PCPA injection significantly decreased sleep duration, increased sleep latency and induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. In PCPA-insulted mice, EA of the cymba concha improved the sleep disturbance by significantly prolonging sleep duration, while no change in sleep latency was observed. Moreover, EA of the cymba concha improved PCPA-induced anxiety-like behaviors without decreasing locomotor activities in the open field test. EA of the cymba concha increased the level of GABA in the hypothalamus and peripheral blood, while Glu concentrations remained unchanged.These findings indicate that EA of the region innervated by the ABVN upregulates GABA levels in the hypothalamus and ameliorates the symptoms of insomnia and anxiety, suggesting that EA of the cymba concha might have potential value as an intervention for insomnia.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to examine the effects of electroacupuncture with direct current (DC) on peripheral nerve regeneration. The left sciatic nerve of 55 7-month-old rats was crushed at the thigh. They were ramdomly allocated to four groups: distal cathode DC group (n = 15), distal anode DC group (n = 14), sham operated group (n = 13), and control group (n = 13). In the distal cathode DC group, a cathode electrode was connected to an insulated acupuncture needle inserted at 1 cm distal to the injured site, while an anode electrode was connected to a needle inserted at 1 cm proximal to the lesion. In the distal anode DC group, the anode and the cathode electrode were connected to the needle at 1 cm distal and proximal to the lesion respectively. In the sham operated group, no electrical stimulation was given to the insulated needle inserted at the same site, and in the control group, no treatment was given. Regeneration of the sciatic nerve was evaluated by the number of evoked EMGs recorded at 12 sites in the plantar region, by their latency, and by the weight ratio of the tibialis anterior at four weeks after the crush injury. Regeneration of the peripheral nerve was faster and more accelerated in the distal cathode DC group than in the other groups, while in the distal anode DC group the regeneration was delayed. This result suggested electroacupuncture with cathode distal orientation might be a useful treatment having the advantage of enabling deeper insertion with minimal tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "In recent reviews regarding the efficacy of acupuncture in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) it has been concluded that acupuncture has no specific effect since the control procedure (superficial needling and/or needling away from ‘specific’ points) had similar effects. These conclusions may be questioned since superficial needling and/or needling away from specific trigger points is not inert. Also, manual acupuncture or mild electroacupuncture (EA) may not be sufficient to activate the endogenous pain inhibiting system. Patients with FMS suffer from allodynia, fatigue and muscle ache, which is partly explained by peripheral and central sensitisation. Sensitisation results in augmented and altered stimulus responses whereby light stimulation of the skin has as strong an effect as regular needling on the pain inhibitory system in FMS. Central sensitisation in FMS is also associated with expanded receptive fields of central neurons resulting in a larger topographic distribution of the pain. This would suggest that control procedures using needling away from the ‘specific site’ might have as strong an effect as needling within the most painful area. Also, repeated nociceptive input from muscles (as obtained by de qi) results in expansion of receptive fields which in turn may result in activation of descending pain inhibition outside the stimulated myotome. Sensitisation to pain, such as in FMS, may also be related to abnormalities in descending efferent pathways. As there is likely to be an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory systems in FMS, stronger stimulation may therefore be needed to activate the descending pain inhibitory system. In studies using mild manual acupuncture or weak EA stimulation optimal pain inhibition may therefore not have been obtained. When conducting studies on acupuncture, the clinical condition or syndrome needs to be taken into account and the control procedure designed accordingly.",

We aimed to study the effect of electroacupuncture on pain and nausea and the requirement for postoperative analgesia via patient-controlled analgesia. Method 107 patients who were undergoing abdominal hysterectomy or laparascopic cholecystectomy were randomised to receive either electroacupuncture (n = 56) or no additional treatment (n = 46) during the operative period. We measured the use of patient-controlled analgesia and time in recovery as well as pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and sedation. 102 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients were female: the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group included 10 males. Adhesive dressings were placed over all acupuncture points in both groups, to ensure blinding of patients and assessors during the recovery period. Results The electroacupuncture group had a longer duration of operation but the difference was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the groups for the requirement for patient-controlled analgesia or total time in recovery. Pain scores were marginally lower in the acupuncture group, but not significantly, and there were no differences between the groups in nausea or sedation scores. Conclusion Electroacupuncture at 10 Hz given under general anaesthetic has no effect on postoperative nausea or analgesic requirement. Future studies should investigate acupuncture given before or after surgery.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The validity of a new sham acupuncture technique was tested on acupuncture naïve healthy subjects. Methods The procedure was tested in accupoints LI4 and ST6 in a randomised, single blind and crossover study. The participants were blind to which technique they received. 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, aged between 20 and 62 years, mean age 34 years) were recruited at the Universidad de la República, Uruguay. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) real acupuncture or (2) sham acupuncture. After 30 min, the patients were ‘needled’ again in a crossover design. Main outcome measures A yes/no questionnaire was used to assess the credibility and characteristics of the procedure. Results For the credibility question (do you think you received real acupuncture?) no statistically significant group differences were evident before or after the crossover. Subjects who answered yes to this question ranged from 14/16 (87.5%) before crossover to 10/16 (62.5%) after crossover for the sham and 12/16 (75%) before crossover to 15/16 (93.8%) after crossover for the real acupuncture. The question that showed a significant difference (only after crossover) was the question, “did you feel the needle penetrating the skin?”; after crossover 12/16 (75%) subjects in the real acupuncture group said yes and 2/16 (12%) subjects in the sham group said yes to this question (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions These data suggests that this method is credible and constitutes a simple and inexpensive technique for use as a control in clinical research in acupuncture naïve subjects.",

Muscular paralysis was evaluated weekly with manual muscle testing, the active range of motion of joints related to the muscular paralysis and, when necessary, needle electromyography. Adverse events were also recorded during the course of the treatment.Complete functional recovery was observed in the two cases with neurapraxia and two with axonotmesis, while one axonotmesis case achieved improvement and the other showed reinnervation potential without functional recovery. No improvement was observed in the neurotmesis case. Pigmentation of the skin where the anode needle was inserted occurred in three cases. Although there was no definite causal link, one case showed excessive formation and resorption of bone in the area close to the cathode needle site.Accelerated nerve regeneration caused by DCEA may contribute to recovery. The skin pigmentation and callus formation suggest that the shape of the anode electrode, current intensity and other factors should be examined to establish a safer treatment method.",

This study aims to investigate whether electroacupuncture can modify the dose of midazolam monitored by the bispectral index (BIS) in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation.Orotracheally intubated patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned into three groups (groups A, B and C). All patients were given an intravenous infusion of midazolam. Patients in group A received no additional treatment. Patients in group B were given acupuncture without electrical stimulation at acupuncture points GV24 and EX-HN3 (Yintang) for 6 h simultaneously, and patients in group C were given electroacupuncture to the same points as in group B.Maintaining the BIS between 60 and 80, the hourly mean one dose of midazolam within the first 6 h after sedation in group C was 0.05 (±0.02 mg/kg per hour), which was significantly lower than both group A (0.08 ± 0.03 mg/kg per hour, p<0.001) and group B (0.07 ± 0.01 mg/kg per hour, p<0.021). The doses in groups A and B showed no significant difference. Between-group comparison analysis of hepatic and renal function and severe adverse reactions all showed no significant difference between the three groups.Electroacupuncture appears to reduce markedly the dose of sedative drug required in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation monitored by BIS, without any obvious severe adverse action, and larger studies to confirm the effect are justified.",

MYMOP scores showed clinically significant improvements at 1 month for pain (4.2 (SD 1.2) to 2.9 (SD 1.4)), stiffness (4.1 (SD 1.3) to 2.9 (SD 1.3)) and function (4.5 (SD 1.1) to 3.3 (SD 1.2)) which continued up to 2 years. Well-being scores did not change.This is the first evaluation of nurse-led group (multibed) acupuncture clinics for patients with knee osteoarthritis to include a 2 year follow-up. It shows the practicability of offering a low-cost acupuncture service as an alternative to knee surgery and the service's success in providing long-term symptom relief in about a third of patients.

In the United States, acupuncture is a commonly employed TCM method for treating a variety of chronic illnesses. Three systematic reviews have been reported recently, reaching differing conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM). Among the FM acupuncture studies considered in these reviews, none used TCM diagnosis as an inclusion/exclusion criterion or adjusted treatment based on TCM diagnosis. Overlooking TCM diagnosis may be a reason for such disparate results.To obtain TCM diagnoses in a sample of women meeting 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM who were recruited for a yoga study and to investigate whether there is significant variability.Two TCM practitioners conducted baseline TCM diagnostic examinations on 56 women with FM. A consensus diagnosis was reached based on standardised history, palpation and examination. Canonical discriminate analysis identified two baseline items which predicted TCM diagnosis.School of Nursing, Oregon Health & Science University.Women, ages 23-75, with FM recruited to a yoga intervention study.Three primary TCM diagnoses were found in the population: Qi and Blood Deficiency (46.4%, CI 33.0% to 60.36%), Qi and Blood Stagnation (26.8%, CI 15.8% to 40.3%), and Liver Qi Stagnation (19.6%, CI 10.2% to 32.4%).It is likely that previous studies of FM were treating a heterogeneous study population where variable results might be expected.

Methods Eighty-two students were randomised into an EA treatment group (n=30), a sham TENS group (n=18) and an untreated control group (n=34). EA was applied at a continuous frequency of 2 Hz to the limbs, face, ears and scalp for 20 min once a week, over 6–8 weeks. Sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was performed on similar sites for the same number of times in each session and for the same length of time. Outcome measurements included a comparison of the indices obtained by different self-applied questionnaires before and after treatment. The surveys used were the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory—Student Survey (MBI-SS), in addition to the Quality of Life Questionnaire—abbreviated version (WHOQOL-bref).

Objective To determine the electroacupuncture (EA) protocol to be used in a future clinical trial examining the effect of acupuncture on metabolic parameters related to obesity and to examine whether a single EA treatment can change fasting blood glucose in obese subjects. Methods 16 obese women aged 30–52 years with body mass index &gt;30 kg/m 2 were assigned consecutively into three groups and their fasting blood glucose was measured before and after administering a single session, lasting 30 min, of one of three EA treatment protocols.

The role of NO was investigated by administering N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 20 mM), an NO synthase inhibitor or Ringer's solution (control site), via intradermal microdialysis (protocol 1; n=7). The role of axon reflex vasodilation by local sensory neurones was investigated by comparing vasodilation at sites treated with 'eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics' (EMLA) cream (2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine) with untreated sites (control site) (protocol 2; n=10). After 5 min of baseline recording, acupuncture was applied to PC4 and a control site in proximity to PC4 for 10 min and scanning was performed for 60 min after acupuncture stimulation. Skin blood flow (SkBF) was evaluated by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated from the ratio of SkBF to mean arterial blood pressure.In the first protocol, sites administered L-NAME showed significant reductions in CVC responses following acupuncture stimulation compared to control sites (administered Ringer's solution) (p<0.05). In the second protocol, changes in CVC responses after acupuncture stimulation did not differ significantly between treated sites with EMLA cream and untreated sites (p>0.05).These data suggest that cutaneous vasodilation in response to acupuncture stimulation may not occur through an axon reflex as previously reported. Rather, NO mechanisms appear to contribute to the vasodilator response.",

Methods This work was a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of patients who received at least one session of acupuncture for pain management from March 2010 to February 2012 in the Korean medical hospital of Pusan National University. Demographic characteristics and data on patient conditions, treatment interventions received and costs associated with acupuncture treatments were analysed. Results We identified a total of 2167 patients, including 2105 outpatients and 237 inpatients. The mean age (SD) of the patients was 52.0 (15.3) years, and approximately two-thirds of the patients were women (64.0%). The average number of acupuncture treatment sessions was 8.0 (6.6 for outpatients and 14.5 for inpatients). The most treated conditions were low back pain (30.5%), neck pain (23.9%) and shoulder pain (17.5%). Interventions included needle acupuncture with manual (52.6%) or electrical (47.4%) stimulation, herbal medicine (44.2%), cupping (21.2%) and moxibustion (3.5%). Over one-third of outpatients (33.5%) received at least six sessions of acupuncture. The median total cost of each outpatient and inpatient care per person was 169 604 and 1 001 707 Korean Won (approximately £98 and £577), respectively. Conclusions Acupuncture was primarily used for the treatment of low back, neck and shoulder pain with a wide range of related interventions at an academic medical centre for traditional Korean medicine. These data reflect real clinical practice and should inform the design of future prospective clinical research of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "We have observed a 'heat-sensitisation' phenomenon in a large proportion of patients receiving suspended moxibustion treatment. Patients become thermally sensitised to moxibustion stimulation at certain locations on the body, indicated by sensations of strong warmth or heat penetrating into the body (heat penetration), warmth spreading around the stimulation site (heat expansion), warmth conducting in certain directions and reaching some body regions or even internal organs remote from stimulation sites (heat transmission), or other non-thermal sensations such as aching, heaviness, pressure etc. These heat-sensitised locations are not fixed, but may, during the progression of disease, dynamically change within a certain range centred on acupuncture points. Each condition seems to have its specific set of such sensitised acupuncture points and such phenomena are not commonly observed in other body regions or in healthy subjects. A number of clinical trials have shown that the appearance of heat sensitisation is correlated with better therapeutic effects in various diseases, indicating the clinical significance of such responses. Further investigation is required to elucidate the epidemiological characteristics and biological mechanisms of the heat sensitisation in suspended moxibustion.",

    "abstract": "Background Human leptin is a peptide hormone that is released from white adipocytes. The absence of leptin or its receptor leads to uncontrolled food intake, leading to obesity. In the present work, the effects of auricular acupressure combined with low-calorie diet on the leptin hormone level were investigated. Methods Volunteers (n=86) with body mass indices (BMI) between 25 and 45 kg/m 2 were randomised into a case (n=43) or a control (n=43) group. Participants in each group received a low-calorie diet for 6 weeks. The case group was treated with auricular acupressure and the control group received a sham procedure. Plasma leptin levels, body fat mass, body weight and BMI were measured before and after treatment. Results Participants who received auricular acupressure showed significant reductions in their plasma leptin levels (18.57%, p&lt;0.01) as well as in their body fat mass (4%, p&lt;0.05). These changes were not observed in the control group. The reduction in leptin was significantly greater in the acupressure group than the controls. Conclusions Auricular acupressure combined with a low-calorie diet significantly reduced plasma levels of leptin. However, the mechanism of this reduction is not clear.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study evaluates the thermographic changes associated with moxa burner moxibustion at the SP6 acupuncture point to establish an appropriate, safe distance of efficacy for moxibustion. Methods Baseline temperature changes using a moxa burner were obtained for a paper substrate at various distances and times, and the tested with volunteers in a pilot study. A single-group trial was then conducted with 36 healthy women to monitor temperature changes on the body surface at the acupuncture point (SP6). Results Based on the temperature changes seen for the paper substrate and in the pilot study, a distance of 3 cm was chosen as the intervention distance. Moxibustion significantly increased the SP6 point skin surface temperature, with a peak increase of 11°C at 4 min (p &lt;0.001). This study also found that during moxibustion the temperature of the moxa burner's rubber layer and moxa cautery were 56.9±0.9°C and 65.8±1.2°C, as compared to baseline values of 35.1°C and 43.8°C (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions We determined 3 cm was a safe distance between the moxa burner and acupuncture point. Moxibustion can increase the skin surface temperature at the SP6 point. This data will aid traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners in gauging safer treatment distances when using moxibustion treatments.",

Methods Subjects were 17 patients with spinal canal stenosis who did not respond to 2 months of general conservative treatment and conventional acupuncture. Under x-ray fluoroscopy, two acupuncture needles were inserted as close as possible to the relevant nerve root, as determined by subjective symptoms and x-ray and MRI findings, and low-frequency electroacupuncture stimulation was performed (10 Hz, 10 min). Patients received 3–5 once-weekly treatments, and were evaluated immediately before and after each treatment and 3 months after completion of treatment. Results After the first nerve root electroacupuncture stimulation, scores for lumbar and lower limb symptoms improved significantly (low back pain, p&lt;0.05; lower limb pain, p&lt;0.05; lower limb dysaesthesia, p&lt;0.01) with some improvement in continuous walking distance. Symptom scores and continuous walking distance showed further improvement before the final treatment (p&lt;0.01), and a significant sustained improvement was observed 3 months after completion of treatment (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion Lumbar and lower limb symptoms, for which conventional acupuncture and general conservative treatment had been ineffective, improved significantly during a course of electroacupuncture to the spinal nerve root, showing sustained improvement even 3 months after completion of treatment. The mechanisms of these effects may involve activation of the pain inhibition system and improvement of nerve blood flow.",

The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the anti-emetic effect of electroacupuncture (EA).Forty-eight rats received saline (n=12) or 6 mg/kg cisplatin (n=36) to establish a chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting model. EA was performed at CV12 (n=12), bilateral PC6 (n=12), or sham points (n=12) 3 days before and 1-2 days after cisplatin administration (4-5 times in total), at 0.5-1 mA intensity and 2/15 Hz frequency for 10 min. Kaolin intake, food intake and bodyweight change were evaluated as markers of nausea and vomiting severity. Concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the duodenum and c-Fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry, respectively.Cisplatin administration led to increased kaolin intake and reduced food intake and bodyweight over the following 2 days. EA at CV12 significantly reversed the cisplatin-induced change in kaolin intake (on days 1 and 2) and food intake and bodyweight (on day 1). EA at CV12 also attenuated the cisplatin-induced increase in 5-HT in the duodenum and suppressed c-Fos expression in the NTS. EA at PC6 influenced kaolin intake (on day 1 only) and c-Fos expression, but had no statistically significant effect on food intake, bodyweight or 5-HT expression.This study demonstrated beneficial effects of EA on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in a rat model. The anti-emetic effect of EA may be mediated through inhibition of 5-HT secretion in the duodenum and activity of the NTS.",

English and Chinese language articles published within 10 years of the search were reviewed for inclusion. Randomised control trials comparing combined treatment with acupuncture and rehabilitation and rehabilitation alone in patients with acute or subacute stroke (onset until 3 months after stroke) were included in this review. Three review authors independently checked the titles and abstracts of trials for inclusion based on selection criteria. Studies measuring changes of motor function, activities of daily living, neurological deficit or spasticity/range of motion during the treatment period and at the end of follow-up were included.17 trials met the inclusion criteria, of which five were of good quality. 14 trials had results favourable to acupuncture combined with rehabilitation, compared with conventional rehabilitation treatment alone.Acupuncture in combination with rehabilitation may have benefits for the treatment of acute and subacute stroke sequelae in comparison with rehabilitation alone. However, many of the studies were at risk of bias. Future studies should focus on reaching a consensus about the most appropriate modality of acupuncture intervention, and the appropriate length of treatment for both interventions, to maximise the potential synergistic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective The ‘intensity-response’ relationship between acupuncture stimulation and therapeutic effect is currently the focus of much research interest. The same needling manipulation with different frequencies can generate differential levels of stimulus. This study aimed to examine the effects on gastric motility induced by four twirling frequencies based on relatively standardised manual acupuncture (MA) manipulations. Methods Twirling manipulations at 1, 2, 3, and 4 Hz were practised before the experiments by a single operator using an MA parameter measurement device and stability was evaluated through time-frequency analysis. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=8 each): Control, Model, Model+MA (1, 2, 3, and 4 Hz). Rats in the five Model groups received injections of atropine into the tail vein to inhibit gastric motility, which was continuously recorded by a balloon in the gastric antrum. Rats in the four Model+MA groups received MA at 1, 2, 3 and 4 Hz, respectively, for 70 s and needles were retained for a further 5 min. Results The amplitude of waveforms produced by the four twirling frequencies was relatively consistent and reproducible. The gastric motility amplitude in all groups decreased after modelling (injections of atropine) (p&lt;0.01). Twirling manipulation at 1, 2, and 3 Hz (but not 4 Hz) increased gastric motility amplitude (p&lt;0.05). The increase in gastric motility amplitude induced by MA at 2 Hz was greater than for all other frequencies (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Acupuncture at ST36 helped recover gastric motility amplitude in rats with atropine-induced gastric inhibition and the effects induced by 1–3 Hz frequency were greater than those induced by 4 Hz.",

    "abstract": "Objective To examine the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on early post-rupture tendon repair in a rat model of Achilles tendon rupture using histological and mechanical evaluation. Methods An Achilles tendon rupture model was prepared in 90 Wistar rats, which were randomly assigned to EA, manual acupuncture or control groups. Rats in the EA group received EA (pulse width 5 ms; stimulation frequency 50 Hz; stimulation strength 20 μA; stimulation time 20 min) daily from 1 day following model preparation until the day of assessment (either 7 or 10 days after model preparation), when the region of interest was sampled to assess tendon repair using in vitro methods. Total cell count and the number of cells staining positive for transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) were measured. Tension tests were performed 10 days after model preparation to measure the maximum breaking strength of the repaired tendon. Results Both the total cell count and the number of cells positive for b-FGF were significantly higher in the EA group (p&lt;0.05). In the EA group only, immunostaining showed strong expression of TGF-β1 7 days after model preparation (p&lt;0.05). Maximum breaking strength of the repaired tendon 10 days after model preparation was significantly higher in the EA group (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions The marked increase in cell count and growth factor expression as well as increased tendon strength in the EA group suggest that EA may be a useful method for promoting tendon repair.",

    "abstract": "Background The autonomic nervous system and trigeminal nerve are involved in adjusting flow through diverging cerebral arteries in the prefrontal cortex. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 100 Hz electroacupuncture (EA) to the trigeminal nerve area on cerebral blood flow and autonomic nervous system function. Method This was a randomised crossover study of 16 healthy volunteers who were assigned to an EA or control group. Stimulation (in the EA group) was performed five times, each after 1 min of rest. Needles were inserted at the inner edge of the eyebrows and 1 cm from the front hairline midpoint. We used high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components of heart rate (HR) variability to assess autonomic nervous system function. HF and LF/HF ratio were taken as indicators of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively. We measured cerebral blood flow using a two-channel near-infrared spectroscope. Results In the EA group, HR significantly decreased (p=0.004) and HF significantly increased (p=0.006) relative to baseline. By contrast, there were no significant changes in HR or HF within the control group (p&gt;0.05). Accordingly, HR tended to be lower (p=0.087) and HF greater (p=0.071) in the EA group versus the control group. There were no significant differences in LF/HF ratio within/between groups. Compared with the control group, cerebral blood flow was significantly greater in the left (p=0.048) and right (p=0.016) prefrontal cortex in the EA group. Conclusions Delivery of 100 Hz EA to the trigeminal nerve area reduces HR and increases parasympathetic nervous activity and cerebral blood flow.",

    "abstract": "An ideal placebo design in clinical research should resemble the intervention under investigation to facilitate blinding, yet remain clinically inert. With regard to physical interventions such as acupuncture, a true placebo device has not been developed and validated. Since 1998, researchers have designed several placebo acupuncture devices (PADs). The three most widely used PADs are the Streitberger, the Park and the Takakura device.This review focuses on evaluating studies of these devices, in the context of credibility of blinding (COB), assessment of penetrating pain or sensation, and de qi sensation.Electronic database searches were conducted in four English and two Chinese databases from their inception until November 2016. All studies included in the review were conducted on healthy participants and compared verum manual acupuncture with any of the aforementioned PADs with respect to one or more of the above three outcomes related to blinding effect.The synthesised analyses of the 15 included studies showed that the Streitberger and Park placebo devices may not blind participants successfully when tested at a sensitive acupuncture point (LI4). In terms of penetrating sensation, there were significant differences between these two placebo devices and verum acupuncture when applied at this point. The Takakura device was the only PAD that had the potential to blind the acupuncturist. However, the blinding analyses of all outcome measures were inconsistent.Overall, there were insufficient data to confirm the blinding effects of these skin-contact PADs as each device was associated with limitations that warrant further design improvements.",

As the use of moxibustion increases, concerns are being raised regarding its safety and quality. The need to establish standards to protect patient safety is paramount in all medical fields. As a form of medical practice, it is essential to develop moxibustion standards in the areas of terminology, moxibustion products, treatment rooms and practice to ensure its harmonisation and safe usage. The evidence base guiding policy and decision making has to be based on evidence from basic and clinical research.

In total, 432 patients with KOA were randomly assigned to one of three groups (HSM, conventional moxibustion, or conventional injection with sodium hyaluronate). The primary end point was the guiding principle of clinical research on new drugs in the treatment of KOA (GPCRND-KOA).

Pairwise comparisons showed that HSM was more effective than the conventional drug. There was no difference in any measures between conventional moxibustion and the conventional drug. Compared with conventional moxibustion, HSM resulted in greater improvement in all outcomes.This trial provided some evidence of the superiority of HSM in patients with KOA, suggesting that the observed differences might be due to superiority effects of a heat-sensitive point, although the effect of expectation cannot be ruled out.The trial was registered at Controlled Clinical Trials: ChiCTR-TRC-09000600.",

    "abstract": "Background Bronchial asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease which has three main pathological features: airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway remodelling, and chronic inflammation. Acupuncture is known to be an effective integrative medical therapy that has been used in the treatment of several chronic diseases, including bronchial asthma. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on inflammation and regulation of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in a mouse model of asthma. Methods The murine asthma model was established by both injection and inhalation of ovalbumin (OVA). Within 24 hours of the last OVA challenge, lung function was assessed by measurement of the airway resistance (R L ) and lung dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Pulmonary tissues were collected for the detection of pathological changes and mucus secretion. Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-33 and sST2 (secreted ST2) were detected by ELISA. Th17 cell proportions and counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed by flow cytometry. Results The results showed that AHR, chronic inflammation and mucus secretion were significantly suppressed by acupuncture treatment. R L decreased while Cdyn increased after acupuncture treatment. There was an apparent decrease in the serum concentrations of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-33, and an increase in sST2 level compared with untreated asthmatic mice. Acupuncture also reduced the CD4 +IL-17A+ cell proportion and counts in BALF. Conclusion Acupuncture effectively protects lung function and attenuates airway inflammation in the OVA-induced mouse model of asthma, which supports the role of acupuncture as a potential therapy in asthma treatment.",

Rats of the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups underwent CLP modeling of sepsis; those in the Sham-CLP underwent sham surgery and those in the Control and Control+EA groups remained unoperated. Rats in the CLP+EA and Control+EA groups received verum EA at ST36 and rats in the CLP+Sham-EA groups received EA at non-traditional acupuncture points. After three days, serum D-lactate concentrations were measured and ileal mucosa was collected for haematoxylin and eosin staining, morphological observation and Chiu's scoring. The intestinal epithelial cells were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while protein expression of occludin was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.TJs of the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups were continuous under TEM but discontinuous in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups. Plasma D-lactate levels were significantly higher in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups compared with the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups (P<0.01). Protein expression of occludin, reflected by immunohistochemistry scores (IHS) and the results of Western blotting, were significantly reduced in the CLP, CLP+EA and CLP+Sham-EA groups when compared with the Control, Sham-CLP and Control+EA groups (P<0.01).

Methods: Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to generate a TBI model using Feeney’s freefall epidural impact method. MA was performed on half of the TBI model rats, while the others remained untreated. Acupuncture was administered at GV15, GV16, GV20, GV26, and LI4. At the end of the intervention, rat brain tissue samples were collected, and the microglial M1 polarization status was observed by immunofluorescence labeling of CD86, an M1 microglia-specific protein. RhoA/ROCK2 signaling components were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression levels of inflammatory factors. Results: Compared with normal rats, the CD86 expression density in the untreated TBI model rats was high and showed an aggregated expression pattern. The genes and proteins of the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway were highly expressed, and inflammatory factors were significantly increased. The CD86 expression density in TBI rats after MA was reduced compared to that in untreated TBI rats and showed a scattered distribution. The expression of RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway genes and proteins was also significantly reduced, and inflammatory factors were decreased. Conclusion: These results show that MA may inhibit M1 polarization of microglia by regulating the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway, thereby reducing neuroinflammation in TBI.",

PD can be classified as idiopathic, acquired or hereditary and may be caused by various factors such as oxidative stress, loss of mitochondrial function, neuronal excitotoxicity or calcium imbalance. Methods We hypothesised that electroacupuncture (EA) at KI3 would reduce neuronal excitotoxicity by regulating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function and may represent a novel therapeutic approach for PD. Results Our results showed that deficits in spatial learning (reflected by the escape latency time in the Morris water maze task) and long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by systemic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration (that damages dopaminergic neurons) could be rescued by EA on day 3. In PD mice, phosphorylated NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B were elevated (134.03±10.17% and 123.46±3.47% of baseline levels, respectively) but total NR1 and NR2B was unaffected (101.37±3.87% and 102.61±4.22% of baseline, respectively). Elevated levels of pNR1 and pNR2B, and phosphorylated forms of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, α Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK), and cAMP response element-binding protein were also reduced following EA. Conclusions These novel findings suggest that EA can rescue learning and LTP deficits in a rodent model of PD. The results point to a possible role for EA-based approaches in the clinical treatment of learning deficits associated with PD.",

Methods: A literature search in eight databases yielded nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the comparative effectiveness of acupuncture and CC in anovulatory infertility. Subsequently, data were extracted and the studies were assessed for the quality of their methodological designs and risk of bias. Meta-analyses of the RCT data were conducted. Results: Nine trials including 1441 women were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69), ovulation (OR 2.57, 95% CI 0.59 to 11.29) or pregnancy loss (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.63) when acupuncture was used as an adjuvant therapy alongside CC. Although acupuncture alone did not increase the ovulation rate (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.49), our review demonstrated superior effects in patients who received acupuncture as a separate treatment modality with respect to both the pregnancy rate (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.10) and the maximum follicular diameter (mean difference 0.50 mm, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.56 mm) when compared with CC alone. Statistical analysis also showed a reduction in the rate of pregnancy loss when acupuncture was used as a separate treatment compared with CC alone (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45). Conclusions: Based on the above pooled results of the studies, the use of acupuncture as a monotherapy significantly improved the rate of pregnancy among the study participants compared with the use of CC alone.

    "abstract": "Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins are activators of innate immunity inducing infection and inflammatory responses. Anti-inflammatory drugs can have undesirable side effects. Acupuncture may be an alternative for the treatment of inflammatory processes. Objective: We investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of manual acupuncture (MA) at SP6 upon LPS-induced peritonitis in rats. Methods: Peritonitis was induced in rats with an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.002, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 µg/kg) in four experimental groups (n = 6 each). A fifth group was injected with sterile saline solution (saline group, n = 6). Four hours after the procedure, peritoneal fluid was collected to determine total cell counts for inflammatory cells, differential leukocyte counts and peritoneal capillary permeability. The LPS dose of 0.02 µg/kg was used in the subsequent experiments as it most successfully induced peritoneal inflammation. Subsequently, five experimental groups (n = 12 rats each) were used: (1) saline, (2) control (untreated LPS group), (3) indomethacin (LPS group treated with indomethacin), (4) NA (LPS group treated with MA at a location not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point), and (5) SP6 (LPS group treated with verum MA at SP6). Ten minutes after MA or 30 min after indomethacin treatment, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS. After 4 h, total leukocyte and differential cell counts, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, vascular permeability and cytokine levels were evaluated in the peritoneal fluid. Cytokine levels were additionally evaluated in the brainstem. Results: SP6 MA and indomethacin treatments reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular permeability and MPO activity in the LPS-exposed rats. Pre-treatment with indomethacin and SP6 MA decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels and preserved interleukin (IL)-10 in the peritoneal fluid. Indomethacin also reduced IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid. In the brainstem, indomethacin reduced IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10, whereas SP6 MA reduced only TNFα and IL-6 levels. Conclusions: This study clearly demonstrates the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture, which we believe may involve the activation of anti-inflammatory neural reflexes in the regulation of peritonitis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common post-surgical complication, which is associated with increased costs and extended hospital stays. Recently, interest in acupuncture as a potential therapy for POCD has grown. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for POCD. Methods: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Medline, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases were searched through March 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients with POCD treated with acupuncture (acupuncture group) were compared with those receiving a no treatment control were included. Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen studies containing 1241 participants were included. POCD incidence in the acupuncture group was significantly lower than that in the control groups on the first (odds ratio (OR) = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23–0.45) and third (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.30–0.56) post-operative days, with no statistically significant difference on the seventh day (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.32–1.04). Acupuncture therapy also improved mini–mental state examination (MMSE) scores on the first (mean difference (MD) = 3.28, 95% CI = 2.79–3.77) and third (MD = 2.52, 95% CI = 2.18–2.87) post-operative days, with no effect on the seventh (MD = 0.14, 95% CI = –0.24 to 0.51). Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores on the first post-operative day were not impacted by acupuncture but were likely associated with post-operative nausea and vomiting on the seventh post-operative day. With respect to methodological quality, most RCTs were found to have an unclear risk of bias. Conclusion: Acupuncture may successfully treat/prevent POCD. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture has been clinically recommended as a method of pain relief by the World Health Organization and is widely used by medical doctors. Fibromyalgia (FM) pain has a complex physiological and psychological origin and can be pharmacologically treated with duloxetine, milnacipran and pregabalin. However, these drugs produce undesirable side effects, such as headaches, nausea and diarrhoea. Acupuncture may serve as an effective alternative treatment for pain relief with few side effects. Aims: We hypothesised that acupuncture would reduce FM pain by influencing transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and the downstream phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK), which are located in the central thalamus, amygdala and cortex. Methods: A FM mouse model was established by injecting two doses of acid saline into 32 female C57/B6 mice. The mice were then assigned to different subgroups (n=8 each) and treated with electroacupuncture (EA) or EA sham control. TRPV1 and pERK expression levels were measured using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: Our results demonstrated that the expression of TRPV1 and pERK in the thalamus, amygdala and somatosensory cortex was normal in the control mice, but significantly increased in FM mice; these FM-induced changes in expression were attenuated by EA. Conclusion: Our data suggest that EA can reverse the central sensitisation of the TRPV1-ERK signalling pathway in the mouse brain. Thus, our findings provide mechanistic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic efficacy of EA for treating FM pain.",

Increasing evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) can regulate cardiac function by modulating the autonomic nervous system (ANS), but little is known about its effectiveness on neural remodeling post-MI.To investigate the role of EA in ANS remodeling post-MI.Adult male C57/BL6 mice were equally divided into the Control (Ctrl), MI and EA groups after generating the MI model by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Echocardiography and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining were employed to evaluate cardiac function and infarct size after EA treatment for five consecutive days. Serum norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured by ELISA to quantify sympathetic activation. Then, ANS remodeling was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-qPCR, and Western blotting.Our preliminary findings showed that EA increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening and reduced infarct area after MI injury. Serum NE levels in the EA group were significantly decreased compared with those in the MI group. IHC staining results demonstrated that the density of growth associated protein (GAP)43 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive nerve fibers in the EA group were decreased with increased choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACHT). Meanwhile, the results verified that mRNA and protein expression of GAP43 and TH were significantly inhibited by EA treatment in the MI mice, accompanied by elevated CHAT and VACHT.EA treatment could improve cardiac function and reduce infarct size by modulating sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve remodeling post-MI, thus helping the cardiac ANS reach a new balance to try to protect the heart from further possible injury.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17, as a T-helper 17 cell (Th17) cytokine, plays a key role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathophysiology including chronic inflammation and airway obstruction, which lead to decreased pulmonary function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acupuncture on IL-17, its receptor (IL-17R) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, in a rat model of COPD.The COPD model was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by exposure to cigarette smoke for 12 weeks. The model rats were treated with electroacupuncture (EA) at BL13 and ST36. The lung function and histology of the rats were observed. IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-10 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in plasma. The leukocytes and macrophages in the BALF were counted. The expression levels of IL-17R were assayed in lung tissue by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. MAPK signaling pathway molecules including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38, and their phosphorylated forms, were observed in the lung by western blotting.Compared with the control group rats, lung function decreased and there was a severe inflammatory infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma in the COPD rats. EA effectively improved lung function and alleviated the inflammatory infiltration in the lungs of COPD rats. EA also reversed the elevated total leukocyte and macrophage counts, the high levels of IL-17 and TNF-α, and the low IL-10 content in COPD rats. Meanwhile, EA downregulated the increased mRNA and protein expression of IL-17R, and significantly inhibited the elevated levels of phosphorylated JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 in the lungs of COPD rats.Our results suggest that the protective effects of acupuncture therapy on the lungs of COPD rats are likely related to inhibition of IL-17/IL-17R and the post-receptor MAPK signaling pathways.",

The effects of EA administered at different preoperative time points were compared. Methods: A total of 413 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomly allocated into 4 groups receiving EA the day before surgery (Group Pre, n = 103), 30 min before (Group 30, n = 104) or both (Group Comb, n = 103), or usual care alone (Group Usual, n = 103). All acupuncture groups had usual care. The incidence of PONV and pain at 24 h were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the severity of postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain, requirement for antiemetic medication and quality of recovery (QoR)-15 scores after surgery. Results: There were significant differences between the four groups in nausea and vomiting incidence (0–24 h), postoperative antiemetic use (0–48 h), and postoperative pain (0–6 h), with the EA groups recording the lowest levels. Regarding primary outcomes, incidence of nausea and vomiting at 6-24 h was 28/11/18/11% (p = 0.003) 23/5/8/9% (p &lt; 0.001), respectively, for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. Accordingly, EA reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting at 6-24 h by 61/34/60% and 79/65/61% for Groups Pre/30/Comb, respectively. Regarding secondary outcomes, incidence of nausea and vomiting at 0-6 h was 20/9/11/7% (p = 0.013) and 17/7/9/6% (p = 0.021), respectively, for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. Rescue antiemetics at 0–6 h were required by 18/4/11/4% (p = 0.001) in Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. The mean numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score (0–10) at 0–6 h was significantly different between groups (2.45/1.89/2.01/1.97 for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb, p = 0.024). There were no significant differences between the three EA-treated groups. Conclusion: In gynecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery and treated with multimodal antiemetic methods, one session of preoperative EA may be a safe adjunctive treatment for PONV prophylaxis. Optimal timing of EA requires further verification. Trial registration number: ChiCTR-INR-16010035 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry).",

    "abstract": "The management of breech presentation at term remains controversial. It appears logical that maternal and perinatal outcomes would be improved if breech presentation could be avoided. External cephalic version is considered a safe procedure if cases are selected appropriately and anaesthesia avoided. Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese method of treatment, which utilizes the heat generated by burning herbal preparations containing the plant Artemisia vulgaris to stimulate the acupuncture points. It is used for breech version with a reported success rate of 84.6% after 34 weeks gestation. Moxibustion technique is cheap, safe, simple, self-administered, non-invasive, painless and generally well tolerated. Although many studies give encouraging results regarding the use of moxibustion in inducing cephalic version of breech presentation, a definitive conclusion cannot be made as most involve small sample sizes and are not randomised. Moxibustion could be an extra option offered to women with breech presentation along with vaginal delivery, caesarean section and external cephalic version. This article discusses the possible role of moxibustion in correction of breech presentation in the hope that, some interest will be stimulated in what is a very interesting area for future research.",

Three general practices, in Oxfordshire (rural), Lincolnshire (semi-rural), and Peterborough (urban), recruited 102 patients aged 16 or over with long-standing, moderate or severe hay fever symptoms that had required continuous therapy for at least one month of the year for three or more consecutive years. The patients were asked to keep a diary to record: the amount of medication used daily; a daily symptom score (using a ten-point scale), from which was derived a weekly remission of symptoms score; and their assessment of the effect of acupuncture on the hay fever symptoms. Symptom scores and use of medication were similar in the two groups. In the four-week period following each patient's first treatment, remission of symptoms was reported by 39.0% in the active treatment group and 45.2% in the sham group; mean weekly symptom scores were 18.4 and 17.6 respectively; and mean units of medication used were 4.1 and 5.0 respectively. Sixteen out of 43 patients in the active treatment group and 14 out of 43 in the sham group felt that the acupuncture had had an excellent or very good effect on their hay fever. The treatments were simple, safe, reproducible and perceived as equally effective. Whether this represented an acupuncture effect, a placebo effect, or natural variation in a fluctuating condition, is not clear.",

All had had conservative treatment of physiotherapy and shoe-support without significant pain relief before acupuncture was offered, and thus acted as their own controls for the purposes of the study. The following traditional points were needled: Taixi (KI.3), Kunlun (BL.60) and Sanyinjiao (SP.6). Pain was assessed by a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) before treatment was started and after four, weekly sessions of acupuncture treatment. If complete pain relief was not obtained by the initial four-week treatment, a further two, weekly sessions of the above mentioned acupoints, with the addition of trigger point acupuncture in the gastro-soleus and plantar fascia, was carried out and pain assessed. Patients were also assessed with a verbal rating score to indicate the percentage improvement after acupuncture compared to before treatment. The mean duration of heel pain was 25.11 months (SD 10.68). The VAS data obtained at 4 and 6 weeks of acupuncture treatment showed a statistically highly significant improvement compared to the VAS before acupuncture (p &lt; 0.0009 and p &lt; 0.0001 respectively). Using the Mann-Whitney test, there was a statistically significant difference in VAS obtained at 6 weeks, after trigger point acupuncture had been added for poor responders, compared to that obtained after the first 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment (p &lt; 0.047). Our study demonstrates that acupuncture is effective in treating patients with chronic heel pain due to plantar fasciitis and that the addition of trigger point acupuncture in poor or non-responders may be useful.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a unique personal experience showing variability where gender and sex related effects might contribute. The mechanisms underlying the differences between women and men are currently unknown but are likely to be complex and involving interactions between biological, sociocultural and psychological aspects. In women, painful experimental stimuli are generally reported to produce a greater intensity of pain than in men. Clinical pain is often reported with higher severity and frequency, longer duration, and present in a greater number of body regions in women than in men. Women are also more likely to experience a number of painful conditions such as fibromyalgia, temporomandibular dysfunction, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. With regard to biological factors, quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the endogenous pain inhibitory systems have been implicated, as well as an influence of gonadal hormones. Psychosocial factors like sex role beliefs, pain coping strategies, and pain related expectancies may also contribute to the differences. Being exposed to repeated painful visceral events (eg menses, labour) during life may contribute to an increased sensitivity to, and greater prevalence of, pain among women. When assessing the outcome of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in pain treatment, the factors of gender and sex should be taken into account as the response to an intervention may differ. Preferably, treatment recommendations should be based on studies using both women and men as the norm. Due to variability in results, findings from animal studies and experiments in healthy subjects should be interpreted with care.",

Both acupuncture and anaesthetic injection were performed at two to five of the most painful points on the lower back once weekly for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture group, a 0.18 mm diameter stainless steel needle was inserted to a depth of 10-20 mm and manual stimulation was applied. In the local anaesthetic injection group, a 0.5 mm diameter needle was inserted to a depth of 10-20 mm and a local anaesthetic was injected. Participants evaluated pain using a Visual Analogue Scale immediately before and after the first treatment, before each subsequent treatment, and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after completion of treatment.There was a significant difference between the two groups in the change in Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (p<0.01), with acupuncture providing more favourable results than local anaesthetic injection. The reduction in pain score from baseline calculated at each time period was significantly different between the two groups after the first (p<0.05) and final (p<0.01) treatments, and during the follow-up period (after 2 weeks (p<0.01) and 4 weeks (p<0.05)).Both injection and acupuncture relieved pain, but acupuncture was superior for the immediate and sustained effects, suggesting that it is a useful treatment for low back pain. The difference in the effects may be attributable to differences in the mechanism of pain suppression.",

    "abstract": "Objectives After initial promising research into acupuncture for withdrawal from drugs of dependence, two large negative trials were published in 2002 and the use of acupuncture in US rehabilitation facilities fell. However, subsequently it has been maintained, despite a lack of support from systematic reviews. This suggests a mismatch between research and clinical observation, which could be due to the acupuncture technique used, choice of controls or outcome measures. This study aims to explore the mismatch. Methods An exploratory review of all 48 clinical trials on alcohol, cocaine, nicotine or opioid dependence included in current reviews. Results Studies with sham controls (that could be active) were less likely to be positive (33%) than those with non-acupuncture controls (75%). Positive results were more likely when measuring craving (56%) or withdrawal symptoms (58%) than when measuring abstinence (31%) or attrition (31%). Three treatment variables appeared to be associated with positive results: (1) body acupuncture, used in 13 studies, was associated with positive outcomes for craving and withdrawal symptoms but not for abstinence or attrition; (2) electroacupuncture, used in seven studies, was associated with positive results with all four outcomes; and (3) bilateral needling in 20 studies was associated with effects on abstinence, craving and withdrawal symptoms. Conclusions The current evidence suggests that acupuncture may have some effects on drug dependence that have been missed because of choice of outcome in many previous studies, and future studies should use outcomes suggested by clinical experience. Body points and electroacupuncture, used in the original clinical observation, justify further research.",

General practitioners (GPs) educated in Western medical acupuncture did the interventions. Parents and GPs' assistants were blinded. Active treatment was the bilateral insertion of 0.20×15 mm Seirin needles to 12 mm depth at ST36. The intervention consisted of daily treatments of 30 s duration for three consecutive workdays. Blinding was done with a red point mark on the skin and circular adhesive dressing covering. The parents were asked two blinding validation questions in the course of the study period. The primary end point was the effect of the intervention assessed as change in crying time per 24 h measured with a crying registration form.The authors improved the standardisation and changed the blinding procedure as a result of the pilot study. Blinding validation questions were considered necessary. The changes made in the main study protocol are discussed.The pilot study led to important changes that were implemented into the final trial protocol. Blinding validation is essential in no-treatment controlled trials of acupuncture on infants, where the parents are blinded assessors of symptom reduction.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of electroacupuncture (EA) on the dynamic equilibrium of the immune system and immune cell populations during the pericraniotomy period. Methods A total of 56 patients undergoing craniotomy were randomised into three groups: control (C, n=18), EA (A, n=19) and sham acupuncture (S, n=19) groups. Blood samples were collected before anaesthesia (T0) and 30 min, 2 h and 4 h after induction of anaesthesia (T1, T2 and T3, respectively,) to measure the levels of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IgM, IgA, IgG and full blood count. Results There was no significant difference between the measurements in groups A and S during craniotomy. The levels of IgM and IgA decreased significantly in group C compared with groups A and S at T2 and T3 time points. The levels of total T cells and suppressor T cells in group C decreased significantly compared with groups A and S at T1 and T2, and the level of natural killer cells in group C decreased significantly compared with groups A and S at T1. No significant differences between groups were found in the levels of TNFα, IgG, IL-10, IL-8, leucocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, Th cells or B cells.

Methods Twelve healthy volunteers received 30 min of electroacupuncture (EA) at the Baihui (GV20) and Yintang acupuncture points and then underwent two fMRI scans, one each at 5 and 15 min after needle removal. Related brain networks were analysed centred at different ‘seeds’, centres which functionally connect the other cerebral regions in an organised network, such as the anterior frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, hypothalamus, head of the caudate nucleus and anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Networks were analysed based on the resting cerebral functional connection, and the differences in the activities of the brain networks between the two time points were compared. Results At 5 min after needle removal, 12 brain functional regions were involved in organising the network centred at the caudate nucleus ‘seed.’ This number was greater than the number of related brain networks centred at the other ‘seeds’. At 15 min after needle removal, 15 and 14 brain functional regions were involved in organised networks centred at the parahippocampal and hypothalamus ‘seeds’, respectively; these numbers were greater than the numbers of other related brain networks centred at the other ‘seeds’. Conclusions A brain network composed of a large number of cerebral functional regions was found after EA at GV20 and Yintang in healthy volunteers.

The fracture caused displacement of the middle third of her right radius from the distal end of her right ulna. This, combined with other fractures in the fifth metacarpal bone and the proximal phalanx, resulted in almost total traumatic amputation. Her right arm was amputated surgically below the elbow.\n\nRecurrent wound infections occurred in her right forearm stump. As a result she underwent three debridement operations and split-thickness skin graft surgery. A skin rash, diagnosed as erythema multiforme, developed over the upper trunk after the operation. Steroid treatment stabilised the condition. After a hospital stay of about 1.5 months, she was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\n\nThe woman had PLP and phantom limb sensation (PLS) after the surgical amputation.

The aim of this study was to quantify measurement variability and assess reliability of the AcuGraph system-a commonly used electrodermal screening device.Four experiments were conducted to measure variability in electrical conductance readings obtained by the AcuGraph system. The first involved measuring known resistors. The second measured non-human organic matter. The third was a test-retest assessment of the Yuan-Source and Jing-Well points in 30 healthy volunteers who were measured by a single operator. The fourth was an interoperator reliability evaluation of seven acupuncturists at the Yuan-Source and Jing-Well acupoints on four individuals at two time points.Against known resistors, the AcuGraph had an average coefficient of variability (CV) of 1.8% between operators and test-retests. On non-human organic material the AcuGraph had an average CV of 0.9% and 2.8%. When a single operator tested 30 participants, the average reliability for the Yuan-Source points was 0.86 and 0.76 for Jing-Well points with a CV of 23.2% and 25.9% respectively. The average CV for the seven acupuncturists was 24.5% on Yuan-Source points and 23.7% on Jing-Well points.The AcuGraph measures known resistors and organic matter accurately and reliably. Skin conductance at acupoints recorded by one operator was also reliable. There was less consistency in electrodermal recordings obtained by seven different operators.

The 63-year-old woman suffered from persistent hallucinations and even physical pain as a result of the hallucination of a black bird that kept pecking her back. The patient received 12 weekly acupuncture treatments. A clinical diagnostic interview and psychological testing (on sleep quality, depression, and on positive and negative symptoms) were conducted before, immediately after and 3 months after the acupuncture treatment. The results of the diagnostic interview gave important insights into the treatment effects. The patient experienced improved daily functioning and noticed a change in hallucinations. Although the hallucinations still occurred, she felt less disturbed by them. Interestingly, pain decreased markedly. In addition, the results showed that the overall score of the positive and negative symptoms did not change immediately; however, a decrease in symptoms occurred 3 months after acupuncture treatment. Moreover, the patient described an immediate improvement in sleep; this was confirmed by a daytime sleepiness questionnaire. The patient was not able to complete a (longer) test on sleep quality beforehand but did so after the treatment period. Finally, a delayed improvement in the depression scale was found. Although larger clinical intervention studies on acupuncture and schizophrenia are needed, the results of this case study indicate that acupuncture may be beneficial as an add on treatment tool in patients with schizophrenia.

Fatigue was scored according to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).A total of 15 (37.5%) patients with MS with fatigue responded to amantadine. The mean FSS score reduction after 2 months of treatment was 8±4, which was statistically significant (p<0.001). Of the 20 patients who were resistant to amantadine, 5 (25%) responded to acupuncture combined with amantadine treatment. The FSS scores of the 20 patients who were refractory were significantly reduced after this treatment (mean: 13±6, p<0.001).Acupuncture appears to be associated with benefits for a proportion of patients with fatigue who are resistant to conventional drugs such as amantadine, and this finding justifies further research.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To determine the feasibility and acceptability of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in reducing symptoms and bothersomeness in women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI); and to estimate the sample size for a full scale trial. Methods Thirty-four women with MUI were randomly assigned to either 12 sessions of TCM acupuncture, 12 sessions of PFMT, or to a waiting list control group. Outcome measures included an assessment of interest to participate in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and compliance with treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, and included the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF), expectations of treatment effect, and adverse events. Results Recruitment was feasible and randomisation worked adequately by means of SurveyMonkey. SurveyMonkey does not permit stratification by ICIQ-UI SF baseline score. Fourteen of 22 women found the treatment options acceptable. The dropout rate was high, especially in the control group (6/12). Outcome forms were completed by 20 of 34 women. The median (IQR) changes of the ICIQ-UI SF scores in the acupuncture, physiotherapy, and waiting list group were 5.5 (2.3 to 6.8), 1.0 (−3.0 to 4.5), and 1.5 (−1.5 to 3.0), respectively, suggesting the need for a full scale trial. Conclusions Women with MUI were willing to participate in this study. There is a need for adjusting eligibility criteria. A sample size of 129 women, 43 in three arms, is required. No major adverse events occurred.",

Objectives This study reports an investigation of the sensorimotor aspects of the acupuncture lifting-thrusting skill in order to highlight the important kinematic and kinetic features of the action. The study also explores the role of perceptual acuity in accurate acupuncture performance. Methods Twelve novice and 12 expert acupuncturists watched a standardised video demonstrating the mild reinforcing and reducing technique of lifting-thrusting on an acupuncture point and then performed 10 trials of the technique on an artificial skin pad mounted on a six-axis force transducer with an infrared light-emitting diode affixed to the index finger of their dominant hand. The force transducer measured the force applied by participants as they needled the acupuncture point while an optoelectric camera measured the position of the diode. Subsequently, the participants engaged in two tests of general perceptual acuity. Results Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that experts are more consistent in their trial-by-trial amplitude (p=0.03) and lifting-thrusting velocity (p=0.029) than novices. Measures of perceptual acuity revealed no differences between novices and experts. Conclusions Movement amplitude and velocity consistency are the action features of the mild reinforcing and reducing lifting-thrusting skill that differentiate the performances of experts from novices. The acquisition of acupuncture expertise is a function of extended practice rather than any inherent perceptual ability.",

The reorganisation of collagen fibrils was improved in the EA and SB groups at days 14 and 21, respectively. EA at day 21 appeared to reduce the reorganisation.

Three months after ovariectomy, rats in the OVX+GB and OVX+N groups received EA treatment for 3 months. Urine, blood and femur samples were collected from each animal for analysis. Results Bodyweight (BW) in the OVX+GB group decreased after EA treatment, reaching a minimum of ∼12% below the OVX and OVX+N groups at 1 month. Concentrations of urine deoxypyridinoline, a bone resorption marker, were significantly elevated in the OVX and OVX+N groups but not the OVX+GB group. Concentrations of serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase, a bone formation marker, were significantly higher in the OVX+GB group versus the Sham and OVX groups. Bone mineral density (BMD) did not differ between the OVX, OVX+GB and OVX+N groups, but was ∼10% lower than the Sham group. However, BMD/BW in the OVX+GB group was significantly higher than in the OVX and OVX+N groups and similar to the Sham group. Histological assessment of the femur showed that EA at GB points improved the bone architecture. Conclusions EA treatment at GB points had anti-osteoporotic effects in a rat model of osteoporosis.",

This study aimed to explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cognitive impairment and its relationship with Ca2+neurotoxicity in a rat model of I/R injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).60 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control (sham surgery) group, untreated MCAO group and EA-treated MCAO+EA group. Rats in the MCAO and MCAO+EA groups underwent modelling of poststroke cognitive impairment by MCAO surgery. EA was performed for 30 min daily at GV20 and GV24 (1-20 Hz) for 1 week. The Morris water maze experiment was used to assess cognitive function. 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining was used to measure infarct volume. The intracellular Ca2+content in the Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 area of the hippocampus was assessed by laser confocal scanning microscopy. ELISA was performed to evaluate the concentration of glutamate (Glu) in the hippocampus, and the protein expression of two Glu receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) 2A and NMDAR2B) were analysed by Western blotting.Compared with the untreated MCAO group, EA effectively ameliorated cognitive impairment (P=0.01) and shrunk the infarct volume (P=0.032). The content of intracellular Ca2+, Glu and NMDAR2B in the hippocampus was significantly raised by MCAO (P=0.031-0.043), while EA abrogated these effects. NMDAR2A was decreased by MCAO (P=0.015) but increased by EA (P=0.033).EA had a beneficial effect on cognitive repair after cerebral I/R, and its mechanism of action likely involves a reduction of Ca2+influx via inhibition of Glu neurotoxicity and downregulation of NMDAR2B expression.",

Compared with group M, greater expression of IκBα in group E was only observed at the 1 h time point (p<0.01).Collectively, our data suggest that EA inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65 and increases the expression of IκBα, which leads to the suppression of NF-κB activation in a rat tissue chamber model of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Mild adverse events (AEs) are common with acupuncture, but the risk factors remain unclear. A prospective study using a standardised AE assessment and acupuncture protocol was undertaken to address the question.A 20-item AE report form investigated local and systemic AEs in 150 adults with insomnia randomised to receive traditional, minimal and non-invasive sham acupuncture. Sociodemographic, clinical and psychological variables at baseline and past history and perceived credibility of acupuncture were assessed.The incidence of any AEs per patient was 42.4% with traditional acupuncture, 40.7% with minimal acupuncture and 16.7% with non-invasive sham acupuncture. Traditional and minimal acupuncture were associated with a greater number of local AEs, while the presence of a chronic medical condition was predictive of fewer local and systemic AEs. Greater severity of insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and pain catastrophising thoughts were associated with lower risk, but most of the significant correlations disappeared after logistic regression. Divorce and widowhood were the only significant sociodemographic variables, while previous acupuncture treatment and perceived credibility of acupuncture were found to be unrelated. The risk of any AEs was higher in participants receiving traditional acupuncture (OR 4.26) and minimal acupuncture (OR 4.27) and in those without medical comorbidity (OR 3.39).The prevalence of AEs was higher than usual, probably due to the low threshold in our definition of AEs and the systematic collection from the patients' perspective. Baseline variables were largely unable to predict AEs associated with acupuncture. Further studies should explore the roles of practitioners, patients' anxiety during treatment and patient-practitioner interactions.NCT01707706.",

    "abstract": "Background A previous study has reported that low-frequency (LF) electroacupuncture (EA) influences salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is known to control the secretion volume of sIgA; however, the effect of high-frequency (HF) EA on salivary sIgA has not been determined. We investigated whether HF EA affects salivary sIgA levels and the ANS. Method Sixteen healthy subjects were randomly classified into two groups: a control group and an EA group. After a 5 min rest, subjects in the EA group received EA at 100 Hz bilaterally at LI4 and LI11 for 15 min before resting for a further 40 min post-stimulation. Subjects in the control group rested for a total of 60 min. Measurements of the ANS and sIgA levels in both groups were made before, immediately after, 20 min after, and 40 min after rest or 15 min EA treatment. HF and LF components of heart rate variability were analysed as markers of ANS function. LF/HF ratio and HF were taken as indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, respectively. Salivary protein concentrations and sIgA levels were determined by Bradford protein assay and ELISA, respectively. Results LF/HF ratio was significantly increased immediately after EA. HF was significantly increased at 20 min after EA and sIgA level was significantly increased at 40 min after EA. In addition, HF and salivary sIgA level were positively correlated with each another. Conclusions HF EA exerted sequential positive effects on sympathetic nerve activity, parasympathetic nerve activity, and salivary sIgA level (immediately and after 20 and 40 min, respectively). HF EA may increase salivary sIgA levels by influencing parasympathetic nerve activity.",

Methods An SIIR rat model was created using daily intraperitoneal injections of clinically relevant doses of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) for 5 days to induce chronic insulin resistance. Thirty-six SIIR rats were randomly divided into the SIIR+EA group (n=18), which received 15 Hz EA at ST36 for 60 min, and the SIIR group (n=18), which remained untreated. Plasma glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured in serial blood samples taken without further manipulation (n=6 per group) and during insulin challenge test (ICT, n=6 per group) and intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT, n=6 per group). Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 were measured using Western blotting and expressed relative to β-actin. Results Following EA, area-under-the-curve (AUC) for glucose was reduced (7340±291 vs 10 705±1474 mg/dL/min, p=0.049) and FFA levels significantly lower at 30/60 min in the SIIR+EA versus SIIR groups. Similar effects on glucose AUC were seen during the ICT (5568±275 vs 7136±594 mg/dL/min, p&lt;0.05) and igVTT (11 498±1398 vs 16 652±1217 mg/dL/min, p&lt;0.01).

Conclusions EA decreased the FFA level and increased insulin sensitivity in SIIR rats. Further clinical studies are needed to determine whether EA is an effective alternative treatment for the reduction of insulin resistance in patients requiring chronic use of dexamethasone.",

De qi sensations were rated to measure their psychophysical responses.Overall de qi scores did not differ by gender, although females reported greater intensity of aching (p=0.04). Acupuncture activated the hippocampus, thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate body, claustrum, cingulate gyrus, and culmen in males, and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus, caudate body, insula, fusiform gyrus, cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus in females. The middle/medial frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate body, uvula, and cerebellar tonsil were activated when data from all subjects were combined. Relative to males, females exhibited greater brain activation in the right-sided postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, precuneus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, declive, middle occipital gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus.The neural effects of GB34 acupuncture might differ between males and females because different brain structures were modulated in response to acupuncture. This potential gender effect should be taken into account in future clinical research. We also revealed that the caudate body was activated by GB34 acupuncture in both males and females and may represent a major target of GB34 acupuncture.KMC IRB 0861-06.",

    "abstract": "Objective Few studies have investigated the predictors of the specific and non-specific effects of acupuncture. The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine patient characteristics that may predict a better treatment response to acupuncture for insomnia. Methods We pooled the data of three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acupuncture for insomnia to examine sociodemographic variables, clinical characteristics, baseline sleep-wake variables, and treatment expectancy in relation to acupuncture response. Subjects with an improvement in insomnia severity index (ISI) scores of ≥8 points from baseline to 1 week post-treatment were classified as responders. Factors were compared between responders and non-responders, and also by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 116 subjects who received traditional needle acupuncture were included, of which 37 (31.9%) were classified as responders. Acupuncture responders had a higher educational level (p&lt;0.01) and higher baseline ISI score (p&lt;0.05), compared to non-responders. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the number of years spent in full-time education remained significant as a predictor of treatment response (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.38, p&lt;0.01). Conclusions Consistent with previous studies, our data suggest that the response to acupuncture is difficult to predict. Although the predictive power of educational level is weak overall, our findings provide potentially valuable information that could be built upon in further research (including a larger sample size), and may help to inform patient selection for the treatment of chronic insomnia with acupuncture in the future.

We investigated whether acupuncture could be used to manage limb oedema in women after breast cancer surgery. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and four Chinese databases were electronically searched for papers published through November 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for BCRL were included. Results: In total, six RCTs with 318 patients were identified. The main analysis revealed a positive overall effect of acupuncture intervention on pre/post-treatment differences in the diameter of the elbow joint, reductions in upper limb lymphoedema and effectiveness index based on arm measurement data in patients with breast cancer. Two studies evaluating the outcome of acupuncture on the diameter of the elbow joint found a significant reduction in diameter between the acupuncture and control groups (weighted mean difference (WMD) 6 cm, 95% CI 5.11 to 6.89 cm; P&lt;0.001). The same two studies investigated the effect of acupuncture on upper limb lymphoedema reduction and found a significant difference between the acupuncture and control groups (risk ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.67; P&lt;0.001). Two other studies used the effectiveness index to assess the arm and found a significant difference between the acupuncture and control groups (WMD 23.34, 95% CI 10.74 to 35.94; P&lt;0.001). The fifth study used bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy to assess lymphoedema at several points on the arm before and after acupuncture; this study also reported a significant reduction in lymphoedema. The sixth study reported no significant difference in bioimpedance between the groups. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis and systematic review suggests that acupuncture is effective at reducing BCRL in patients after breast cancer treatment.",

Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Sixteen patients who had suffered a stroke and presented with shoulder pain were randomly assigned to receive rehabilitation alone or rehabilitation combined with DN. Both groups received a neurorehabilitation session including modulatory interventions targeting the central nervous system. Patients in the DN group also received a single session of DN over active TrPs in the shoulder musculature. A numerical pain rating scale (NPRS, 0–10) was used to asses post-needling induced pain at 1 min, 24 h, and 72 h after needling. Shoulder pain (NPRS, 0–10) was assessed at baseline, and 3 and 7 days after DN in both groups. Results: Five (62%) patients receiving TrP-DN reported post-needling induced pain. Post hoc analysis found that post-needling induced pain decreased significantly at 24 and 72 h (both p &lt; 0.001) after DN. Patients receiving TrP-DN plus rehabilitation exhibited greater decreases in shoulder pain intensity at 3 days (Δ = −4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −5.8 to −2.6) and 7 days (Δ = −4.3, 95% CI = −5.9 to −2.7) after the intervention compared with those receiving rehabilitation alone (all p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This trial found that 50% of stroke patients receiving DN experienced post-needling induced pain, a side effect that almost disappeared 72 h after the intervention without any additional therapeutic action. In addition, the inclusion of TrP-DN into a rehabilitation session was effective at decreasing shoulder pain in these patients.",

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL up to 19 April 2018 and included relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using the inverse variance method with random-effects model. Prespecified hypotheses were tested in meta-regression to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Statistical software packages used were RevMan 5.3.5 and Stata 14.0. Results: Thirty-three RCTs were included (n=2503 patients). Compared with non-acupuncture interventions, acupuncture produced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD −1.76 kg, 95% CI −2.22 to −1.30, I 2 =77%; moderate quality), body mass index (WMD −1.13 kg/m 2 , 95% CI −1.38 to −0.88, I 2 =85%; low quality) and waist circumference (WMD −2.42 cm, 95% CI −3.22 to −1.62, I 2 =75%; moderate quality). Acupuncture plus lifestyle intervention resulted in a greater reduction in body weight than acupuncture alone (MD −1.94 kg, 95% CI −3.17 to −0.70). Acupuncture also led to a greater reduction in total cholesterol (WMD −12.87 mg/dL, 95% CI −22.17 to −3.57, I 2 =87%; very low quality) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD −13.52 mg/dL, 95% CI −21.47 to −5.58, I 2 =74%; low quality).

Methods: The following electronic databases were systematically searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chongqing VIP database. The primary outcome was the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) score. Two independent investigators screened for eligible clinical trials.

Results: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 904 participants were included in the study.

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared to placebo acupuncture for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A search was conducted in seven English-language biomedical databases from their inception to 3 April 2019 to identify studies evaluating acupuncture as an adjunct to IVF treatment. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with placebo acupuncture using a non-invasive placebo acupuncture device in women undergoing a fresh or frozen IVF cycle were eligible, as were studies that tested placebo acupuncture as the intervention. Outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, live birth rate and adverse events. Results: Eight RCTs involving 3607 women were included. Studies were judged to be low risk for most of the risk of bias domains. Acupuncture around the time of embryo transfer was not significantly different to placebo acupuncture in terms of the clinical pregnancy rate (6 RCTs, 2473 women, risk ratio (RR) = 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88, 1.11), I 2 = 51%, moderate certainty evidence), ongoing pregnancy rate (4 RCTs, 1459 women, RR = 0.88 (95% CI = 0.75, 1.02), I 2 = 50%, moderate certainty evidence), miscarriage rate (4 RCTs, 502 women, RR = 1.23 (95% CI = 0.89, 1.71), I 2 = 30%, high certainty evidence) or live birth rate (4 RCTs, 1835 women, RR = 0.87 (95% CI = 0.75, 1.01), I 2 = 0%, high certainty evidence). Outcomes with placebo acupuncture were not significantly different to usual care. Adverse events relating to acupuncture, such as discomfort and bruising, were mild to moderate. Conclusion: Acupuncture administered around the time of embryo transfer did not have a statistically significant effect on IVF outcomes compared with placebo acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "To explore the effects and mechanism of action of electroacupuncture (EA) in a rat model of pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Female offspring of Sprague-Dawley rats receiving dihydrotestosterone (DHT) during pregnancy (days 16-19), as a model of prenatal androgenization, were divided randomly into three groups: model group (M), EA group, and sham acupuncture (SA) group (n = 8 each). A normal (N) group comprising female offspring of healthy pregnant rats not receiving DHT (n = 8) was added. EA was administered at CV6 and bilateral SP6/ST36 with 2 Hz frequency and 2 mA intensity. SA consisted of superficial needling at different locations without electrical stimulation.EA improved the disturbed estrous cycles, while it could not be concluded that SA was effective in this respect. EA improved ovarian morphology including the number of corpora lutea and area of the ovary, whereas SA did not. However, both EA and SA attenuated the increased luteinizing hormone and decreased estradiol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels in the serum of PCOS model rats. Levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone did not significantly differ between groups. EA and SA alleviated the upregulation of kisspeptin protein and mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and kisspeptin protein level in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). No differences were found between groups in protein or mRNA expression of dynorphin (DYN) or neurokinin B (NKB) in the hypothalamus. Co-expression of kisspeptin, NKB, and DYN were observed in ARC. The GnRH level in the median eminence decreased and could be rescued by EA and SA. Intriguingly, kisspeptin levels in the granulosa cells of the ovary decreased in the model group and could be rescued by EA but not SA. Levels of kisspeptin, NKB, and DYN protein and mRNA in the ovary did not differ between any groups.Both EA and SA appeared to improve symptoms of PCOS at puberty by modulating the kisspeptin system in the hypothalamus. EA also had an effect on ovarian kisspeptin expression and a more comprehensive effect with respect to improving PCOS at puberty than SA.",

Motor impairments are the most prevalent, causing an impact on activities of daily life. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a session of dry needling (DN) applied to the upper extremity muscles on the sensorimotor function, hypertonia, and quality of life of persons with chronic stroke. Methods: A randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial was performed. Participants were randomly assigned into an intervention group that received a single session DN in the biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, extensor digitorum, adductor pollicis and triceps brachii muscles, or into a control group that received the same treatment but with a sham DN intervention. Treatment outcomes included the Fugl–Meyer Assessment Scale for the upper extremity, the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale, and the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. Measurements were carried out before, immediately after, and 14 days after intervention. Results: Twenty-three persons participated in the study. Significant differences between groups were observed after the intervention in the total wrist–hand motor score (p = 0.023) and sensorimotor score (p = 0.022), for hypertonia in the elbow extensors both after treatment (p = 0.002) and at follow-up (p = 0.018), and in quality of life at follow-up (p = 0.030). Conclusions: A single session of DN improved total wrist–hand motor function and total sensorimotor function in persons with chronic stroke immediately after treatment, as well as quality of life 2 weeks after treatment.

Hypertonia was measured using the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS), and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the EuroQoL 5-dimension questionnaire. Data regarding the effects and costs of physiotherapy were presented by calculating the mean and 95% confidence interval. The health outcomes were evaluated considering the rate of responders to the treatment based on the MMAS. Spanish preference weights were used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were calculated to determine the economic value of DN.Eighty patients with stroke in the subacute stage of recovery were selected to participate in this study. Based on the rate of responders, the ICER of the DN group was very low. Despite the sensitivity analysis performed, the results of the ICUR were not encouraging.Cost-effectiveness with responder rate results were favourable for the DN group and were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis according to levels of care. In addition, our findings revealed that 4 weeks of treatment could be more cost-effective than 8 weeks. DN treatment of the upper extremity appears to be cost-effective based on the rate of responders measured using the MMAS scale.",

    "abstract": "Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway.Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels.Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA.EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

    "abstract": "Improving synaptic plasticity is a good way to alleviate neuropathic pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is currently used worldwide to treat this disease, but its specific mechanisms of action need further investigation. Evidence has suggested that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays an important role in promoting nerve regeneration and can promote the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).In this study, we examined the effects of EA on synaptic plasticity and its underlying mechanism.A spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rat model was established. NSC37204 (a specific inhibitor of bFGF) was used to determine the relationship between bFGF and putative EA-mediated improvements in synaptic plasticity. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were assessed to evaluate hyperalgesia in rats with SNL. Tissue morphology was detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Nissl staining, while neural plasticity and its molecular mechanisms were examined by Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), dual-label immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.We found that EA improved synaptic plasticity, consistent with higher levels of expression of bFGF and VEGF. Contrary to the beneficial effects of EA, NSC37204 promoted synaptic reconstruction. Furthermore, EA-induced improvements in the neurobehavioral state and improved synaptic plasticity were blocked by NSC37204, consistent with lower expression levels of bFGF and VEGF.These findings indicate that EA suppresses SNL-induced neuropathic pain by improving synaptic plasticity via upregulation of bFGF expression.",

Acupuncture improves dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but, to the best of our knowledge, has not been tested in AECOPD. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of true acupuncture added to standard of care (SOC), as compared with both sham procedure plus SOC and SOC only, for the treatment of AECOPD among inpatients. Methods: This double-blinded randomized sham-controlled trial was set in a tertiary hospital in Israel. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of AECOPD were assigned to true acupuncture with SOC, sham procedure with SOC or SOC only. The primary outcome was dyspnea improvement as measured daily by the validated modified Borg (mBorg) scale. Secondary outcomes included improvement of other patient-reported outcomes and physiologic features, as well as duration of hospitalization and treatment failure. Acupuncture-related side effects were evaluated by the validated Acup-AE questionnaire. Results: Seventy-two patients were randomized: 26 to acupuncture treatment, 24 to sham and 22 to SOC only arms. Baseline characteristics were similar in the three groups. A statistically significant difference in dyspnea intensity was found from the first day of evaluation after treatment (p = 0.014) until day 3 after treatment. Similar results were found for sputum production, but no statistical significance was found when comparing physiologic features between the three arms. Acupuncture was not associated with adverse events. Conclusion: Acupuncture seems to be efficacious in the treatment of AECOPD among inpatients hospitalized in internal medicine departments.

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse eﬀect of anticancer agents with virtually no effective treatment. Safe and effective therapies are needed urgently. Acupuncture shows therapeutic possibilities in this regard but needs to be further evaluated.A systematic search was conducted in seven databases from their inception to April 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on acupuncture/electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of CIPN were included. Revman 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis if there was no significant heterogeneity. Otherwise, qualitative analysis was utilized.Nine studies involving 582 patients were included in this review. Most of the studies exhibited unclear risk of bias because some details were not mentioned. As the clinical heterogeneity was significant, qualitative analysis was performed to describe nerve conduction velocity, effective rate for motor neuropathy, pain scores, quality of life and adverse events. Meta-analysis was performed on four studies to analyze the effective rate for sensory neuropathy due to inconspicuous heterogeneity. The results indicated that acupuncture may generate a better effect on sensory neuropathy than vitamin B (risk ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval = 1.31-1.95, I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001). The efficacy of EA plus glutathione (GSH) appeared to be better than that of GSH alone in alleviating sensory neurotoxicity and in improving nerve conduction velocity. Acupuncture plus methylcobalamin showed more favorable effects than methylcobalamin alone in relieving neuralgia, restoring nerve conduction velocity and improving quality of life. In terms of pain relief and improved CIPN-specific quality of life, acupuncture plus standard care was better than standard care alone. In terms of pain relief, EA was more effective than usual care.Acupuncture may be effective and safe in the treatment of CIPN according to the analyzed studies. However, more studies with higher methodological quality are warranted in order to be able to draw firmer conclusions. Future rigorous RCTs will be necessary to confirm the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for CIPN.",

Acupuncture is known to increase dopamine secretion and is widely used to treat myopia clinically. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if acupuncture inhibits myopia progression in form deprived Syrian hamsters by inducing rises in dopamine content that in turn suppress inflammasome activation. Methods: Acupuncture was applied at LI4 and Taiyang every other day for 21 days. The levels of molecules associated with the dopamine signaling pathway, inflammatory signaling pathway and inflammasome activation were determined. A dopamine agonist (apomorphine) was used to evaluate if activation of the dopaminergic signaling pathway suppresses myopia progression by inhibiting inflammasome activation in primary retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. A dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) inhibitor (SCH39166) was also administered to the hamsters. Results: Acupuncture inhibited myopia development by increasing dopamine levels and activating the D1R signaling pathway. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, leucine-rich repeat (LRR)- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation was inhibited by activation of the D1R signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that acupuncture inhibits myopia development by suppressing inflammation, which is initiated by activation of the dopamine—D1R signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The need for skin disinfection before insertion of an acupuncture needle is controversial and there is no specific research on this topic. However research and observations on the effect of, and the need for, skin disinfection before injections forms a good analogy of acupuncture. Whilst micro-organisms present on the surface of the skin are accessible to disinfection, those located under the surface in ducts, glands and follicles are out of reach and can be inoculated into the sterile tissues below by needle insertion. Fortunately, the bacteria resident on the skin have a low potential to cause infection if host immunity is not severely impaired or compromised by the long-term presence of foreign material, such as a surgical stitch. Disinfection of clean skin before injection is not generally considered necessary and observations of lack of infection following injections without prior skin disinfection support this; however, contamination by micro-organisms not normally resident on skin can pose a higher risk of infection. If skin is visibly soiled, it should be washed and if needle insertion is near an infected or contaminated site, it should be disinfected with alcohol. Practitioner hand hygiene between patients is important, even if gloves are worn. Hands should be washed with soap or detergent and water, or an alcohol handrub can be used if hands are physically clean.",

    "abstract": "We report a prospective randomised trial of acupuncture given to 44 patients with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee awaiting total knee joint replacement. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, group A receiving acupuncture to the most affected knee only and group B receiving acupuncture to both knees. Acupuncture was given to four local points around the knee and one distal point. The local points were Spleen 9 (Yinlinquan, SP9), Spleen 10 (Xuehai, SP10), Stomach 34 (Liangqui, ST34), and Stomach 36 (Zusanli, ST36). The distal point was Large Intestine 4 (Hegu, LI4) on the first web space of the ipsilateral hand. A blinded observer assessed knee function before starting treatment, and at the end of two and six months. Analysis of the results showed a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, and this improvement was sustained for six months. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. In conclusion, unilateral acupuncture is as effective as bilateral acupuncture in increasing function and reducing the pain associated with OA of the knee. This trial is not able to distinguish the specific from the non-specific effects of the treatment.",

The service offers acupuncture, spinal injection procedures, osteopathy and a range of other interventions for patients whose back pain has not responded to conservative management. This section of the report focuses on injection procedures for lumbar facet joint and sacroiliac joint pain, which have been shown to be the cause of chronic low back pain in 16-40% and 13-19% of patients respectively. Diagnosis relies on the use of intra-articular or sensory nerve block injections with local anaesthetic. Possible treatments following diagnosis include intra-articular corticosteroid, radiofrequency denervation (for facet joint pain) or ligament prolotherapy injections (for sacroiliac joint pain). The results of several hospital audits are reported. At six month follow up, 50% of 38 patients undergoing radiofrequency denervation following diagnostic blocks for facet joint pain had improved by more than 50%, compared to 29% of 34 patients treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Sixty three per cent of 19 patients undergoing prolotherapy following diagnostic block injection for sacroiliac joint pain had improved at six months, compared to 33% of 33 who had intra-articular corticosteroid. Both radiofrequency denervation and sacroiliac prolotherapy showed good long-term outcomes at one year.",

After the subjects had been at rest for about 20 minutes, acupuncture needling using the sparrow-pecking method, in which the needle is moved vertically lifting and thrusting, was performed for one minute at the Shousanli point on the right forearm (LI10). The procedure was carried out with the subjects in a supine position and in a sitting position. The position for stimulation of each subject, either supine or sitting, was selected at random, and on different days. The results showed that the average heart rate reduction associated with stimulation in supine subjects was 3.6 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- standard error (SE)) beats per minute (bpm), while that for sitting subjects was about 7.0 +/- 1.07 (mean +/- SE) bpm, indicating that stimulation reduces heart rate to a greater degree in subjects who are sitting (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test). These results would be consistent with a mechanism involving reduced sympathetic drive to the heart, as sympathetic nerve activity has more influence on the heart rate in the sitting than in the supine position.",

This observational study was conducted in preparation for a randomised controlled trial. Methods We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee. The patients received weekly acupuncture treatment, and related techniques, from November 1997 to November 2000. We recorded: socio-demographic data; measures of effectiveness, including intensity and frequency of pain; the daily dose of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication; the degree of incapacity; and sleep disorders caused by pain in the knee. Results The 563 patients who presented were mainly female (88%) with an average age of 65 years (±10.7); the average age of the male patients was 67 years (±11.8). The condition in most patients (95%) was chronic: 54% had the condition for 5-10 years and a further 23% for more than 10 years. Of the total, 85 (15%) abandoned treatment and were excluded from the evaluation, while 75% of the remainder achieved a reduction in pain of 45% or more. This study is intended to form the basis for a subsequent controlled clinical trial of the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Conclusion The degree of pain relief experienced by patients from acupuncture justifies a more rigorous study.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture was first used in China, probable about 2000 years ago. When acupuncture first arrived in the West in the 17th century, the principles which the Chinese had used to explain its actions were at variance with current scientific knowledge of the body's structure and function. This led to the rejection of acupuncture by the medical profession in the UK, although individual practitioners adopted it with enthusiasm, usually needling the point of maximal tenderness to treat musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture was more generally accepted in France and Germany, where the pioneering British physician Felix Mann encountered it in the 1950s. He then taught acupuncture to other medical practitioners and organised regular meetings in London, from which the British Medical Acupuncture Society, BMAS, emerged in 1980. The tradition of biannual scientific meetings has continued since then. The Society has many connections with prominent acupuncturists internationally and is a founder member of the International Council of Medical Acupuncture and Related Techniques (ICMART), and has hosted two world congresses. The Society was involved in standardisation of the meridian nomenclature published in 1990. The Society's scientific journal, Acupuncture in Medicine, was founded in 1981 and has gained international recognition, being indexed on several databases. The Society has established regular teaching courses at different levels, which lead to professional qualifications of Certificate and Diploma. The membership is now open to different health professionals, has grown steadily and now stands at nearly 2500. The Society is administered from offices in Cheshire and London. Many individual members have contributed to the Society's characteristic Western ‘medical’ approach to acupuncture in which needling is seen as a form of neuromuscular stimulation that owes little to traditional meridians or points. The Society has shown a particular interest in acupuncture for myofascial trigger point pain. Members of the Society have contributed to the evidence base of acupuncture with several books, clinical trials and reviews. The Society is optimistic that it will have an increasingly important role in promoting the use and scientific evaluation of acupuncture for the public benefit.",

Methods Participating physicians were recruited whose qualifications met or surpassed those of physicians currently accredited for providing acupuncture by state health funding agencies in Germany. Semi-standardised treatment strategies for acupuncture and minimal acupuncture were developed in a consensus process with acupuncture experts. A total of 270 patients suffering from episodic or chronic tension-type headache were randomised to 12 sessions of semi-standardised acupuncture (three predefined ‘basic’ points, recommendations for additional points given, but individual choice of additional points possible), standardised minimal acupuncture (superficial needling of at least 5 of 10 predefined, bilateral, distant non-acupuncture points) or a waiting list. Forty two physicians, trained and experienced in acupuncture, from 28 centres in Germany participated in the trial. Results The median duration of acupuncture training of trial physicians was 500 hours (range 140 to 1350 hours). Physicians had 10 (&lt;1 to 25) years acupuncture experience. The three ‘basic’ points (GB20, GB21 and LR3) were treated in 96%, 82% and 97% of sessions, respectively. Frequently treated optional points included LI4 (67%), SP6 (50%) and ST36 (46%). Ten of the 42 physicians stated that they would have treated patients differently outside the trial. The trial found a significant effect of acupuncture over waiting list but not over minimal acupuncture. Conclusions In general, trial physicians complied well with the predefined interventions. A relevant minority of participating trial physicians stated that they would have treated patients differently outside the trial.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a major clinical problem that causes great suffering for the individual and incurs costs for society. Accurate assessment and evaluation of perceived pain is necessary for diagnosis, for choice of treatment, and for the evaluation of treatment efficacy. The assessment of an individual's pain is a challenge since pain is a subjective, multidimensional experience, and assessment is based on the person's own self-report. The results are often varied, possibly due to inter-individual variation, but also in relation to gender and aetiology. A gold standard for pain assessment is still lacking, but rating scales, questionnaires, and methods derived from psychophysical concepts, such as threshold assessments and perceptual matching, are used. In the evaluation of pain and associated variables, both systematic and individual variation should be taken into account, as should pain-associated symptoms. Recommendations for pain treatment should be based on the patient's specific needs. Therefore, it is important to assess the level of perceived pain taking individual variation into account. The methods used should preferably have proved to be useful in randomised controlled trials, and analysis of pain assessment should consider its non-metric properties. In the future, the use of studies with a naturalistic protocol together with individual assessment of individual pain responses could increase the internal and external validity.",

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular dysfunction often represents a major therapeutic problem in a dental practice. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that acupuncture may be useful in the treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction. However, most studies have been performed in university settings. The aims of this study were to determine if the results of acupuncture treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction in general dental practice are comparable to the results obtained in previous studies in university clinics, and whether the treatment approach differs from that used in previous studies.The case reports submitted by 15 dentists applying for the diploma of the British Dental Acupuncture Society were combined into one audit. All dentists were informed before submitting the forms that the data might be used for scientific purposes. The criteria for Pain Syndrome Dysfunction were used as inclusion criteria. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain intensity before and after acupuncture treatment. The acupuncture points and technique used were recorded for each treatment.A total number of 70 case reports were received. Ten patients were excluded, as they did not fulfil the criteria. The remaining 60 patients (50 female) fulfilled an average of 3.2 of the Pain Syndrome Dysfunction criteria, out of a possible five. Their mean age was 40.6 years (range 14-68). The average duration of temporomandibular dysfunction was 32 months (range 1-180). The patients received a mean of 3.4 treatments, each treatment lasting on average 12 minutes. The dentists used only manual stimulation, and mainly acupuncture points over the temporomandibular joint and in the masticatory muscles, points on the neck, and additional relaxing points. The mean pain scores were 7.35 (SD 1.52) before treatment and 2.67 (SD 0.58) after treatment (P < 0.001). A beneficial effect was observed in 85% with an average reduction in the pain intensity of 75%.This audit shows that the results of using acupuncture in the treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction in a general dental practice are comparable to those obtained in clinical studies in university settings. Also the therapeutic approach of using acupuncture is similar. Thus, acupuncture is a simple, relatively safe and potentially efficacious and useful technique in the management of temporomandibular dysfunction in a general dental practice.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic benefits of acupuncture for chronic pain patients have been clearly identified in recent clinical trials. Underlying mechanisms of acupuncture action mediated by endogenous opioids have been well demonstrated. The existence of pain inhibitory systems in the central nervous system has also been clarified and acupuncture seems to be a potent stimulus for activating the analgesic systems, although the pain mechanisms in acute and chronic states are essentially different. On the other hand, the exact nature of the acupuncture point still remains unclear. Here, we propose a key role of polymodal receptors (PMR) in acupuncture and moxibustion and offer a rational explanation of the acupuncture point as a sensitised PMR. Moxibustion (burning of moxa) therapy has been shown by medical historians to predate the use of acupuncture, and the meridian theory developed in association with moxibustion treatment. A variety of sensory receptors are activated by acupuncture and/or moxibustion, but there are very few that can be excited by both stimuli. PMRs are one of the most promising candidates. The functional characteristics of PMRs correspond with those of acupuncture action in the periphery; and tender or trigger points, one of the primitive features of acupuncture points, are assumed to be the sites of sensitised PMRs. Diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) is proposed as a possible mechanism of immediate action of acupuncture, and inputs for the development of DNIC seem to be the PMRs. In our experimental model, repeated eccentric contractions of muscle produced local tenderness at the palpable band and induced a typical referred pain pattern on application of pressure. Repeated indomethacin injections inhibited the production of the experimental trigger point. These lines of evidence suggest that the acupuncture points are the sites where the PMRs are sensitised and that such conditions might be repeatedly produced by various biomechanical stressors, insufficient blood supply and metabolic products.",

Intra-articular injection of mono-iodoacetic acid (MIA) was performed to induce knee osteoarthritis. Indirect moxibustion was applied to the lateral aspect of the knee joint every other day for 28 days (14 treatments). Weight bearing of the hind legs was measured directly by the downward pressure applied to footplates, using an Incapacitance Tester. Morphine was injected for testing the validity of weight bearing as a pain measure, and naloxone was used to examine the participation of endogenous opioids in the mechanism of moxibustion analgesia. Data were analysed by calculating the area under the curve. Results Injection of MIA significantly reduced weight bearing. No analgesic effects of moxibustion were observed during the initial 7 days (unpaired t test, P=0.83). Continued moxibustion treatments increased weight bearing at the 14th day significantly, and this effect continued until the end of the experiment on the 28th day (P&lt;0.05). A single moxibustion treatment had no immediate effect on weight bearing. The analgesia due to the cumulative effect of moxibustion was antagonised by naloxone injection. Morphine injection in control MIA injected rats increased weight bearing to the normal range, confirming the validity of the measurements. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of repeated moxibustion treatments for pain relief in experimental knee osteoarthritis and suggest the existence of sustained inhibitory modulation by endogenous opioids in the moxibustion group.",

The aim of the present study was to compare their relative effectiveness on promoting psychological functioning and quality of sleep. Methods Consecutive patients (n=144) referred to a physiotherapist for treatment of chronic nociceptive pain in the neck or low back for more than three months, aged 18–70, were alternately allocated to an intramuscular acupuncture group (n=59), to a periosteal acupuncture group (n=55), and, for the latter part of the study, to an information control group (n=30). Eight treatments were administered during a five week period with two optional treatments after one month. All patients were encouraged to stay active. Psychological functioning was estimated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and quality of sleep with a visual analogue scale. All estimations were performed prior to treatment, one week after the end of treatment, and one, three and six months after end of treatment. Non-parametric statistics were used. Results There were no significant differences between the acupuncture groups, nor between the acupuncture and control groups during the treatment period.

Methods A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. Results Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.",

Methods Electrostimulation of acupuncture points was performed on 12 critically ill patients requiring sedation for mechanical ventilation. Electrostimulation was applied by point surface electrodes at LI4, ST36, HT7 and LR3 points for 20 minutes every hour for 12 hours using dense dispersed mode with a current frequency of 10–100Hz and maximum intensity of 10mA. All patients were sedated with propofol and alfentanil as required. The dose of propofol was reduced by 10mg/hour provided the patient remained sedated according to our guidelines. Sedation and analgesia scores, dose of sedative and analgesics drugs, respiratory rate, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and compliance with the ventilator were recorded before electrostimulation of acupuncture points, and hourly thereafter for 12 hours.

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation is used to promote bone reunion, and is most effective when applied directly to the fracture site.To examine the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on the healing process of tibia fracture in a rat model.Thirty 12-week-old male Wistar rats underwent unilateral open osteotomies of the tibiae. The rats were then assigned randomly to three groups: EA group (n=10), sham group (n=10) and control group (n=10). In the EA group, a cathodal electrode was connected to an acupuncture needle percutaneously penetrated directly at the surgery site, while an acupuncture needle inserted at 15 mm proximal to the surgery site was used as an anodal electrode. EA (50 Hz, 20 μA, 20 min) was performed daily for 3 weeks. In the sham group the acupuncture needles were inserted at the same sites but no electrical stimulation was given and in the control group, no treatment was given. The response was evaluated at 1, 3, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery by radiographic, macroscopic and mechanical examinations.The EA group showed accelerated bone healing (EA group 29.92+/-4.55 mm², sham group 26.46+/-5.21 mm², control group 26.19+/-2.81 mm², p<0.05 at 3 weeks) and accretion of the callus (radiographic evaluation: EA group 35.66+/-4.37 mm², sham group 32.60+/-5.73 mm², control group 29.72+/-6.39 mm², p<0.05 at 6 weeks) compared with the other groups.

Objective To compare the effectiveness of a new technique of individualised ‘sensitivity elimination’ dose versus a standardised 15 min dose in the treatment of LDH. Methods This study was a multicentre (four centres in China), randomised, controlled trial with two parallel arms (group A, individualised sensitivity elimination dose; group B, standardised dose). The most heat-sensitised acupuncture point from the triangle bound by BL25 and GV2 was selected. Both groups received 18 sessions over 2 weeks. The outcome was evaluated by Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (M-JOA) score before and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up examination. All main analyses were by intention to treat. Results A total of 96 patients were included. A Significant difference of total M-JOA score was noted between the groups at weeks 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.05). Significant differences were also evident during the follow-up period (p&lt;0.01). The mean duration of moxibustion was 42.7±5.4 (range, 22–58) minutes in the experimental group. Conclusions The effectiveness of the individualised sensitivity elimination dose appears superior to the standardised dose in the treatment of LDH. Only 15 min moxibustion in the conventional dose group seemed insufficient to elicit the satisfactory clinical effects obtained by heat-sensitive moxibustion therapy. However, in view of some limitations of this study further research is necessary before this can be stated conclusively. Trial Registration Controlled Clinical Trials: ChiCTR-TRC-09000602.",

The present study aimed to identify functional brain response to active acupuncture in patients with unilateral ischaemic stroke using functional MRI (fMRI).A total of 10 patients aged 47-65 years with left hemispheric ischaemic stroke received single-session manual acupuncture at the TE5 point of the affected (right) forearm. A 6-min tactile control procedure in which an acupuncture needle tip was alternately touched and removed from the skin at the acupuncture point for 30 s each was performed first, followed by active acupuncture in a blocking paradigm consisting of six 30-s twist blocks of rotation interspersed between six 30-s blocks of rest. A whole brain scan was simultaneously conducted on a 3.0-T imager. Activated and deactivated brain regions during tactile stimulation and active acupuncture relative to rest were obtained via group analysis.Compared to tactile stimulation, needling with twist manipulation modulated many more widespread brain areas. All the brain areas activated and deactivated by active acupuncture relative to tactile stimulation were distributed in the primary sensorimotor and medial frontal cortex of the unaffected, but not the affected hemisphere.Active acupuncture results in lateralisation of functional cerebral response to the contralateral unaffected hemisphere in patients with unilateral stroke. This lateralisation may represent an effect of acupuncture in enhancing a compensatory process by redistributing functions into the intact cortex, particularly in the unaffected hemisphere.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of EA treatment in a TBI rat model. Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation, TBI control, TBI+EA treated for 30 min or TBI+EA treated for 60 min. The animals were treated with EA immediately after TBI. The EA was applied at acupuncture points GV20, GV26, LI4 and KI1 with a dense-dispersed wave, frequencies of 0.2 and 1 Hz, and amplitude of 1 mA for 30 or 60 min. Regional blood flow, cell infarction volume, extent of neuronal apoptosis, expression of cell apoptosis-associated factor transforming growth-interacting factor (TGIF) were studied, and functional outcome was assessed by running speed test. All tests except regional blood flow were performed 72 h after TBI onset. Results Immediately after TBI, compared with the TBI control groups, the regional blood flow was significantly increased by EA treatment for 60 min. Compared with the TBI controls 72 h after TBI, the TBI-induced run speed impairment, infarction volume, neuronal apoptosis and apoptosis-associated TGIF expression were significantly improved by EA treatment. Conclusions The treatment of TBI in the acute stage with EA for 60 min could increase the regional blood flow and attenuate the levels of TGIF in the injured cortex, might lead to a decrease in neuronal apoptosis and cell infarction volume, and might represent one mechanism by which functional recovery may occur.",

Review Manager V.5.3 was employed for data analysis. Results The literature search identified 186 papers, of which only four of met the inclusion criteria: two for allergic rhinitis (AR) and two for asthma. High and unclear risk of bias existed across all the included studies. The findings demonstrated that acupressure greater effects on the relief of nasal symptoms of AR compared with 1% ephedrine nasal drop plus thermal therapy. With either Western medicine or Chinese herbal medicine as a cointervention, one study indicated that acupressure plus salbutamol was led to a significantly greater improvement of pulmonary function for patients with asthma compared with salbutamol only. However, the remaining two studies indentified no significant differences in any outcome measures between the two groups. Conclusions No reliable conclusions regarding the effects of acupressure on AR and asthma could be drawn by this review due to the small number of available trials with significant heterogeneity of study design and high/unclear risk of bias. Further, more rigorously designed RCTs are needed. Acupressure seems safe for symptomatic relief of AR and asthma, although larger studies are required to be able to robustly confirm its safety.

Accordingly, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of English and Chinese randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture use in the ED. Methods Four English databases (Embase, PubMed, AMED and CENTRAL) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang) were systematically searched using the keywords ‘acupuncture’ and ‘emergency department’, followed by a bibliographic search of references. The data were extracted and assessed by two independent authors. RCTs were selected based on pre-defined criteria. Data were extracted and a risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The quality of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results In total, 1461 articles were screened and six RCTs involving 651 patients were included. For various acute pain conditions, acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture, more effective than intravenous morphine, comparable to conventional ED treatment, and superior to standard ED care alone when used on an adjuvant basis; however, the overall level of evidence was low. Studies that applied acupuncture in hypertension and cardiac arrest were deemed to be at high risk of bias, and the level of evidence for these outcomes was very low. No major adverse events were reported in the included studies. Conclusion There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support the use of acupuncture in the ED. Multicentre RCTs with rigorous designs are warranted.",

The TBI+MA group received manual acupuncture at GV20, GV26, GV16 through GV15, and bilateral LI4. mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB and protein in the rat cortices was quantified using real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analyses.The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) scores of the TBI+MA group were improved compared with baseline scores 12 hours after modelling, and improved at 7d and 14d compared with the TBI group (P<0.05), while the score of the TBI group did not improve until 14d compared to baseline. mRNA and protein expression of TLR2, TLR4 and NF-κB in the TBI group were higher than the normal group at 3d (P<0.05), reached a peak at 7d, then began to decrease at 14d. mRNA and protein expression of TLR2, TLR4 and NF-κB were higher in the TBI+MA group compared with the TBI group at 3d (P<0.05), were significantly down-regulated at 7d (P<0.01), and decreased to normal levels at 14d.Acupuncture has a bidirectional regulatory effect on the TLR2/4-NF-κB signalling pathway-related genes TLR2, TLR4 and NF-κB in the TBI rat cortex, promoting their expression in the early stage and inhibiting it in the later stage.",

    "abstract": "Background Warm needle acupuncture (WNA) is commonly used in primary osteoporosis (OP) management in China. The evidence of its effectiveness needs to be systematically reviewed. Objective The aim of the meta-analysis was to evaluate whether using WNA alone or combined with conventional medicine benefits primary OP. Methods PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and VIP databases were searched from their inception through 30 June 2016. RCTs applying WNA independently or as an adjunct to conventional medicine, compared with conventional medicine alone, were included. Primary outcomes were bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and greater trochanter. The secondary outcome was chronic pain measured by VAS score. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan V.5.3 software. Results Nine RCTs involving 572 participants were included. When WNA was used as an adjunct to conventional medicine, meta-analysis revealed a statistical difference in favour of increasing BMD of the lumbar vertebrae (mean difference (MD)=0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08, P&lt;0.001). WNA increased BMD of the femoral neck (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21, P&lt;0.001) and greater trochanter (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.15, P&lt;0.001) when used alone, and additionally decreased VAS scores (MD=−1.10, 95% CI −1.14 to −1.06, P&lt;0.001) when used as an adjunct to conventional medicine. However, the safety of WNA was not specifically reported. Conclusions WNA may have beneficial effects on BMD and VAS scores of patients with primary OP. However, all included trials were at high risk of bias and of low quality. Further rigorous studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of WNA for primary OP treatment.",

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of ear acupuncture for obesity on the depression of obese women. Methods After baseline testing, 30 eligible patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt;29.9 kg/m 2 were included. The Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) was used to assess changes in depression. BMI was also measured. Patients had six ear acupuncture sessions, every 15 days and were followed up for 3 months. Twenty four patients completed the study. Results The mean±SD age of patients was 42.9±9.0 years. Their mean±SD BMI was 39.0±4.7 kg/m 2 before acupuncture, decreasing to 37.2±4.3 kg/m 2 after acupuncture therapy (p&lt;0.001). The mean depression score was 4.4±2.3 before acupuncture, decreasing to 2.7±1.4 (p&lt;0.001) after treatment. There was no significant correlation between BMI and depression score before acupuncture therapy (p=0.104). After acupuncture therapy, no significant correlation was found between the percentage reduction of BMI and percentage reduction of the depression score (p=0.119).

    "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this preliminary study was to compare the effectiveness of domperidone and acupuncture for the management of diabetic gastroparesis. Methods This was a preliminary, prospective non-randomised, unblinded case-crossover study conducted in patients with longstanding, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis. All patients received domperidone (20 mg four times a day) for 12 weeks, followed by a 2–3 week washout period, and then biweekly acupuncture treatments for 8 weeks. Gastric emptying rate, glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) levels were measured at start and end of each treatment period. At each of these timepoints patients completed the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey Update (SF-36). Results The trial was curtailed after only eight participants could be recruited in 3 years. The mean age of patients was 57.1±9.9 years, the male:female ratio was 1:7 and mean body mass index (kg/m 2 ) was 25.2±1.2. There was no change in any of the outcome parameters after treatment with domperidone. Acupuncture was associated with a decrease in scores for almost all cardinal symptoms of the GCSI, as well as in increased total score on the SWLS (p=0.002) and the social functioning domain of the SF-36 (p=0.054). Acupuncture did not lead to an improvement in gastric emptying, or glucose control from baseline. Conclusions Acupuncture treatment may lead to symptomatic improvement in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Within the limitations of this preliminary, non-randomised and unblinded study, it appears that this effect may be due to non-specific mechanisms.",

Take for example, the nomenclature of specific points and meridians, used in both WMA and TCM, which allows us to record treatment plans identifying previously needled points for future reference, which would be understood by either practitioner. The concept of qi is also used in both WMA and TCM. However, digging deeper there appear to be few further similarities between the two, with many of the TCM concepts of diagnosis and management of a problem being somewhat of an enigma, without the appropriate training and experience. Is it possible to merge the two, to obtain the best of both worlds? Are they really so different? What are the potential benefits and pitfalls?

Methods 40 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were randomly divided into two groups: EA combined with general anaesthesia (EA group, n=20) and general anaesthesia control group (n=20). The bilateral acupuncture points ST36 and PC6 were selected in both groups. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol was used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia to reach an equilibrium state of Narcotrend Index (NT index). In the EA group, EA was performed with a Hans EA device. In the control group, general anaesthesia was performed without EA stimulation. In both groups, heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MAP) and NT index were recorded at corresponding time points up to 30 min after the end of acupuncture. Results The NT indices of the EA group showed a downward trend after EA stimulation (p=0.01). From 15 min after the start of EA stimulation the NT indices of the EA group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). HR and MAP of the two groups showed no significant differences at any time points (p≥0.05). Conclusions EA stimulation at bilateral ST36 and PC6 significantly deepens the sedation level of general anaesthesia in patients with propofol TCI, has little impact on haemodynamics and provides significant delayed sedation effects.",

To our knowledge, no studies have summarised the effects of laser acupuncture (LA) on obesity. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of LA, in particular with respect to its impact on anthropometric features and appetite in obese adults, by conducting a systematic review of previous clinical trials. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Google Scholar electronic databases for papers published through October 2016. All clinical trials in English containing either anthropometric indices or appetite parameters were included. Two reviewers independently examined studies based on a predefined form for data extraction and the Jadad scale for quality assessment in order to minimise bias throughout the evaluation. Results After screening the papers, seven clinical trials met the criteria and were included in the systematic review. Positive effects of LA therapy were seen in body weight (n=3), body mass index (n=5), waist circumference (n=4), hip circumference (n=3), waist to hip ratio (n=4) and % fat mass (n=3). Appetite parameters were reported in one study, which showed that LA can reduce appetite and increase the sensation of feeling full. Conclusion Although some studies have indicated beneficial effects for LA on obesity, the lack of evidence with high methodological quality made it impossible to reach a definitive conclusion about the efficacy of LA for obesity management. Further high-quality, randomised, sham-controlled clinical trials with a larger sample size are needed to shed light on the efficacy of LA for obesity management and weight maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Background Substantial evidence from clinical reports has established that most cerebral palsy (CP) patients benefit from a comprehensive rehabilitation exercise training programme. Such advances are enhanced when scalp electroacupuncture (EA), applied at a location corresponding to the projection of the motor area, is combined with rehabilitation exercise training. However, little information exists regarding the mechanistic basis for these effects. Objective To examine whether EA stimulation within the scalp projection location of the motor area can inhibit apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by regulating the PI3k/Akt signalling pathway in a rat model of CP. Methods Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical modelling of CP. Five were used to confirm successful establishment of the model and the remaining 45 rats were randomly divided into one of three groups that remained untreated (CP group, n=15) or received EA treatment alone (CP+EA group, n=15) or EA in combination with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (CP+EA+LY294002 group, n=15)). An otherwise healthy negative control group of rats undergoing sham surgery was also included (Control group, n=15). In the CP+EA and CP+EA+LY294002 groups, EA was applied to the scalp surface at alocation corresponding to the projection of the motor area. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scores, hippocampal protein expression of Akt and p-Akt (by Western blot analysis) and neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal tissue (by histopathology) were assessed at 7, 14 and 21 days post-CP induction. Results CP rats receiving scalp EA treatment demonstrated improved behavioural scores, less hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and higher expression levels of Akt and p-Akt (p<0.05) at all time points studied compared with untreated CP rats. There were no significant differences observed between CP+EA+LY294002 and untreated CP model groups. Conclusions The effects of scalp EA on the PI3K/ Akt signalling pathway may represent one of the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and improvement of deficits associated with CP in a rat model.",

We described subgroups of acupuncture users and used logistic regression to estimate the odds of past year acupuncture use versus non-use and completion of a full treatment course versus a short course. Covariates included demographic factors and health status. Analyses used strata, weights and clustering to account for the complex sample design.Among acupuncture users, 38% completed a full course. Acupuncture use was low (1.5%), but odds were higher among women and those with greater education and less poverty. Those who used acupuncture insurance benefits and who had greater education were more likely to receive a full treatment course. Insurance benefits attenuated disparities in use by sex and race/ethnicity.Nationally, most people who use acupuncture do not receive a full treatment course. Considering evidence of effectiveness, low risk and relatively low cost of delivery, acupuncture could play a larger role in non-pharmaceutical treatment of common conditions such as pain. Policymakers should consider that, without insurance benefits for acupuncture, people are less likely to complete a full treatment course, which may contribute to disparities in use and health outcomes.",

Methods: 8-week-old male apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE −/− knockout) mice were randomly divided into two groups (n=10 per group): atherosclerosis (AS) and AS plus moxibustion (AS+M). C57BL/6J mice of the same background (n=10) were selected as controls. Mice in the AS+M group received indirect moxibustion with an ignited moxa stick held over CV4. Mice of the AS and control groups were restrained in the same holder with an unlit moxa stick held over CV4. All treatments were performed for 20 min per day, 6 days per week for 12 weeks. After the treatment, the mice were euthanased and their serum lipids were measured. The aortic roots and thoracic aortas were collected for haematoxylin and eosin and red oil O staining, respectively, to analyse the atherosclerotic lesions. Expression of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABCA)A1/G1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in the thoracic aorta were examined with Western blotting. Results: The moxibustion-treated (AS+M) mice showed a significantly lower plaque area percentage in the aortic root and thoracic aorta, and higher expression of LXRα and ABCA1 in the thoracic aorta compared with the AS mice. No significant differences were found in average lipid area percentage in the thoracic aorta, or ABCG1 expression in the thoracic aorta, between mice in the AS+M and AS groups. Conclusion: Moxibustion treatment at CV4 suppressed the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice. The anti-atherogenic effect of moxibustion may be achieved by: (1) regulation of lipid metabolism, and thus prevention of lipid accumulation; and (2) upregulation of LXRα- and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in the lesion area.",

Before we establish a standard for acupuncture manipulation, it is important to understand completely the manifestations of acupuncture manipulation in the actual clinic. To examine motion patterns during acupuncture manipulation, we generated a fitted model of practitioners' motion patterns and evaluated their consistencies in acupuncture manipulation.Using a motion sensor, we obtained real-time motion data from eight experienced practitioners while they conducted acupuncture manipulation using their own techniques. We calculated the average amplitude and duration of a sampled motion unit for each practitioner and, after normalisation, we generated a true regression curve of motion patterns for each practitioner using a generalised additive mixed modelling (GAMM).We observed significant differences in rotation amplitude and duration in motion samples among practitioners. GAMM showed marked variations in average regression curves of motion patterns among practitioners but there was strong consistency in motion parameters for individual practitioners. The fitted regression model showed that the true regression curve accounted for an average of 50.2% of variance in the motion pattern for each practitioner.Our findings suggest that there is great inter-individual variability between practitioners, but remarkable intra-individual consistency within each practitioner.",

The intervention phase lasted 8 weeks and outcomes were measured 1 week after the last intervention (T1) and 6 months after baseline (T2). The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity according to a 100 mm visual analogue scale (pain VAS) at T1. Secondary outcome measures were the Lattinen index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the SF-12 health-related quality of life scale (Spanish version in every case).There were 265 participants (TAP group, n=130; PAP group, n=135). Pain was most frequently located in the upper back (55.1%, n=146), followed by the lower back (25.3%, n=67) and the dorsal area (12.5%, n=33). Nineteen patients (7.2%) reported pain affecting the entire spine. There were statistically significant differences between TAP and PAP in the change in the pain VAS at T1 of 10 mm (95% CI 2.8 to 17.3, p=0.007) and in the change in the pain VAS at T2 of 7.2 mm (95% CI 0.02 to 14.3, p=0.049) in favour of TAP. We also observed a statistically significant difference of 3.4 points in the physical component of the SF-12 in favour of TAP at T2 (95% CI 0.45 to 6.3, p=0.024). No severe adverse effects were detected or reported during treatment.The application of auriculopressure in patients with non-specific spinal pain in primary healthcare is effective and safe, and therefore should be considered for inclusion in the portfolio of primary healthcare services.ISRCTN01897462.",

Although early EA treatment similarly increased BMD and bone strength of the femur, late EA treatment did not. However, both early and late EA treatment reduced mRNA expression of cathepsin K in OVX rats.Early EA completely prevented and late EA partially prevented bone loss and deterioration of bone strength in OVX rats. The timing of initiation of EA treatment may be an important consideration for optimisation of effects.

There is increasing clinical evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for insulin resistance.1\n\nFrom a mechanistic point of view, the post-receptor responses and signal transduction pathways that are initiated when insulin binds to its receptor in the cell plasma membrane are well described (http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/insulin.php). These include the association of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) with the insulin receptor (IR), which results in the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (GRB2). Activated PI3K phosphorylates membrane phospholipids and the main product is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which in turn activates PIP3-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 activates another kinase called protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt). Insulin-mediated activation of Akt causes inhibition of lipolysis and gluconeogenesis and activation of protein and glycogen synthesis. Insulin signalling also activates the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway either by IR phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (SHC), which then interacts with GRB2, or via IRS1 activation. Insulin decreases hepatic glucose production (HGP) and increases the rate of glucose uptake, primarily in striated muscle and adipose tissue. In muscle and fat cells, the clearance of circulating glucose depends on the insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) isoform to the …",

Moxa smoke has been a major reason for avoiding moxibustion due to its smell and potential risks to the human body.10 units of commercial indirect moxa (CIM) from six manufacturers (A-F) were burnt in a 2.5×2.5×2.5 m chamber without ventilation, and concentrations of carbon oxides (CO and CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the indoor air samples were measured.For brands A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, relative to baseline values, we observed an increase in CO (from 0.002 to 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, 0.006, 0.005, and 0.006 parts per billion (ppb)), NOx (from 0.009 to 0.051, 0.025, 0.015, 0.050, 0.019, and 0.020 ppb), and total VOCs (TVOC; from 48.06 to 288.83, 227.93, 140.82, 223.22, 260.15, and 161.35 μg/m3), while the concentration of CO2 was not elevated. Each CIM brand demonstrated different VOC emission characteristics, which could be divided into three groups. On average, we estimated that 20 units of CIM or 2.41 g moxa floss would need to be combusted in order to exceed the safe levels set by Korean environmental law. This limit is likely to be greater in the case of a larger room or use of ventilation.Despite increased CO/NOx/VOC concentrations, overall levels remained within safe limits. These findings may help clinicians to maintain safe moxibustion treatment conditions to help keep both patients and clinicians safe from the pollutants generated by moxa combustion.",

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antagonism reportedly suppresses neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Aims: In the present study, we investigated the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on TLR2 and related signalling molecules in a complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced mouse model of inflammatory pain to determine whether EA can attenuate inflammatory pain via the TLR2 signalling pathway. Methods: EA significantly reduced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the animal model. A similar effect was produced by TLR2 antagonism induced by CU-CPT22 injection. Results: TLR2 expression in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord and thalamus increased following induction of inflammation. Expression levels of downstream molecules such as pPI3K, pAkt and pmTOR also increased, as did those of MAPK subfamily members such as pERK, pp38 and pJNK. Transcription factors (pCREB and pNFκB) and nociceptive ion channels (Nav1.7 and Nav1.8) were also involved. Conclusion: Increased expression of the above molecules was attenuated by both EA and TLR2 antagonism. Our results show that EA attenuates inflammatory pain via TLR2 signalling.",

To evaluate the tensiomyographic changes between the two lower limbs after these interventions. Methods 80 participants with bilateral reduced hamstring flexibility were randomized into four groups: Stretching, Neurodynamic, PNM, and Needle groups. All interventions were performed on the right limb. Each participant’s leg was subjected to SLR testing and tensiomyography before and after the interventions. Results Each group improved their SLR values in the non-intervention limb compared to baseline values, but the PNM and Needle groups obtained higher values for the SLR test in the non-intervention limb compared with the Neurodynamic and Stretching groups. There were statistically significant differences for mean SLR measures between limbs pre- and post-intervention for all groups except the PNM group, suggesting crossover effects for PNM but not the other techniques studied. There were no differences in tensiomyographic assessments between groups or between sides, at baseline or upon completion of the study.

Acupuncture also had fewer mean reported side effects (22.7% ± 5.9%) compared with surgery (25.3% ± 12.6%) and pharmacotherapy (88.8% ± 25.0%), and the lowest cost; after 5 years, the cost of acupuncture was estimated to be £750, compared to £1507.73 for carbamazepine and £4878.42 for MVD. Acupuncture was the least stressful according to the SRRS (53 points), whereas surgery was second most stressful (153 points) and pharmacotherapy was the most stressful intervention to patients (217 points). Conclusion Acupuncture appears more effective than pharmacotherapy or surgery. Statistical analysis of side effects was not possible due to inconsistent reporting protocols, but the data suggest that acupuncture is considerably safer than pharmacotherapy or surgery. Acupuncture also appears to be the least expensive therapeutic modality to deliver long-term (65 weeks onwards), and our analysis indicated that it was less stressful to patients than pharmacotherapy or surgery. Further study into these areas and the practicality of its availability in the UK National Health Service (NHS) and other health systems is recommended.",

    "abstract": "To examine the possible impact of moxibustion on the serum proteome of the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this experiment. The CIA animal model was prepared by injection of type II bovine collagen in Freund's adjuvant on the first and seventh day. The 36 rats were randomly divided into two groups: the untreated CIA group (control), and the CIA plus treatment with moxibustion (CIA+moxi) group. Moxibustion was administered daily at ST36 and BL23 for 7, 14 or 21 days (n=12 rats each). Arthritis score was used to assess the severity of arthritis. At the end of each 7 day treatment, blood samples from the control group and the CIA+moxi group were collected. After removal of high abundance proteins from serum samples, two-dimensional gel combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight MS/MS (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) techniques were performed to examine serum protein expression patterns of the CIA rat model with and without moxibustion treatment. In addition, the relevant proteins were further analysed with the use of bioinformatics analysis.Moxibustion significantly decreased arthritis severity in the rats in the CIA+moxi group, when compared with the rats in the CIA group 35 days after the first immunisation (p=0.001). Seventeen protein spots which changed >1.33 or <0.77 at p<0.05 using Bonferonni correction for multiple testing were found to be common to all three comparisons, and these proteins were used for classification of functions using the Gene Ontology method. Consequently, with the use of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the top canonical pathways and a predicted proteomic network related to the moxibustion effect of CIA were established.Using the proteomics technique, we have identified novel candidate proteins that may be involved in the mechanisms of action underlying the beneficial effects of moxibustion in rats with CIA. Our findings suggest that immune responses and metabolic processes may be involved in mediating the effects of moxibustion. Moreover, periodxiredoxin I (PRDX1) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) may be potential targets.",

Our previous clinical study reported that electroacupuncture (EA) provided intrapartum analgesia, but the underlying mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Aims To observe the effect of EA on labour pain and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action in a rat model. Methods Copulation-confirmed pregnant rats (n=120) were given castor oil to induce labour. Rats remained untreated (control group, n=20) or received either meperidine (an opioid that is commonly used to treat labour pain, n=20) or EA at SP6, LI4, SP6+LI4 or SP10 (four groups, n=20 each). Labour pain was evaluated by the warm water tail-flick test. Serum DYN values were measured by ELISA. Protein and mRNA expression of prodynorphin (PDYN, the precursor protein of DYN) and KOR were analysed by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Results EA treatment at all acupuncture point combinations studied significantly relieved labour pain and increased serum DYN concentrations, to a degree similar to that achieved with meperidine. EA notably enhanced protein expression of KOR and PDYN and mRNA expression in the lumbar spinal cord but not in the cerebral cortex. The size of effect varied by EA group in the order: SP6&gt;LI4&gt;SP6+LI4&gt;SP10 for all parameters measured, indicating differential effects relating to acupuncture point selection/combination. Conclusions The present study indicates that EA relieves labour pain, at least in part, by regulation of the spinal DYN/KOR system in a rat model.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture and related techniques are used worldwide to alleviate pain; however, their mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation (TEAS) at different frequencies in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in rats.CCI was induced by ligating the common sciatic nerve, which produced neuropathic pain. 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats with CCI were randomly divided into three groups (n=6 each) that remained untreated (CCI group) or received TEAS at high frequency (CCI+TEAS-H group) or TEAS at low frequency (CCI+TEAS-L group). Rats in the CCI+TEAS-H group received high frequency stimulation (6-9 mA, 100 Hz) at GB34/GV26/ST36; those in the CCI+TEAS-L group received low frequency stimulation (6-9 mA, 2 Hz) at the same points. Rats in the control group had the same electrodes applied but received no stimulation. All three groups were subjected to behavioural studies after treatment. Expression of μ opioid receptors (MORs) in the L3-L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting after treatment.Compared with the untreated CCI group, both mechanical allodynia and thermal hypergesia were significantly attenuated, and MOR expression in the DRG was significantly increased by low frequency TEAS treatment at GB34/GV26/ST36 (p<0.05). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the CCI and CCI+TEAS-H groups.The use of low frequency TEAS significantly mitigated neuropathic pain in this rat model, and its analgesic effect is likely mediated by upregulation of MOR expression in the DRG.",

    "abstract": "Propofol provides excellent sedation during colonoscopy. However, its application, namely when used together with an opioid, is associated with cardiopulmonary depression. Acupuncture is used nowadays for the treatment of pain and anxiety, and also to induce sedation. We hypothesised that electroacupuncture (EA) during colonoscopy would have sedative effects, thereby reducing propofol requirements to achieve an adequate level of sedation.The study was designed and conducted as a single centre, patient and observer blinded, sham- and placebo-controlled randomised trial. Patients scheduled for elective colonoscopy under deep propofol/alfentanil sedation were randomly assigned to receive unilateral EA, sham-acupuncture (SA) or placebo-acupuncture (PA) at ST36, PC6 and LI4. The primary outcome parameter was the total dosage of propofol. Secondary outcomes included the patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction levels evaluated by questionnaires.The dosage of propofol required (median [IQR]) was not significantly different between the three groups (EA group 147 μg/kg/min [109-193] vs SA group 141 μg/kg/min [123- 180] vs PA group 141 μg/kg/min [112-182]; P=0.776). There was also no significant difference in alfentanil consumption (P=0.634). Global satisfaction (median [IQR]) among patients (EA group 6.6 [6.0-7.0] vs SA group 6.8 [6.0-7.0] vs PA group 6.5 [6.0-7.0]; P=0.481) and endoscopists (6.0 [5.0-6.0] for all groups; P=0.773) did not significantly differ between the three groups. There was no significant difference in the number of cardiorespiratory events.For colonoscopy, the applied mode of EA did not show any propofol-sparing sedative effect compared with sham or placebo acupuncture.The trial is registered in the Netherland's Trial Registry (NTR4325).",

Participants were randomized into two groups. The treatment group received a combined intervention of manual acupuncture (MA) plus electroacupuncture (EA), while the control group received a combination of sham acupuncture interventions consisting of sham MA plus sham EA for 6 weeks. The serum lipid levels were measured as the primary outcome measure and anthropometric parameters and serum metabolic profiles including amino acids and carnitines were measured as secondary outcome measures.The serum lipid levels and anthropometric measurements did not significantly differ between groups, while body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were improved within each group and the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased over time in the treatment group. There were no significant differences in amino acid levels between groups, while certain carnitine (C2, C4, C6, and l-carnitine) levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the treatment group compared to the control group.In summary, 6 weeks of acupuncture treatment did not affect anthropometric and serum metabolic parameters, with the exception of certain carnitines, when compared to sham acupuncture. The observation of increased carnitine levels in the acupuncture group could result in potential long-term benefits to obese individuals. Additional studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of acupuncture on lipid metabolism and the underlying mechanism of action.This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02066090).",

    "abstract": "Sleep is crucial for proper functioning of the brain, whereas lack of sleep is very common in modern society and can cause memory impairment. Hence, it is of great significance to find effective methods to intervene in the pathogenesis of memory impairment.We designed this study to explore the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on the deficits caused by sleep deprivation (SD).In this study, we first utilized the modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to establish a rat model of SD, which was followed by use of the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) to assess the performance of rats following EA treatment.We found that EA at GV20 and ST36 significantly decreased the number of error reactions, increased the number of active avoidance responses in the Y-maze and shortened the latency of finding the platform in the MWM test in SD + EA versus untreated SD groups. Moreover, EA treatment partially restored SD-induced reductions in hippocampal dopamine (DA) content and significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated (p) synapsin I, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II, and tyrosine hydroxylase, which are related to the synthesis and release of DA.In summary, we it appears that EA at GV20 and ST36 may improve SD-induced memory deficits by restoring the quantity of DA in the hippocampus, which is related to activation of CaMK II, synapsin I, and tyrosine hydroxylase. EA may have potential as an alternative therapy for SD and could improve learning and memory deficits among those suffering from sleep deficiency, although this needs verification by prospective clinical studies.",

Acupuncture may have benefits in the treatment of MetS. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of MetS.Large-sample randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture treatment for MetS were extracted from multiple Chinese and English databases and analyzed using meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness of acupuncture with respect to various MetS indices in comparison with control treatments including conventional medications (CMs) and lifestyle intervention (LI), together and separately.A total of 13 RCTs were identified with 423 subjects undergoing acupuncture regimens and 411 receiving control interventions. Active acupuncture yielded better outcomes than sham acupuncture with respect to improving multiple MetS indices. Acupuncture monotherapy had similar effectiveness in controlling triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein levels compared to CMs. The overall effects of adjunctive acupuncture were markedly greater than those of controls (CMs + LI, CMs, and LI) with respect to waist circumference with a mean difference of -5.11 cm (Z = 4.57, p < 0.001) and body mass index with a mean difference of -2.54 (Z = 5.38, p <0.001), and improvements were observed in most hyperlipidemia indices and fasting blood glucose. An evidence-based acupuncture regimen was identified as a future treatment strategy for MetS.Acupuncture is beneficial in the treatment of MetS and could serve as an alternative therapy for MetS-associated conditions. Larger-scale RCTs are needed to confirm the efficacy/effectiveness of our recommended evidence-based acupuncture regimen in MetS.",

Patients vary considerably in their responsiveness to acupuncture: some fail to respond at all while others (strong reactors) experience marked effects. It is widely recognised that fear of acupuncture generally precludes a therapeutic response, whereas belief in the efficacy of the treatment is irrelevant. All these phenomena must presumably have a neurophysiological explanation. This paper proposes that they may, at least in part, be caused by processes occurring in those brain structures that are classified as forming the limbic system. The paper briefly reviews the history and status of the limbic system idea, discusses how limbic system structures may contribute to the phenomena in question, and offers a number of predictions which would allow these hypotheses to be tested.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is a specialised sensory stimulation that is analysed through sensory neural pathways. Therefore to understand its action we have to analyse the anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of the nervous system, aided with a knowledge of neuroendocrinology and the chemoarchitecture of the brain. Various neural theories have been developed to explain the mechanisms of acupuncture. It is now evident that acupuncture reacts at local, regional (spinal cord) and general (brain) levels. Therefore, inserting one or more needles at particular points (or areas) of the body activates neural pathways on three different levels, provoking local, regional, and general reactions. The local reaction is a multifactorial phenomenon. The electric injury potential due to the needle, the presence and synthesis of opioid peptides at the site of injury, and substance P, histamine like substances, bradikinin, serotonin and proteolitic enzyme release around the needle, all occur during needling. The regional reaction concerns the activation of a larger area (2–3 dermatomes) via reflex arches. We can analyse the viscero-cutaneous, cutaneo-visceral, cutaneo-muscular and viscero-muscular reflexes and also the vegetative, stretch and polysynaptic segmental reflexes. The general reaction mainly activates the brain central mechanism of internal homoeostasis. We can explain the action of acupuncture in acute and chronic pain syndromes, in addiction and in psychiatric disease through the role of central neurotransmitters and the modulatory systems that are activated by acupoints: opioid, non-opioid and central sympathetic inhibitory mechanisms.",

The double-blind condition, where the clinician is ignorant of the treatment allocation, cannot be sensibly maintained in trials of acupuncture or other physical treatments. The definition of an appropriate control group is also a difficult matter. The great majority of controlled trials of acupuncture so far conducted are seriously flawed by the use of a placebo control that itself has therapeutic effects. Recently more appropriate control groups have been developed, notably mock TENS, which is inert, and minimal acupuncture, which has only a very slight specific effect. As trials can only be single blind, if is especially important to monitor the adequacy of the control procedure, to ensure that it is perceived as being as effective as the true treatment. It is suggested that this can be achieved by assessing the: credibility of the two treatment procedures. Controlled trials of acupuncture should therefore be single blind, and employ a control condition that has no more than minimal specific effects, but is nevertheless seen as a credible, bona fide treatment by patients.",

Claims have been made that acupuncture can affect muscle EMG activity, though there is some doubt about the reliability of these studies. This study's aim was to examine the immediate effects of acupuncture on the EMG activity of the common wrist extensor muscles. Methods Thirty five right-handed healthy volunteers, 17 male and 18 female, aged 18-70 years were recruited from a convenience sample. Five subjects provided reliability data, and the remaining 30 took part in the main study. The study was a crossover, within-subject design, with the interventions counterbalanced. The three conditions were genuine acupuncture to LI4 ( Hegu) and LI10 ( Shousanli) for 20 minutes, with de qi; inappropriate acupuncture to PC3 ( Quze) and PC6 ( Neiguan) for 20 minutes; and 20 minutes of a no intervention control. All participants received each condition in random order. The outcome measure was surface EMG activity recorded over the common wrist extensor muscles during a 10 second, sub-maximal, isometric contraction. The average of three readings was used. The reliability of the outcome measurement was assessed in five volunteers selected at random who received repeated EMG recordings without acupuncture. Results The reliability tests showed the EMG procedure was highly reliable, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1) of 0.9996 and a standard error of measurement of 0.014mV. In the main study, paired t tests for the effect of the order of the first two interventions showed no detectable carry-over effect. Freidman analysis of variance found no difference between the three conditions (P=0.573). Conclusion No meaningful change was detected in EMG activity following acupuncture interventions, but this study provides a sound protocol and normative values on which to plan future research.",

One hundred and seventy two patients were selected for acupuncture over a period of 6.5 years. Treatment was given by a single acupuncturist and consisted of a course of needle acupuncture for an average of seven sessions per patient. Treatment outcome was measured by an oral rating scale of improvement at the end of treatment and at follow up six months and one year after treatment. Nineteen patients were withdrawn from treatment for various reasons, two for adverse events. One hundred and fifty three patients were evaluated, of whom 68% had a successful outcome from acupuncture, reporting an improvement in pain of at least 50%. The success rate was higher in patients with a short duration of pain: 85% in patients with pain for up to three months and 78% with pain for up to six months. Long-term follow up showed that 49% of the patients who completed treatment had maintained the benefit after six months, and 40% at one year. The results indicate that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for selected patients with chronic neck pain.",

    "abstract": "Introduction For many women, undergoing assisted reproductive technology can be a difficult experience, and can result in changes in physical and emotional health and wellbeing. Recent research has suggested that acupuncture may be helpful for women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. To date, there is no information describing the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes seen in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology, or relationships between TCM and Western medicine diagnoses. Objective To examine the health status of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology from both Western and Chinese medicine perspectives. Methods One hundred and eighty women were included in the study. All underwent a TCM diagnosis, 177 (98.3%) completed the quality of life questionnaire SF36. Information about Western medicine diagnosis was collected from case notes and was available for 176 (97.7%) women. Results Women in the trial reported poorer health on several domains of the SF36 compared with the South Australian population. The most common TCM diagnosis was ‘Kidney Yang deficiency’, diagnosed for 53.9% of patients. A TCM diagnosis of Qi or ‘Blood stagnation’ was associated with poorer quality of life on the mental health, emotional role function and social function domains of the SF36. No associations were found between TCM diagnosis and physical or general health components of the SF36. Conclusions Associations between TCM and reproductive health diagnoses were demonstrated. Emotional health and wellbeing is an important aspect of patient care that needs to be addressed in clinical practice and research studies, as the findings suggest that this aspect of their health is often poorer during assisted reproductive technology.",

This paper critically reviews the processes used to establish one-sentence statements about the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief. Some one-sentence statements claim that acupuncture is not clinically effective because systematic reviews of clinical trials find similar amounts of pain relief between sham acupuncture and real acupuncture. However, these one-sentence statements fail to account for shortcomings in clinical trials such as inadequate doses and inappropriate acupuncture technique. Establishing the physiological intention of acupuncture and developing criteria to assess whether this has been achieved in trials will help to overcome some of these problems in future trials. In addition, shortcomings in systematic review methodology such as imprecise inclusion criteria, comparisons of heterogeneous study populations and imprecise definitions of acupuncture have resulted in discrepancies in vote counting of outcomes between review groups. Recognition of these issues has produced a shift in favour of acupuncture in recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It is hoped that this will be reflected in a reappraisal of some of the negative one-sentence statements about the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief.",

Methods Using various search strategies, a professional librarian searched six electronic databases (PubMed, AMED, Science Direct College Edition, China Academic Journals, Acubriefs, and the in-house Journal Article Index maintained by the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine Library). English and Chinese language human studies with all study designs and for all clinical indications were included. Excluded were experimental and animal studies, electroacupuncture and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Data were extracted on clinical indication, study design, number, age and gender of subjects, magnetic devices used, acu-magnet dosing regimens (acu-point site of magnet application and frequency and duration of treatment), control devices and control groups, outcomes, and adverse events. Results Three hundred and eight citations were retrieved and 50 studies met our inclusion criteria. We were able to obtain and translate (when necessary) 42 studies. The language of 31 studies was English and 11 studies were in Chinese. The 42 studies reported on 32 different clinical conditions in 6453 patients from 1986–2007. A variety of magnetic devices, dosing regimens and control devices were used. Thirty seven of 42 studies (88%) reported therapeutic benefit. The only adverse events reported were exacerbation of hot flushes and skin irritation from adhesives. Conclusions Based on this literature review we believe further investigation of acu-magnet therapy is warranted particularly for the management of diabetes and insomnia. The overall poor quality of the controlled trials precludes any evidence based treatment recommendations at this time.",

    "abstract": "Objective Although electroacupuncture (EA) therapy is used to relieve various kinds of pain, the optimal frequency and duration of EA remain unclear. We investigated the effect of varying frequency and duration of EA during hyperalgesia elicited by carrageenan-induced inflammation. Methods Carrageenan was administered by subcutaneous intraplantar injection to induce inflammation. Nociceptive thresholds were measured using the paw pressure threshold (PPT) (Randall-Selitto Test). EA was applied at 3, 15, or 100Hz to the left anterior tibial muscles for 1, 15, or 60 minutes. Intensities used were chosen within the known tolerance of the animal, and increased up to 3mA for 3Hz, and up to 1.5mA for 15 and 100Hz. EA was started three hours after carrageenan injection. Results Three hours after carrageenan injection, a marked ipsilateral inflammatory response appeared and PPT decreased significantly. This decrease persisted for at least 24 hours after carrageenan injection. EA at 3Hz (60 minutes) resulted in significant increases of PPT which persisted for 24 hours after injection. EA at 3Hz (15 minutes) also induced PPT elevations immediately and for one hour after EA compared to the control group. However, no other variety of EA significantly increased PPT. Conclusion These results show that EA produces electroacupuncture analgesia of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. These findings also suggest that, among the frequencies and durations tested, EA at 3Hz (60 minutes) is the most suitable frequency and duration for carrageenan-induced inflammation. It seems that EA has different analgesic effects and mechanisms according to the parameters of stimulation. For EA in the clinical induction of analgesia, it is especially important that an effective frequency and duration are selected.",

EA was applied at different frequencies, through needles inserted around the incision, over selected peripheral nerve branches and in the ear, from 30 min before surgery until the end of surgery, when needles were removed. All patients also received routine sedation and local anaesthesia. Results There was no difference between the pain scores in the groups receiving EA and sham TENS in the immediate postoperative period, which may be owing to adequate levels of analgesia from conventional techniques. On the fourth and seventh postoperative days, less pain and lower consumption of analgesic drugs were reported in the treatment group. Seroma occurred more frequently in the control group, which also had higher glucose blood levels in the immediate postoperative surgery period. The single case of chronic postoperative pain occurred in the control group.

Their suggestion that less emphasis should be placed on eliciting painful de qi during acupuncture is certain to raise debate, although it was not clear from the report whether this recommendation extended to non-painful de qi .\n\nIn the past decade investigators have emphasised the need to generate needle de qi sensations during real but not sham interventions in RCTs.

It seems timely to review the theoretical and practical risks associated with the application of EA.\n\n### Increased depth and altered angulation\n\nDepth and angulation of needles is often modified for the application of EA in order to ensure that the needles can support the weight of the electrical leads and clips for the period of stimulation without falling out. EA is often applied for 20–30 min and may involve strong muscle contraction. Under these circumstances, needles need to be angled so that the weight of the attached leads and clips opposes the tendency of the contracting muscle to push the needle out. The use of increased depth of insertion and the need to alter angulation from the more familiar orientation at certain points require the practitioner to have a greater knowledge of anatomy for safe needling.5,–,7\n\n### Muscle contraction and needle movement\n\nDuring strong, low-frequency electrical stimulation of needles in muscle, vigorous muscle contraction can occur. Often this movement is entirely safe; however, in some locations it may be wise to take precautions to reduce needle movement, for both the safety and comfort of the patient. If a needle is placed close to a motor nerve unusually strong muscle movement will occur quite abruptly on increasing stimulation between about 0.5 and 0.9 mA. Under these …",

Little is known about the reliability of TCM pattern diagnoses. Objective To examine in a cross-sectional study the inter-rater reliability of TCM diagnoses and acupuncture point selection. Methods 30 infertile and 24 previously pregnant women were examined for TCM patterns by two acupuncturists. An operational interview guide related to gynaecology was used. The acupuncturists independently decided on the TCM patterns (categorised as excess, deficiency and merged patterns) and the prescription of acupuncture points. Kappa Statistics were used in the analyses. Results 39 different TCM patterns and 36 different acupuncture points were used. For the choice of acupuncture points, poor to no agreement was found. Moderate to fair agreement was seen in excess/deficiency and merged patterns. Perfect match to moderate agreement on treatment was obtained when choosing meridians given certain TCM patterns. Conclusions The low agreement on diagnoses indicates that acupuncturists follow individual pattern differentiation processes. The selection of acupuncture points seem to be closely related to the choice of TCM pattern diagnoses. The results indicate that the poor reliability in the diagnoses and thus treatment received by a patient will vary individually, which in turn is a challenge for clinical trials of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Background Studies on the relationship between de qi intensity and activity changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are scarce. This study investigates the physiological responses associated with de qi. The relationship between de qi intensity and such responses was determined. Method This was a single-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 36 subjects (19 men, 17 women), aged 34.5±4.6 years, were randomly assigned to group 1 (electroacupuncture at 2 Hz, 0.4 ms to right LI4 and LI11 for 30 min), group 2 (electroacupuncture stimulation to bilateral patellae) or group 3 (sham electroacupuncture to right LI4 and LI11 but over Duoderm pads). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HR variability by low/high frequency (LF/HF) were recorded 5 min before, during and 5 min after the intervention. Needle sensations were quantified by the Modified Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale – Chinese version (C-MMASS) and the C-MMASS index was computed. Results A significant increase in LF/HF, MAP and HR was observed in group 1. A small and significant increase in LF/HF was observed in group 2 but the changes in MAP and HR in groups 2 and 3 were not significant. The C-MMASS index was highest in group 1 (5.3±1.3), moderate in group 2 (3.5±0.7) and lowest in group 3 (0.77±0.2). A positive correlation between de qi intensity and changes in LF/HF, MAP and HR was observed. Conclusions This study suggests that de qi is associated with physiological changes, and that de qi intensity increases with an increase in sympathetic discharge of the ANS.",

This results in hypotension, vascular hyporeactivity and multiple organ failure (eg, liver injury) in rats. In rats with endotoxin shock, electro-acupuncture (EA) of ‘Neiguan’ (PC6) retrieved blood pressure and reduced plasma concentrations of NO. The authors evaluated whether EA at PC6 could alleviate the development of liver injury and dysfunction in endotoxic rats. Methods A total of 28 male adult Wistar rats were included in this study. Rats received intravenous LPS (10 mg/kg for 4 h) or saline for 4 h followed by EA at PC6 acupuncture point. Results Elevated biochemical parameters of liver injury and marked infiltration of neutrophils into liver tissues caused by LPS were significantly attenuated by EA. However, hypotension, tachycardia and raised production of plasma NO were not suppressed by EA at PC6. Conclusions These results indicate that EA at PC6 should be further investigated as a possible adjuvant therapy for endotoxin-induced liver dysfunction. Its mechanism of action needs further investigation.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that neural electrical signals are generated or changed when acupuncture is administered. In order to explore the effects of different MA manipulations on the neural system, an experiment was designed to record the discharges of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn evoked by MA at different frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 Hz) at ST36.Microelectrode extracellular recordings were used to record the discharges of WDR neurons evoked by different MA manipulations. Approximate firing rate and coefficient of variation of interspike interval (ISI) were used to extract the characteristic parameters of the neural electrical signals after spike sorting, and the neural coding of the evoked discharges by different MA manipulations was obtained.Our results indicated that the neuronal firing rate and time sequences of ISI showed distinct clustering properties for different MA manipulations, which could distinguish them effectively.The combination of firing rate and ISI codes carries information about the acupuncture stimulus frequency. Different MA manipulations appear to change the neural coding of electrical signals in the spinal dorsal horn through WDR neurons.",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture treatment has been increasingly used to treat chronic liver diseases. We previously reported that acupuncture combined with curcumin, a natural antifibrotic compound, could remarkably attenuate liver fibrosis in chemically intoxicated rats, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of acupuncture combined with curcumin on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation in the fibrotic liver. Methods A total of 60 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into control, model, sham, acupuncture, curcumin and combination treatment groups. During the establishment of fibrosis using carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ), acupuncture at LR3, LR14, BL18 and ST36 and/or curcumin treatment by mouth were performed simultaneously. After treatment, serum PDGF levels were measured. Protein and mRNA expression of key effectors in PDGF pathway and fibrinolysis in the liver was determined. Results Acupuncture combined with curcumin potently reduced serum PDGF levels and selectively disrupted the PDGF-βR/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Combination treatment also significantly repressed expression of connective tissue growth factor and upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, promoting fibrinolysis in the fibrotic liver. Conclusions The beneficial effects of acupuncture and its combination with curcumin could be attributed to the disruption of PDGF-βR/ERK pathway and stimulated ECM degradation in the fibrotic liver. Acupuncture treatment significantly enhanced curcumin effects at the molecular level. These findings may provide molecular insights into the potential of acupuncture combined with curcumin for prevention of hepatic fibrosis.",

The measurements were conducted in a room with a temperature of 25°C, with subjects in a long sitting position after 10 min rest. Acupuncture needles were retained for 10 min at two sites on the right tibialis anterior muscle. ECG was performed simultaneously with measurements of blood pressure and the respiratory cycle. Based on the R-R interval on the ECG, frequency analysis was performed, low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components were extracted and the ratio of LF to HF components (LF/HF) was evaluated.The trigger point acupuncture group showed a transient decrease in heart rate and an increase in the HF component but no significant changes in LF/HF. In the control group, no significant changes were observed in heart rate, the HF component or LF/HF. There were no consistent changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in either group.These data suggest that acupuncture stimulation of trigger points of the tibialis anterior muscle transiently increases parasympathetic nerve activity.",

Methods An online questionnaire with an invitation to participate was circulated by email to 263 hospices and specialist palliative care services in the UK. Results A response rate of 54% was obtained. Acupuncture was provided by 59% of services that responded. In general, small numbers of patients receive acupuncture as part of their palliative care treatment as inpatients, day patients or outpatients. Most practitioners were regulated health professionals who had received a Western-style training in acupuncture and used a Western-style medical acupuncture approach. Where acupuncture was not available the commonest reason given was the lack of a suitable practitioner. Most agreed that if funding and a suitable practitioner were available, acupuncture would be a useful addition to their service. The level of awareness of specific types of evidence supporting the use of acupuncture in palliative care was low, but most respondents were aware that some evidence existed. Conclusions There is a need to increase training in acupuncture for healthcare professionals working in palliative care. There is also a need to raise awareness of the potential benefits to patients and the evidence base supporting the use of acupuncture in palliative care.",

Design A total of 12 healthy volunteers were stimulated by EA at Yintang and GV20 for 30 min. Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before EA, and at 5 and 15 min after needle removal. Statistical parametric mapping was used to preprocess initial data, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were analysed. Results ReHo at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the left temporal lobe and cerebellum and decreases in the left parietal lobe, occipital lobe and right precuneus. At 15 min post stimulation, ReHo showed increases in the left fusiform gyrus; lingual gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; postcentral gyrus; limbic lobe; cingulate gyrus; paracentral lobule; cerebellum, posterior lobe, declive; right cuneus and cerebellum, anterior lobe, culmen. It also showed decreases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, right temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe and right cingulate gyrus. ALFF at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the right temporal lobe, but decreases in the right limbic lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. At 15 min post stimulation ALFF showed increases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, right temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum, but decreases in the left frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus, right frontal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. Conclusions After EA stimulation at Yintang and GV20, which are associated with psychiatric disorder treatments, changes were localised in the frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Changes were higher in number and intensity at 15 min than at 5 min after needle removal, demonstrating lasting and strong after-effects of EA on cerebral functional regions.",

However, no validated measure of expectancy for acupuncture is available in the Korean language. The Acupuncture Expectancy Scale (AES), a 4-item self-reporting questionnaire, is the validated instrument for measuring expectancies regarding acupuncture therapy. We translated the AES into Korean and examined its test–retest reliability and construct validity. Methods The AES was translated using a forward and backward translation procedure. Internal consistency was assessed in 275 participants with item-total correlations. Construct validity was also assessed by performing principal component analysis and correlating scores on the scale with the participants’ intention to receive acupuncture therapy. Test–retest reliability was assessed in 33 participants by calculating Cronbach's α and Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Results Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's α=0.910). Principal component analysis showed that expectancy of acupuncture treatment accounted for 79.2% of the variance. The AES was positively correlated with participants’ intention to receive acupuncture treatment (r=0.695, p&lt;0.001). Test–retest reliability in 33 of the 275 participants was adequate, with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ranging from 0.500 to 0.737 (p&lt;0.001).

Radiation therapy can cause oral trismus, which is related to high doses of radiation. Although acupuncture is reported to be effective and is widely used for the treatment of peripheral facial paralysis by promoting an improvement of motor functions, few reports in the literature demonstrate its effectiveness. We report a case in which the symptoms of a patient with facial paralysis after surgical cancer treatment associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved after laser treatment at acupuncture points. Ten weekly sessions of laser therapy were conducted, using the Twin laser device, applied to systemic acupuncture points (LR3, LI4, LI18, LI19, LI20, SI17, SI19, ST4, ST6, ST7, GV20), together with 10 weekly sessions of auricular acupressure. Significant improvement of the trismus was seen, confirmed by the increase in mouth opening from 33.26 to 53.3 mm. The patient's family also noted reduced anxiety and hyperactivity. These results suggest that laser acupuncture and auricular acupressure for trismus and facial paralysis following cancer treatment is worth further investigation.",

To induce anterior knee pain (AKP), 5% hypertonic saline (0.12 ml/min with a total volume of 8.5 ml over 70 min) was injected into the infrapatellar fat pad of the dominant leg. One of four 30-min treatments was randomly assigned to each subject after pain was induced (acupuncture, cryotherapy, sham cryotherapy and no treatment).

All the participants received 20 sessions of acupuncture over a 4-week period. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine attack (NDMA) assessed at 5-8 weeks after randomisation. The secondary outcomes were visual analogue scale, headache intensity and quality of life assessed at 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomisation. Expectations of the acupuncture effect were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment and categorised into five levels, with 0% the lowest and 100% the highest. Outcome improvement was first compared among the participants with different expectation levels using an analysis of variance model. The association between expectations of treatment and outcome improvement was then calculated using a logistic regression model.Patients with 100% baseline expectations did not report significantly fewer NDMA than those with 0% baseline expectations after adjusting for the covariates (at 5-8 weeks, 1.7 vs 3.9 days, p=0.987). High baseline expectations had no significant impact on improvement of the primary outcome (100% vs 0%: OR 8.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 191.65, p=0.682). However, patients with 100% post-treatment expectations reported fewer NDMA than those with 0% expectations (primary outcome: 1.3 vs 5.0 days, p<0.001) and were more likely to have a favourable response (100% vs 0%: OR 68.87, 95% CI 6.26 to 1449.73, p=0.002).

Methods Twenty-five students were randomly assigned to an electroacupuncture (n=12) group or control group (n=13) that did not receive treatment. Electroacupuncture was applied at a continuous frequency 2 Hz for 20 min once a week for 8 weeks at sites on the extremities, face, ear and scalp. The outcomes of the students treated with electroacupuncture were compared with those of the control group at the endpoint, controlling the influence of baseline scores. The instruments used were self-administered questionnaires that comprised the validated Portuguese version of the mini-sleep questionnaire (MSQ), the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Beck anxiety inventory, the Maslach burnout inventory–student survey (MBI–SS), and World Health Organization quality of life assessment – abbreviated version (WHOQOL–bref). Results The medical students treated with electroacupuncture showed a significant decrease compared with the control group for MSQ scores (p=0.04) and PSQI (p=0.006). After treatment, 75% students in the electroacupuncture group presented a good sleep quality, compared with 23.1% of the students in the control group. No significant difference on daytime sleepiness was shown by the ESS. The electroacupuncture group showed significant improvement on depressive symptoms (BDI), the emotional exhaustion and cynicism dimensions of burnout (MBI–SS) and physical health (WHOQOL–bref). Conclusions Electroacupuncture was associated with a significant reduction of stress-related symptoms, but because of the study design the authors cannot say what proportion of the reduction was due to needle stimulation.",

Methods Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a regular diet (Control group, n=8) or a HFD (n=16) for 12 weeks to induce an insulin resistance model. HFD-fed rats were divided into two groups that remained untreated (HFD group, n=8) or received electroacupuncture (HFD+EA group, n=8). EA was applied at PC6, ST36, SP6 and BL23. At the end of the experiment, fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin (FINS), serum C-peptide (C-P) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were determined. Pancreatic islet samples were subjected to histopathological examination. The thoracic aorta was immunostained with anti-rat insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) antibodies. mRNA and protein expression of IRS-1, PI3K, Akt2 and eNOS in the vascular endothelium were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Results The bodyweight increase of the HFD+EA group was smaller than that of the untreated HFD group. Compared with the HFD group, the levels of FBG, FINS, C-P and HOMA-IR in the HFD+EA group decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01). Histopathological evaluation indicated that EA improved pancreatic islet inflammation. The expression of endothelial markers, such as IRS-1, PI3K, Akt2 and eNOS, decreased in the HFD group, while EA treatment appeared to ameliorate the negative impact of diet. Conclusion EA may improve insulin resistance and attenuate endothelial dysfunction, and therefore could play a potential role in the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease through the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",

Methods We retrospectively analysed 887 treatments in 407 TMD-patients (mean age 45±1.5 years), who received microsystem acupuncture (mouth, scalp or fingers) with a focus on oral acupuncture. All patients systematically underwent palpation of specific muscular tender points and their pain rating was assessed on a four-point Likert scale (no pain to strong pain) before and after treatment. In 42 cases, the pain intensity was determined using a visual analogue scale (0–100 mm). As the data were normally distributed, analysis was performed with unpaired t-tests. Results The pterygoid muscles were most painful to palpation, with the lateral pterygoid rated moderate to strong by 76% of patients and the medial pterygoid by 48% of patients. The palpation of microsystem acupuncture points revealed the strongest sensitivity (moderate or strong pain) of the oral retromolar points at the upper jaw (83%). After treatment, the pain intensity of all tender points had significantly decreased (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of moderate to strong pain ratings was below 3% at most tender points. Overall pain intensity of the subjects (n=42) before treatment was 55.5±19.7 mm on the VAS scale and was significantly reduced to 29.6±20.9 mm (P&lt;0.001) post-treatment. Conclusions This analysis suggests microsystem acupuncture could reduce the pain intensity of TMD in the short term. Considering the increased local muscular tenderness, further investigations regarding the key role of myofascial trigger points in the occurrence of TMDs are warranted and could lead to new comprehensive treatment strategies.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at GV4/GV6 versus BL20/BL23 on the bones in ovariectomised (OVX) rats to explore the pathways that mediate the effects of EA on bone. Methods Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to one of four groups (n=10 rats each) that received sham surgery (Sham group), OVX surgery only (OVX group), OVX surgery plus EA at GV4/GV6 (GV group) and OVX surgery plus EA at BL20/BL23 (BL group). Bone turnover markers osteocalcin (OC) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b) were measured in serum, and bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae and histomorphology of the femur were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) was detected by ELISA. The expression of lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5, β-catenin, runt-related transcription factor (Runx) 2 involving Wnt/β-catenin signalling and p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 involving mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling were determined by Western blotting. Results The two EA-treated groups demonstrated increased levels of OC and the BMD of lumbar vertebrae, decreased levels of TRACP 5b and improved bone microstructure in the femur, compared with the untreated OVX group (P&lt;0.05). Histomorphology analysis showed that EA treatment significantly increased the values of the trabeculae (µm), trabecular area (%) and trabecular bone number (per mm) and reduced trabecular separation (mm), compared with the OVX group. In addition, the ratio of OPG to RANKL and LRP5, β-catenin and Runx2 expression were significantly upregulated, while the expression of phosphorylated (p)-p38 and p-JNK were downregulated in EA-treated groups compared with the OVX group. Conclusion EA attenuates PMOP and it appears that the mechanism involves the regulation of multiple targets and pathways.",

The design needed to not only ensure research consistency and replicability but also be ‘responsive’ to real world heterogeneous and evolving presentations in challenging physical settings. Background: Chronic pain is prevalent in the United States. While acupuncture is effective for chronic pain, minority, ethnically diverse and lower socioeconomic populations have limited access. Group acupuncture is proposed as a lower cost option to facilitate access in safety net settings, but research on the effectiveness of group versus individual acupuncture is lacking. Methods: We engaged a modified Delphi process with expert practitioners from diverse backgrounds who were experienced in individual and group practice. All contributions were recorded and collated for second- and third-round consensus discussions that included contributions by the trial’s research acupuncturists. Results: A ‘responsive manual’ flow chart was created with suggested sequencing that included interviews concurrent with palpation, Tui na, Gua sha, acupuncture needling, ear treatment, basic recommendations and options for departure with rationale. The manual was implemented by six research acupuncturists in five primary care settings in the Bronx, New York, with weekly team meetings to discuss manual use. There were no serious adverse events (AE) and few minor AE reported in this trial. Conclusion: A ‘responsive manual’ can be structured and implemented that is not only consistent and replicable but also flexible to accommodate the real-world clinical needs of practitioners and patients in challenging physical settings.",

The pressure release technique is one of the most recommended manual therapy techniques. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of varying durations of the pressure release technique application on latent MTrPs of the levator scapulae. Methods: In a three-arm (1:1:1 ratio), double-blinded, parallel, randomised clinical trial, 60 healthy university students (23 men, 37 women) with a mean±SD age of 20.0±2.67 years were recruited. Subjects were assigned to receive pressure release in one latent MTrP of the levator scapulae lasting 30s (T 30s ; n=17), 60s (T 60s ; n=22) or 90s (T 90s ; n=21). Active cervical range of movement (CROM), strength, pressure pain threshold (PPT) and neck pain intensity at full stretch were measured immediately before and after treatment. Results: Mixed-model analyses of variance showed statistically significant differences for PPT (P=0.045; partial Eta 2 =0.103), comparing T 60s versus T 30s (P=0.009; Cohen’s d=1.044) and T 90s versus T 30s groups (P=0.001; Cohen’s d=1.253), and for left side bending strength (P=0.043; partial Eta 2 =0.105), comparing T 90s versus T 30s (P=0.023; Cohen’s d=0.907). The rest of the comparisons did not present any significant differences (P⩾0.05). Conclusions: The 60 s and 90 s applications of the pressure release technique may be recommended to increase PPT and strength, respectively, in latent MTrPs of the levator scapulae in the short term.

However, the time course of the effects of acupuncture stimulation has not yet been thoroughly studied. Objective: To investigate the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) on glutamic acid (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and determine whether there is a temporal effect of acupuncture on the treatment of cerebral ischaemia. Methods: We performed thread occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in rats to establish an animal model of MCAO. Simultaneously, during acupuncture treatment, microdialysis was used to continuously and dynamically observe immediate alterations in amino acid metabolism with acupuncture stimulation after cerebral ischaemia in vivo in this rat model of MCAO. Results: We found that, in comparison with an untreated MCAO group, Glu content was significantly decreased during the first acupuncture stimulation and during the course of the acupuncture treatment in the MCAO+MA group (MCAO vs MCAO+MA: day 1, P=0.032; day 2, P=0.021; day 3, P=0.017). These findings were also seen after the end of treatment when acupuncture was no longer applied (MCAO vs MCAO+MA: day 7, P=0.009). Measurements of GABA content following cerebral ischaemic injury showed that GABA peaks 24 hours after damage, falls thereafter and decreases to baseline levels on day 7. In the MCAO+MA group, GABA content on days 1 to day 2 was lower than in the MCAO group (MCAO+MA vs MCAO: day 1, P=0.003; day 2, P=0.001), although it was higher than in the control group (MCAO+MA vs control: day 1, P=0.024; day 2, P=0.009). GABA content on day 3 and day 7 was higher in the MCAO+MA group than in the MCAO group and the control group (MCAO+MA vs MCAO: day 3, P=0.008; day 7, P=0.013; MCAO+MA vs control: day 3, P=0.002; day 7, P=0.009). Conclusion: Acupuncture stimulation at GV26 can effectively decrease excessive release of Glu induced by ischaemia and maintain the endogenous inhibitory activity of GABA. This phenomenon was seen during the entire course of acupuncture treatment and continued for some time after the end of acupuncture treatment.",

Interventions were made on arrival at the postanaesthesia care unit. The primary outcome was the incidence of POV within 24 h after the operation. Secondary outcomes included severity of vomiting, incidence of rescue treatment, patients’ satisfaction and the first anal exsufflation time 24 h after the operation. Results The incidence of POV within 24 h postoperative period in each group was P 33%; O 11%, A 9% and C 6%. Outcomes for all intervention groups were significantly better than that for placebo (p&lt;0.01). For the three interventions compared with placebo, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were O, NNT=5; A, NNT=5 and C, NNT=4. The secondary outcomes also demonstrated greater benefits of the combined regimen, with improvement seen in all the measures. Conclusions Ondansetron, acupuncture, and ondansetron and acupuncture combined are effective prophylaxis for POV.",

    "abstract": "Sciatica has classically been associated with irritation of the sciatic nerve by the vertebral disc and consequent inflammation. Some authors suggest that active trigger points in the gluteus minimus muscle can refer pain in similar way to sciatica. Trigger point diagnosis is based on Travel and Simons criteria, but referred pain and twitch response are significant confirmatory signs of the diagnostic criteria. Although vasoconstriction in the area of a latent trigger point has been demonstrated, the vasomotor reaction of active trigger points has not been examined. We report the case of a 22-year-old Caucasian European man who presented with a 3-year history of chronic sciatic-type leg pain. In the third year of symptoms, coexistent myofascial pain syndrome was diagnosed. Acupuncture needle stimulation of active trigger points under infrared thermovisual camera showed a sudden short-term vasodilatation (an autonomic phenomenon) in the area of referred pain. The vasodilatation spread from 0.2 to 171.9 cm(2) and then gradually decreased. After needling, increases in average and maximum skin temperature were seen as follows: for the thigh, changes were +2.6°C (average) and +3.6°C (maximum); for the calf, changes were +0.9°C (average) and +1.4°C (maximum). It is not yet known whether the vasodilatation observed was evoked exclusively by dry needling of active trigger points. The complex condition of the patient suggests that other variables might have influenced the infrared thermovision camera results. We suggest that it is important to check if vasodilatation in the area of referred pain occurs in all patients with active trigger points.",

    "abstract": "A previous study demonstrated that acupuncture increases the synthesis and reorganisation of collagen molecules in rat tendons after injury. Clinical studies have shown that acupuncture improves pain and functional activity in patients with tendinopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Recent studies have shown that acupuncture can modulate both anti-inflammatory (AI) and mechanotransduction (MT) molecular pathways. Moreover, the modulation of these pathways can increase type I collagen synthesis, which is the main factor that influences tendon biomechanical properties. Our hypothesis is that acupuncture increases synthesis and subsequent reorganisation of type I collagen during tendon healing by concomitant modulation of the Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor-κB AI pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway and the Rho/Rac-F-actin MT pathway. Increased collagen synthesis and reorganisation requires that at least one acupoint is anatomically connected with the site of the injury because of the local tenoblast MT mechanism. Confirmation of this hypothesis will increase the knowledge of acupuncture modulation of the previously mentioned molecular pathways, and such confirmation may also help to establish the relationships between the different types of acupuncture needle stimulation and the influence of acupuncture stimuli on pathway activity levels. In addition, the downstream therapeutic effects of acupuncture therapy may be established. This hypothesis can be verified in a rat tendon healing model, and subsequent clinical protocols for tendon healing can be developed and evaluated as standalone therapies or as a component of a combination therapy.",

Methods Twenty-nine female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control; untreated CRD; CRD+AEA; and CRD+sham electroacupuncture (SEA). An electromyogram (EMG) was recorded for 120 min in the conscious state. After a 30 min baseline recording, CRD was performed in untreated CRD, AEA and SEA groups and lasted for 90 min. AEA and SEA were started at 30 min and lasted for 30 min. The EMG was recorded and analysed to evaluate the severity of visceral pain, indicated by the magnitude of the vasomotor response (VMR). mRNA expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a (5-HT 1a ) receptor was measured separately in the colon and raphe nuclei using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Results No differences were seen in the baseline EMG among the four groups (p&gt;0.05). During pre-stimulation, VMR magnitude in the CRD, AEA and SEA groups increased compared with that in the control group (p&lt;0.05). During stimulation, the VMR magnitude was significantly decreased in AEA but not SEA groups relative to the (untreated) CRD group. Similarly, mRNA expression of the 5-HT 1a receptor in both the colon and raphe nuclei was lower in AEA but not SEA groups compared with the CRD group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions AEA can ameliorate CRD-induced visceral pain in rats, and increase mRNA expression of the 5-HT 1a receptor peripherally (in the colon) and centrally (in the raphe nuclei), suggesting a serotonergic mechanism of action.",

Methods A total of 40 12-week-old male Wistar rats underwent unilateral open osteotomy of the fibula to create a 2 mm gap. The rats were randomly assigned to an EA group (n=20) and a control group (n=20). In the EA group, a cathodal electrode was connected to an acupuncture needle percutaneously at the surgery site, while another acupuncture needle inserted 15 mm proximal to the surgery site was used as an anodal electrode. EA was performed 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The control group received no treatment. Some rats were killed at 3 days and 1 week after surgery and the cut end of the distal part of the fibula was surgically removed and histologically assessed. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to measure total cell count and immunohistochemical staining to assess the increase in the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-positive cells.

Methods This was a pilot prospective cohort study. Pregnant women with a diagnosis of preeclampsia were offered acupuncture and allocated into groups based on their choice: the acupuncture group (n=11) comprised women electing to receive treatment (up to 10 sessions over 2 weeks). The control group (n=11) was made up of women who declined and was matched for age, gestation at diagnosis, and parity. All women received usual care and underwent measurement of blood pressure (BP) at four time points: at baseline, at the end of the intervention, immediately before delivery, and postpartum (within 24 h). Results Patients in the acupuncture group had significantly lower BP at time of delivery, and postpartum, than patients in the control group (p&lt;0.05). The individual change in BP between baseline and the end of treatment was significantly greater in the acupuncture group versus the control group for both systolic BP (median (IQR) −8 (−3 to −14) vs +1 (−7 to +9) mm Hg, p=0.007) and diastolic BP (−3 (−1 to −3) vs +2 (−2 to +7) mm Hg, p=0.013). There were no significant differences between the groups in perinatal outcomes and no adverse effects of treatment. Conclusions Acupuncture plus usual care was associated with a greater reduction in BP than usual care alone.

Rats in the EA group received EA treatment from the day of OVX. Ten rats in each group were randomly killed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after operation. Results EA reduced urine C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen from 4 weeks after OVX, reduced C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type II collagen and body weight from 8 weeks after OVX, and increased serum 17β-oestradiol from 4 weeks after OVX compared with the OVX group (all p&lt;0.01).

Acupuncture can protect ICCs, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether miR-222, c-kit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are involved in the putative effects of acupuncture on ICC recovery. Methods: A POI model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats by colo-colic anastomosis, and then acupuncture was performed at bilateral ST36, SP6 and LR3 once daily for 3 consecutive days. C-kit protein expression in the colonic tissue adjacent to the incision site was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. mRNA levels of c-kit, eNOS and miR-222 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The levels of c-kit mRNA/protein and eNOS mRNA decreased, while miR-222 increased in the colonic tissues of POI model rats. Acupuncture treatment improved GI motility, inhibited the up-regulation of miR-222 and blocked the down-regulation of c-kit mRNA/protein and eNOS mRNA. The levels of miR-222 and c-kit were negatively correlated. Conclusion: Acupuncture at ST36, SP6 and LR3 facilitates ICC recovery and improves post-operative GI motility in part through regulation of miR-222, c-kit and eNOS.",

A systematic review was conducted to examine the quality of reporting in published studies of acupuncture in cancer according to the STRICTA (STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) guidelines. Methods: Systematic review of published research of acupuncture for symptoms of cancer and the side-effects associated with its treatment. Databases searched were: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane (all databases), Scopus, and PubMed from their inception to December 2014. Clinical trials, pilot/feasibility studies, observational studies, and case studies were included. Only full journal papers published in English were included. The quality of reporting was evaluated using STRICTA guidelines. Each included paper was assessed by two independent reviewers, with disagreements adjudicated by a third reviewer. Results: 88 papers were identified which met the inclusion criteria. The median number of STRICTA items reported in trials with a control or comparator arm (n=47) was 14 out of 17 (range 8 to 17, IQR 4). For studies without a control or comparator arm the median was 11 out of a possible 15 (range 5 to 15, IQR 3). Key weaknesses in reporting included details of other components of treatments, and details of the acupuncturist administering treatments. Conclusions: Despite the widespread use of the STRICTA guidelines in acupuncture research, adherence remains poor for a few specific items. Further research is required to explore the reasons why authors fail to report those items, and to develop strategies to improve the adherence to the guidelines.",

Objective: To examine whether electroacupuncture (EA) promotes the immune response by regulating the downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator / nuclear factor kappa B (DREAM/NF-κB) signalling pathway in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced immunosuppression, and determine the most effective frequency. Methods: Twenty-four Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with CP to establish an immunosuppression model and six mice were injected with the same volume of normal saline as a control. The 24 mice were randomly divided into four groups: manual acupuncture, 2 Hz EA treatment, 100 Hz EA treatment and alternating 2/100 Hz EA treatment. After EA treatment for 3 days, immune response, natural killer (NK) cell toxicity and the expression of cytokines and DREAM/NF-κB were assessed. Results: EA treatment, especially at alternating 2/100 Hz frequency, improved spleen and thymus indices, increased lactate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase levels, promoted concanavalin A- and lipopolysaccharide-induced splenocyte proliferation, increased NK cell toxicity and ameliorated CP-induced immunosuppression in mice. Additionally, 2/100 Hz EA treatment increased interleukin (IL)−2, IL-6, IL-12, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ levels and decreased IL-10 levels in CP-induced immunosuppressed mice. Finally, it was found that 2/100 Hz EA treatment increased p-IκBα and NF-κB expression and decreased DREAM and IκBα expression, suggesting that this treatment activates the NF-κB signalling pathway. Conclusion: 2/100 Hz EA treatment might be an effective way to enhance immune responses in CP-induced immunosuppressed mice.",

Objective: To investigate the effect of MWA on gene expression profile in the p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)-induced rat model of insomnia. Methods A rat model of insomnia was established and the animals were divided into five groups: control, PCPA (untreated), PCPA+estazolam, PCPA+MA (manual acupuncture), and PCPA+MWA. The rats were euthanased at 7 days after treatment, and hypothalamic tissue was harvested to extract total RNA for the analysis of gene expression profile.

Furthermore, ingenuity pathways analysis was used to analyse the main regulators. Results: After treatment, in rats with improved sleep, micro-array data from the follow-up phase compared with baseline showed that MWA down-regulated 11 genes compared with the control group and 16 genes compared with the PCPA group. Six genes were selected following the micro-array detection to perform quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) verification, and the results showed that the coincidence rate was up to 90%, which verified the reliability of the microarray results. Compared with the PCPA group, transcription levels of Egr 1, Btg2 and BDNF in the PCPA+MWA group were up-regulated (P&lt;0.05).

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Searches were conducted in the following electronic databases from their inception to 31 March 2018: CINAHL, MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and SPORTDiscus. Reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were hand-searched for additional studies. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in DOMS in adults measuring the pre-specified primary outcome (pain) were included. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted using pre-defined extraction forms and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) checklist. Quality of studies was evaluated based on the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Results: Five RCTs investigating laboratory-induced DOMS in the upper limbs with a total sample size of 182 healthy participants were included. Of the included studies, three reported superiority of acupuncture over no treatment in DOMS pain reduction as measured by visual analogue scale, pressure pain threshold or electrical pain threshold, while two studies yielded non-significant results. All studies demonstrated risk of bias in one or more areas, commonly lack of blinding of participants and personnel. Summary/conclusion: There is conflicting to limited evidence to support the effects of acupuncture on the relief of pain associated with DOMS. The findings were confounded by methodological limitations and reporting insufficiency. More rigorous, high-quality, and well-reported RCTs are required to further evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for DOMS.",

Methods: A narrative review of scientific literature published in English. Results: Two randomized controlled trials found that dry needling of scars (using the classic “surrounding the dragon” technique in one study and intradermal needling in a second study) was more effective than sham or control interventions with respect to scar appearance and pain. Two case reports have suggested that scar needling generates a rapid decrease in pain and improvement of mobility in scarred tissues. Another two case reports have reported positive effects of scar needling on the wound healing process. These findings are supported by an animal study examining the effect of needling on the wound healing process and the physiological mechanisms of action underlying the technique. Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence that the “surrounding the dragon” needling technique is a beneficial treatment for patients suffering from scar pain and other scar-related symptoms and can facilitate wound healing and make this process less painful. Further high-quality studies should be conducted to verify/quantify the efficacy of this method, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of action underlying the effects of scar needling and to establish an effective intervention protocol.",

Reports of adverse events (AEs) associated with acupuncture are relatively consistent, but the safety of EA has been less well reported. In this systematic review, we provide a summary of the types of AEs related to EA in clinical practice. Methods Twelve electronic databases, including those in English (PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, CENTRAL), Korean (KMbase, KISS, NDSL, KISTI, OASIS), Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu) and Japanese (J-STAGE), were systematically searched for single case studies and case series through April 2018. There were no language restrictions. We included clinical studies in which EA was used as a key intervention and in which AEs that may have been causally related to EA were reported. Results Thirty-seven studies, including 27 single case studies and 10 case series, were evaluated. The most frequently reported AEs were pallor (eight cases), skin pigmentation (eight cases), vertigo (seven cases), chest tightness (six cases), vomiting (six cases) and unconsciousness (five cases). Thirty-one cases (62%) achieved full recovery and three cases (6%) achieved partial recovery. There were also three cases of death (6%). Conclusion AEs related to EA included acupuncture-related AEs and serious AEs induced by electrical stimulation. Currently, specific stimulation conditions associated with EA-specific AEs are not identifiable due to inappropriate reporting. However, skin pigmentation, syncope or spasm, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock, cardiac emergencies, electrical burns, and potential internal organ injury are potential EA-specific AEs regarding which physicians should be cautious in clinical practice.",

Plasma levels of DA and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were assessed 1 or 4 h after reperfusion. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in intestinal tissues were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Intestinal tissue injury was assessed by observation of the pathological lesions and permeability to 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran.EA significantly increased levels of DA and lowered levels of TNF-α. EA also inhibited intestinal levels of MPO and MDA and intestinal tissue injury and decreased intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Abdominal vagotomy and intraperitoneal administration of butaclamol (but not spiperone) inhibited the effects of EA.These findings suggest that EA at ST36 could attenuate intestinal I/R-induced inflammatory injury and that the underlying mechanism may involve EA-induced increases in levels of DA, mediated by the vagus nerve and D1 receptors.",

Methods A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cognitive deficit (MICD) was established. Rats were randomly assigned into a sham-operated control group (SC group, n = 12), untreated MICD model group (MICD group, n = 12), and MICD group receiving EA treatment at GV20 and GV24 (MICD + EA group, n = 12). Results Compared to the MICD group, rats in the MICD + EA group receiving EA at GV20 and GV24 exhibited significantly shortened escape latency times and crossed the position of the platform a significantly increased number of times during the Morris water maze test on the 14th day after EA, which suggested EA could significantly improve spatial learning and memory ability. Furthermore, compared to the MICD group, functional connectivity of the left retrosplenial cortex (RSC) with the left hippocampus, left RSC, right RSC, left cingulate gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, right tegmentum of midbrain, and right visual cortex was increased in the MICD + EA group; the MICD group showed decreased functional connectivity of the left RSC with the left hippocampus, right hippocampus, left RSC, right RSC, right amygdaloid body, left visual cortex, and right visual cortex. Conclusion These findings suggest that EA at GV20 and GV24 might improve the learning and memory ability of MICD rats by increasing the functional connectivity between the RSC and hippocampus, cingulate gyrus and midbrain, which is encouraging for the potential treatment for cognitive impairment secondary to ischemia stroke.",

Methods Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service—National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database, this study identified 59,370 patients taking anti-hypertensives who had been diagnosed with hypertension between 2003 and 2006. They were divided into acupuncture and non-acupuncture groups. The follow-up period ended with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, stroke or death. After propensity score matching (PSM), there were 18,011 patients each in the non-acupuncture and acupuncture groups. We calculated the incidence rate, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for MACE, myocardial infarction, stroke and death in patients with hypertension using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. In addition, secondary outcome analyses for stroke and cardiovascular mortality were performed. Results After PSM, the HRs for MACE (0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.86), all-cause mortality (0.73, 95% CI 0.70–0.76) and myocardial infarction (0.85, 95% CI 0.79–0.92) were significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the non-acupuncture group. Moreover, the HRs for stroke-related mortality, hemorrhage stroke–related mortality, ischemic stroke–related mortality, ischemic heart disease–related mortality and circulatory system disease–related mortality were significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the non-acupuncture group. Conclusion This observational study with long-term follow-up extends the evidence base in support of the effectiveness of acupuncture for the management of hypertension and potentially reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

Methods Twelve acupuncture naive right-handed volunteers were allocated to receive three sessions of EA at LI4 in a random different order (crossover): (1) EA alone (EA); EA after injection of local anaesthetics into the deltoid muscle (EA+LA); and (3) EA after blockade of the brachial plexus (EA+NB). During each session, participants were imaged in a 3 T MRI scanner. Brain regions showing change in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal (activation) were identified. Subjective acupuncture sensation was quantified after functional MRI scanning was completed. Results were compared between the three sessions for each individual, and averaged. Results Blockade of the brachial plexus inhibited acupuncture sensation during EA. EA and EA+LA activated the bilateral thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and left putamen, whilst no significant activation was observed during EA+NB. The BOLD signal of the thalamus correlated significantly with acupuncture sensation score during EA. Conclusions Blockade of the brachial plexus completely abolishes patterns of brain activation induced by EA at LI4. The results suggest that EA activates specific brain regions through stimulation of the local nerves supplying the tissues at LI4, which transmit sensory information via the brachial plexus.

Methods PubMed, Embase and major Chinese databases were searched to identify journals of TCM from China for inclusion. The latest ‘instruction for authors’ (IFA) of each included journal was obtained and any text mentioning CONSORT or CONSORT extension papers was extracted. Subsequently, the editor of each of the included journals was surveyed about their journal's endorsement of the CONSORT recommendations and their incorporation into editorial and peer review processes. Results Sixty-three journals of TCM from China were examined. Of these, only three (5%) and one (2%) of the 63 journals mentioned the CONSORT statement and extension papers, respectively, in their IFA. Fifty-four of 63 (86%) of surveyed journals responded, with the majority of respondents being editors. Only 20% (11/54) of the respondents reported that they had any knowledge of the CONSORT statement. Only 6% (3/54) of the editors reported that they required authors to comply with the CONSORT statement or that they incorporated it into their peer review and editorial processes. Conclusions TCM journals in China endorsing the CONSORT statement constituted a small percentage of the total. The majority of editors surveyed were not familiar with the content of the CONSORT statement and extension papers. We strongly recommend that the China Periodicals Association issue a policy to promote the endorsement of the CONSORT statement and conduct relevant training for journal editors in China.",

This study investigated whether 'Governor Vessel' (GV) electroacupuncture (EA) would promote the differentiation of endogenous OPCs into oligodendrocytes by activating the retinoid X receptor γ (RXR-γ)-mediated signalling pathway.Adult rats were microinjected with ethidium bromide (EB) into the T10 spinal cord to establish a model of spinal cord demyelination. EB-injected rats remained untreated (EB group, n=26) or received EA treatment (EB+EA group, n=26). A control group (n=26) was also included that underwent dural exposure without EB injection. After euthanasia at 7 days (n=5 per group), 15 days (n=8 per group) or 30 days (n=13 per group), protein expression of RXR-γ in the demyelinated spinal cord was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In addition, OPCs derived from rat embryonic spinal cord were cultured in vitro, and exogenous 9-cis-RA (retinoic acid) and RXR-γ antagonist HX531 were administered to determine whether RA could activate RXR-γ and promote OPC differentiation.EA was found to increase the numbers of both OPCs and oligodendrocytes expressing RXR-γ and RALDH2, and promote remyelination in the remyelinated spinal cord. Exogenous 9-cis-RA enhanced the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes by activating RXR-γ.The results suggest that EA may activate RXR signalling to promote the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in spinal cord demyelination.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a condition characterised by the presence of chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain, low pain threshold and hyperalgesia. Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) may worsen symptoms in patients with FMS. Objective: The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to compare the effects of dry needling and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on pain intensity, heart rate variability, galvanic response and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ). Methods: 74 subjects with FMS were recruited and randomly assigned to either the dry needling group or the TENS group. Outcomes measures (pain intensity, heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, SpO 2 and photoplethysmography) were evaluated at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. 2×2 mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed. Results: The mixed-model ANOVAs showed significant differences between groups for the sensory dimension of pain, affective dimension of pain, total dimension of pain, visual analogue scale (VAS) and present pain intensity (PPI) (P=0.001). ANOVAs also showed that significant differences between groups were achieved for very low frequency power of heart rate variability (P=0.008) and low frequency power (P=0.033). There were no significant differences in dry needling versus TENS groups on the spectral analysis of the photoplethysmography and SpO 2 . Conclusions: This trial showed that application of dry needling therapy and TENS reduced pain attributable to MTrPs in patients with FMS, with greater improvements reported in the dry needling group across all dimensions of pain. Additionally, there were between-intervention differences for several parameters of heart rate variability and galvanic skin responses. Trial registration number: NCT02393352",

    "abstract": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates inflammation via catecholamines. Recent evidence has shown that electroacupuncture (EA) activates neuronal networks involved in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine that control systemic inflammation. In muscle, catecholamines are related to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This signaling molecule has been implicated in recovery from sustained contractile activity, which may induce muscular pain, such as that which occurs during low back pain (LBP).Our aim was to evaluate the effects of EA used for the control of LBP on the activation of the sympathetic nervous system in a randomized controlled clinical trial in athletes.Two groups of athletes with acute or chronic low back pain were studied. EA, sham EA and pharmacological treatment (diclofenac sodium) were evaluated. The outcome measures included a pain score represented by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and serum levels of catecholamines quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, blood was collected into chilled heparin tubes, placed in 96-well cell culture plates and incubated with an equal volume of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium, with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone or with catecholamines. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in the supernatants were analyzed.The results indicated that the initial pain ratings did not differ between the groups analyzed. EA induced epinephrine secretion but not norepinephrine or dopamine secretion. Although EA and pharmacological treatment did not differ in terms of pain relief, in vitro epinephrine and norepinephrine reduced TNF-α production in response to LPS stimuli.EA activates the sympathetic nervous system and induces the release of epinephrine, which could ameliorate inflammation and protect muscular tissue in addition to relieving pain.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of EA preconditioning on the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins in a CMI model of vascular regeneration. Methods: A CMI model was established by subcutaneous injection of isoprinosine hydrochloride (ISO) for 14 days in 45 Wistar rats, which had been randomly divided into a model group ( n = 15), a CMI group pretreated with sham EA for 21 days (CMI + Sham group, n = 15) and a CMI group pretreated with verum EA for 21 days (CMI + EA, n = 15) prior to modeling. An additional 15 Wistar rats received 0.9% sodium chloride via intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days (control group). Serum levels of VEGF and HIF-1α were measured by ELISA, while protein expression of VEGF and HIF-1α in the area of myocardial infarction was measured by Western blotting. The area of myocardial infarction and fibrosis of the myocardial tissue in the study groups were visualized by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining, respectively. Results: EA pretreatment improved cardiac function by regulating left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction and the ST segment voltage of the electrocardiogram. EA pretreatment promoted vascular regeneration by increasing serum levels of VEGF and HIF-1α and by increasing protein expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in the infarcted region of the myocardium, leading to a reduction in the area of myocardial infarction on HE staining and reduction of myocardial fibrosis on Masson staining. Conclusion: EA pretreatment promotes protein expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in areas of ischemic myocardium, which may represent useful biomarkers for coronary collateral establishment and offer potential targets for therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with CMI.",

Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) that received a session of DN over the semitendinosus, medial gastrocnemius, soleus and rectus femoris muscles, or to a control group (CG) that received a session of sham DN in the same muscles. The effects of DN were assessed using the timed up and go test (TUG), 10 meter walk test (10MWT), 6 minute walk test (6MWT) and myotonometry before, immediately after, and 7 days after the intervention.Thirty-three participants were analyzed aged 69.9 ± 7.2 years (mean ± SD; 39% female). There were no significant differences between the IG and CG for any outcomes. Significant differences were observed when comparing the Pre and Follow-up values in the IG for functional mobility of gait in the TUG (p = 0.049), gait speed in the 10MWT (p = 0.041) and muscle tone in the lower extremities by myotonometry (frequency (p = 0.027) and stiffness (p = 0.013)). By comparison, there were no significant within-group differences in the CG.A single session of DN had no measurable benefit compared to a single session of sham DN. Within-group changes in the IG suggested improvements in functional mobility of gait and gait speed, as well as changes in the muscle tone in the lower extremities of PD patients, which could be worthy of further exploration by future research.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is the leading cause of neurological sequelae in ischemic stroke. Recently, we reported that the anti-inflammatory mediator annexin A1 (ANXA1) favored microglial M2 polarization in brain injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate electroacupuncture (EA) treatment and its potentially ANXA1-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model of stroke.Treatment with EA consisted of dense-sparse frequencies (alternating 4 Hz sparse waves for 1.5 s and 16 Hz dense waves for 1.5 s) at CV24 and GV26. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Boc-2 (5 µM) or short hairpin RNA (sh)ANXA1 (2 µL) 3 days before EA was performed to block the effects of ANXA1.EA pretreatment enhanced expression of ANXA1 and its receptor, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), when compared to MCAO/R alone. EA treatment also rescued MCAO/R-induced deficits in neurological performance, and learning and memory, and reduced infarct volume. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that EA prevented MCAO/R-induced changes in microglial activation and morphology. EA also reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as arginase-1 (Arg-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). All EA-induced effects were either partially or completely prevented by prior administration of FPR antagonist Boc-2 or shANXA1.The current study provides strong evidence that EA treatment has protective effects against ischemic stroke in the MCAO/R mouse model and that the mechanism likely involves the promotion of M2 polarization in microglia via ANXA1.",

Serum miRNA levels were initially determined using a TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) in pooled samples. Markedly altered miRNAs in IBS-D patients were subsequently validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on individual samples. All IBS-D patients accepted the acupuncture therapy for 6 weeks. The disease severity was assessed using the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) questionnaire before and after treatment. After acupuncture, the patients' serum was re-analyzed for altered expression of the miRNAs by qRT-PCR.TLDA and qRT-PCR analysis revealed six upregulated miRNAs (miR-1305, miR-575, miR-149-5p, miR-190a-5p, miR-135a-5p, and miR-148a-3p; P < 0.05) and two downregulated miRNAs (miR-194-5p, miR-127-5p; P < 0.05) in IBS-D patients compared with healthy controls. Post acupuncture treatment, total IBS-SSS scores, severity of abdominal pain, duration of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits and disruption in quality of life decreased significantly (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the upregulated miR-148a-3p levels in IBS-D patients also decreased significantly after acupuncture (P < 0.05).The over-expression or reduced expression of several miRNAs may contribute to IBS-D pathogenesis.

Furthermore, the role of different dopamine receptors was explored through intraperitoneal injections of non-specific dopamine receptor antagonist chlorpromazine, specific dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and specific dopamine D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride hydrochloride prior to ST36 EA and CS exposure.EA at ST36 improved lung function, alleviated lung and systemic inflammatory responses by reducing inflammatory cells and cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-1β in BALF, plasma and lung tissue in this COPD mouse model. Plasma dopamine was greatly increased after EA at ST36, negatively correlated with lung histological lesions and inflammatory cytokine levels, and positively correlated with mice body weight and lung function indicators. Chlorpromazine and eticlopride hydrochloride inhibited the anti-inflammatory effect of EA at ST36, while SCH 23390 showed no neutralizing effect.EA at ST36 could alleviate inflammation in this mouse model of COPD through the dopamine D2 receptor pathway.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) is widely used as a rehabilitation method for stroke in China; however, the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) has been reported to impact anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Objective: This study investigated the role of PPAR-γ in EA-mediated effects and aimed to illuminate its possible mechanisms in cerebral I/R. Methods: In this study, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury were treated with EA at LI11 and ST36 for 30 min daily after MCAO/R for seven consecutive days. The neuroprotective effects of EA were measured by neurobehavioral evaluation, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, hematoxylin–eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. Oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, neural apoptosis and microglial activation were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting was used to assess PPAR-γ-mediated signaling. Results: We found that EA significantly alleviated cerebral I/R-induced infarct volume, decreased neurological scores and inhibited I/R-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and microglial activation. EA also increased PPAR-γ protein expression. Furthermore, the protective effects of EA were reversed by injection of the PPAR-γ antagonist T0070907.

    "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture is an unusual cause of infectious sacroiliitis. Herein, we report three new cases of pyogenic sacroiliitis deemed to be attributable to acupuncture. Case 1: A 45-year-old male underwent 8 acupuncture sessions. He developed inflammatory pain in the left buttock, fever and tachycardia 11 days after the last session. Examination revealed involvement of the left sacroiliac joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was consistent with sacroiliitis and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus . The final diagnosis was left sacroiliitis caused by S. aureus . He was treated with lincomycin. Case 2: A 55-year-old female who had undergone 10 acupuncture sessions presented with inflammatory gluteal pain 10 days after the last session. Physical examination revealed signs of sacroiliac involvement, confirmed by MRI of the pelvis. The diagnosis was right sacroiliitis complicated by myositis of the gluteal muscles caused by S. aureus . Treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and ofloxacin. Case 3: A 72-year-old female who had undergone 10 acupuncture sessions presented 5 days after the last session for inflammatory gluteal pain. On examination, left unipodal weight-bearing was impossible and the tripod sign was present. MRI and clinical findings were in favor of left sacroiliitis associated with infectious pyogenic spondylodiscitis at L4-L5 and paravertebral abscesses. She received empiric antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin and gentamycin, followed by ofloxacin. On the 14th day, the patient unexpectedly died of pulmonary embolism after developing respiratory distress. Conclusion: This case series highlights the continued need for vigilance in the clinical practice of acupuncture.",

This article is aimed at discussing some of the problems related to acupuncture research that might have contributed to this overt discrepancy. These are the effects of investigator bias, the abundance of derivatives of traditional acupuncture, the lack of standardisation of treatment and selection of acupoints, and the difficulty in blinding the investigator, patient or therapist, as well as the problems related to the choice of an appropriate placebo. Such, mostly methodological difficulties, can and must be overcome if the controversy regarding the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture is to be solved.",

    "abstract": "Why is acupuncture accepted in the East, especially for the treatment of chronic pain, but not in the West? One reason is that the modus operandi of acupuncture is not fully understood; another is the enigmatic nature of chronic pain. This article introduces a new concept of chronic pain, and suggests how acupuncture may relieve it. Chronic pain may arise from sources that are extrinsic to the nervous system (for example, ongoing injury or inflammation), but it can also be intrinsic and the result of abnormal hypersensitivity (supersensitivity) in neuropathic or partially denervated structures. Neuropathic pain typically affects the musculoskeletal system, and a pivotal component of this type of pain is muscle spasm or shortening. Spasm can cause pain localised to muscle, but sustained muscle spasm or shortening mechanically overloads tendons and their attachments, and can produce pain in these structures. Since neuropathic pain is different from nociception or inflammation, its treatment is also distinct (desensitisation of supersensitivity). Most physical treatment modalities for this type of pain, such as heat, massage or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), desensitise by reflex stimulation of the affected part via its intact innervation. However these modalities are passive and limited in scope. Stimulation ends when their application is terminated. In contrast, injection techniques, including acupuncture, are more effective and long-lasting, because the tissue injury that they produce can unleash the body's healing source of bioenergy through the current of injury. Tissue injury also releases the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which can promote healing.",

Methods A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was performed, including a meta-analysis which combined the results of trials that used adequate acupuncture treatment and used WOMAC scores to measure the effect. The internal validity (quality) and heterogeneity of studies were taken into account. Results Thirteen studies were available, of which eight, involving 2362 patients, could be combined. For both reduction of pain and improvement of function, acupuncture was significantly superior to sham acupuncture (P&lt;0.05 for all comparisons) in both the short term and the long term. Compared with no additional intervention (usual care), acupuncture was again significantly superior for pain and function. The treatment effects were maintained after taking account of quality and heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Acupuncture is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Its overall effect size is 0.8, and it can be considered instead of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients whose symptoms are not controlled by education, exercise, weight loss if appropriate and simple analgesics. Further research is necessary into the most efficient way of delivering acupuncture, and its longer term benefits.",

Methods Twenty-five patients (16 women) from a chronic pain clinic were included. Patients were asked, before examination of the external ears, if they had past or present musculoskeletal pain in any of 11 body regions. An ear map, collapsed into 11 zones representing the musculoskeletal system, was used. The ear examiner was blinded to the patients’ pain conditions, medical history and ongoing treatment. Patients communicated with the examiner only to express if tenderness was present in the external ear on palpation using a spring-loaded pressure stylus commonly used for auricular acupuncture. The degree of tenderness was registered on a 5-point scale and dichotomised (no tenderness or tenderness). Agreements between the patients’ painful body regions and tenderness in the external ear zones were presented as percentage, kappa values, sensitivity and specificity. Results The 25 patients reported 116 past or present musculoskeletal pain regions and had 110 tender ear zones. No statistically significant agreements were found between the painful body regions and the corresponding tender ear zones. Conclusions Our results did not show agreements between patients’ reported musculoskeletal pain regions and tender zones in the external ears assessed according to commonly used maps in auricular acupuncture using a pressure stylus. However, very tender points occur on the external ear in a population with chronic musculoskeletal pain.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain in women, many of whom suffer a progression of symptoms over their menstrual life. Symptoms may include combinations of abnormal visceral sensations and emotional distress. Endometriosis pain, or ‘endometrialgia’ often has a negative influence on the ability to work, on family relationships and sense of worth. Endometrialgia is often considered to be a homogeneous sensory entity, mediated by a specialised high threshold sensory system, which extends from the periphery through the spinal cord, brain stem and thalamus to the cerebral cortex. However, multiple mechanisms have been detected in the nervous system responsible for the pain including peripheral sensitisation, phenotypic switches, central sensitisation, ectopic excitability, structural reorganisation, decreased inhibition and increased facilitation, all of which may contribute to the pain. Although the causes of endometrialgia can differ (eg inflammatory, neuropathic and functional), they share some characteristics. Endometrialgia may be evoked by a low intensity, normally innocuous stimulus (allodynia), or it may be an exaggerated and prolonged response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia). The pain may also be spontaneous in the absence of any apparent peripheral stimulus. Oestrogens and prostaglandins probably play key modulatory roles in endometriosis and endometrialgia. Consequently many of the current medical treatments for the condition include oral drugs, like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, contraceptives, progestogens, androgenic agents, gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues, as well as laparoscopic surgical excision of the endometriosis lesions. However, management of pain in women with endometriosis is currently inadequate for many. Possibly acupuncture and cognitive therapy may be used as an adjunct.",

    "abstract": "Background Although substantial data have supported the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis (OA), the number of points used has varied. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of six and two acupuncture points in the treatment of knee OA. Methods A randomised trial of knee OA patients was conducted. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 35. The “six point group” received treatment at six acupuncture points, ST35, EX-LE4 ( Neixiyan), ST36, SP9, SP10 and ST34, while the “two point group” received treatment at just the first pair of points, ST35 and EX-LE4. Both groups received twice weekly electroacupuncture on 10 occasions. Electrical stimulation was carried out at low-frequency of 3 Hz to all points, with the intensity as high as tolerable. Both groups were allowed to take a 200 mg celecoxib capsule per day for intolerable pain. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, week 9 and week 13, using a Thai language version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Global assessment of change after 10 treatments was also recorded. Results Acupuncture at both six and two acupuncture points was associated with significant improvement. Mean total WOMAC score at weeks 5 and 13 of patients in both groups showed no significant difference statistically (p = 0.75 and p = 0.51). Moreover, the number of celecoxib capsules taken, global assessment of global change and body weight change of both groups also showed no statistical difference. Conclusion This evidence suggests that electroacupuncture to two local points may be sufficient to treat knee OA, but in view of some limitations to this study further research is necessary before this can be stated conclusively.",

The three most common diagnostic categories for which acupuncture was used were spinal pain (33.4%), pain (other) (25.1%) and joint pain (12.3%). About 42% of visits were not covered by health insurance carriers and hence patients had to pay themselves. For the remaining 58% of visits, health insurance carriers picked up all or part of the cost of the acupuncture treatments.The results indicate that pain is the most common reason for use of acupuncture in an academic medical centre and that women use acupuncture more than men.

Additionally, most of the reports are difficult for overseas researchers to access because they are written in Japanese and cannot be located using Medline. Purpose To review studies on acupuncture and moxibustion therapy for respiratory disease conducted in Japan. Data sources The results of a literature search using “Igaku Chuo Zasshi Web” and the Medical Online Library, both of which are Japanese databases, covering the period between 1979 and 2006. Study selection This study reviewed references cited in retrieved documents and selected original articles and case reports on acupuncture and moxibustion therapy for respiratory disease. Data extraction The search terms used were “acupuncture” and “respiratory disease”, along with “respiratory”, “asthma”, “COPD”, “bronchitis” and “common cold”. Results The study retrieved 34 papers on acupuncture treatment for respiratory disease written in Japanese (9 full papers, 19 case reports and 6 case series). The papers dealt with such conditions as asthma (14 trials), cough variant asthma (one trial), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (seven trials), chronic bronchitis (one trial), usual/idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (one trial) and the common cold (two trials). The study also found eight trials dealing with cold prevention. Conclusions A small number of reports on acupuncture and moxibustion treatment for respiratory diseases were found in the Japanese databases. Future studies must use more rigorous evaluation methods, such as randomised controlled trials, to measure the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy for treating respiratory diseases.",

However, there is little information on the effect of acupuncture on the immune function in response to exercise. Purpose The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acupuncture treatment on the mucosal immune function after a single period of intense exercise by measuring salivary immunoglobulin A (SIgA). Methods 12 healthy men (23.6±SEv 0.3 years) participated in this study with a crossover design. The subjects exercised on a bicycle equipped with an ergometer at 75% VO 2 max for 60 min. Acupuncture treatment was applied at LU6, LI4, ST36 and ST6, for 30 min after the exercise. The control treatment was rest without acupuncture and that the order of the treatment was randomised. We measured parameters including saliva flow rate, SIgA concentration, SIgA secretion rate, heart rate and plasma catecholamine concentration all before the exercise and at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 24 h after the exercise. The visual analogue scale for self-perceived tiredness and the profile of mood states questionnaires were recorded before the exercise and at 24 h after the exercise. Result Intense exercise-induced decrease of SIgA levels was attenuated by the acupuncture treatment. In contrast, the subjective fatigue score and psychological measurement were not affected by the acupuncture. Conclusion Acupuncture treatment may attenuate the decrease in SIgA level induced by intense exercise.",

It is questionable whether doctors know enough about these therapies to provide balanced and informed advice to patients and, given that most will come across patients accessing CTs, this is an area of concern.This was an exploratory study of 40 students attending a placement at a CT service within an acute hospital trust in the UK. A questionnaire was given at the start of placement to record their scepticism towards CTs on a 0-10 scale and again, on placement completion.Of the students attending, 73% (n=29) completed the questionnaire. There was a statistically significant reduction in scepticism scores assessed before and after placement (p<0.001). Of the respondents, 90% (n=26) were shown or attempted acupuncture. 76% of students reported that the placement would definitely influence the rate of CT referrals in their future practice.The placement experience provided students an opportunity to reconsider their attitudes towards CTs. The study was limited to one site and students independently elected to participate in the experience. Similar exposure could be of value to the wider medical student population, ultimately leading to more informed advice available to patients. Future research should include greater numbers, which could include a multi-site study.",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture received a positive recommendation in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline for low back pain (LBP). However, no such recommendation was forthcoming in the NICE clinical guideline for osteoarthritis (OA). Importantly, the two guidelines adopted different treatment comparators in their economic analyses of acupuncture; in the LBP guideline ‘usual care’ was used (with no consideration of placebo/sham interventions), whereas ‘sham acupuncture’ was the comparator in the OA guideline. Objective To analyse the implications of using different control group comparators when estimating the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture therapy. Methods The NICE OA economic analysis for acupuncture was replicated using ‘usual care’ (ie, no placebo/sham component) as the treatment comparator. A ‘transfer-to-utility’ technique was used to transform Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis scores into EQ-5D utility scores to allow quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains to be estimated. QALY estimates were combined with direct incremental cost estimates of acupuncture treatment to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results When ‘usual care’ was used as the treatment comparator, ICER point estimates were below £20 000 per QALY gained for each acupuncture trial analysed in the OA clinical guideline. In the original analysis, using placebo/sham acupuncture as the treatment comparator, ICERs were generally above £20 000 per QALY gained. Conclusion The treatment comparator chosen in economic evaluations of acupuncture therapy is likely to be a strong determinant of the cost-effectiveness results. Different comparators used in the OA and LBP NICE guidelines may have led to the divergent recommendations in the guidelines.",

To overcome these concerns, many students join an undergraduate study group (Acupuncture League) where they have more time to learn. We also describe the presence of foreign medical students who, since 2000, have enrolled in a course of 150 h in an exchange programme.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To provide an in-depth analysis of seven well-reported studies that examined electrodermal activity (EDA) at acupuncture points with regard to three commonly held tenets of acupuncture: (1) EDA at pathology-related acupuncture points is distinguishable from non-pathology-related acupuncture points; (2) EDA at acupuncture points can assist in diagnosing and monitoring therapeutic progress; and (3) EDA at acupuncture points is able to identify substances that are either therapeutically beneficial or toxic to an individual. Methods Seven of 29 studies that scored &gt;50% on their quality of reporting 54 essential technical and clinical details of EDA testing in human patients were identified from a previous literature review. Fourteen categories of data were extracted from these seven studies for further discussion. Results Two studies compared EDA at pathology-related auricular acupuncture points to non-pathology-related sites. Two studies correlated EDA measurements at sites other than auricular acupuncture points with the presence of specific medical conditions. The final three studies assessed changes in EDA at acupuncture points on the fingers and toes when different substances were placed in the electrical circuit with the patient. Conclusions This review highlights the heterogeneity of approaches to EDA assessments and the discrepancies between common clinical practice and the scientific evidence to support that practice. It also provides pilot data that suggest EDA testing at auricular acupuncture points may distinguish pathology-related acupuncture points from non-pathology-related points; decreased skin conductance correlates with tiredness or low energy; and EDA testing at the Jing-Well acupuncture points, on the tips of the fingers and toes, may assist in monitoring effectiveness of acupuncture treatment. The evidence does not support the use of VEGA testing for allergic status.",

    "abstract": "Needling sensation has been considered by many acupuncturists to be an important component of acupuncture since the early classical texts. From a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, needling sensation, de qi , is a composite of unique sensations interpreted as the flow of Qi or ‘the arrival of vital energy’. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is successful only when de qi is experienced.\n\nFrom a medical acupuncture perspective, needling sensation is a sensation mediated by sensory afferent nerves. Although the perception of needling sensation may vary in individuals and with manual technique, this distinct sensation is generally characterised by soreness, numbness, heaviness, distension and aching in the deep tissues surrounding the inserted needle.1–3 Thus, the needling sensation is not a single but a composite sensation that is generated from the activation of various sensory receptors and their afferent fibres in acupuncture sites—in particular, small fibre-innervated nociceptors and myelinated fibre-innervated mechanoreceptors.4 It has recently been hypothesised that numbness, heaviness and distension are elicited when manual manipulation is performed at acupuncture sites rich in muscle spindles and tendon organs, whereas the sensation evoked in sites rich in receptors is characterised by aching and soreness.5\n\nStudies by Hui and coworkers have shown that acupuncture stimulation induces deactivation of a limbic–paralimbic–neocortical network (LPNN) and activation of somatosensory brain regions. On the other hand, when acupuncture induced sharp pain, there was an activation of LPNN. Tactile stimulation induced greater activation of the somatosensory regions but less extensive deactivation of the LPNN. These results imply that acupuncture mobilises the anticorrelated functional networks of the brain to mediate its actions.6\n\nThe process of eliciting Qi with needles is experienced by both patient and acupuncturist. Patients experience de qi as multiple unique sensations at the needle site itself and around the …",

The standard General Linear Model (GLM) approach and multi-conditions analysis were used.Results from the multi-conditions analysis were different from those from the standard GLM analysis. We found that the neural signal of the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical system after acupuncture stimulus lasted longer than the putative period. Furthermore, the fMRI signal changes in the occipital cortex showed different temporal patterns between GB37 and the non-meridian point.Owing to the sustained effect of acupuncture, standard GLM analysis may be unsuitable for 'on-off' design acupuncture studies and lead to uncertain and contradictory results. The findings from this study suggest that acupuncture at GB37 can induce complex brain activity in the vision cortex.

With its use in the public health system supported by legislation since 1988, its recognition as a medical specialty in 1995 enabled the introduction of an annual board examination and the creation of an official Medical Residency Programme. Since then, medical acupuncture has developed considerably, mostly through its massive spread into the Brazilian public health system. Brazil is the only country outside China that has created a Medical Residency Programme on Acupuncture. The 2-year programme consists of 5760 training hours, beginning with major clinical areas (internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics and gynaecology) during 24 weeks in the first year. The residents study and practice acupuncture using the traditional Chinese Medicine approach and also the biomedical model. Specialists educated by this programme are therefore expected to have an optimum knowledge of both Western and Eastern medicine. Since it was first created, nine public health institutions have adopted the residency programme on acupuncture so, rather than being an alternative therapy, acupuncture has become an easily accessible and well-accepted conventional medical resource in Brazil.",

Autonomic responses were measured by recording the skin conductance response (SCR) throughout acupuncture stimulation.

Results After acupuncture stimulation, SCR significantly increased and there were greater individual differences in enhanced sympathetic activations to acupuncture stimulation. Changes in SCR correlated with scores for the painful sensation domain of the AFS.

Once activated, the emetic centre responds poorly to antiemetic drugs, which makes the treatment of PONV difficult.\n\nThe choice of anaesthetic is an important consideration in the prevention of PONV.

Despite these circumstances, there has been little exploration of the interface between acupuncture providers and conventional primary healthcare practitioners in rural and regional Australia. Methods A 27-item questionnaire was sent by post in the second half of 2010 to all 1486 general practitioners (GPs) currently practising in rural and regional Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, Australia to explore their practices and attitudes to a variety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices. Their responses on other therapies have been published previously; this report covers acupuncture. Results A total of 585 GPs completed the questionnaire; 49 were returned as ‘no longer at this address’, resulting in an adjusted response rate of 40.7%. Two-thirds of GPs (68.3%) referred patients to an acupuncturist at least a few times per year, while only 8.4% stated that they would not refer patients to an acupuncturist under any circumstances. GPs being older (OR=6.08), GPs being women (OR=2.94), GPs practising in a rural rather than remote area (OR=6.25), GPs having higher levels of self-reported knowledge of acupuncture (OR=5.54), the use of complementary medicine (CAM) by a GP for their personal health (OR=2.37), previous prescription of CAM to other patients (OR=2.99), lack of other treatment options (OR=4.31) and GPs using CAM practitioners as the major source of their CAM information (OR=3.05) were all predictive of increased referral to acupuncture among rural GPs.

    "abstract": "De Quervain's disease is a painful stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal compartment of the hand affecting the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, caused mainly by overuse. Conventional treatments include rest, immobilisation, oral anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection and even surgery, but none of these is established as clearly effective. Acupuncture is rarely mentioned and the points suggested are rather general-regional, tender and ah shi points. Tendinopathy is almost always associated with problems in the relevant muscles and this paper calls attention to the correct identification and needling of the affected muscles, in order to increase the specificity of acupuncture treatment.",

Three days following injection, the distribution of motor and sensory neurons labelled with AF488-CTB was examined in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) under a fluorescent microscope.For both types of injection, labelled motor and sensory neurons were distributed on the side ipsilateral to the injection in the spinal cord and DRG between spinal levels C5 and T1. The number of labelled motor neurons following intramuscular injection was significantly higher than subcutaneous injection. By contrast, the number of labelled sensory neurons following subcutaneous injection was significantly higher in number and extended over a greater number of spinal segments compared to intramuscular injection.These data indicate that the motor and sensory innervation of muscle and subcutaneous tissue beneath LI11 differ, and suggest that acupuncture signals induced by deep and superficial needling stimulation may be transmitted through different neural pathways.",

MA was applied to the right tibialis anterior muscle (TA) for 1 min using a stainless steel acupuncture needle. In eight rats, high-performance liquid chromatography with the microdialysis technique was used to measure local extracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine in the TA. In the remaining 32 rats, fluorescent microspheres (15 µm in diameter) were used to measure MBF in the TA following pre-treatment with either the P2 receptor antagonist suramin (100 mg/kg intra-arterially) or saline (control) (n=16 each). Rats receiving MA (Suramin+MA and Saline+MA groups, n=8 each) were compared with untreated rats (Suramin and Saline groups, n=8).MA significantly increased the local extracellular concentration of ATP, ADP, and adenosine (p<0.05, before MA vs 30 min after MA). In addition, MA significantly increased MBF in rats pre-treated with saline or suramin (p<0.01, Saline vs Saline+MA; p<0.05, Suramin vs Suramin+MA, respectively). However, suramin significantly suppressed this MA-induced increase in MBF (p<0.05, Saline+MA vs Suramin+MA).These results suggest that both ATP and ADP partially contribute to the MA-induced increase in MBF via P2 receptors. However, further studies are needed to clarify the contributions of other vasodilators.",

Method Cancer patients attending oncology clinics at a university teaching hospital were invited to participate in the evaluation of acupuncture services from June 2014 to May 2015. Patients had a prior diagnosis of cancer (albeit at different stages) and were planning to receive, or were already receiving, systemic and/or radiation cancer treatment. Results The majority (81%) of participants indicated that they would consider the use of acupuncture during their cancer treatment. The most common reasons given for not considering acupuncture included adequate control of symptoms already with medical treatment, inconvenient clinic timing, and needle phobia. The main reasons given for considering acupuncture use included its perceived capability of reducing fatigue, boosting energy levels, improving immune function, and reducing pain and anxiety. Patients considering acupuncture use also demonstrated significantly higher levels of stress (p&lt;0.001), anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.001), fatigue (p&lt;0.001), and lower global quality of life (p&lt;0.01) compared to those who were not considering acupuncture. Conclusions The findings show that demand for acupuncture by cancer patients is high. A substantial proportion of cancer patients intend to use acupuncture to manage cancer and/or cancer treatment-related symptoms. Discussion with patients about acupuncture and other complementary therapies during the consultation may improve cancer care.",

However, evidence of effectiveness to support the application of electroacupuncture (EA) during the process of ischaemia is scarce. Objectives To investigate dynamic changes in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression as well as its association with neurological status in rats subjected to acute ischaemic stroke and EA intervention. Methods Forty adult male rats were randomly divided into three groups that received sham surgery (Control group, n=10) or underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion and EA (MCAO+EA group, n=15) or minimal acupuncture as a control treatment (MCAO+MA group, n=15). The rats in the MCAO+EA and MCAO+MA groups received EA or acupuncture without any electrical current, respectively, during 90 min of ischaemia. Rats in the Control group received the same surgical procedure but without MCAO. EA involved electrical stimulation of needles inserted into the quadriceps at 50 Hz frequency and 3 mA current intensity. Neurological status was evaluated on postoperative day 1, and cerebral infarction volume (IV) and HIF-1α expression 24 hours later. Results Neurological scores were improved and cerebral IV was decreased in the MCAO+EA group compared to the MCAO+MA group (both p&lt;0.05). Moreover, HIF-1α expression was higher in the MCAO+EA group versus the MCAO+MA group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions EA enhanced recovery of neurological function, decreased cerebral IV and increased HIF-1α expression in ischaemic rats. Further research is needed to determine whether EA is effective for stroke treatment through the stimulation of muscle contraction.",

    "abstract": "Background: Moxibustion treatment has been found to ameliorate clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and constipation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Herein we investigated the mechanisms underlying the use of moxibustion in a rat model of IBS. Methods: In our study, an IBS model was established in rats by colorectal distension (CRD) stimulus and mustard oil enema. The rats were randomly divided into a normal group, model group, mild moxibustion group, electroacupuncture group, probiotic group and dicetel group. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores were determined within 90 min of the last treatment. The expression of GDNF/GFRα3 protein and mRNA in the colon and spinal cord were detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Results: The IBS model rats had significantly higher AWR scores than the normal group ( P&lt;0.01). After mild moxibustion treatment, the AWR score was significantly reduced (20 mm Hg, P&lt;0.05; 40 mm Hg, 60 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg, P&lt;0.01). The model group showed significantly more colonic glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF/GFRα3 (GDNF family receptor α3) protein and mRNA expression in the colon and spinal cord than the normal group ( P&lt;0.01). Compared with the model group, the expression of GDNF/GFRα3 protein and mRNA in the colon and spinal cord of the rats were significantly decreased in the mild moxibustion group (colon: GDNF and GFRα3 protein, P&lt;0.01; GDNF and GFRα3 mRNA, P&lt;0.01; spinal cord: GDNF and GFRα3 protein, P&lt;0.01; GDNF mRNA, P&lt;0.05, GFRα3 mRNA, P&lt;0.01).

Methods: A total of 54 patients with unilateral PFPS aged 20–30 years were selected randomly from patients referred to physical therapy clinics of Babol University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Twenty-seven patients were allocated to either IC or DN groups. Three sessions of treatment were applied over 1 week with follow-up at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. Primary outcome measures comprised the Kujala questionnaire score for functional status, numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) for pain intensity and pressure pain threshold (PPT) for sensitivity to mechanical stimulation; these were measured and recorded before treatment and 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after the last treatment session. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the between-group comparisons of any variables at the various follow-up points. Both groups (n = 27 participants each) had significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) in pain, functional status and PPT values at follow-up. Conclusions: There were no differences in markers of pain, function or pressure sensitivity over a 3-month follow-up period between patients with PFPS treated with DN and IC. Temporal improvements in both groups suggested that the two techniques may be similarly effective for the treatment of PFPS.",

Methods Four English (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) and three Chinese (China Science Journal Citation Report (VIP), Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)) language databases were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing four approaches: EA, TENS, medication and sham/placebo controls. The primary outcome was pain intensity, measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), numeric-rating scale (NRS) or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale. Classic pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted to integrate the treatment efficacy/effectiveness through direct and indirect evidence. Results Thirteen studies were included. In the direct meta-analyses, there was no statistically significant overall effect of EA (mean difference (MD) −4.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.51 to 2.96), while the overall effects of high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (H-TENS) (MD −16.63, 95% CI −24.57 to −8.69) and medication (MD −7.12, 95% CI −12.07 to −2.17) were statistically significant. In the network meta-analyses, the relative effect of the EA and H-TENS groups (MD 5.07, 95% CI −11.33 to 21.93) on pain control did not differ. Meanwhile, H-TENS demonstrated the highest probability of being the first best treatment, and EA had the second highest probability. Conclusion The present analysis indicated that both EA and TENS exert significant pain relieving effects in KOA. Among the four treatments, H-TENS was found to be the optimal treatment choice for the management of KOA pain in the short-term, and EA the second best treatment option. Given that the application of TENS is recommended by various international guidelines for the treatment of KOA, EA may also represent a potentially effective non-pharmacologic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Evidence shows that the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway participates in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Our previous study revealed that electroacupuncture (EA) attenuated neuropathic pain via activation of alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) in the spinal cord. However, whether 2 Hz EA alleviates neuropathic pain by regulating the downstream molecules JAK2/STAT3 has not been fully clarified. Methods: Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was used as a marker of mechanical allodynia in rats with spared nerve injury (SNI). After applying 2 Hz EA on day 3, 7, 14 and 21 post-surgery, spinal expression of JAK2, STAT3 and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 was examined using quantitative reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Intrathecal injection of the α7nAChR antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (α-Bgtx) was used to further explore the mechanism underlying the effects of 2 Hz EA on expression of JAK2/STAT3 in SNI rats. Results: It was found that levels of spinal STAT3 and IL-6 mRNA, as well as levels of phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, p-STAT3 and IL-6 protein, were markedly increased in SNI rats. 2 Hz EA attenuated the SNI-induced up-regulation of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and IL-6 expression in the spinal cord. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of α-Bgtx (1.0 μg/kg) not only inhibited the effect of 2 Hz EA on mechanical hypersensitivity but also ameliorated the down-regulation of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and IL-6 expression induced by 2 Hz EA. Conclusion: This study revealed that 2 Hz EA attenuated SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and the concomitant up-regulation of spinal JAK2, STAT3 and IL-6 in SNI rats, suggesting that suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway might be the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of 2 Hz EA on neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this research are, first, to establish if the extraordinary acupuncture meridian known as Chōng $$ Penetrating Vessel or Sea of Blood, is in essence a description of certain macroscopic parts of the underlying vascular system and, second, by extension, to show that it is likely that cadaveric dissection would have been used as a tool to arrive at this understanding. Generally accepted scholarly opinion holds that the ancient Chinese rarely used dissection in order to explore the anatomy of the human body, and that the meridians are therefore invisible metaphysical structures corresponding to lines drawn on the body. However, the seminal text, ‘The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine’, describes using palpation to examine the living and dissection to examine the dead. This implies that the original authors of these texts were observing physical structures visible to the naked eye. Dissection has therefore been used to compare the descriptions of the Chōng meridian in ‘The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine’ with the vascular anatomy of the human body. Fifteen acupuncture points located on various different ordinary meridians but bearing the same name, Chōng $$ were also examined to see if they bore any relationship to the vascular system. The dissections clearly show that the Chōng meridian correlates to certain main blood vessels in the body, in particular the vena cava. Similarly, most Chōng acupuncture points have a strong correspondence with blood vessels, marking terminal arteries on the hands, feet and forehead and anastomoses on the face, body and feet. These findings strongly suggest that the ancient Chinese texts relating to this meridian are likely to have been a ‘description’ of the vascular system. Furthermore, the ancient Chinese apparently had a high degree of anatomical skill in the practice of dissection and acute powers of observation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the consequences and costs of acupuncture in general medical practice for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) in Korea.A multicentre observational study was performed. Outpatients with CLBP who received at least one acupuncture session in a Korean Medicine clinic during the study period were included and followed up for 3 months. All patients received regular acupuncture treatments in accordance with the doctors' discretion. The consequences in terms of effects included condition-specific outcomes and preference-based outcome. For cost analysis, the cumulative resource use for direct medical costs at each research clinic during the study period and direct patient data using the self-reported healthcare utilisation questionnaires were used.A total of 157 patients were eligible to participate and 105 were finally included. Significant improvements in condition-specific and preference-based measures were observed after acupuncture treatment. An average of approximately $146 (£93) per patient was reported for direct medical costs in each clinic for 1 month and $231 (£148) for 3 months. Other medical expenses related to CLBP were reduced during this period.The use of acupuncture to manage CLBP in general clinical practice in Korea inexpensively improved pain, functional disability and quality of life. The study results are meaningful and consistent with the results of previous trials performed in other European countries but the power of the study is not strong, having major design weaknesses. A large-scale cohort or registry based on practice may be helpful to strengthen the evidence of the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture.",

Acupuncture is popular among cancer patients and has previously been shown to improve symptoms in a range of musculoskeletal complaints. Aim To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the management of AIMSS in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Methods A literature search was carried out for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for AIMSS in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Characteristics of trials and outcomes were extracted from the retrieved articles, which were also assessed for risk of bias and quality of reporting. Results Four RCTs were retrieved of sample size 32–67 (totalling 190 participants). Compliance with treatment was high and rates of adverse events were low. Of the three two-arm RCTs, two found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture and one found that acupuncture was statistically superior to sham acupuncture. The fourth RCT, which incorporated three arms, found acupuncture and sham acupuncture to be statistically superior to usual care but there was no difference between true and sham acupuncture. Three trials that used non-penetrating sham as the control found no effect of acupuncture over sham, but the one trial that used superficial needle insertion found acupuncture to be superior. Conclusions Acupuncture is safe and results in improvement in AIMSS symptoms, but similar benefits are also elicited by non-penetrating sham acupuncture. Future research should seek to establish the durability of improvements.",

An outcome study of a tobacco-free 90-day inpatient dual-diagnosis treatment programme that uses several evidenced-based treatments in addition to ear acupuncture (acudetox) was undertaken to determine overall treatment effectiveness. Methods Between January 2009 and December 2011, 231 patients were treated in the programme, 88% with nicotine dependence and 79% with personality disorder diagnoses. All patients completing the programme were invited to enrol in a 1-year follow-up study in which they responded to monthly questionnaires to assess outcomes. Results 185 patients (80%) successfully completed the programme. There was no correlation between successful programme completion and gender, race, age, primary drug dependence diagnosis or primary psychiatric diagnosis. The use of acudetox was positively correlated with successful completion (p=0.006). Of the 78 patients with BPD, 100% of men and 83% of women successfully completed the programme. Their use of acudetox was positively correlated with successful completion (p=0.026). At the end of the year, 140 questionnaires were returned: 51 patients with BPD reported outcomes similar to the group as a whole, with 55% sober and doing well. Conclusions The use of acudetox was positively correlated with both successful completion of the programme for those with BPD as well as successful tobacco cessation, which ultimately improves the ability to maintain sobriety.",

A 62-year-old male had previously undergone a lower left arm amputation following an electrical accident. Using functional MRI, we investigated brain responses to acupuncture stimulation in the aforementioned amputee under three conditions: (a) intact hand, (b) prosthetic hand (used by the patient), and (c) fake fabric hand. The patient described greater de qi sensation when he received acupuncture stimulation in his prosthetic hand compared to a fake hand, with both stimulations performed in a similar manner. We found enhanced brain activation in the insula and sensorimotor cortex in response to acupuncture stimulation in the amputee's prosthetic hand, while there was only minimal activation in the visual cortex in response to acupuncture stimulation in a fake hand. The enhanced brain responses to acupuncture stimulation of the patient's prosthetic hand might be derived from cortical reorganisation, as he has been using his prosthetic hand for over 40 years. Our findings suggest the possible use of acupuncture stimulation in a prosthetic hand as an enhanced sensory feedback mechanism, which may represent a new treatment approach for phantom limb pain.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that transcutaneous electrical acupuncture stimulation (TEAS) is effective in improving orthostatic tolerance (OT). The purpose of this study was to determine if TEAS treatment can attenuate cardiovascular deconditioning induced by a 4-day -6° head-down bed rest (HDBR).Fourteen healthy male subjects were randomly allocated to a control group (control, n=6, 4 days HDBR without countermeasures) and a TEAS treatment group (TEAS, n=8, 4 days HDBR with TEAS at Neiguan (PC6) for 30 min each day for 4 consecutive days during HDBR). OT, plasma hormones, plasma volume and heart rate variability were assessed before and after HDBR. Cardiac function and cerebral blood flow were measured before, during and after HDBR.The data showed that TEAS treatment mitigated the decrease in OT that was observed in the control group and cardiac function, alleviated autonomic dysfunction, and partially prevented plasma volume reduction after HDBR. Angiotensin II and aldosterone were significantly increased by 129.3% and 133.3% after HDBR in the TEAS group (p<0.05).These results indicate that 30 min of daily TEAS treatment at PC6 is partially effective in maintaining OT, probably due to increased plasma volume-regulating hormones and activation of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. TEAS treatment appears effective at reducing cardiovascular deconditioning induced by HDBR for 4 days.NCT02300207.",

Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure mRNA expression of Wnt3a, β-catenin and Sox2. Western blots were performed to determine the expression levels of WNT3a, β-Catenin and SOX2. Results Wnt3a mRNA was upregulated in the 7-day and 14-day acupuncture subgroups compared with the corresponding model subgroups (p&lt;0.05). β-catenin expression was significantly increased in the 7-day and 14-day acupuncture subgroups compared with the corresponding model subgroups (p&lt;0.01).

However, to our knowledge, it remains unknown whether EA could alleviate bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of EA pretreatment on bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest and outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in rats.24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: EA (n=12), and minimal acupuncture (MA) (n=12). Rats in both groups were needled at bilateral PC6, ST36, and ST40. Needles in the EA group were electrically stimulated for 60 min. ECG and invasive arterial blood pressure measurements were recorded. Two hours after EA or MA, 10 mg/kg bupivacaine was infused intravenously at a rate of 5 mg/kg/min in all rats. Rats suffering cardiac arrest were immediately subjected to CPR. At the end of the experiment, arterial blood samples were taken from surviving rats for blood gas analysis.The time from bupivacaine infusion until 20% prolongation of the QRS and QT interval, and the time to cardiac arrest, were notably increased among the rats pretreated with EA. Moreover, EA pretreatment significantly improved mean arterial pressure and heart rate at all monitored points after bupivacaine infusion. The proportion of animals surviving was higher in the EA group (9/12) than the MA group (3/12) at the end of experiment (p=0.039).Tolerance to bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity appeared to be increased following EA pre-treatment.

    "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the antidepressant effects of auricular intradermal acupuncture (AIA) of areas innervated by both the auricular branch of the vagus nerve and the trigeminal nerve. Methods: Forty-nine patients with depression were randomly allocated into an AIA group ( n = 25) and a sham AIA group ( n = 24). Both groups received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as conventional treatment. The AIA group received AIA stimulation, and the sham AIA group received sham AIA, which constituted being subjected to an attached needle that did not penetrate the skin. The needles were retained for 4 h each session, with five sessions a week for a total duration of 2 weeks. The outcomes were assessed by the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-17), five factors (sleep disorder, retardation, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety/somatization, and weight) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) at weeks 0, 1, and 2. Results: Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to the AIA ( n = 27) and sham AIA group ( n = 27), of whom 25 patients in the AIA and 24 patients in the sham AIA group were analyzed. AIA-treated patients displayed a significantly greater reduction from baseline in HAMD-17 scores ( p = 0.03) and SDS scores ( p = 0.02) at week 2 compared to patients receiving sham AIA. The AIA intervention also produced a higher rate of clinically significant responses in sleep disorders ( p = 0.07) compared to sham AIA. No adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusion: According to the findings of this preliminary study, AIA appears to have additional value compared to SSRIs alone in treating patients with depressive disorder.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with poor sleep. This study examined the effects of acupuncture versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on serum BDNF and sleep outcomes in cancer survivors with insomnia. Methods: This was an exploratory analysis of a randomized clinical trial (n = 160) comparing acupuncture versus CBT-I for cancer survivors with insomnia. Interventions were delivered over 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and week 8. Serum BDNF was evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sleep was evaluated with the insomnia severity index and consensus sleep diary. Pearson correlations between BDNF and sleep outcomes were calculated. Data analysis was limited to 87 survivors who provided serum samples. Results: Among 87 survivors, the mean age was 61.9 (SD: 11.4) years, 51.7% were women, and 24.1% were non-White. Mean serum BDNF did not significantly increase in acupuncture (n = 50) or CBT-I (n = 37) groups. When analysis was restricted to patients with low baseline BDNF (i.e. levels below the sample median of 47.1 ng/mL), the acupuncture group (n = 22) demonstrated a significant 7.2 ng/mL increase in mean serum BDNF (P = 0.03), whereas the CBT-I group (n = 21) demonstrated a non-significant 2.9 ng/mL increase (P = 0.28). Serum BDNF was not significantly correlated with sleep outcomes (all P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Among cancer survivors with insomnia and low baseline BDNF, acupuncture significantly increased serum BDNF levels; however, the clinical significance of this finding requires further investigation.

    "abstract": "Objective: To compare the clinical effects of needling interventions eliciting local twitch responses (LTRs) versus needling without eliciting LTRs when applied to muscle trigger points (TrPs) associated with spinal pain of musculoskeletal origin. Databases and data treatment: Electronic databases were searched for randomized or non-randomized clinical trials where one group received needling intervention where LTRs were elicited and was compared with another group receiving the same intervention without elicitation of LTRs in spinal pain disorders associated with TrPs. Outcomes included pain intensity, pain-related disability, and pressure pain thresholds. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool or ROBINS-I tool, methodological quality was assessed with the PEDro score, and quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Six trials were included. The application of a needling intervention eliciting LTRs was associated with a significant reduction in pain intensity immediately after treatment (mean difference (MD): −2.03 points, 95% confidence interval (CI): −3.77 to −0.29; standardized MD (SMD): −1.35, 95% CI: −2.32 to −0.38, p = 0.02) when compared to the same needling intervention without elicitation of LTRs. No effect at short-term follow-up (MD: −0.20 points, 95% CI: −1.46 to 1.06, p = 0.75) was observed. No significant differences based on elicitation or non-elicitation of LTRs were found in related disability (SMD: −0.05, 95% CI: −0.41 to 0.30, p = 0.77) or pressure pain thresholds (MD: 23.39 kPa, 95% CI: −13.68 to 60.47, p = 0.22). Discussion: Low-level evidence suggests an immediate effect of obtaining LTRs during needling interventions on pain intensity, with no significant effects on related disability or pressure pain sensitivity in spinal pain disorders associated with muscle TrPs.

    "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to reduce cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VaD) patients. However, the mechanism of action remains unknown.The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays an important role in apoptosis. Herein, we focused on whether EA can inhibit apoptosis and alleviate cognitive impairment by regulating the JNK signaling pathway using a mouse model of VaD induced by modified bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo).In experiment I, 60 mice were randomly divided into a Sham group, BCCAo group, BCCAo + EA group, BCCAo + Sham-EA group, BCCAo + SP group (receiving the selective JNK inhibitor SP600125) and BCCAo + SP + EA group. Morris water maze tests, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effect of the EA intervention on VaD. In experiment II, 30 mice were randomly divided into a Sham group, BCCAo group, BCCAo + EA group, BCCAo + SP group and BCCAo + SP + EA group. Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to detect protein and mRNA expression of key factors in the JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus.EA, SP600125 and EA + SP600125 significantly inhibited hippocampal apoptosis and improved cognitive impairment in VaD model mice. There were no significant differences between the BCCAo group and the BCCAo + Sham-EA group. EA, EA + SP600125 and SP600125 inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and caspase-3. EA and EA + SP600125 promoted protein and mRNA expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in the hippocampus of VaD mice and inhibited protein and mRNA expression of activator protein (AP)-1, p53 and Bax.EA can reverse cognitive deficits and inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in VaD model mice, at least partially through inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway and regulation of apoptosis signals.",

The aim of the present review was to identify any available literature on the potential benefits of DN in pwMS. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase/Ovid, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science and PEDro databases and at ClinicalTrials.gov. The search results were limited to studies published between 2000 and 2023 without language restrictions. All articles reporting on the application of DN (defined as the use of a needle to target myofascial trigger point(s) without injection) in pwMS were included. Studies related to traditional medicine were excluded. Two reviewers independently investigated the quality of reporting based on Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Data on the effects of DN on muscle spasticity, pain intensity, mobility and other reported outcomes in pwMS were extracted and analyzed. Results: Four original articles (two case reports and two case series) and one conference paper reporting the findings of a randomized controlled trial randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included. The RCT was small (n = 16 participants) and sham-controlled with no significant differences between groups. In all four case reports/series, reduced spasticity was observed following DN treatment in pwMS. Findings with respect to other outcomes (including pain intensity, mobility, quality of life, manual dexterity and disability reduction) were mixed. Conclusion: Although no firm conclusions can be drawn from these uncontrolled case reports/series, DN for pwMS appears feasible and (based on limited clinical observation) may have potential as an adjunct therapeutic method to address spasticity in pwMS. However, the quantity and quality of available data are extremely limited. There is a need for high-quality studies of DN (ideally adequately sized RCTs with a low risk of bias) to further explore its effectiveness in the MS population.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the influence of acupuncture expectancy on fertility outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) receiving active or control acupuncture with or without clomiphene. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome Acupuncture plus Clomiphene Trial (PCOSAct), which was randomized controlled trial that recruited 1000 infertile patients with PCOS and randomly allocated them to receive active acupuncture or control acupuncture with or without clomiphene. Acupuncture expectancy data (measured on a scale from 4 to 20 points) were available in 827 women, who were subdivided into low expectancy and high expectancy groups (with scores &lt;16 or ⩾16 points, respectively) after the third session of active or control acupuncture treatment. Anthropometric and endocrine parameters and fertility outcomes were compared. Kaplan–Meier curves were employed to evaluate the time to ovulation and live birth and a Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting by body mass index (BMI) and treatment group allocation in PCOSAct. Results: 373 and 454 patients were identified as having low and high expectancy, respectively. Compared with the low expectancy group, patients with high expectancy had been attempting to conceive for a shorter period (18 vs 24 months) and were more likely to have a prior history of acupuncture treatment (16.7% vs 10.7%). They also had an earlier menarche (13 vs 14 years), a higher BMI (23.8 vs 23.5 kg/m 2 ) and a lower estradiol level (194.5 vs 206.9 pmol/L). There was no interaction between acupuncture and acupuncture expectancy in terms of fertility outcomes. High expectancy was significantly associated with a shorter time to ovulation (35.0 vs 49.0 days) and higher chances of ovulation during the study period (HR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.5). After adjusting for confounders, there were no significant between-group differences in any other outcomes, including conception, clinical pregnancy and live birth. Conclusion: High acupuncture expectancy was associated with a shorter time to ovulation and higher chances of ovulation in infertile patients with PCOS receiving active or control acupuncture in the PCOSAct trial.

    "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves the insertion of filiform needles into the body. Currently, various brands of acupuncture needles are available for purchase and product quality control is intended to ensure the safety of both the patient and the acupuncturist. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of acupuncture needles using physical–chemical and mechanical tests according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 17218:2014. Methods: We evaluated nine different brands of 0.25 mm × 30 mm acupuncture needles. The needles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy—energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) techniques for morphological and compositional evaluation at 300× magnification. Mechanical tests were used to determine puncture performance, intensity and needle tip sharpness according to ISO 17218:2014 using an Instron 4411 with controlled needle displacement. Puncture force was measured in Newtons, and a stereomicroscope was used to evaluate structural changes after the intensity test. Results: SEM-EDS analyses indicated deformations, scratches and imperfections in various brands of needle, particularly Açomed and Complementar. Following the intensity test, all brands exhibited deformations at the needle tips. The Uniqmed brand had the lowest puncture performance test force (median = 0.033 N, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.030–0.035 N), while Açomed had the highest (0.117 N, 95% CI = 0.109–0.132 N). The Dragon brand had the lowest sharpness test force (0.026 N, 95% CI = 0.025–0.029 N), while Complementar had the highest (0.060 N, 95% CI = 0.056–0.064 N). Conclusion: Despite statistically significant disparities, no group exceeded the limits set by ISO 17218:2014. Although there are a few research studies on this topic, some authors have opted not to reveal brand names, which makes direct comparisons problematic. As a result, we anticipate that the findings from this study may be used in future meta-analyses and ISO 17218:2014 revisions.",

Methods: A randomized, assessor-blinded controlled trial was conducted from October 2022 to March 2023 with 1:1 allocation to the intervention group and the control group. Eighty-four patients with benign gallbladder disease based on conventional diagnostic criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two different groups. The intervention group received a 30 min EA treatment at LI4, PC6, ST36 and LR3 (2/100 Hz frequency, 1 mA average intensity) that was given immediately after surgery. All patients received standard perioperative management based on an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Time to first flatus was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included time to first defecation and first normal bowel sound, as well as evaluation of abdominal distension/pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Results: The intervention group had a shorter time to first flatus and time to first normal bowel sound. They also had a lower overall incidence of postoperative abdominal distension, pain and PONV over the first 24 h. The degree/grading of abdominal distension was also lower at 12 h and that of abdominal pain and PONV was lower at both 12 and 24 h postoperatively.

The NC group received no intervention. To create myopia, the right eyes of the LIM and LIM + MA groups were covered with −6.00 D lenses. The LIM + MA group received 30 min of acupuncture stimulation daily at Taiyang and LI4. The effect of LIM modelling and MA on ocular measurements, expression of STAT3, phosphorylated (p)-STAT3, MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP)-2 expression (as well as histopathology, morphology and immunohistochemistry of the guinea pigs’ eyes) were evaluated. Results: Compared with the NC group, the LIM group showed increased expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and MMP-2, and decreased expression of TIMP-2, as well as an increase in ocular measurements. The eye tissue morphology was disrupted and fibres became thinner in the LIM group. Compared to the LIM group, the LIM + MA group exhibited a noteworthy decline in the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and MMP-2, a significant increase in TIMP-2, and a decrease in ocular measurements and tissue morphology, which were similar to that of the NC group. Conclusion: Acupuncture has the potential to decrease STAT3 activation and block the STAT3-MMP-2 pathway in the ocular tissue of guinea pigs with experimental LIM, thereby delaying the development of myopia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy and is associated with significant strain on both patients and healthcare systems. Acupuncture is one of the conservative treatments used for this syndrome, although more evidence is needed regarding the efficacy of this intervention. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in patients with CTS through clinical, electrophysiological and ultrasonographical assessments. Methods: Seventeen wrists, belonging to a total of 12 patients who had been diagnosed with CTS, were included. Eight EA sessions were performed (twice a week for 4 weeks). The visual analogue scale (VAS), symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS) of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) were administered, median nerve conduction studies were performed and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve was measured by ultrasound. These evaluations were made at baseline and 3–7 days after the last treatment. Results: Following EA, there was a decrease in pain on the VAS scale with a median difference (MD) of −2.45 (p &lt; 0.001), a decrease in the severity of symptoms on the SSS scale (MD −0.60; p = 0.001) and an improvement in the function of the limb on the FSS scale (MD −0.25; p = 0.02). Furthermore, there was a reduction in the CSA of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet (MD −2.00 mm²; p = 0.003). No differences in any median nerve conduction study parameters were found. Side effects (observed in 8% of treatments) were all minimal and self-limiting. Conclusion: Although no firm conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled clinical trial, EA appears to be a promising treatment for CTS patients, and herein was associated with an improvement in symptoms and morphological changes in the median nerve.

The purpose of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in the subgroup of CP/CPPS patients with a sedentary lifestyle and to compare outcomes between sedentary and non-sedentary participants in the group receiving acupuncture. Methods: In the original RCT, 440 patients with moderate to severe CP/CPPS received 20 sessions of acupuncture or sham acupuncture (SA) over 8 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks after the treatment was completed. The primary outcome was the proportion of sustained responders, defined as those with a reduction of at least six points in the National Institute of Health—chronic prostatitis symptom index (NIH-CPSI) total score at weeks 8, 20 and 32. In this secondary analysis, we compared n = 147 participants in the acupuncture group with a sedentary lifestyle group: (1) n = 148 participants with a sedentary lifestyle in the SA group ; and (2) n = 62 participants with a non-sedentary lifestyle in the acupuncture group. Results: Among those with a sedentary lifestyle, the proportion of sustained responders was 38.3% in the acupuncture group versus 20.1% in the SA group (odds ratio (OR) 2.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45–4.10]; P = 0.001).

Acupuncture is known to be an effective treatment approach for CS; however, the relevant factors affecting QoL in this patient population remain unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess QoL and investigate related factors among patients with CS undergoing acupuncture. Methods: A predictive correlational study was conducted among 265 participants with CS undergoing acupuncture as part of routine clinical care. The following questionnaires were used to collect data on QoL and related factors: healthy lifestyle questionnaire (HLQ), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Chinese version of the perceptual stress scale (CPSS), self-rated abilities for health practices scale (SRAHP), social support rating scale (SSRS), cervical spine disease health knowledge awareness questionnaire and 12-item short form survey (SF-12). Standard multiple linear regression analysis was applied to determine the predictors of QoL in this patient population. Results: The mean total score of the QoL scale was 37.8 ± 10.57 (mean ± SD), indicating moderate QoL levels among patients with CS undergoing acupuncture. Based on multiple regression, lifestyle (β = 0.25, p &lt; 0.01), health behavior (β = 0.379, p &lt; 0.01), social support (β = 0.098, p &lt; 0.01), knowledge about CS (β = 0.107, p &lt; 0.01) and PSQI scores (β = −0.196, p &lt; 0.001) explained 71% of the variance of QoL. Conclusion: Lifestyle, health behavior, social support and knowledge about CS significantly and positively predict the level of QoL, while PSQI scores negatively predicted QoL.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Incisional pain, which is the most commonly observed postoperative complication, is closely related to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Although electroacupuncture (EA) has been demonstrated to reduce incisional pain, its analgesic mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether EA alleviates incisional pain in rats by regulating the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and procalcitonin (PCT) in the astrocytes and neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Methods: Forty-six healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were included, of which n = 8 were assigned to the control group. The remaining 38 rats were used to establish the incisional pain model. Finally, 32 successfully modeled rats were obtained and randomly divided into model, sham EA, 2 Hz and 20/100 Hz EA groups. Mechanical pain withdrawal threshold (MPWT) was measured before modeling, 6 h after modeling, and 3 days after EA intervention. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect IL-6 and PCT protein and mRNA expression, as well as their co-expression with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker of astrocytes) and NeUN (a marker of neurons) in the spinal dorsal horn of rats in each group after 3 days of EA intervention. Results: Reduced IL-6 and PCT levels in the astrocytes and neurons were observed in the spinal dorsal horn of the incisional pain model after EA intervention, and incisional pain was also significantly relieved. Conclusion: Both 2 Hz and 20/100 Hz EA appear to relieve incisional pain in rats and these effects may be related to inhibition of IL-6 and PCT expression in the spinal dorsal horn.",

Methods: Forty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were allocated into five groups: control, model, EA, U73122 and U73122 + EA groups (n = 8 each). All groups except the control group underwent a multifactorial method to induce FD. The EA group received EA, the U73122 group received the PLC inhibitor U73122, and the U73122 + EA group received U73122 prior to EA. The control and model groups received no interventions. After 10 days of treatment, behavioral and GI motility tests were conducted. Gastric antrum tissues were analyzed post-euthanasia to determine PDGFRα, PLC, phosphorylated ( P )-PLC, and IP3 expression and co-localization using Western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy was used to examine gastric antrum gap junctions (GJs) and PDGFRα + cells. Results: The FD model rats displayed reduced activity, weight gain and food intake, with altered GI motility, widened gastric antrum GJs and decreased mRNA/protein expression of PDGFRα, PLC, P -PLC and IP3. Post-EA, rats showed improved weight gain, food intake, GI motility and mRNA/protein expression, as well as normal GJs. The U73122 group failed to demonstrate significant improvements in motility or PDGFRα + cell morphology, with lower protein/mRNA expression of key pathway intermediates than the EA group. Conclusion: EA enhances GI function in FD rats by activating the PDGFRα + cell-associated PLC-IP3 pathway, demonstrating potential as a therapeutic target for FD.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-five selected patients with pain, mainly of musculo-skeletal origin, were offered treatment by a qualified medical acupuncturist in his general practice surgery as an alternative to hospital outpatient referral. The patients assessed their own outcomes on a digital scale: there were 46 successful treatments and 14 failures, with 5 being lost to follow up. The cost of acupuncture treatment was compared to that of the referral that would have been made if acupuncture had not been offered. The acupuncture was found to have cost £10,943 against a minimum likely cost for hospital referrals of £26,783. A minimum total saving for all 60 patients of £13,916 was determined, giving an average saving per patient of £232. Additional hidden savings through avoiding further hospital procedures and expenditure on medication were not taken into account. It is concluded that acupuncture in selected patients and when used by an appropriately qualified practitioner appears to be a cost-effective therapy for use in general practice, reducing the need for more expensive hospital referrals.",

    "abstract": "We report on a pilot study we undertook to investigate if segmental acupuncture treatment, given two minutes prior to a regional inferior dental block (ID) with Prilocaine Hydrochloride, would reduce the onset time of a local anaesthetic. Thirty healthy people, who needed a regional inferior dental block (ID) as part of dental treatment in the lower jaw, were randomly allocated to three groups. They received segmental acupuncture, heterosegmental superficial acupuncture, or standard treatment (regional inferior dental block) without acupuncture. In the segmental acupuncture group, acupuncture was given within the innervation of the trigeminal nerve. The needles were left in for two minutes, followed by a regional inferior dental block (ID). In the second group, acupuncture needles were inserted superficially in extra-segmental points and left in for two minutes without stimulation, followed by the regional inferior dental block. A control group received standard treatment only, of a regional inferior dental block. The concept 'pain free for dental work' was defined as 'patients reporting pins and needles in the lower lip' and measured by a drilling test. Patients who reported no pain during the drilling test were included in the study. The time from administration of the injection to the patients' reporting pins and needles was recorded by an independent dental nurse. All tested patients reported sufficient anaesthesia during the drilling test. In the segmental acupuncture group, anaesthesia was achieved after 62 seconds, compared to the heterosegmental superficial acupuncture group, who took 115 seconds and the control group, who received standard treatment only, and took 119 seconds. The difference between the segmental acupuncture group and the heterosegmental superficial acupuncture group was statistically significant (p < 0.015); the difference between the segmental acupuncture group and the control, who received a regional inferior dental block only, was also significant (p < 0.032). No significant difference was found between the heterosegmental superficial acupuncture group and the control group who received a regional inferior dental block only (p < 0.84). It appears from this pilot study that the onset time of local anaesthesia is reduced if segmentally administered acupuncture is given prior to the regional inferior dental block. However, it needs to be reproduced including objective measurements.",

The aim of this study was to explore the possible physiological mechanisms.In a laboratory experiment, manual acupuncture was performed at a point adjacent to the sixth lumbar vertebra of 13 animals and its effect on sciatic nerve blood flow was measured using a laser Doppler flowmetry. Simultaneously, changes in blood pressure and cardiac rate were observed. Each animal was stimulated four to eight times, making a total of 58 experiments.Acupuncture stimulation did not produce consistent changes in sciatic nerve blood flow, with increased and decreased blood flow as well as no change in blood flow observed. Among the 58 individual experiments, sciatic nerve blood flow was increased in 33, reduced in 12, and unchanged in 13. Approximately half of the stimulations showed a correlation between blood flow and blood pressure change.Our results indicate that lumbar acupuncture stimulation can have an influence on sciatic nerve blood flow. The effect is dependent not only on blood pressure but also other factors, for example vasodilator and vasoconstrictor nerve activity. This mechanism may contribute to a clinical effect on intermittent claudication of the cauda equina.",

In all three cases, symptoms were markedly reduced immediately after electroacupuncture to the spinal nerve root. The sustained effect was noticeably longer than that of spinal nerve blocks previously performed, in two out of the three cases. We suggest that descending inhibitory control, inhibitory control at the spinal level, inhibition of potential activity by hyperpolarisation of nerve endings, or changes in nerve blood flow may be involved in the mechanism of the effect of electroacupuncture to the spinal nerve root. These results suggest that electroacupuncture to the spinal nerve root may be superior to lumbar spinal nerve block when it is applied appropriately in certain cases of radicular sciatica, taking into consideration patient age, severity of symptoms and duration of the disorder.",

The aim of this study was to identify such predictors. Method A secondary analysis was performed on data from 100 participants in a trial of laser and sham laser acupuncture for chronic non-specific low back pain. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify which baseline characteristics predicted pain change in the immediate, short and intermediate term. An analysis of covariance was performed based on these results to re-examine the primary result of the trial. Results Strong predictors of poor response were receipt of disability support pension, headache, the regular use of analgesics or previous failed back surgery. Higher pain scores or exacerbation of pain at baseline predicted a greater proportionate pain relief after the intervention. Adjusted analysis suggested a clinically important effect of laser compared to sham (p&lt;0.05), at short term follow-up only. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest which characteristics of patients with chronic low back pain are more likely to respond to laser acupuncture treatment, but require replication in other studies. The findings may not apply in other acupuncture interventions and treatment of different conditions. They may also be used to set selection criteria for future studies, and to aid interpreting the effect of baseline imbalances on trial results.",

The guideline states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture. There appears to be three areas where the guidelines may have not used the available evidence in the most appropriate manner. First, data on the long-term effectiveness of acupuncture may have been misinterpreted. Second, the specific rejection of electroacupuncture indicates a restricted understanding of acupuncture as a treatment, and is based on a cost-effectiveness analysis which may not be ideal. Third, the cost-effectiveness calculations used comparisons with sham acupuncture (\"placebo\") when comparison with standard care would have been more appropriate. The guideline may therefore lead some patients with osteoarthritis to miss out on a treatment that may be effective for them.",

    "abstract": "Women have traditionally been high users of complementary therapies and use of these therapies continues during pregnancy and birthing. While women look to acupuncture and other therapies to support them during this time, traditional maternity services are in a state of change. In Australia, there is an increase in births, a workforce crisis, an increase in birthing in labour ward settings, few opportunities for women to birth at home, increased caesarean sections and an increase in obstetric interventions. The future role of acupuncture in this changed environment will be influenced by the evidence of safety and effectiveness of acupuncture. Research evaluating acupuncture during the antenatal period, labour preparation and birthing is small in quantity, but there are encouraging findings suggesting acupuncture maybe safe and effective. Women have prioritised interventions to manage pregnancy symptoms such as nausea and back pain, and interventions to prepare for labour and manage pain in labour as important. Further acupuncture trials are needed to ensure women have reliable and valid information to inform their decision making. Assessment of safety requires contributions from researchers, practitioners and integration with institutional data collection systems. Research of effectiveness should involve rigorous designs, but with debate about the appropriateness of traditional randomised controlled trial designs to evaluate complex interventions, and the limitations of sham controls, different approaches with mixed research methods should be considered. Exploring new research methods, especially those which explore the woman's experience with acupuncture, are also key to defining a role in the future.",

Methods The effect of scalp acupuncture was studied using MRI for two different stroke models: spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats and rats with transiently induced focal cerebral ischaemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h (MCAO rats). Results Stroke onset in SHR-SP rats was characterised by a development of vasogenic oedema without any appearance of cytotoxic oedema. Scalp acupuncture reduced rapidly neurological dysfunction in SHR-SP rats and reduced the volume of the vasogenic oedema during the same period. In contrast, in MCAO rats, focal cerebral ischaemia caused an immediate development of cytotoxic oedema without any appearance of vasogenic oedema. Vasogenic oedema developed after reperfusion. Scalp acupuncture had no significant effects on the cytotoxic oedema, vasogenic oedema or neurological dysfunction of the MCAO rats within the time span examined. Conclusion Scalp acupuncture had a rapid and strong effect on neurological dysfunction only in the hypertensive stroke-model by reducing the vasogenic oedema. Our results suggest that, if there are similar underlying mechanisms in human strokes, scalp acupuncture may be more beneficial for patients with strokes of hypertension-caused vasogenic origin than ischaemic origin.",

Information was abstracted from all retrieved articles on review status, type and number of English and Chinese language databases searched, participation of at least one Chinese speaking author and language restriction. Frequencies were calculated and bivariate analyses were performed stratifying on interventions of interest to assess differences in search strategy techniques, language restrictions and results.The search retrieved 68 titles, including 48 completed reviews, 17 protocols and three previously withdrawn titles. Acupuncture was the primary intervention of interest in 44/65 (67.7%) of the retrieved reviews and protocols. While all articles searched at least one English language database, only 26/65 (40.0%) articles searched Chinese language databases. Significantly more articles where acupuncture was the primary intervention of interest searched Chinese language databases (53% vs 9%, p<0.01). Inconclusive findings as to the effectiveness of acupuncture were found in 28/48 (58.3%) of all completed reviews; this type of finding was more common in reviews which did not search any Chinese language databases.It is important for reviews assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture to search Chinese language databases. The Cochrane Collaboration should develop specific criteria for Chinese language search strategies to ensure the continued publication of high-quality reviews.",

The Cochrane criteria were used to assess the risk of bias for the individual studies.A total of 416 publications were initially collected and four studies were included in this review. One study evaluated the efficacy of IMS for chronic tension-type headaches; IMS showed a better effect than the sham (headache index: mean difference (MD) -4.90, 95% CI -9.53 to -0.27). Three studies tested the effectiveness of IMS for various conditions. In the first study no significant difference was observed in a comparison of IMS and meloxicam therapy for chronic shoulder pain (pain-visual analogue scale (VAS): MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.16). The second study in patients with myofascial pain syndrome of the upper trapezius muscle found that IMS had a greater effect than simple dry needling measured by the pain-VAS (MD -2.70, 95% CI -3.77 to -1.63). In the third study, patients with lower back pain who received IMS plus the standard treatment had a better status at discharge than those receiving the standard treatment alone (relative risk 1.63, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.24).Despite the positive results of these individual studies, the level of evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of IMS for several conditions remains insufficient because of concerns about a lack of precision and a high risk of bias of the included studies. Rigorous large-scale clinical trials of IMS are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technique.",

Eight TCM patterns are regarded as typical for female infertility. There are no empirical data comparing these patterns in fertile and infertile women. Objective To identify and compare the TCM patterns and recommended acupuncture points in infertile and fertile women. The hypothesis that infertile and fertile women should differ in occurrence of TCM patterns described as typical for infertility was examined. Methods A cross-sectional study examined the distribution of TCM patterns and acupuncture points among 24 infertile and 24 fertile women. TCM patterns and points proposed by two acupuncturists were analysed. The odds ratio was used as the effect measure. Results Three patterns were found in more than 92% of the women. Five patterns occurred more frequently among infertile (p≤0.03), and four among fertile (p≤0.02) women. Only three of the eight patterns assumed typical for infertile women were more common among infertile women. Two of the eight patterns were more common among fertile women. Acupuncture points KI3, LI3 and SP6 were chosen for almost all women, whereas CV4, CV3 and ST29 were chosen more often for infertile women (p&lt;0.03), and SP3 more often for fertile women (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The data indicate that the presence of some, and the absence of other, TCM patterns are associated with infertility.

However, only a few studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of this treatment. Objective To observe changes in the symptoms of COPD during acupuncture treatment in patients with COPD stratified according to the severity of the disease. Methods A prospective case series of 26 patients with dyspnoea on exertion due to COPD was followed from October 2004 to October 2008 in the Departments of Respiratory Internal Medicine, Gifu University of Medicine and Meiji University of Integrative Medicine, Japan. All participants received acupuncture treatments once a week for 10 weeks in addition to standard medication therapy. The main outcome measure was the modified Borg dyspnoea scale after the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and the secondary outcome measure was the BODE index. Results All 26 patients showed significant improvement in the Borg dyspnoea scale after 10 weeks of acupuncture treatment (from 4.02 (2.85) to 1.96 (1.97), mean difference −2.06, 95% CI −3.03 to −1.09, p=0.0002, paired t test). Improvements in the BODE index, 6MWT and oxygen saturation during exercise, which indicates better reduced dyspnoea on exertion and prognosis, were also found.

Curcumin is a natural product with antifibrotic effects, but has poor pharmacokinetic profiles. This study aimed to evaluate whether acupuncture combined with curcumin could more potently attenuate liver fibrosis in chemical intoxicated rats. Methods 60 Sprague–Dawley male rats were randomly divided into control, model, sham, acupuncture, curcumin and combination therapy groups. During the establishment of fibrosis using carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ), acupuncture at LR3, LR14, BL18 and ST36 and/or curcumin treatment by mouth were performed simultaneously. After treatment, pathological indexes and histology for hepatic injury and fibrogenesis were detected. The expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components was also determined. Results Acupuncture combined with curcumin potently protected the liver from CCl 4 -induced injury and fibrogenesis, as indicated by reduced levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, hyaluronic acid, laminin and procollagen III. Combined use also led to significant liver histological improvements. Furthermore, combined use effectively inhibited ECM expression such as α-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and α1(1) collagen. Conclusions Acupuncture treatment could significantly enhance the antifibrotic efficacy of curcumin on CCl 4 -induced hepatic fibrosis in rats in vivo, suggesting that a combination of acupuncture with curcumin may be exploited for the prevention of hepatic fibrosis.",

A study was undertaken to assess its effects in rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and discuss its mechanisms. Methods 21 Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into three groups. Group 1 underwent tMCAO and subsequently received acupuncture treatment, Group 2 underwent tMCAO without treatment and Group 3 only underwent sham operation. The evolution of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) features in ischaemic lesions from acute to chronic periods was assessed and the correlations with behavioural tests and histopathological changes were examined. Results tMCAO rats displayed side-specific sensorimotor deficits after occlusion. Behavioural scores of rats in group 1 reduced gradually with acupuncture treatment. No significant difference in lesion size on T2-weighted imaging was found between the two tMCAO groups. Relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) and relative fractional anisotropy (rFA) values in the centre and at the edge of the ischaemic lesions reduced at first and then increased to varying degrees. Only changes in the rFA value at the edge of the ischaemic lesions were significantly different between the two tMCAO groups. A more significant increase in growth-associated protein B-50 and synaptophysin protein expression was found in group 1 than in the other groups. No significant correlations were found between behavioural scores, DTI appearances and immunohistochemical results. Conclusions The acupuncture points applied were effective, and improving neuronal regeneration may have a role in the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of post-stroke paralysis of the limbs in rats.

However, reviewers have infrequently searched for eligible RCTs in Korean databases and journals. This study aimed to identify difficult to locate acupuncture RCTs in Korean databases and journals and to assess the characteristics and quality of the identified RCTs. Methods Eleven electronic databases and seven journals were searched up to December 2012. All RCTs using needle acupuncture were considered for inclusion. Key study characteristics were extracted and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Results One hundred and forty-three publications met our inclusion criteria. Acupuncture RCTs in the Korean literature emerged in the mid-1990s and increased in the mid-2000s. Diverse methods of acupuncture were used, including some methods unique to Korea (eg, Saam acupuncture). The largest proportion of trials evaluated acupuncture for musculoskeletal conditions (27.3%). The mean sample size was 44.3±25.3 per trial. Random sequence generation methods were reported in 44.8% of the RCTs, whereas only 11.9% reported methods of allocation concealment. A low proportion of trials reported participant blinding (32.9%) and outcome assessment blinding (18.9%). Conclusions Korean acupuncture trials, many of which evaluate acupuncture styles unique to Korea, are typically omitted from systematic reviews of acupuncture, resulting in the potential for language bias. The development of this database of difficult to locate Korean trials, which includes English language translations of abstracts, will enable these trials of varying quality to be assessed for inclusion in future acupuncture systematic reviews.",

However, the participants' discrimination accuracy was statistically significant from P(C)=0.5 for the upper limb acupoints alone comparison (t(19)=2.36, unadjusted p=0.03).This study showed that the Park sham device is more likely to blind participants in differentiating between the real and sham needles in the lower limb (BL meridian) acupoints than in the upper limb (TE meridian). However, the participants' ability to differentiate between the needle types for the upper limb acupoints was significantly different from chance levels.",

This report describes the diagnosis, determination of infectious origin and treatment of a case of ISI attributed to the use of acupuncture for the treatment of lower back pain. We report on a 61-year-old man who developed right hip pain and fever 3 days after undergoing acupuncture over the right buttock region for the treatment of lower back pain. Blood culture showed infection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and MRI disclosed the presence of an inflamed area over the right iliac bone and the right portion of the sacrum. The patient was cured after a 4-week course of antimicrobial treatment. Clinicians should take a history of acupuncture use when evaluating patients presenting with fever of unknown origin and/or bacteraemia and consider the possibility of ISI when evaluating patients with hip pain and infectious signs after acupuncture or other possible causes of infection. This indicates the importance of performing clinically clean procedures to prevent septic complications when treating patients with acupuncture.",

One of these theories proposes that acupuncture points and meridians have unique electrical properties and their electrical skin impedance is lower than surrounding areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in electrical skin impedance between PC4 and the pericardium meridian compared with the surrounding areas. Methods Eighteen healthy subjects (10 women) were recruited to participate in the study. An impedance meter based on the four-electrode technique was designed specifically for the study. Twenty-five points were marked on the skin: one on the point PC4, four others on the pericardium meridian and 20 points around it. The electrical impedance of each point was measured with the four-electrode device. Results The mean electrical skin impedance at PC4 was significantly different from the 20 of the surrounding points but not significantly different from the four adjacent points. The mean skin impedance of the five points over the pericardium meridian was significantly different from that of parallel rows of points using repeated measures analysis of variance (p&lt;0.001) Conclusion Within the possible limits of this measurement technique, skin impedance along the pericardium meridian is lower than surrounding areas, supporting the idea of different properties of the pericardium meridian compared with the control areas. Evidence on skin impedance at PC4 is inconclusive and further studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background In trials, ‘therapist intensive’ complex interventions are typically delivered over time, during which a relationship between the practitioner and participant may develop. Such relationships are sometimes criticised as obscuring any ‘true’ treatment effect. Limiting interactions is one strategy that might be used to try to control for the effect of a therapeutic relationship. Objectives We conducted systematic review into the rationale, methods and effects of constraining relationships in controlled trials and cohort studies of acupuncture, including studies published before 2008 with an update citation search in 2010. Methods We searched six databases without keyword restrictions. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to explore the effect of relationship constraint on pain outcomes. Results Eighty-one of 785 (10.3%) trials reported constraining relationships. Most did not state the reason for constraint, describe the nature of the limitation, provide information on how the constrained relationship was monitored or note protocol adherence. Where a reason was reported, this was primarily to maintain participant blinding, rarely was it stated that the constraint was to control the therapeutic relationship. We found no evidence of an effect of constraint on pain outcomes (percentage heterogeneity explained, p=0.89). These results were robust to variation in trial quality and design. Conclusions Acupuncture trials appear to be constrained mostly to try to prevent participant unblinding to their allocated treatment, not to control the therapeutic relationship. The apparent lack of monitoring and negligible effects on pain outcomes of the included trials indicate the need for more high-quality randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of constraint.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is being increasingly used for a multiplicity of symptoms in patients with cancer and those requiring palliative care. An evidence base has been accumulating over recent years for symptoms such as acute and chronic pain, nausea and vomiting, xerostomia, vasomotor symptoms, fatigue and dyspnoea. Many symptoms occur in patients with cancer long after their initial treatment, which usually consists of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Today, 45% of patients worldwide survive at least 5 years beyond their initial diagnosis and cancer is increasingly regarded as a chronic disease. As treatments become more successful, patients face the additional challenges of dealing with both the physical and psychological sequelae of their condition.1\n\nYet, anticancer treatment remains an intense experience for many patients and causes numerous side effects. Acupuncture, being a non-drug treatment, provides at least a partial solution for the increasing proportion of patients who turn to complementary and alternative therapies for help with symptom control at variable times after their diagnosis. Acupuncture has been used in pain management in our large Oncology Hospital for over 30 years, initially treating only pain but gradually also used in the treatment of non-pain symptoms such as hot flushes, dyspnoea and radiation-induced bowel and bladder problems. A wide range of symptoms have been treated with …",

Methods 160 adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) to establish I/R injury and were randomly divided into four groups (n=40 each) that remained untreated (I/R group) or received EA at LU5, LI4, ST36 and SP6 (I/R+EA group), the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (I/R+PD group), or both interventions (I/R+PD+EA groups). An additional 40 rats undergoing sham surgery formed a healthy control group. Eight rats from each group were sacrificed at the following time points: 2 hours, 6 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 1 week. Neurological function was assessed using neurological deficit scores, morphological examination was performed following haematoxylin-eosin staining of cortical tissues, and apoptotic indices were calculated after terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-16-dUTP nick-end labelling. Cortical protein and mRNA expression of p-ERK and ERK were measured by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Results Compared with the I/R group, neurological deficit scores and apoptotic indices were lower in the I/R+EA group at 1 and 3 days, whereas mRNA/protein expression of ERK/p-ERK was higher in the EA group at all time points studied. Conclusion Our results suggest that EA can alleviate neurological deficits and reduce cortical apoptosis in rats with I/R injury. These anti-apoptotic effects may be due to upregulation of p-ERK. Moreover, apoptosis appeared to peak at 1 day after I/R injury, which might therefore represent the optimal time point for targeting of EA.",

Methods 90 male rats weighing 160Â±5 g were used. 12 rats were control fed (Normal group) and 78 were fed a high-fat high-sugar diet for 8 weeks and underwent intraperitoneal STZ injection to model DM. 60 animals that met modelling criteria were randomly divided into an untreated DM group and four groups receiving EA at Weiwanxiashu (DM+WWX group), BL15 (DM+BL15 group), BL23 (DM+BL23 group) or a non-traditional acupuncture point on the tail (DM+Tail group). Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and insulin levels were determined and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed. Results EA at Weiwanxiashu had a glucose-lowering effect on the 21st and 28th days, decreased TC, TG and LDL-C levels, increase insulin levels and improved glucose tolerance. EA at BL15 had a glucose-lowering effect on the7th, 14th and 21st days of intervention but did not impact lipids, insulin or OGTT parameters. EA at BL23 or on the tail had no significant effects. Conclusion EA at Weiwanxiashu and BL15 had differential effects on metabolic markers in the STZ-induced rat model of DM. These effects may be explained neuroanatomically by variations in the segmental innervation of the tissues at these locations.",

Methods 30 healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. Block-designed manual acupuncture stimuli were delivered at SP6, and de qi sensations were measured after acupuncture stimulation. All subjects underwent functional MRI (fMRI) scanning during the acupuncture stimuli. The fMRI data were separately analysed by ISS and traditional GLM methods. Results All subjects experienced de qi sensations. ISS analysis showed that the regions activated during acupuncture stimulation at SP6 were mainly divided into five clusters based on the time courses. The time courses of clusters 1 and 2 were in line with the acupuncture stimulation pattern, and the active regions were mainly involved in the sensorimotor system and salience network. Clusters 3, 4 and 5 displayed an almost contrary time course relative to the stimulation pattern. The brain regions activated included the default mode network, descending pain modulation pathway and visual cortices. GLM analysis indicated that the brain responses associated with the instant effects of acupuncture were largely implicated in sensory and motor processing and sensory integration. Conclusion The ISS analysis considered the sustained effect of acupuncture and uncovered additional information not shown by GLM analysis. We suggest that ISS may be a suitable approach to investigate the brain responses associated with the instant effects of acupuncture.",

Objective To evaluate the influence of long term EA on peripheral nerve injury (PNI) from multiple angles. Method Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: control, PNI and PNI+EA. In the latter two groups, PNI was modelled by transection followed by re-anastomosis of thesciatic nerve. In the PNI+EA group only, EA was delivered using a discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 2 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until the affected limb was observed to twitch slightly. The treatment was given for 15 min each time, six times a week (continuously for 6 days followed by a 1-day break) for a total of 8 weeks. The effects of EA on anastomotic sciatic nerve regeneration were evaluated using the sciatic function index (SFI), mechanical withdrawal thresholds, thermo-nociceptive thresholds, conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve and bilateral gastrocnemius wet weight. Results From weeks 2 to 4 after modelling, the SFI recovery rate in the PNI+EA group was faster than that in the PNI group. In week 4, the SFI of the PNI+EA group was significantly higher than that of the PNI group (p&lt;0.05). However, a significant effect of EA was no longer evident from weeks 5 to 8. There was no effect of acupuncture on anti-amyotrophy and conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve at 8 weeks after modelling. EA did not shorten the paw withdrawal threshold time, but appeared to alleviate thermo-nociceptive sensitivity. Conclusion Long term repeated stimulation of the same site with EA does not appear to be conducive to the functional recovery of an injured sciatic nerve in rats.",

These symptoms could be alleviated by acupuncture. Although several lines of evidence in Western countries suggest that acupuncture has a beneficial effect on symptoms in breast cancer survivors, few relevant studies have been conducted in Korean patients. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of acupuncture for a variety of treatment-related symptoms in Korean breast cancer survivors. Method: From October 2015 to March 2016, we recruited patients who had undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently reported symptoms, including aromatase inhibitor-related knee pain, vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and post-mastectomy pain in the chest wall or shoulder. The women received 4 weeks of symptom-specific acupuncture followed by a further 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture for this indication, and its impact on common and symptom-specific outcome variables. Results: Eight study participants were recruited over a period of 6 months, six of whom completed the planned acupuncture treatment and follow-up assessments. A total of 78 acupuncture sessions were performed. We found that acupuncture was feasible, with only six minor self-limiting acupuncture-related adverse events. Most of the women felt that they had benefitted from participation in the study. The preliminary analysis indicated improvement in common symptom-specific outcomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that acupuncture is feasible, but low recruitment rates should be considered when considering future acupuncture research in Korean breast cancer survivors. Rigorous evaluation of this symptomatic treatment strategy is now needed in the Korean population.",

An additional 12 mice were given an injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and formed a healthy control (Normal) group. After performing echocardiography and measuring the ratio of heart weight (HW)/tibia length (TL) at 14 days, all mice were euthanased. Morphological examination was performed following haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's staining of heart tissues. Ultrastructural changes were observed by electron microscopy. Cardiac protein expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) were measured by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and Western blotting.Compared with the untreated model group, acupuncture at PC6 lowered the heart rate, reduced the ratio of HW/TL, improved the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall thickness (LVAWd), LV end-diastolic anterior wall thickness (LVAWs), LV end-systolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWd), LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWs), and fractional shortening (FS) as observed by echocardiography (ISO+MA(PC6) vs. ISO groups: P<0.05). Moreover, evidence from morphological studies demonstrated that acupuncture at PC6 inhibited myocardial hypertrophy and collagen deposition, and normalised the ultrastructural changes. In addition, ANP and TNFα expression were attenuated in the verum acupuncture group compared with the untreated model group (ISO+MA(PC6) vs. ISO groups: P<0.05).The results demonstrated that acupuncture at PC6 attenuates sympathetic overactivity. Additionally, it may improve cardiac performance by reversing adverse cardiac remodelling. Acupuncture has potential as a treatment for sympathetic hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cannabinoid CB2 receptors (CB2Rs) are mainly present on immune cells including mast cells, which participate in 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of mast cell degranulation was involved in the anti-ACD effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at ST36 via CB2R. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were sensitised and challenged with DNFB following EA stimulation for 1 week. Ear swelling, serum IgE levels, local cytokine production and mast cell infiltration were evaluated. Additionally, rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs) were isolated and cultured for detection of CB2R expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling activation and mast cell degranulation (including β-hexosaminidase and histamine release) in the presence or absence of CB2R antagonists. Results: EA treatment inhibited ear swelling, suppressed IgE and cytokine production, decreased the number of mast cells and curbed mast cell degranulation, which was associated with the inhibition of p38 phosphorylation in DNFB-induced ACD. Importantly, EA enhanced the expression of CB2R mRNA and protein in the RPMCs. CB2R antagonist AM630 but not CB1R antagonist AM251 effectively reversed the suppressive effect of EA on p38 activation, mast cell infiltration and degranulation. Conclusion: These findings provide more evidence to support the hypothesis that EA promotes CB2R expression in mast cells, which is followed by inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway, potentially resulting in the anti-ACD effect of EA.

This study describes 2019 state training requirements to evaluate how they represent opportunities and barriers to increasing access to acupuncture. Methods: We searched publicly available databases to identify Acupuncture Practice Acts and additional statutes and regulations pertaining to acupuncture training requirements on state licensure board websites. We then extracted state-specific acupuncture training requirements for individuals with and without a healthcare-related professional license. Results: Thirty-three states allow physicians to provide acupuncture without requiring any additional training requirements, 11 states and the District of Columbia (DC) require 200–300 training hours, and three require physicians to obtain a separate acupuncture license. Three states have no regulatory agency ruling. Forty states require non-healthcare professionals to complete an accredited program of more than 1900 h and pass an examination. Twenty-three states have an Acupuncture Detoxification Specialist designation allowing individuals without a clinical professional license to provide auricular acupuncture for substance use disorder treatment after a 70-h training course. Discussion: State-level training requirements are intended to increase safe and effective care, but variations represent a potential barrier to increasing the number of acupuncture providers in the United States. Allowing non-physician medical professionals to complete reduced training requirements for specific indications could be a model to increase access to acupuncture. The influence of training requirements on acupuncture access and opioid overuse needs examination.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture/electroacupuncture, alone or combined with other interventions, on pain intensity, pain-related disability, and strength in lateral epicondylalgia (LE) of musculoskeletal origin. Databases and data treatment: Electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials, where at least one group received acupuncture or electroacupuncture for LE of musculoskeletal origin. To be eligible, trials had to include humans and collect outcomes on pain intensity or pain-related disability in LE. Data were extracted by two reviewers. The risk of bias (RoB) of the trials was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool, methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) score, and the level of evidence was summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) using random effects were calculated. Results: A total of 14 trials (10 acupuncture) were included. The meta-analysis found a moderate effect size of acupuncture (SMD = −0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −1.22 to −0.10), but not electroacupuncture (SMD = −0.08, 95% CI = −0.99 to 0.83), in the reduction of elbow pain as compared to a comparative group. Acupuncture exhibited a significant moderate effect size (SMD = −0.51, 95% CI = −0.91 to −0.11) in the improvement of related-disability. Acupuncture (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.57), but not electroacupuncture (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI = −0.29 to 0.98), exhibited a significant but small effect size on strength. Most significant effects were in the short term. The RoB was low but the heterogeneity of trial results led to a downgrading of the GRADE evidence level. Conclusion: Low-level evidence suggests positive effects of acupuncture, but not electroacupuncture, for pain, related-disability, and strength, in LE of musculoskeletal origin, in the short term.",

Postoperative analgesia for CS needs to be effective and safe, but should not interfere with the mother's ability to care for her baby, and must be free from adverse neonatal effects in breast-feeding women. Because of these restrictions, few analgesic drugs are recommended. Thus, the choice of optimal method for postoperative analgesia after CS depends on drug availability, institutional …",

Bortezomib, a current treatment option, inhibits angiogenesis by proteasome inhibition and is known to be effective in the treatment of MM. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common dose-related side effect of bortezomib in patients with MM. We describe a case of PN due to bortezomib treatment which responded dramatically to acupuncture treatment, enabling his bortezomib treatment to continue. The patient was a 74-year-old man with pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in his hands and feet after 22 days of bortezomib treatment given by the haematology clinic. His neuropathic pain score was 8/10. There were no autonomic symptoms. Electroneurophysiological testing confirmed sensorimotor PN. Acupuncture treatment was planned as his neuropathic pain continued. Acupuncture was administered bilaterally to ST36, SP6 and LI4 15 times (every other day in the first five sessions and then twice a week). The numbness, tingling and pain symptoms substantially decreased after the first two treatments. After the 15th session acupuncture treatment was continued once a month. At the end of the sixth month the neuropathic pain assessment score was 0/10. There was no side effect of acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture seems promising as a complementary medical treatment for neuropathic pain from bortezomib-induced PN. Clinical studies involving more cases and electrophysiological studies are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "The role of somatosensory stimulation (acupuncture and related techniques) as an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been hotly debated over the past decade. In the last 6 years there have been no fewer than 12 meta-analyses of 34 randomised controlled trials (table 1). Systematic and narrative reviews of the literature often report conflicting findings and opinions. Despite this controversy, subfertility remains one of the most common reasons that women consult an acupuncturist.47 Meta-analysis of acupuncture trials is often challenging due to methodological diversity, and this is especially true for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) due to marked differences in timing (treatment given during the follicular phase, at the time of oocyte retrieval and/or embryo transfer (ET), and/or as luteal phase support) and the variety of interventions including manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture (EA), transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation (TEAS) and laser acupuncture. Various outcome measures have been used ranging from biochemical pregnancy rate to live birth rate (LBR), depending on the duration of follow-up. LBR (‘take home baby rate’) is considered to be the ideal primary outcome measure and is clearly most important to patients. Interestingly, concordance between studies with respect to point location is relatively high. The acupuncture points targeted generally correspond anatomically to the segmental innervation of the uterus and ovaries, irrespective of whether the primary approach to point selection is traditional or neurophysiological. …",

However, 3 years after the surgery the patient complained of pain in the lower back, and the symptoms worsened after seven sessions of acupuncture. Technetium 99m-labelled methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) bone scintigraphy (BS) revealed abnormal uptake of (99m)Tc-MDP in the L4 and L5 vertebrae. He was admitted to our hospital because of suspected bone metastases from rectal cancer. He was diagnosed with infection based on a history of acupuncture and the findings of enhanced MRI and CT. Percutaneous lumbar discectomy (PLD), external drainage and irrigation using antibiotics were carried out to treat the L4-5 disc. Pathological analyses and bacterial culture of the resected disc confirmed infection with group C streptococcus. Postoperative antibiotic treatment resulted in significant pain relief on the third day and gradual complete relief. Considerable improvement was seen on CT and MRI at follow-up.We consider it highly likely that this patient's infection was caused by acupuncture. In patients with malignancy, abnormal uptake of (99m)Tc-MDP in BS may signify bone metastasis but can also be observed in bone infections. PLD can be used to resect diseased discs to relieve pain quickly and to prevent herniation of lumbar discs. After PLD, external drainage can be employed for abscess drainage, decompression and perfusion of antibiotics. PLD may serve as an alternative to open surgery for pyogenic spondylodiscitis.",

The aim of this study was to screen for potential intracellular signalling pathways that are upregulated by EA at ST36 bilaterally in rats with diabetes mellitus (DM) using microarray analysis. Methods Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were randomly assigned to experimental (EA, n=8) or control (non-EA, n=8) groups. Plasma glucose levels were measured at baseline and after 30 and 60 min, and microarray analysis was performed on samples of gastrocnemius muscle. Results Relative to baseline values, EA significantly reduced plasma levels of glucose at 30 and 60 min. The microarray pathway analysis showed that cell adhesion molecules and type 1 DM gene sets were both upregulated in EA versus non-EA groups (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Cell adhesion molecules might be related to the glucose-lowering effect induced by EA in rats with STZ-induced type 1 diabetes. Further research will be required to examine the involvement of related intracellular signalling pathways.",

Increased neck pain and bacteraemia prompted MRI, which showed atlanto-axial septic arthritis without signs of infection of the tissues between the superficial cellulitic area and the atlanto-axial joint, thus making direct extension of infection unlikely. It is more likely that haematogenous spread of infection resulted in seeding in the atlanto-axial joint, with the proximity of the arthritis and acupuncture site being coincidental. Acupuncture is a treatment option for some indolent pain conditions. As such, acupuncture services are likely to be more frequently utilised. A history of acupuncture is rarely requested by the admitting doctor and seldom offered voluntarily by the patient, especially where the site of infection due to haematogenous spread is distant from the needling location.

Acupuncture was performed on 19 fingers of 15 patients. Acupuncture needles were inserted into the radial and ulnar sides of the flexor tendon at the A1 pulley of the affected finger. Treatment was performed daily up to a maximum of five times. Before and after each treatment, pain during snapping and the severity of snapping were evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS).VAS scores for pain and snapping severity were significantly improved immediately after the first treatment (p<0.001). Pain during snapping, assessed before each treatment, improved over time, reaching statistical significance from the second treatment onwards (p<0.001); similarly, a significant improvement in the severity of snapping was observed, also from the second treatment (p<0.001). Patients with clinically significant improvements (≥50%) in pain and snapping severity had a significantly shorter duration of the disorder than those with <50% improvement (p<0.05).Acupuncture at the impaired A1 pulley site may be an effective treatment for trigger finger.

Considering that few studies have investigated the use of acupuncture in PHC, this article presents our experience in the city of Florianópolis when integrating acupuncture into PHC using an educational programme developed to teach acupuncture to primary care physicians (PCPs). Methods The course programme was designed using the WHO standards for acupuncture training and discussed at three consensus meetings. Between 2011 and 2014 three iterations of an introductory acupuncture course for PCPs were offered. During this period 53 physicians finished the programme. Results The number of acupuncture sessions in PHC rose from 1349 in 2011 to 6488 in 2015. It was observed in 2015 that 81% of the course participants working in PHC were regularly using acupuncture in their daily practice, with a mean number of sessions of 11.35 sessions per month. Moreover, collaborative work, which started during the course between the PCPs and the acupuncture specialists in secondary and tertiary public health care, helped to increase the quality of acupuncture referrals and facilitate clinical case discussions. Conclusions Our experience in the city of Florianópolis shows that teaching acupuncture to PCPs is a sustainable model that can help introduce acupuncture into PHC. Furthermore it can expand access to acupuncture treatment for the population and increase the communication between PCPs and acupuncture specialists.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of adenosine to the increase in skeletal muscle blood flow (MBF) caused by manual acupuncture (MA).Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats (310-360 g) were anaesthetised and divided into four equal groups (n=8 each): Saline, Saline+MA, Theophylline, and Theophylline+MA. In the two MA groups, the sparrow-pecking MA technique was applied at 30 repetitions per min for 1 min to a depth of 15-18 mm using a stainless steel acupuncture needle (0.20×40 mm). The stimulus point was located on the right tibialis anterior (TA) muscle 7-8 mm below the knee. Animals in the two theophylline groups were intra-arterially injected with 8-(p-sulphophenyl) theophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, at a dose of 30 mg/kg before MA. Animals in the two saline groups received control saline. Fluorescent microspheres (15 µm in diameter, yellow-green fluorescent) were used for MBF measurement in all four groups.MA of the TA muscle significantly increased MBF (Saline+MA vs Saline: p=0.001; Saline+MA vs Theophylline: p=0.008). Pre-treatment with theophylline appeared to inhibit this increase (Theophylline vs Theophylline+MA; p=1.000). MBF in the Theophylline+MA group was 43% lower than in the Saline+MA group, although this was not significantly different (p=0.104).The results suggest that adenosine leads to an increase in MBF caused by MA. Adenosine may play a role in acupuncture analgesia by washing out algesic substances. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the precise mechanism.",

Similarly, the total number of endometrial glands per cross section and endometrial thickness in the OVX +EA group was significantly increased compared to the (untreated) OVX group. EA treatment also increased protein (but not mRNA) expression of both ERα and ERβ in the uteri of OVX rats.This study has demonstrated that EA treatment decreases uterine atrophy in OVX rats.

We have reported previously that acupuncture has beneficial effects on asthma without changing the concentration of serum cortisol, although endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) plays an important role in regulating immune responses. Objective In this study, bilateral adrenalectomy (removal of both adrenal glands) was performed in rats before asthma model induction to investigate whether acupuncture influences asthma in a GC-dependent manner. Methods Adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised rats were injected with ovalbumin to induce asthma and then left untreated or treated with manual acupuncture (MA) at GV14, bilateral BL12 and bilateral BL13, or manual restraint without MA. Healthy and sham-adrenalectomised control groups were also included. Pulmonary resistance (R L ), serum concentrations of corticosterone, and eosinophil counts were measured at the end of the experimental course. Sera from adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised asthmatic rats treated with acupuncture were injected into untreated adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised asthmatic rats to investigate further the potential role of GC in the effect of acupuncture. Results Acupuncture significantly decreased R L and eosinophil count in both adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised asthmatic rats. Moreover, administration of sera derived from acupuncture-treated adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised asthmatic rats attenuated the increase in R L and eosinophil count in both asthmatic models. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that endogenous GC is not a key contributor to the effects of acupuncture on asthma, and that acupuncture may have potentially therapeutic effects on asthma in a GC-independent manner.",

Methods 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal (n=6), CHS (n=7), and CHS+EA (n=7). Rats in the CHS group and CHS+EA groups received four different types of stressors for 7 days. For rats in the CHS+EA group, EA was applied at ST36 in the bilateral hind legs for 30 min before each stress-loading session. Rats in the normal group did not receive stressors or EA treatment. The faecal pellets of each rat were collected and weighed at a fixed time every day. Protein expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypothalamus and colorectal tissues was measured by Western blotting at the end of the experiment on the 7th day. Results After 7 consecutive days of CHS, the number of faecal pellets, faecal wet weight, and faecal water content were significantly increased in the CHS group compared with the normal group (p=0.035, p=0.008 and p=0.008, respectively). All three parameters were significantly decreased in CHS+EA versus CHS groups (p=0.030, p=0.011 and p=0.006, respectively). Stress significantly increased CRF expression in both the hypothalamus and colorectal tissues. The excessive CRF responses seen following CHS were significantly suppressed by EA treatment. Conclusions EA treatment can ameliorate stress loading induced abnormal defaecation in rats and decrease protein expression of CRF centrally (hypothalamus) and peripherally (colorectal tissues), suggesting a potentially therapeutic role for EA in stress-related responses.",

The acupuncture intervention is designed to be flexible and responsive to the most common Emergency Department (ED) scenarios, including trauma, acute pain of the low back, abdomen and/or musculoskeletal system, renal colic and headache. Background: Opioids remain a primary treatment for acute ED pain with attendant risk of adverse effects, addiction liability, diversion and death. Effective/safer options for acute pain are needed. Although acupuncture therapy has shown promise for acute pain in the ED alone or in conjunction with usual care, pragmatic trials are needed to obtain definitive and generalizable evidence. Methods: An Acupuncture Advisory Panel was convened that included nine acupuncture experts with 5–44 years of experience in practice and 2–16 years of experience in the acute pain care setting. A modified Delphi process was used with provision of a literature review, surveys of our panel members, three online discussions and email discussion as needed. The STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials (STRICTA) checklist was used as a guide. Results: A responsive acupuncture intervention was agreed on for ACUITY. Session forms were fashioned in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture program to capture essential treatment data, assess fidelity and inform our design for a future pragmatic multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture in the ED, and for use by other future researchers. Conclusion: Development of a responsive manualization intervention provides the appropriate framework for conducting a future, pragmatic, multi-site, definitive RCT of acupuncture in the ED.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurological deficits. Acupuncture can inhibit neuroinflammation and promote nerve repair; however, the specific mechanism is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether acupuncture could modulate the M1 and M2 phenotypic polarization of microglia in a rat model of TBI via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/intracellular toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) pathway.A total of 90 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, SPF grade, were randomly divided into a normal group, model group and acupuncture group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (first, third, and fifth day groups) according to the treatment time (n = 10 rats/subgroup). We used the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) method to quantify neurological deficits before and after modeling. We used Nissl staining to observe the pathological changes in brain tissue, flow cytometry to detect the proportion of M1 and M2 polarized microglia in the injured area on the first, third and fifth day, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to examine TLR4/TRIF/MyD88 expression in microglia on the first, third and fifth day, as well as expression of the amount of binding of TLR4 with TRIF and MyD88.Compared to the model group, mNSS in the acupuncture group gradually decreased and pathological morphology improved. The proportion of CD11b/CD86 positive cells was decreased, while that of CD11b/CD206 was increased in the acupuncture group. Expression of IP TLR4, IP TRIF and IP MyD88 also decreased in the acupuncture group.The results of this study demonstrate that one of the mechanisms through which acupuncture mitigates neuroinflammation and promotes nerve repair in TBI rats may be inhibition of M1 phenotypic polarization and promotion of M2 phenotypic polarization through inhibition of the TLR4/TRIF/MyD88 signaling pathway.",

Methods: This randomised clinical trial included 90 patients divided into three groups. Group 1 was treated with dry needling of TrPs, group 2 with intramuscular electrical stimulation of TrPs, and group 3 with electroacupuncture of motor points and/or the spinal accessory nerve. Each group received seven treatment sessions. The outcomes were the pain score measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and quality of life evaluated by the 12-item short form (SF-12) health questionnaire. We compared the pain outcome over serial time points using growth curve analysis methods. Results: Participants in the three groups experienced significant improvements in pain scores over time. The average pain level of participants in group 3 across the repeated assessments was 0.98 units lower than in group 1 (mean difference (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74–0.23)), p = 0.012). There were no significant differences in pain scores between participants in groups 1 and 2, and there were no significant differences in quality of life across the three groups at the end of the treatment period. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that electrical stimulation of motor points and/or of the spinal accessory nerve may be superior in terms of pain relief (but not quality of life) to dry needling and possibly electrical stimulation of trigger points for the management of MPS involving the trapezius.

    "abstract": "Background: Although growing numbers of patients seek acupuncture for pain management, few acupuncturists with insurance credentialing work in the conventional medical settings. This has resulted in increasing frustration among patients wishing to receive acupuncture in primary care settings as part of their insurance benefits. Methods: A course of eight weekly sessions of group auricular acupuncture (AA) for chronic musculoskeletal pain was implemented in a US primary care clinic and billed to insurance. The process of implementing group AA is described, including patients and researchers’ perceptions of their experience. We also examined various hypothetical scenarios for reimbursement based on relative value units (RVUs) based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) billing/coding. Results: Recruitment was greatly limited by COVID-19 requirements for social distancing and administrative hurdles, such that only four patients participated, three of whom attended all eight sessions. Seven additional Medicare patients were excluded due to concerns that acupuncture would not be covered. Participants reported mostly positive experiences with both AA and the group model of care. Based on our hypothetical reimbursement scenarios, in the fee-for-service model, group sessions appear to be economically more viable when staffed by non-physician acupuncturists credentialed for insurance reimbursement. For example, for a group of six patients each receiving acupuncture would be anticipated to generate 3.60 RVUs, whereas a physician seeing three individual patients consecutively for return office visits at CMS Evaluation and Management (E/M) level 3 could generate at least 4.11 RVUs. Conclusions: Offering group AA services in primary care clinics might increase access to acupuncture for patients with chronic pain. Although patients appreciated quicker access to acupuncture through group visits, and the group visit experience itself, logistical and economic barriers remain a challenge for sustainable group-based acupuncture visits.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is highly prevalent in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway plays a critical role in neuronal survival in a variety of central nervous system injuries. This study aimed to determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) at Yintang and LI20 ameliorates SAH-CI in a rat model and to examine whether it modulates the PI3K/AKT pathway by administering a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) versus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle. Notably, 129 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into Blank, Sham, SAH and SAH + EA groups (Experiment 1, n = 54) and SAH, SAH + EA, SAH + LY294002, SAH + EA + LY294002 and SAH + EA + DMSO groups (Experiment 2, n = 75). Garcia scoring was used to evaluate neurological function. The moisture content of the rat brain was determined by dry‒wet method. The Morris water maze was used to assess learning and memory function. Pathological changes in neurons in the hippocampus were observed via hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The number of surviving neurons and the percentage of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus were detected via Nissl and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expression of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins was detected via Western blotting. The results indicated that EA intervention after SAH reduced brain water content, enhanced Garcia scores, improved neurological function and behavioral markers of CI, and increased the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampus. Moreover, EA significantly increased the expression of AKT, phosphorylated (p)-AKT, PI3K, p-PI3K, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, p-GSK-3β and B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 proteins, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3. In addition, the effects of EA were abolished by LY294002. EA appeared to improve CI in a rat model of SAH through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) at 5/100 Hz has emerged as an effective and promising treatment for NP; however, its mechanism of action is still uncertain. Accordingly, this study investigated the alleviatory mechanism of EA in chronic compression injury (CCI)-induced chronic pain via the C–C chemokine ligand 3 / C–C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCL3/CCR5) axis. Methods: The CCI model was established in rats to induce NP. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed with von Frey and Hargreaves tests, respectively. From day 8 after CCI, EA (5/100 Hz) was performed for 1 week (30 min/day). CCL3 and CCR5 expression was detected with Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Glial cell activation was determined through co-labeling of neurons and glial cells with antibodies against CCL3 and CCR5. The release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: EA markedly ameliorated CCI-induced chronic NP in rats and reduced CCL3 and CCR5 expression in the rat spinal cord. CCL3 and CCR5 were co-expressed by neurons and microglia in the central nervous system. In addition, EA also repressed the activation of glial cells and levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Conclusion: EA may mitigate chronic NP in rats by blocking the CCL3/CCR5 axis in the spinal cord. In addition, EA appeared to exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by suppressing glial cell activation. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanism of EA-induced analgesia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a substantial loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and the formation of intracellular Lewy bodies, which are mainly composed of α-synuclein (α-syn). Acupuncture has been used to improve the symptoms of PD in humans and exhibits a neuroprotective effect against Parkinsonism in animal models. We further investigated the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture via its effect on α-syn levels, dopaminergic cell death and serping1 expression in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of chronic PD. Methods: Mice were divided into a control group receiving phosphate-buffered saline (CTL) and three model groups receiving MPTP that either remained untreated (MPTP) received verum acupuncture at GB34 and LR3 (MPTP_A) or received control acupuncture at sites not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point location (MPTP_NA). The signal intensity of serping1 gene expression was assessed using microarray, and α-syn level and dopaminergic cell death were measured by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. To further investigate the relationship between expression of serping1 and α-syn, a cell culture experiment was carried out in a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treated neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) with and without serpin g1 knockdown using short interfering (si)RNA. Results: Acupuncture at GB34 and LR3 attenuated the MPTP-induced decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and increase in α-syn levels in the SN. Furthermore, verum acupuncture prevented the increase in serping1 level induced by MPTP. In SH-SY5Y cells, MPP+ treatment increased α-syn and decreased both TH expression and cell viability; however, these effects were mitigated by serping 1 knockdown. Conclusions: Our results suggest that an MPTP-induced reduction in serping1 level leads to decreased TH and increased α-syn expression, and that these effects can be attenuated/blocked by acupuncture at GB34 and LR3. Our findings provide new evidence for the neuroprotective effects of acupuncture on dopaminergic cells, which may be mediated by control of serping1 expression.",

Methods: Thirty-six rats were divided into the manual acupuncture (MA), high-frequency EA (HF-EA) and low-frequency EA (LF-EA) groups (n = 12/group). After intravenous anesthesia with propofol, an EEG was recorded before and after stimulation at bilateral ST36 and PC6 using 50-Hz stimulation (HF-EA group) or 2/15-Hz stimulation (LF-EA group) versus no electrical stimulation (MA group). The brains were collected after the experiment to determine cortical and subcortical Ad and PGD 2 levels. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) was collected for Ad immunohistochemistry. Results: There were changes in the δ wave in the LF-EA group and in the α, β and θ waves in the HF-EA group. Compared with the MA group, subcortical Ad levels were higher in the LF-EA group (0.96 ± 0.035 vs 0.93 ± 0.034 pmol/mL, p &lt; 0.05). Cortical PGD 2 levels were higher in the LF-EA group than in the MA group (13.49 ± 0.440 vs 12.95 ± 0.436 pmol/mL, p &lt; 0.05). VLPO Ad levels were significantly increased in the LF-EA group compared to both the HF-EA group (0.210 ± 0.0066 vs 0.201 ± 0.0065, p &lt; 0.05) and the MA group (0.210 ± 0.0066 vs 0.199 ± 0.0095, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: LF-EA at bilateral ST36 and PC6 may increase the depth of anesthesia and sedation, possibly through increased intracranial PGD 2 and Ad levels.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Dysphagia is a common complication after stroke and can negatively affect patients’ quality of life. Despite electroacupuncture (EA) being widely used to treat dysphagia, its effectiveness and underlying mechanism of action have not been thoroughly examined. The aim of this study was to gather preliminary data on the efficacy of EA when used as an adjunct to a standardized but individually adjusted rehabilitation program for patients with post-stroke oropharyngeal dysphagia (PSOD) and to compare EA with adjunctive neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Methods: Forty-five patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to EA, NMES or control groups. All groups received traditional rehabilitation training for dysphagia. The EA and NMES group additionally received EA at bilateral Jialianquan and NMES of the suprahyoid muscle group, respectively. Before and 3 weeks after treatment, the swallowing function of the patients was assessed by surface electromyography (sEMG), videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), standardized swallowing assessment (SSA) and water swallow test (primary outcomes). Post hoc secondary outcome measures included the functional oral intake scale (FOIS), penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) and deglutition duration. Results: All outcome measures improved within each group. When compared to the control group, greater improvements were seen in the EA group for SSA, FOIS, modified barium swallow impairment profile (MBSImp) and PAS scores, as well as several different sEMG parameters (average EMG (AEMG), peak amplitude and deglutition duration for both saliva and water) in PSOD patients. Only deglutition duration for water and saliva was significantly improved in NMES versus control groups. EA was superior to NMES only with respect to the AEMG for water and saliva. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence demonstrating that PSOD patients may benefit from EA at bilateral Jialianquan . Relative to a control group receiving traditional rehabilitation alone, the addition of EA was associated with improvements in a range of different outcome measures in PSOD patients, with medium to large effect sizes.

    "abstract": "Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a subtype of IBS. Many patients are dissatisfied with the efficacy of drug treatment and seek complementary and alternative medical therapies, especially acupuncture treatment. In this study, we evaluated the effect of manual acupuncture (MA) on IBS-D using a rat model and investigated the underlying mechanism of action by analyzing the changes in untargeted metabolomics of plasma/liver/colon and targeted plasma lipidomics. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into Control, IBS-D and MA groups (n = 10 each). IBS-D/MA groups received acetic acid enemas combined with restraint stress. The Control group received saline enemas. The MA group received daily MA at ST36 for 2 weeks after modeling. Pain and stool quality were measured by the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and Bristol stool form scale (BSFS). Plasma/liver/colon samples were collected for ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/Q-Orbitrap mass spectromy (MS) untargeted metabolomics. Plasma was also subjected to UHPLC-MS/MS targeted lipidomics. MA treatment improved BSFS and AWR scores in IBS-D model rats, suggesting reduced intestinal hypersensitivity. Metabolomic results showed that MA impacted 18 metabolites in the plasma, liver and colon, which were mainly involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Targeted lipidomic results showed MA restored the low levels of four medium-chain and one long-chain fatty acids to normal levels in IBS-D, suggesting that acupuncture treatment of IBS-D involves fatty acid metabolic pathways. MA reduced markers of intestinal hypersensitivity and impacted a number of metabolic pathways in a rat model of IBS-D.",

Following adaptive training, 60 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were allocated to one of two experiments. In experiment 1, rats received intrathecal SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), intramuscular EphB1-Fc (EphBs inhibitor) or no injection before undergoing chronic constrictive injury (CCI). In experiment 2, CCI model rats received EA either alone or combined with either anisomycin (p38 MAPK agonist) or EphrinB1-Fc (EphBs agonist) versus minimal acupuncture (MA) as a control intervention. A sham surgery group was included in both experiments as a control for CCI. All groups consisted of n = 6 rats (four in experiment 1 and six in experiment 2). Behavioral hyperalgesia was examined and the spinal L5-6 region was harvested and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β levels. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to assess protein expression of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl-2 associated X-protein (BAX), EphB1, EphrinB1, p38 MAPK, phosphorylated (p)-p38 MAPK and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (Iba)-1. CCI induced behavioral hyperalgesia, as demonstrated by altered paw withdrawal latency (PWL), paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and cytokine levels, and increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and microglial activation. However, inhibitors SB203580 and EphB1-Fc reversed these effects. Notably, EA showed similar beneficial effects, but these were counteracted when combined with anisomycin and EphrinB1-Fc. The analgesic effects of EA in this rat model of NP appear to be linked to diminished p-p38 MAPK expression and subsequent microglial deactivation. EA has a potential role as a complementary therapy for NP.",

Most subjects had similar values for many of the characteristics investigated including relative pulse force at the three traditional palpation locations ( Cun, Guan and Chi), pulse width and pulse rhythm. There were some significant gender differences. The pulse was present beyond Chi in 90% of males compared with 56% of females. Female pulses tended to be less forceful compared with males. However, with the exception of overall force, there was little support for TCM assumptions of gender differences in pulse such as in left/right balance. There was some support for the use of the TCM palpation locations Cun, Guan and Chi to discriminate between pulses since there was significant differences in manifestations of some pulse characteristics among these locations.",

    "abstract": "This is a brief review of the history of electrotherapy. Pain has been relieved by electricity since ancient times, at first by means of applying live electric fish to the tender part to cause numbness. But once frictional machines were found to produce electro-static electricity (Franklinism) in the mid 18th century the use of living organisms was discontinued. By the late 18th century Galvani had rediscovered the fact that animals developed electricity spontaneously. Volta discovered a chemical means of producing electricity from the first form of battery or voltaic pile without recourse to animal tissues or frictional machines whose efficiency varied with atmospheric conditions. This discovery led to the medical use of direct current (Galvanism). Its ability to cause necrosis by electrolytic means was employed in the destruction of tumours. Galvanism was also applied to needles, hence the first form of electroacupuncture pioneered by Berlioz and Sarlandiére. For the first time the combination of electrotherapy and oriental ideas about needling were brought together. Furthermore these early experimenters showed how stimulation of the nervous system brought profound relief from pain. In the early 19th century Faraday's work on the production of alternating currents and his understanding of electrolysis provided medicine with the escape that was required from the dangers of Galvanism. A variety of safer alternating and interrupted currents (Faradism) have been employed in electrotherapy ever since, particularly in the form of electroacupuncture, TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation) and Dorsal Column Stimulation. The popularity of electrotherapy fell during the early part of the 20th century as no one knew how its effects were obtained. However now we know how afferent nerve fibres respond to different frequencies and amplitudes, electrotherapy permits the modern practitioner to stimulate the nervous system in a number of different ways to induce the selective production of various monoamines, amino acids and peptides in the central nervous system. However more experiments are required to make electrotherapy realise its true potential in stimulating the patient's own pain relieving substances.",

This type of project, and particularly the prospective case series or pre- post-intervention study, may give valuable evidence of the overall effectiveness of acupuncture for example in different situations and in different conditions and provides one step in the research pathway before generating an hypothesis. The project should be designed with the aim of reducing bias as much as possible. Careful and detailed planning is essential for the project to produce worthwhile results that readers can evaluate and replicate. Ethical issues should be considered and formal approval may be necessary. The patient group should be recruited systematically and baseline data obtained. The treatment given should be systematic and decisions to change or end treatment made explicit. The outcome should be measured in ways that are known to be reliable and valid. Musculoskeletal problems can be evaluated with scales for pain and confirmed by measuring one other symptom such as stiffness or one other aspect such as bothersomeness. Global change scores also provide supporting information, and the MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile) measure is popular when patients with different conditions are included. The design of questionnaires for beliefs and attitudes is a specialised area that should not be attempted without expert help. Adverse events should also be recorded. Analysis of the data and the best way of summarising and presenting the results are also discussed.",

Chronic pain after rib fractures is also commonly reported. Acupuncture is widely used in the management of pain but its use has been reported rarely in the traumatic brain injury literature. This case report suggests that acupuncture may be a useful option to consider in these patients. Outcome was assessed formally using a 0 10 verbal numerical rating scale for pain, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for psychological status before and after the course of treatment. These scales are widely used in clinical practice as well as in research involving patients with traumatic brain injury, although they have not been validated in this population. The changes in this patient's outcome scores were not consistent with the benefits he reported. Treatment of this patient highlighted the difficulties of using standardised self rating scales for patients with cognitive impairment.

    "abstract": "Our wish to know more about the paths taken by electrical currents in electroacupuncture (EA) with special reference to the heart, particularly in patients with an implanted pacemaker, prompted us to undertake this study. Using ourselves as subjects, we have developed a safe oscillographic method to detect, visualise and record the EA currents that avoids the use of equipment requiring mains electricity. After two trials with unsatisfactory equipment, we found that the newly developed model 3425 PicoScope™ (Pico Technology Ltd), with a four channel differential amplifier input connected to a laptop PC operating in battery mode, satisfied our criteria. With this recording system, we carried out two sets of experiments in which EA was provided by a Cefar acus4™ stimulator. The results confirm that the placement of a pair of acupuncture needles for EA can be used to predict the paths taken by the stimulating currents, and thus their areas of likely influence. When the needles are placed in closely adjacent acupuncture points in a limb, there is little or no detectable spread of the currents along the limb or into the chest. By contrast, when the needles are placed far apart, the electrical currents spread widely. Thus, when each of a pair of needles is placed in a point on opposite arms, the electrical currents recorded in the area of the pectoral muscles is of an order that might trigger an abnormal cardiac rhythm in a susceptible heart or activate a cardiac pacemaker incorporating an intracardiac defibrillator (ICD). Our results confirm the guidelines for EA safe practice recommended by the British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS) to avoid adverse events, ie EA should not be applied such that the current is likely to traverse the heart. We can now be confident that electric fields generated by pairs of needles below the knee or elbow do not create detectable currents in the chest. It is likely that similar results would be obtained with the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) but this remains to be established by additional experiments.",

The most bothersome reaction was a temporary worsening of symptoms (29%, n=38), though this was not associated with an unwillingness to try acupuncture again (χ2 = 0.382, df = 1, p>0.536). Those unwilling to try acupuncture again reported significantly less reduction in their pain at 3 months (mean (SE) SF-36 bodily pain score at 3 months 30.453 (3.598) vs 19.30(1.128); p=0.003).Among this group of patients seeking help for low back pain, the experience of treatment reactions was universal. There was no evidence that the bothersomeness of treatment reactions was associated with patient's willingness to try acupuncture again. The benefit of pain reduction over the course of treatment appeared to outweigh self-rated bothersome reactions to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Objectives This study was performed to investigate the innervations related to acupuncture point PC8 in rats using a neural tracing technique. Methods After 6 μL of 1% cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the site between the second and third metacarpal bone in rats, a corresponding site to acupuncture point PC8 in the human body, CTB labelling was examined with immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord and brainstem. Results All CTB labelling appeared on the ipsilateral side of the injection. The labelled sensory neurons distributed from cervical (C) 6 to thoracic (T) 1 DRG, while the labelled motor neurons were located on the dorsolateral part of the spinal ventral horn ranging from the C 6 to T 1 segments. In addition, the transganglionically-labelled axonal terminals were found to be dense in the medial part of laminae 3–4 from C 6 to the T 1 spinal dorsal horn, as far as in the cuneate nucleus. Conclusions These results indicate that sensory and motor neurons associated with PC8 distribute in a distinct segmental pattern. The sensory information from PC8 could be transganglionically transported to the spinal dorsal horn and cuneate nucleus.",

Acupuncture represents a potential adjunctive treatment for cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) and yet a recent Cochrane Review4 and an earlier systematic review5 found no studies investigating its use in CIBP.

Methods The setting was an outpatient clinic at the Colorado School of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 90 years. Acupuncture-exposed participants had at least five prior acupuncture treatments, with one treatment in the month prior to the study date. Acupuncture-naïve participants had experienced no prior acupuncture treatments. Participants with dementia, cognitive impairment, or neuropathy were excluded. In total, 61 acupuncture-exposed and 59 acupuncture-naïve participants were blindfolded and received either real acupuncture or toothpick sham acupuncture treatment. Following treatment, participants completed a questionnaire rating the realness of the acupuncture and were asked how they made this determination. We used a previously developed scale rating treatments from 1 (definitely real needle) to 5 (definitely imitation needle) to assess outcome. Results Perceptions of the real treatment were rated as more real than sham treatments for all participants. Further analysis revealed that prior acupuncture exposure did not influence ratings of real treatments, but exposed participants rated sham treatments as significantly less real than naïve participants. Conclusions Acupuncture-naïve and exposed participants both reported different perceptions of real and sham acupuncture using a blindfolded toothpick protocol. This suggests that future trials should carefully monitor participant perceptions of treatments received, even for naïve individuals. Differences between groups further suggest that participants with significant and/or recent exposure to real acupuncture may introduce bias to blinded clinical acupuncture trials.",

Methods A total of 30 teachers and 60 students participated in this study. Acupuncture needles were inserted at LI11 and motion videos were recorded for three subtypes of ‘lifting-thrusting’ manipulation: (1) ‘mild reinforcing-attenuating’; (2) ‘reinforcing’; and (3) ‘attenuating’. The videos were analysed using Simi Motion 3D software to acquire the movement parameters of four trace marks: ‘thumb tip’; ‘forefinger tip’; ‘forefinger middle joint’; and ‘forefinger base joint’. Differences between the two groups were compared using t-tests, X 2 tests and/or rank-sum tests. Results Changes in the near-end interphalangeal joint were positively associated with a range of movement along the X axis. Motion parameters for the thumb tip, the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the forefinger and the X axis shaft swing near the end of the forefinger in the teacher group were higher than those in the student group. The teacher group featured smaller trough dispersion and smaller crest dispersion during ‘reinforcing’ and ‘attenuating’ manipulations, respectively. Conclusions The ‘lifting-thrusting’ manipulation could be simplified as a fixed-axis rotation using metacarpophalangeal joints in the thumb and forefinger as the shaft centre. Teachers opened at a larger angular variation for the PIP during the lifting and thrusting processes with better spatial control. Temporal control was similar between groups and therefore appears easier to grasp. Repetitive training might be helpful for improving athletic and spatial stability during needle manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture has been associated with improved cerebral circulation, analgesia, neuromodulatory function and neurogenesis. In particular, acupuncture at ST36 has been widely used in several central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, its effects on hydrocephalus have not been studied. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture at ST36 on behaviour, motor development and reactive astrogliosis in infantile rats with hydrocephalus.Hydrocephalus was induced in sixteen 7-day-old pup rats by injection of 20% kaolin into the cisterna magna. One day after hydrocephalus induction, acupuncture was applied once daily (for 30 min) for a total of 21 days in eight randomly selected animals (HAc group) while the remaining eight remained untreated (H group). An additional eight healthy animals were included as controls (C group). All animals were weighed daily and, from the fifth day after hydrocephalus induction, underwent MRI to determine the ventricular ratio (VR). Rats were also exposed to modified open-field tests every 3 days until the end of the experiment. After 21 days all the animals were euthanased and their brains removed for histology and immunohistochemistry.Hydrocephalic rats showed an increase in VR when compared with control rats (P<0.01). In addition, these animals exhibited delayed weight gain, which was attenuated with acupuncture treatment. Hydrocephalic animals treated with acupuncture performed better in open field tests (P<0.05), and had a reduction in reactive astrocyte cell density in the corpus callosum and external capsule, as assessed by GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) immunohistochemistry (P<0.05).These findings indicate that acupuncture at ST36 has a neuroprotective potential mediated, in part, by inhibition of astrogliosis.",

Methods After injection of CTB into the tissues at GB14, ST2 and ST6 in the rat, the neural labelling associated with each acupuncture point was revealed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry of the nervous system, including the trigeminal ganglion (TRG), cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord and brain. Results The CTB labelling included sensory neurons and their transganglionic axonal terminals, as well as motor neurons. The labelled sensory neurons associated with GB14, ST2 and ST6 were distributed in both the TRG and cervical DRG, and their centrally projected axons terminated in an orderly fashion at their corresponding targets in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and cervical spinal dorsal horn. In addition, labelled motor neurons were observed in the facial motor nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus and cervical spinal ventral horn, in which facial motor neurons projected to the tissues located at all three acupuncture points. Trigeminal motor neurons innervated both ST2 and ST6, while spinal motor neurons only correlated with ST6. Conclusions These results indicate that the tissues located at each of these three traditional acupuncture points in the rat forehead and face has its own sensory and motor connection with the nervous system in a region-specific pattern through distinct neural pathways. Understanding the neuroanatomical characteristics of acupuncture points from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system should help inform acupuncture point selection according to the demands of the clinical situation.",

SHRs were randomly divided into three groups: no treatment (SHR group); acupuncture at KI3 (KI3 group); and sham acupuncture (Sham group). Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as a normal blood pressure (BP) control group. Rats were subjected to 10 min of acupuncture once a day for 7 days. BP and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) were measured after the first acupuncture session and after 7 days of treatment.The results showed that BP was lower in the KI3 group than in the SHR group, both 30-60 min after the first acupuncture session and 24-48 h after the 7-day treatment. Compared with the WKY group, the SHR group had lower glucose metabolism in the motor cortex, sensory cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, caudate putamen, and visual cortex. Compared with the untreated/sham-treated SHR control groups, cerebral glucose metabolism was lower in the medulla oblongata, thalamus, dorsal thalamus, orbital cortex, and hypothalamus after acupuncture at KI3, while it was higher in the olfactory cortex and inferior phrenic muscle.Our results show that, in SHRs, needling at KI3 reduces high BP, most likely by altering the activation of cerebral regions.",

Two disposable acupuncture needles were inserted at two traditional acupuncture points (ST36 and ST38), located along the anterior tibialis muscle. EA stimulation was administered for 10 min.

This condition could represent a localised or segmental immune deficiency. Recurrent canine otitis seems to be one example of this problem. It has been reported that acupuncture increased the efficacy of conventional treatment for canine otitis by &gt;50%. Objective To assess whether the relapse rate of recurrent canine otitis over 1 year can be modified by acupuncture in adult dogs. Methods One-year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial. 31 dogs with a history of recurring otitis were randomised into two groups. In addition to conventional treatment, each group received four sessions of either real acupuncture, group A (n=16), or sham acupuncture, group B (n=15). The main outcome for the follow-up was the rate of acute otitis episodes in each group over 1 year, with blinded evaluation. A χ 2 test was used for statistical analysis. Results There was one dropout in each group. Fourteen (93%) dogs in group A: were free of otitis relapses, compared with 7 (50%) in group B (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion Acupuncture seems effective for preventing relapses in cases of recurrent canine otitis. This result suggests that acupuncture could be tested as a treatment of other recurrent localised infections. Given the ability of acupuncture to modulate neurotransmitters and opioid peptides, which can in turn modulate the immune system, the immune response to acupuncture also seems worth exploring.",

The State of Sao Paulo Cancer Institute is a public hospital established in 2008 and its acupuncture service follows the experience and model of several oncology centres in the USA, aiming to optimise the treatment of symptoms such as postoperative pain, oncological pain, neuropathic pain, nausea, vomiting, xerostomia and fatigue induced by chemotherapy.

Baseline and final symptom intensity was recorded using a visual analogue score (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 cm, with a higher score meaning higher symptom intensity.Fifty-four (29.50%) were receiving active treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 29 (15.85%) were receiving hormone therapy and 100 (54.65%) were considered to be in remission. The main symptoms were: oncological pain in 44 (24.04%), chemotoxicity in 34 (18.6%), lumbar pain in 53 (28.96%) and chronic postoperative pain in 54 (28.4%).

    "abstract": "Introduction There is insufficient evidence of a relationship between acupuncture needle sensations ( de qi) and hypoalgesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bidirectional needle rotation at LI10 on acupuncture needle sensations and heat pain thresholds. Methods Twenty-two healthy participants received one acupuncture needle at LI10 with bidirectional rotation of the needle in one experimental session and one acupuncture needle at LI10 with mock rotation in a separate session, in a randomised order. Measurements of heat pain thresholds were taken before needle insertion, during needle retention and 15 min after needle removal. At each measurement time point, participants rated needle sensations using the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) of overall intensity of needle sensation. Results Bidirectional needle rotation produced significantly higher scores for VAS, MASStotal, MASSpain and MASSsensation compared with mock rotation (all p&lt;0.001). There were significantly higher pain thresholds relative to pre-intervention baseline during (p=0.014) and after (p&lt;0.001) bidirectional needle rotation but not during (p=0.1) or after (p=0.62) mock bidirectional needle rotation. Bidirectional needle rotation increased the pain threshold relative to baseline 15 min after the needles were removed (p=0.009). A significant but low correlation between needle sensation and change in pain threshold after needling was only found when data from mock and rotation interventions were combined. Conclusions Needle rotation increases the magnitude of hypoalgesia. There is tentative evidence that needle sensation may be associated with the amount of change in pain threshold.",

The patient was a 58-year-old Chinese woman with profound hearing loss, a feeling of fullness in the ear, vomiting and severe dizziness for 2 months. A head scan and MRI of the brain and neck showed no cause for the symptoms. The ear, nose and throat specialist diagnosed a microcirculatory dysfunction, rejecting the diagnosis of Meniere's disease. The patient did not respond to medical treatment and after 2 months attended for acupuncture. It was suspected that the severe dizziness was associated with her neck and back pain. Daily electroacupuncture treatments to her ear, back and neck were given. After 1 month the dizziness was significantly reduced and the hearing loss recovered to a good level. The patient's symptoms recurred after exposure to cold and strong wind and again recovered with acupuncture. She later suffered a third recurrence of severe dizziness which again responded to acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Objective To investigate and compare the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment at GV20 and ST36 on fatigue in rats. Methods Rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups: control, fatigue, fatigue+GV20 and fatigue+ST36. The last two groups received EA pretreatment at GV20 or ST36 for 5 days before being maintained in cages filled with water to a height of 1.5 cm to establish an animal model of fatigue. We used the weight-loaded forced swimming test and open-field test and measured 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) ratios and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and testosterone as behavioural and biochemical markers of fatigue in the rats. Results Compared with controls, rats in the (untreated) fatigue group exhibited reduced weight-loaded swimming times and total movement/distance in the open-field test, plus higher BUN/LDH and lower testosterone levels. Both EA pretreatment at GV20 and ST36 increased swimming times, and reduced serum BUN/LDH. EA pretreatment at GV20 (but not ST36) increased serum testosterone. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios in four brain regions were decreased in the fatigue+GV20 group compared with the fatigue group (p&lt;0.05). By contrast, 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios in striatum and hypothalamus (but not hippocampus or midbrain) were decreased in the fatigue+ST36 group compared with the fatigue group (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, only pretreatment at GV20 affected the results of the open-field test. Conclusions These results suggest that EA pretreatment had a positive effect on the prevention of fatigue. Pretreatment at GV20 had a greater anti-fatigue effect than pretreatment at ST36.",

Moxibustion releases a considerable amount of smoke into the environment. There remains controversy over the safety of moxa smoke and its potential effects on human health.We measured the PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) mass concentration in moxa smoke and the oxidative capacity of PM2.5 and moxa ash (using a plasmid scission assay in whole and water-soluble fractions) in the by-products of moxibustion produced from burning moxa floss of different ratios (3:1 or 15:1) and duration of storage (3 or 10 years) in three simulated moxibustion clinics.PM2.5 mass concentration was 224.28, 226.39 and 210.56 μg/m(3) for samples A (3 years and 3:1 ratio), B (3 years and 15:1 ratio), and C (10 years and 3:1 ratio), respectively. Average D500 oxidative damage of PM2.5 was 29.42%, 29.16% and 27.01% and that of moxa ash was 22.78%, 20.60% and 21.42% for samples A, B and C, respectively. PM2.5 demonstrated a significantly greater oxidative capacity than moxa ash (p<0.05).The oxidative DNA damage induced by individual PM2.5 following moxibustion was lower than that reported in other environments. However, PM2.5 mass concentration after moxibustion is still relatively high. We would recommend ensuring adequate ventilation during moxibustion to reduce any possible risks. Further studies are needed to better define the potential impact of particles in moxibustion by-products on human health.",

The needles passed between the tendons of the palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis muscles and then penetrated the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus and pronator quadratus muscles. The inserted needles were located adjacent to the median nerve. To minimise the risk of unintended injury by acupuncture, it is recommended that needles should not be inserted deeply at the PC6 acupuncture point. An understanding of the anatomical variations of the median nerve and the persistent median artery in the forearm is of clinical importance when performing acupuncture procedures.",

A rat model of heroin addiction was established by intramuscular injection of incremental doses of heroin for 8 consecutive days. A rat model of heroin relapse was established according to the exposure (addiction) → detoxification method. Apoptotic changes in nerve cells in the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were evaluated in each group of rats using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. PERK, eIF2a, CHOP, IRE1 and JNK gene expression and protein expression were measured using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay and immunohistochemical assay, respectively.The total number of positive nerve cells in the hippocampus and VTA was significantly lower in the Heroin+acupuncture group than in the Heroin group (p<0.01). Compared with the Heroin group, mRNA and protein expression of PERK, eIF2a, CHOP, IRE1 and JNK in the hippocampus and VTA were significantly downregulated in the Heroin+acupuncture group (p<0.05).The acupuncture-regulated ERS response appears to mediate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in heroin-addicted rats with brain injury. Inhibition of CHOP and JNK upregulation and reduction of nerve cell apoptosis may be the main mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on heroin addiction-induced brain injury.",

Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. Data on 1479 eligible patients were extracted, and the relative risk (RR) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for the effective rate (ER), swallowing function assessment (SFA), individual activity (IA), eg., modified Barthel Index (MBI) and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated.The pooled ER (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.34, P<0.001, 14 studies) and SFA (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32, P<0.001, five studies) suggested that combination therapy yielded a significantly higher ER and improved the SFA scores to a greater degree than swallowing training alone in patients with poststroke dysphagia. The pooled QOL score (SMD 1.06; 95% CI -0.04 to 2.17, P=0.06, two studies) did not differ between groups. The MBI data (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87, P<0.001, one study) showed significant improvement in IA. Some evidence of publication bias was observed for the ER, although the trim-and-fill analysis and fail-safe number indicated no influence of publication bias on its pooled effect size. There was no evidence of publication bias of any other outcome measures.This study showed that acupuncture combined with swallowing training may improve the ER, swallowing function and activities of daily life of patients with poststroke dysphagia compared with conventional swallowing training alone.",

    "abstract": "There are multiple treatment options for hiccups, including non-pharmacological therapies, but little evidence of superiority of one treatment over another. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture on persistent hiccups after arthroplasty.From April 2010 to December 2015, 15 patients with primary unilateral total hip/knee arthroplasty were diagnosed with persistent hiccups and given acupuncture at PC6, CV12 and ST36. Each acupuncture session lasted 30 min. The total number of treatment sessions was determined by the persistence of symptoms, but acupuncture was administered no more than three times over the course of a week. The hiccups assessment instrument (HAI) was used to assess the severity of hiccups pre-treatment and post-treatment. Adverse events were also recorded.Absolute resolution was observed in all 15 patients after less than three acupuncture sessions. Of these, 10 patients required only one acupuncture session, 3 patients required two sessions and 2 patients required three sessions. The HAI score improved after each round of acupuncture treatment (P<0.05). The average HAI score improved significantly post-acupuncture compared to baseline values pre-treatment (P<0.05). Symptoms accompanying the hiccups included pain in the diaphragmatic area (five patients), mild dyspnoea (three patients), dysphagia (two patients) and nausea/vomiting (one patient). All these accompanying symptoms disappeared at the point of resolution of the hiccups. There were no adverse effects related to acupuncture during the study period.Based on our results, acupuncture may represent a potential treatment option for hiccups after arthroplasty. Caution must be exercised, however, given the lack of a control group. Accordingly, randomised controlled trials will be required to verify the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of hiccups.",

We have previously reported that electroacupuncture (EA) relieves labour pain, but the potential mechanisms remain unclear. Objective: To observe the effects of EA on labour pain intensity, serum PGE2 levels and the p38 MAPK signalling pathway in rats during labour. Methods: Female rats copulated with male rats to induce pregnancy, and then received castor oil to trigger labour. During labour, rats remained untreated (Control group, n=30) or were treated with remifentanil (n=30) or EA at Jiaji (n=30) or SP6+LI4 (n=30), respectively. The warm water tail-flick test was used to assess labour pain. Serum PGE2 levels were measured by ELISA. Protein expression of prostaglandin E2 receptor (PGER2), p38 MAPK and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) were analysed by Western blotting, and mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. Results: EA treatment at Jiaji or SP6+LI4 significantly relieved labour pain, decreased serum PGE2 levels and inhibited protein and gene expression of PGER2 in the myometrium. Moreover, EA reduced protein expression of PLA2 and p38 MAPK, and inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the lumbar spinal cord but not in the cerebral grey matter. Additionally, EA markedly decreased mRNA levels of p38 MAPK in the lumbar spinal cord and significantly reduced PLA2-IV mRNA levels in both the lumbar spinal cord and cerebral grey matter. Conclusions: This study indicates that EA relieves labour pain through, at least in part, inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK-mediated PGE2 release and uterine PGER2 expression in rats.",

CBF velocity and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) were measured using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). The changes in hyperventilation-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity and modified blood flow velocity at 40 mm Hg (CV40) were observed for both ACAs and MCAs before and after GB34 acupuncture treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured before and after GB34 acupuncture treatment.The CO2 reactivity of the ipsilateral MCA significantly increased after GB34 acupuncture treatment, compared with that at baseline (P=0.007). In contrast, the CO2 reactivity of both ACAs and the contralateral MCA remained unchanged. The CV40 of both ACAs and MCAs did not change after GB34 acupuncture treatment and neither did the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate.GB34 acupuncture treatment increased CO2 reactivity specifically in the ipsilateral MCA, but had no effect on either the ACAs or the contralateral MCA. These data suggest that GB34 acupuncture treatment improves the vasodilatory potential of the cerebral vasculature to compensate for fluctuations caused by changes in external conditions and could potentially be useful for the treatment of disorders of the ipsilateral MCA circulation.",

The epidemiological prevalence is approximately 3–5% in women and increases with age. Antagonism of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) reportedly attenuates acid saline-induced FM pain in mice. Aims: Whether pre-treatment with electroacupuncture (EA) or APETx2 can attenuate mechanical hyperalgesia in this murine model remains unknown. Methods: Accordingly, we examined the analgesic effect of EA in a murine model of FM pain induced by dual injections of acid saline and investigated whether EA or APETx2 can attenuate FM pain via the ASIC3 channel. Results: EA significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia in this model. ASIC3 antagonism, induced by injecting APETx2, also significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia. The expression of ASIC3 in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord and thalamus was increased after FM model induction. Over-expression of these nociceptive channels was attenuated by pre-treatment with EA or an ASIC3 antagonist. Conclusion: Our data reveal that both EA and ASIC3 blockade significantly reduce FM pain in mice via the ASIC3, Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 signalling pathways. Moreover, our findings support the potential clinical use of EA for the treatment of FM pain.",

The remaining 80 rats were allocated to undergo Western blot detection of S6 ribosomal protein (pS6, ser240/244). The model was created by mechanical clamping of the sciatic nerve stem. EA stimulation at GB30 and ST36 for 15 min separately was applied once daily for rats in the EA and EA+Rapa groups. For rats in the EA+Rapa group, rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) pathway inhibitor, was injected intramuscularly (1 mg/kg/day) near the site of crush injury in the sciatic nerve and an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was injected in the other three groups every other day. After treatment for 7, 14, 28 and 42 days post-operation, the SFI of 27 rats was obtained to evaluate recovery of motor function and five rats from each group per stage were used for Western blot detection of pS6.The SFI values showed that EA could significantly promote recovery of the injured sciatic nerve but rapamycin hindered the therapeutic effect of EA. Moreover, immunoblotting indicated that EA improved the expression of pS6 in the area of the sciatic nerve crush injury and local injection of rapamycin near the injured sciatic nerve decreased its expression. The pS6 level correlated with the extent of recovery of the injury.This study indicated that EA may activate the mTOR signalling pathway to enhance expression of pS6 and facilitate recovery following sciatic nerve crush injury.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether auricular acupuncture (AA) attenuates bodyweight and obese inflammation through the release of irisin from muscle tissue in mice. Methods: Sixty 4-week-old mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks. These animals were divided into six groups that remained untreated (HFD) or underwent electrical AA (HFD+EAA), sham EAA (HFD+SEAA), adrenalectomy (HFD+AD), adrenalectomy and EAA (HFD+AD+EAA), or adrenalectomy and injection of recombinant lentivirus expressing fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (rFNDC) (HFD+AD+rFNDC) in the ninth week. The EAA and SEAA were performed at two traditional auricular acupuncture points daily for 4 weeks. An additional 10 mice fed a control diet were included as a normal control (NC) group. At the end of the study, norepinephrine (NE) in the serum, tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in the serum and white adipose tissue, irisin in the serum and muscle, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) in the brown adipose tissue (BAT), and FNDC5 in the muscle, were analysed. Results: The AD+EAA group exhibited better control of bodyweight and inflammation compared with the AD+SEAA and untreated HFD model groups (P&lt;0.05), especially regarding the increased expression of NE, FNDC5, irisin and UCP-1 (P&lt;0.05). After adrenalectomy, mice receiving EAA had less NE, FNDC5, irisin and UCP-1 as well as greater expression of inflammatory cytokines and bodyweight. However, lentiviral overexpression of rFNDC successfully reversed this situation in the AD mice and mimicked the effects of EAA on bodyweight, inflammation and expression of FNDC5, irisin and UCP-1, although it did not impact NE. Conclusions: EAA promoted NE release from the adrenal gland leading to further expression of FNDC5, irisin and UCP-1, which contributed to weight management and inflammatory inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Background: A growing body of evidence shows that neuronal activity is involved in modulating the efficacy of acupuncture therapy. However, it has been seldom investigated whether neuronal activity following acupuncture stimulation is effective at regulating hepatic inflammation. Objective: Using the concanavalin A (ConA) model of hepatitis, we investigated the regulation of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the liver tissue and the blood after acupuncture stimulation at ST36. Methods: Mice were subjected to ConA injection, acupuncture stimulation at ST36 by manual acupuncture (MA) or electroacupuncture (EA) procedures, and vagotomy (VNX). Liver tissue and blood were collected for TNF-α analysis. TNF-α mRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and TNF-α, CD11b, CD68, and Erk1/2 proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: TNF-α mRNA and protein were induced in CD11b-positive hepatic cells and the plasma at 6–24 h after ConA injection. The application of MA or EA was very effective at attenuating the production of TNF-α. Anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture were greatly suppressed by VNX in ConA-injected animals, suggesting the requirement of vagus nerve activity in acupuncture-mediated anti-inflammatory responses. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve (SNS) resulted in an anti-inflammatory effect similar to acupuncture stimulation. In parallel with TNF-α, production of phospho-Erk1/2, which was induced in the liver tissue, was downregulated by MA and EA in liver cells. Conclusion: The regulatory effects of acupuncture stimulation on inflammatory responses in the liver may be modulated through the activation of the vagus nerve pathway.",

    "abstract": "Background In a recent individual patient data meta-analysis, acupuncture was found to be superior to sham and non-sham controls in patients with chronic pain. It has been suggested that a subgroup of patients has an exceptional response to acupuncture. We hypothesized the presence of exceptional acupuncture responders would lead to a different distribution of pain scores in acupuncture versus control groups, with the former being skewed to the right. Methods This individual patient data meta-analysis included 39 high-quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic headache, migraine, osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain and shoulder pain published before December 2015 (n = 20,827). In all, 25 involved sham acupuncture controls (n = 7097) and 25 non-acupuncture controls (n = 16,041). We analyzed the distribution of change scores and calculated the difference in the skewness statistic—which assesses asymmetry in the data distribution—between acupuncture and either sham or non-acupuncture control groups. We then entered the difference in skewness along with standard error into a meta-analysis. Findings Control groups were more right-skewed than acupuncture groups, although this difference was very small. The difference in skew was 0.124 for non-acupuncture-controlled trials (p = 0.047) and 0.141 for sham-controlled trials (p = 0.029). In a pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding three trials with outlying results known a priori, the difference in skew between acupuncture and sham was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.2). Conclusion We did not find evidence to support the notion that there are exceptional acupuncture responders. The challenge remains to identify features of chronic pain patients that can be used to distinguish those that have a good response to acupuncture treatment.",

The aim of this preliminary study was to explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of post-stroke OAB. Methods This study was a multi-site randomized, assessor-blind, controlled pilot trial of patients with post-stroke OAB. In all, 34 post-stroke subjects (mean age: 71.0 years; 32.4% female) with OAB symptoms were randomly assigned to the treatment group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The subjects in the treatment group were treated with six sessions of EA for 4 weeks, while the subjects in the control group received usual care. The primary outcome measure was the overactive bladder symptom scale (OABSS). Secondary outcome measures included a three day bladder diary and the stroke-specific quality-of-life scale (SSQoL). Results EA showed a moderate effect size (ES) on the perceived severity of OAB symptoms as measured by the OABSS at week 5 (one week post-treatment, ES 0.57; p = 0.034) and week 8 (three weeks post-treatment, ES 0.60; p = 0.021), although the results did not remain statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. No significant differences in bladder diary parameters or SSQoL score were found. The EA treatment was well tolerated by the post-stroke subjects. Conclusion A six-session EA treatment was feasible and appeared to reduce OAB symptoms in post-stroke patients. Further fully powered trials are warranted to confirm the efficacy of EA for those with post-stroke OAB.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) and manual acupuncture (MA) are the two acupuncture modalities frequently used for PHPS in the clinical setting.

The primary outcome was the proportion of treatment responders, defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the worst pain intensity experienced during the first steps in the morning after a 4-week treatment, measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100; higher scores signify worse pain). Analysis was by intention-to-treat.Ninety-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of PHPS were enrolled from 29 July 2018 through 28 June 2019. Of the patients, 78 (85%) completed the treatment and follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 54.8% (23/42) of the EA group compared to 50.0% (21/42) of the MA group after the 4-week treatment (difference -4.76, 95% confidence interval, -26.10 to 16.57, P = 0.662). There were no significant between-group differences for any secondary outcomes after 4 weeks of treatment and at 16 weeks and 28 weeks of follow-up.

    "abstract": "Objectives: The degree to which the effects of acupuncture treatment vary between acupuncturists is unknown. We used a large individual patient dataset of trials of acupuncture for chronic pain to assess practitioner heterogeneity. Methods: Individual patient data linked to identifiable acupuncturists were drawn from a dataset of 39 high-quality trials of acupuncture, where the comparators were either sham acupuncture or non-acupuncture controls, such as standard care or waitlist. Heterogeneity among acupuncturists was assessed by meta-analysis. Results: A total of 1206 acupuncturists in 13 trials were included. Statistically significant heterogeneity was found in trials with sham-control groups (p &lt; 0.0001) and non-acupuncture control groups (p &lt;0.0001). However, the degree of heterogeneity was very small, with the observed distribution of treatment effects virtually overlapping that expected by chance. For instance, for non-acupuncture-controlled trials, the proportion of acupuncturists with effect sizes half a standard deviation greater or less than average was expected to be 34%, but was observed to be 37%. A limitation is that the trials included a relatively limited range of acupuncturists, mainly physician-acupuncturists. Discussion: Although differences in effects between acupuncturists were greater than expected by chance, the degree of variation was small. This suggests that most chronic pain patients in clinical practice would have similar results to those reported in high-quality trials; comparably, we did not find evidence to suggest that greater standardization of acupuncture practice would improve outcomes. Further research needs to be conducted exploring variability using a sample of acupuncturists with a broader range of practice styles, training and experience.",

    "abstract": "Health inequities or disparities challenge governments and public health systems, impacting health service delivery worldwide. Inherent disadvantage linked to the social determinants of health is intrinsic to the health outcomes among society's marginalised and most vulnerable members. It is acknowledged that marginalised individuals present with higher levels of chronic disease, multi-morbidities and adverse health behaviours than their non-disadvantaged peers. Marginalised individuals and communities present with complex health problems and often receive poor quality or inadequate health care that is unable to meet their needs, leading to stigmatisation and perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage.Emerging research indicates that there may be a role for acupuncture in managing the health needs of marginalised populations and that when historical barriers to accessing acupuncture treatment (such as awareness, availability and affordability of this therapy) are removed, certain marginalised populations are open to engaging with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture has been used by low-income, refugee, veteran and ethnic minority groups to manage chronic pain, substance use disorders, stress and the impacts of trauma in conventional health settings such as community clinics and hospitals. There is the suggestion that integrative health settings and group treatment models may improve access and uptake of acupuncture among marginalised groups.Evidence suggests that the sociodemographic profile of acupuncture users is diverse and acupuncture therapy holds potential value in the treatment of marginalised populations. Further research that investigates reframing and expanding the scope of practice for acupuncture is timely and may contribute to tackling health inequity.",

The present study was designed to investigate the hypnotic effect of acupuncture stimulation at HT7 on caffeine-induced sleep disorders and locomotor activity in rats. We also evaluated neuronal activity changes in the arousal region of the basal forebrain.Rats received intraperitoneal injections of caffeine, and then electroencephalogram power spectrum analysis and locomotor activity measurements were performed. Stimulation at HT7 was performed using a mechanical acupuncture instrument (MAI) before caffeine injection, and its effects on caffeine-induced changes in sleep architecture, locomotor activity and c-Fos expression were examined.Caffeine injection (7.5 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in slow-wave sleep and an increase in wake time compared with saline injection. Caffeine injection also increased locomotor activity and c-Fos expression in the medial septum-vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS-VDB), one of the arousal regions of the basal forebrain. Stimulation at HT7 with the MAI alleviated the caffeine-induced sleep disturbance and the increase in locomotor activity. In addition, MAI treatment at HT7, compared with treatment at a location not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point, reduced the caffeine-induced increase in c-Fos expression.These results indicate that the hypnotic effect of HT7 acupuncture stimulation on caffeine-induced insomnia was associated with suppression of neuronal activity in the basal forebrain.",

Dry needling (DN) is an invasive technique recommended for the treatment of MTrPs. However, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the influence of the DN technique on modification of muscle stiffness and neurophysiological properties of MTrPs. Objective: The objective was to examine the effect of DN on muscle stiffness and motoneuron excitability of a latent medial MTrP (nodule and TB) of the soleus muscle in non-injured subjects. Methods: A double-blinded randomised controlled trial of 46 subjects with latent medial MTrPs of the soleus was conducted, in which all received one session of DN. The intervention group (n = 23) were subjected to DN into the MTrP (the nodule), while the control group (n = 23) were subjected to DN into the TB. Assessment was carried out at baseline (pre-test), after the intervention (post-test) and 1 week after the intervention (follow-up). Biomechanical variables (muscle resistive force at 10°/s and 180°/s, muscle extensibility and strength), as measured with an isokinetic dynamometer, and neurophysiological variables (H-reflex), were recorded. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in biomechanical or neurophysiological assessments between groups. Considering the intra-group analysis, subjects in the intervention group exhibited increased maximal isometric voluntary force to ankle plantarflexion (MIVF p ) at both post-intervention and follow-up assessment (p &lt; 0.0125; 0.2 &lt; d &lt; 0.5), while no changes were found in the control group. Conclusion: One session of DN targeting latent MTrPs did not change muscle stiffness, muscle extensibility or motoneuron excitability. Further research on subjects with muscle tone disorders should be considered to better address the impact of DN on muscle tone. Trial registration number: NCT02575586 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

There has thus been expectation that other forms of headache should benefit also. Unfortunately, acupuncture has not generally been successful for cluster headache. This may be due to acupuncturists approaching the problem as one of severe migraine. In fact, cluster headache is classed as a trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. In this case report, episodic cluster headache is treated in the same way as has been shown effective for trigeminal neuralgia. Acupuncture is applied to the contralateral side at points appropriate for stimulating branches of the trigeminal nerve. Thus, ST2 is used for the infraorbital nerve, BL2 and Yuyao for the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves, and Taiyang for the temporal branch of the zygomatic nerve.",

More evidence is provided by two trials3 ,4 which suggest that the perioperative administration of acupuncture may be a useful adjunct for postoperative analgesia.\n\nThe study by Ntritsou et al 3 confirms the conclusions of this meta-analysis and again demonstrates the benefits of postoperative acupuncture listed above. Besides the importance of confirming the evidence from previous studies, there are several interesting aspects in this investigation which are worthy of comment.\n\nNtritsou et al used a pragmatic approach, where acupuncture for postoperative pain relief was performed immediately at the end of surgery in the operating room. This postoperative approach means that acupuncture interferes much less with the running of the operation.

Recognising that acupuncture is a diverse field of practice, the aim of this study was to gain a broader, global perspective on the different approaches and rationales used in the application of acupuncture in PHP. Methods We built upon an earlier systematic review (which was limited by the necessity of a methodological focus on efficacy) using the critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) method to draw upon a wider international sample of 25 clinical sources, including case reports and case series. Multiple tracks of analysis led to an emergent synthesis. Results Findings are presented at three levels: primary (summarised data); secondary (patterns observed); and tertiary (emergent synthesis). Multiple treatments and rationales were documented but no single approach dominated. Notable contradictions emerged such as the application of moxibustion by some authors and ice by others. Synthesis of findings revealed a ‘patchwork’ of factors influencing the approaches taken. Conclusions The complexity of the field of acupuncture was illustrated through the ‘lens’ of PHP. The ‘patchwork’ metaphor provides a unifying framework for a previously divergent community of practice and research. Several directions for future research were identified, such as: importance of prior duration; existence of diagnostic subgroups; and how practitioners make clinical decisions and report their findings. CIS was found to provide visibility for multiple viewpoints in developing theory and modelling the processes of ‘real world’ practice by acupuncturists addressing the problem of PHP.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cervical spondylosis (CS) is a prevalent disorder that can have a major negative impact on quality of life. Traditional conservative treatment has limited efficacy, and electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel treatment option. We investigated the application and molecular mechanism of EA treatment in a rat model of cervical intervertebral disk degeneration (CIDD). Methods: The CIDD rat model was established, following which rats in the electroacupuncture (EA) group received EA. For overexpression of IL-22 or inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 signaling, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant IL-22 protein (p-IL-22) or the JAK2-STAT3 (Janus kinase 2—signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3) inhibitor AG490 after model establishment. Rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were isolated and cultured. Cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry were used to analyze the viability and apoptosis of the NP cells. Expression of IL-22, JAK2 and STAT3 was determined using RT-qPCR. Expression of IL-22/JAK2-STAT3 pathway and apoptosis related proteins was detected by Western blotting (WB). Results: EA protected the NP tissues of CIDD rats by regulating the IL-22/JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Overexpression of IL-22 significantly promoted the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)3 and MMP13 compared with the EA group. WB demonstrated that the expression of IL-22, p-JAK2, p-STAT3, caspase-3 and Bax in NP cells of the EA group was significantly reduced and Bcl-2 elevated compared with the model group. EA regulated cytokines and MMP through activation of IL-22/JAK2-STAT3 signaling in CIDD rat NP cells. Conclusion: We demonstrated that EA affected apoptosis by regulating the IL-22/JAK2-STAT3 pathway in NP cells and reducing inflammatory factors in the CIDD rat model. The results extend our knowledge of the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of EA as a potential treatment approach for CS in clinical practice.",

Methods: Demographic and clinical data were extracted from patients’ records over a 7-year period. The Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MYMOP) questionnaire and an adapted Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale were used routinely to monitor patient outcomes over an 18-month period. Finally, a retrospective questionnaire was used to assess patient beliefs regarding treatment effectiveness, adverse events and overall experience with care. Patients not providing consent or known to be deceased were excluded. Results: Data were collected for 306 patients presenting with 376 separate health complaints, 58% of which were musculoskeletal. Follow-up outcomes (MYMOP scores (n = 51) and PGIC scale responses (n = 50)) showed a clinically significant improvement compared to baseline for the majority of health complaints (93% of PGIC scores were ‘improved’ and 79% MYMOP demonstrated &gt; 1 point change). Total mean MYMOP severity scores were reduced by almost 50% (p &lt; 0.001) after 1–4 weeks, and this was sustained in the medium-to-long term. There was a strong negative correlation (r = −0.767, p &lt; 0.001) between the MYMOP and PGIC scores. A total of 118 health complaints were reported by 85/255 patients who responded to a retrospective questionnaire. Over 84% of patients believed that the treatments they received were ‘effective’ at addressing their health complaints. Seven minor adverse events were reported and four patients experienced negative treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Although musculoskeletal conditions were the most common, this audit found that patients sought treatment for a wide range of predominantly chronic health complaints, for many of which there is a currently a lack of quality evidence to support the use of acupuncture. Overall, the small sample of patients who responded to outcome questionnaires reported clinically meaningful and sustained improvements.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine is a frequently abused and highly addictive drug that damages brain health and imposes substantial social and economic costs. Acupuncture has been used in the treatment of cocaine addiction and has been shown to improve abnormal mental and motor states. This article mainly focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms involving the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) that underlie the effects of acupuncture in the treatment of cocaine addiction. The central dopamine system is a key player in acupuncture treatment of cocaine addiction; the ventral tegmental area (VTA)—nucleus accumbens (NAc) signaling pathway, which has a modulatory influence on behavior and psychology after chronic use of cocaine, is a significant target of acupuncture action. Moreover, acupuncture alleviates cocaine-induced seizures or acute psychomotor responses through the paraventricular thalamus and the lateral habenula (LHb)—rostromedial tegmental (RMTg) nucleus circuits. The data suggest that acupuncture can impact various cocaine-induced issues via stimulation of diverse brain areas; nevertheless, the interconnection of these brain regions and the PNS mechanisms involved remain unknown. In this review, we also discuss the effects of specific acupuncture protocols on cocaine addiction and note that variations in needling modalities, current intensities and traditional acupuncture point locations have led to different experimental results. Therefore, standardized acupuncture protocols (with respect to stimulation methods, point locations and number of sessions) may become particularly important in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Osteoporosis is widely regarded as a typical aged-related disease caused by impaired bone remodeling. This research was designed to explore the protective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on senile osteoporosis in a rat model and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Three-month-old rats were randomly selected as the youth group, and 24-month-old rats were randomly assigned to the elderly and EA groups. Rats in the EA group received 30 min of EA at bilateral SP10, ST36, K13 and GB34 daily, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD), microstructure of the bone tissue, bone turnover biomarkers and expression level of autophagy-related proteins were detected. Results: Compared with the elderly group, EA treatment significantly increased BMD of the femur and ameliorated the microstructure. EA treatment increased trabecular bone volume ratio (= bone volume / total volume [﻿BV/TV]) and trabecular number (Tb.N) and decreased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) in senile osteoporosis rats. Compared with the elderly group, the serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX1) level in the EA group was lower, and the serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) concentration was higher. In addition, the expression of Beclin 1, microtubule-associated protein I light chain 3 (LC3B) and P62 was inhibited in the senile osteoporosis rats after EA treatment. Conclusions: EA can effectively alleviate aging-related bone loss and improve the microstructure of bone tissue in senile osteoporosis rats, and the regulation of autophagy might be one of the important mechanisms.",

It has been suggested that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at GB30 and ST36 can improve nerve dysfunction post-PNI. Autophagy is an important factor in the regeneration of sciatic nerves and recovery of motor function. Therefore, we investigated the biological effects of EA and examined whether these were mediated by autophagy in sciatic nerve injury. Methods: Mechanical clamping of the sciatic nerve in Sprague-Dawley rats was performed to establish an experimental model of sciatic nerve injury. EA stimulation was administered once daily for 15 min for seven consecutive days beginning 1 week after successful modeling. The recovery of sciatic nerve function was examined via the sciatic functional index (SFI) test. Morphometric analysis was conducted by staining nerve samples with toluidine blue. Autophagy-associated protein levels were measured via Western blotting. Results: EA stimulation at GB30 and ST36 significantly increased the number of myelinated fibers, axonal and fiber diameters, and the thickness of the myelin sheath in our rat model of sciatic nerve injury. In addition, EA stimulation greatly facilitated nerve regeneration following sciatic nerve injury. Moreover, sciatic nerve injury–induced autophagy was inhibited by EA stimulation. Conclusion: EA facilitates recovery of injured sciatic nerves and inhibits autophagy in a rat model.",

The present meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of high-intensity and low-intensity EA in terms of pain relief and functional improvement in KOA. Methods: A thorough and comprehensive literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), all looking at the intensity of EA for KOA, was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science Journal Citation Report (VIP) and Wanfang database, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov. All databases were searched from their inception until April 2022. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB)2 tool. Finally, a meta-analysis of all eligible RCTs was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Three studies with 472 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. The pain intensity reductions were significantly different between the high-intensity EA group and low-intensity EA group (mean difference (MD) = −0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.26 to −0.18, p &lt; 0.00001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores (MD = −3.62, 95% CI = −12.22 to 4.98, p = 0.41). High-intensity EA significantly improved emotional scale (ES) scores compared to low-intensity EA (MD = −0.72, 95% CI = −0.76 to −0.67, p &lt; 0.00001). Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that high-intensity EA provides superior pain relief and has a bigger impact on emotional scale scores in patients with KOA.",

    "abstract": "Background Although an increase in the use of acupuncture in recent years has been identified, there are few studies that focus attention upon the characteristics of acupuncture users. This survey aimed at providing a first step towards addressing this significant research gap. Methods This study was conducted as part of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, and examined the characteristics of acupuncture users among middle aged Australian women between 50 and 55 years old. Data were collected on demographic measures, health status and health service use. Results The paper reports on 11 202 middle aged women, surveyed in 2001. We estimate that 4.5% of middle aged women consult an acupuncturist. Women who consult an acupuncturist are less likely to be married or living in a de facto relationship, are more likely to have had a major personal illness in the previous year, to have suffered from a variety of symptoms or have significantly lower scores (ie poorer health) on all eight dimensions of the SF-36 health-related quality of life scale. Women who use acupuncture are also higher users of ‘conventional’ health services. Conclusion While the development of a research base and clinical applications for acupuncture are ongoing, health professionals should be aware that acupuncture is currently being used by large numbers of middle aged women. In addition, given the relatively higher prevalence of acupuncture use reported in our study, it is important that further research explores acupuncture use in more detail and the relationship between women's health issues and their use and experience of acupuncture.",

It was a valuable opportunity to gain an insight into policy making processes and principles, and I specifically remember Sir Michael’s mantra: “Does it work? Is it safe? How much does it cost?” I realised that “Does it work?” referred to specific efficacy confirmed in systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), rather than pragmatic data on effectiveness in clinical practice. He indicated that there was a growing quantity of suitable evidence (systematic reviews) in the complementary medicine field, and when referring specifically to acupuncture I’m sure he said “We will probably buy acupuncture for back pain, but definitely not for migraine”. At this point I spluttered on my glass of water, and was subsequently invited to comment. I briefly described the issues surrounding sham acupuncture,1 “missing the point”2 and the extraordinary effectiveness of these procedures in the prophylaxis of migraine.3 Sir Michael’s response was simply to comment: “That is your ( viz the acupuncture profession’s) problem!”\n\nAround the same time I had a detailed discussion of the research issues of acupuncture for headaches with one of the leading academics in field of migraine.

The aim of this research was to study the mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of MS. Methods To observe the effects of acupuncture in the treatment of MS, 80 rats were randomised into five groups that were subjected to acceleration and either remained untreated (CTRL), or received restraint (REST), scopolamine (SCOP) or acupuncture at SP4 (sham) or PC6+ST36 (verum) acupuncture points. To study the mechanism underlying the effects of acupuncture in the treatment of MS, 48 rats were randomised into three groups: acupuncture+extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor (ERKinh), acupuncture+insulin receptor (IR) antagonist (IRant), and acupuncture+vehicle (VEH). After acceleration, the MS index (MSI) and spontaneous activity (SA) of the rats were recorded. Serum stress hormones, Fos-positive cells, c-fos mRNA in the vestibular nucleus, and IRβ-, p-IRβ-, ERK1/2- and p-ERK1/2-positive cells in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) were detected. Results After acceleration, MS symptoms in the PC6+ST36 and SCOP groups were reduced compared with the CTRL, REST, and SP4 groups. The number of p-IRβ- and p-ERK1/2-positive cells and insulin levels were higher in the PC6+ST36 group than in the CTRL, REST, and SP4 groups. After ERK1/2 inhibitor and IR antagonist treatment, MS symptoms in the VEH group were lower than in the ERKinh and IRant groups. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that acupuncture significantly alleviates MS through the IRβ-ERK1/2-dependent insulin receptor signalling pathway in the DMV",

Methods A subset of 30 patients with subacute ICH participating in a recently published randomised controlled trial who were able to walk independently were assessed by 3D-GA before and immediately after scalp acupuncture treatment (treatment group) or no intervention (control group) and the results presented here as a secondary analysis. The acupuncture manipulation was repeated three times with an interval of 5 min. Spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters during walking were collected and analysed using a 3D motion analysis system. Results After treatment, there were significant differences between the treatment and control groups in the spatiotemporal parameters of step length, velocity and cadence (p&lt;0.05) and double-limb support. No significant difference was found in step width. When kinematic parameters were evaluated, the treatment group showed a significantly decreased peak pelvic anterior tilt angle and an increased hip extension angle after scalp acupuncture treatment, whereas the control group demonstrated no temporal changes. There were no significant changes in any other kinematic parameters in either group. Conclusions As the first exploratory study to investigate the effect of the scalp acupuncture on gait performance in patients with subacute ICH, this secondary analysis of a recent randomised trial suggested an immediate effect of treatment on spatiotemporal parameters. Improvement in gait pattern may be associated with a decreased anterior tilt of the pelvis and augmented hip joint motion during walking.

Methods 24 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal, RWIS, and RWIS+EA (n=8 per group). Rats in the RWIS group and RWIS+EA group received RWIS for 3 hours. For rats in the RWIS+EA group, EA was applied at ST36 in the bilateral hind legs for 30 min before RWIS. Rats in the normal group did not receive stressors or EA treatment. The gastric mucosal lesions of each rat were evaluated by the erosion index (EI) according to the methods of Guth. The activity of CRH neurons in the PVN and CNA was measured by a dual immunohistochemical test for Fos and CRH in the brain sections. Results RWIS induced serious gastric mucosal lesions. The mean gastric EI was significantly decreased in the RWIS+EA group versus the RWIS group (P=0.005). Stress induced significant activation of CRH neurons in the PVN and CNA compared with the normal group (P&lt;0.001 for both). The mean number of Fos+CRH immunoreactive neurons in the PVN and CNA were both decreased inRWIS+EA versusRWIS groups (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.001). Conclusions EA at ST36 can ameliorate RWIS-induced gastric mucosal lesions and suppress the Fos expression of CRH neurons in the PVN and CNA, suggesting a potentially therapeutic role for EA in stress-related gastric disorders.",

Skin pigmentation or dark spots appeared in these four cases: after 12 treatments in Case 4, during the 14 treatments in Case 3, after one treatment course (16 treatments) in Case 1 and during the sixth month in a long-term treatment of duration 2 years (one or two treatments per week) in Case 2.

In late May 2009, athletic amenorrhoea was diagnosed and a norgestrel–ethinyl estradiol combination (norgestrel 0.5 mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.05 mg three times daily) was prescribed for 2 weeks. She experienced menstrual bleeding on one occasion for 4 days in mid-June before becoming amenorrhoeic again. The athlete visited our centre to try acupuncture treatment. Forty-six acupuncture sessions were given between 1 October 2009 and 2 November 2010. Acupuncture point selection was based on classical acupuncture medicine and included points long used for gynaecological disorders in Japan—namely, CV6, CV12, LR3, LR14, BL17, BL18, BL23, SP6 and SP10. On 7 May 2010, owing to lack of regular normal vaginal bleeding, she again consulted her gynaecologist and was prescribed the same hormone preparation as used previously. She took it for 2 weeks in conjunction with acupuncture treatment. From July, the amount and duration of menstrual flow increased at regular intervals. Throughout July, a biphasic pattern in basal body temperature (BBT) was gradually established. In conclusion, the single hormone replacement therapy in May 2009 without acupuncture treatment was not effective for the amenorrhoea, nor was the single acupuncture treatment between October 2009 and May 2010. However, after hormone replacement therapy was started in May 2010 in conjunction with regular acupuncture treatment, menstrual blood flow restarted and BBT moved close to the biphasic pattern.",

    "abstract": "Auricular acupuncture is an accessible, non-confrontational therapy that appears to be effective when used in drug and alcohol treatment facilities, hospitals and prisons in the UK, Europe and the USA. Despite being popular, research evidence on its effectiveness is lacking, and as a result services are underfunded and risk being withdrawn. There are methodological problems in researching auricular acupuncture. In these days of evidence-based medicine, most studies in this area are explanatory randomised controlled trials, which is limited in capturing the complete benefits of the intervention. Furthermore, there is lack of consensus over definitions of the concept of ‘addiction’ and whether or not this should be perceived as a ‘disease’ that can be ‘cured’ by an intervention such as auricular acupuncture. Basic concepts such as these need to inform development of outcome measures, which should include retention of clients in treatment as an indicator of success.It is argued here that the best approach will integrate research on physical effects with research on subjective experience of those with drug and alcohol problems. The challenge is to design large scale, high quality, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture over the longer term in settings that mimic the delivery of treatment in practice and are informed by acupuncture's own diagnostic traditions, using a combination of objective, quantitative methods and subjective, qualitative methods.",

Conclusions This study suggests that moxibustion can be helpful in managing symptoms related to knee OA. Patients’ attitudes towards moxibustion can affect the treatment result and those who prefer it want to continue the treatment for a long time because they understand that knee OA is a chronic condition which needs continuous care.

We hypothesised that improvements in pulmonary function with electroacupuncture (EA) may be related to orexins in a rat model of COPD. Methods The COPD model was established by cigarette smoke exposure and lipopolysaccharide injection. Modelled rats received EA at BL13 and ST36 for two weeks, after which lung function was tested. Orexin levels in the hypothalamus and medulla were detected by ELISA, while mRNA/protein expression and localisation of orexins and their receptors were investigated using real time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results The decrease in lung function observed in COPD rats was improved after EA treatment. Orexin levels in the hypothalamus and medulla were significantly higher in COPD rats than in normal rats, but were significantly reduced in the EA-treated group. There was a negative correlation between orexin content and lung function. In the hypothalamus, mRNA and protein expression and immunoreactivity of orexins were significantly higher in the COPD group than in the normal group, but a significant decrease was observed after EA. In the medulla, the expression and immunoreactivity of orexin receptors were significantly higher in the COPD group than in the normal group, but a significant decrease was observed after EA. Conclusions The positive effect of EA on pulmonary function in COPD rats may be related to downregulation of orexins and their receptors in the medulla.",

    "abstract": "Background Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are known to serve important functions in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Studies have shown that acupuncture has an anti-inflammatory effect in the airways. However, how acupuncture treatment affects innate immunity, especially with regard to the function of ILC2s in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation, is poorly understood. Methods BALB/c mice were injected and subsequently challenged with OVA ± treated with manual acupuncture. At the end of the experimental course, lung function was assessed by measurement of airway resistance (R L ) and lung dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Cytokine levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ILC2 proportions in the lung were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results The results showed that airway inflammation and mucus secretion were significantly suppressed by acupuncture treatment. R L decreased while Cdyn increased after acupuncture treatment. There was an apparent decrease in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concentrations of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-9, IL-25 and IL-33 and an increase in soluble IL-33 receptor (sST2) levels compared with untreated asthmatic mice. Acupuncture also reduced the lin – CD45 + KLRG1 + ST2 + cell proportion in the lung. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that acupuncture treatment alleviates allergic airway inflammation and inhibits pulmonary ILC2 influx and IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 production. The inhibition of ILC2s by acupuncture may be associated with the IL-33/ST2-signaling pathway and IL-25 levels, thereby offering protection from the respiratory inflammation associated with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background Increasingly, many patients believe that a combined approach of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including acupuncture, and conventional medicine is better than either on its own, and more patients now have the desire to discuss CAM with well-informed general practitioners (GPs). However, to our knowledge, the interaction and collaboration between GPs and acupuncturists specifically in relation to shared care have not been investigated. This research explored interprofessional communication between GPs and acupuncturists in New Zealand. This article specifically reports the GPs’ viewpoints. Methods This study was part of a larger mixed-methods research project. Semi-structured interviews of 14 purposively sampled GP participants were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. Results The data analysis identified both facilitators of and barriers to integrative health care . Facilitators included the willingness of GPs to engage in communication and a recognition of the importance of patient choice. Barriers included the limited opportunities for sharing information and the lack of current established pathways for communication or direct referrals. GPs also highlighted the confusion around scopes of practice in terms of the different styles of and approaches to acupuncture. Conclusion This research contributes to the body of knowledge concerning interprofessional communication and collaboration between GPs and acupuncturists and suggests that while there are significant barriers to collaboration, there is also the potential to impact provider satisfaction and patient well-being. It provides context within a New Zealand health care setting and also provides additional insights regarding acupuncture, specifically through the disaggregation of specific CAM modalities.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) could inhibit pain development through the peripheral dorsal root ganglia; however, it is unclear whether it can mitigate the transition from acute to chronic pain by attenuating protein expression in the p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) pathway in the spinal dorsal horn.We aimed to determine whether EA could prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain by affecting the p38 MAPK/TNF-α pathway in the spinal dorsal horn in a rat model established using HP.We first randomly subdivided 30 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats into 5 groups (n = 6 per group): control (N), sham HP (Sham-HP), HP, HP + SB203580p38 MAPK (HP+SB203580), and HP + Lenalidomide (CC-5013) (HP+Lenalidomide). We then randomly subdivided a further 30 male SD rats into 5 groups (n = 6 per group): Sham-HP, HP, sham EA (Sham EA), EA (EA), and EA + U-46619 p38 MAPK agonist (EA+U-46619). We assessed the effects of EA on the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and p38 MAPK/TNF-α expression in the spinal dorsal horn of rats subjected to chronic inflammatory pain.Rats in the EA group had reduced p38 MAPK and TNF-α expression and had significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia compared with rats in the other groups.Our findings indicate that EA could increase the mechanical pain threshold in rats and inhibit the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. This mechanism could involve reduced p38 MAPK/TNF-α expression in the spinal dorsal horn.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Stable angina is ischemic chest pain on exertion or with emotional stress. Despite guideline-directed therapy, up to 30% of patients have suboptimal pain relief. The aims of this study were to: (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture; and (2) evaluate preliminary efficacy of acupuncture with respect to reduction of pain and increased functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: Participants with stable angina for ⩾1 month received either a standardized acupuncture protocol, twice per week for 5 weeks, or an attention control protocol. Measures included the McGill Pain Questionnaire (average pain intensity (API), pain now) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire–7 (functional status, symptoms, and HRQoL). Feasibility was defined as ⩾80% recruitment, ⩾75% retention following enrollment, and ⩾80% completion. Descriptive statistics and mixed-effects linear regression were used for analysis. Results: The sample (n = 24) had a mean age of 59 ± 12 years, was predominantly female (63%), and represented minority groups (8% White, 52% Black, 33% Hispanic, and 8% Other). Feasibility was supported by 79% retention and 89% completion rates. The recruitment rate (68%) was slightly lower than expected. Acceptability scores were 87.9% for the acupuncture group and 51.7% for the control group. Outcomes were significantly better for the acupuncture versus control groups (API, b = −2.1 (1.1), p = 0.047; functional status, b = 27.6 (7.2), p &lt; 0.001; and HRQoL, b = 38.8 (11.9), p = 0.001). Conclusions and implications: Acupuncture was feasible and acceptable in our diverse sample. We were slightly under the recruitment target of 80%, but participants who started the study had a high likelihood of completing it. Acupuncture shows promise for stable angina, but its effectiveness needs to be confirmed by a larger, adequately powered RCT. Trial registration number: NCT02914834 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Tendon samples were collected at 7, 14 and 21 days after injury (n=8 per group). NCP concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (n=4 each) and birefringence was examined using polarisation microscopy and image analysis (n=4 each). Comparison was also made with healthy (non-tenotomised) tendons in a subgroup of rats (n=4 each).Manual acupuncture at ST36 and BL57 increased molecular organisation of collagen fibres on day 14 and 21 after injury. Isolated use of BL57 and ST36 also increased collagen fibre organisation when examined on day 14 and 21, respectively. No significant increase in NCP concentration was observed in any of the treated tenotomised groups.Acupuncture, through putative anti-inflammatory and mechanotransductor effects, may have a role in strengthening tendons and increasing resistance to re-rupture.",

Dispelling the myths of physiotherapy (physical therapy) led acupuncture is a task that is long overdue. Perhaps the argument “why physiotherapists should not deliver acupuncture” should be reframed “why not physiotherapists (or other healthcare professionals who are not physicians)?”. Chartered physiotherapists are placed at the forefront of modern healthcare, with >55 000 currently practising in the UK.2 As professionally regulated and autonomous healthcare professionals, there is huge opportunity for physiotherapists to deliver acupuncture as part of mainstream healthcare for patient benefit.\n\nWestern medical acupuncture (WMA) practice by physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals in the UK and internationally has substantially increased in the last decade. The Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (AACP) was established in 1984 and membership is currently >6500,3 double that of any other UK acupuncture organisation. Physiotherapists also contribute to the membership of the British Medical Acupuncture Society. Collectively, physiotherapists are the largest professional group of acupuncture providers in the UK and are arguably leading the way in bringing acupuncture into mainstream healthcare.\n\nPhysiotherapists have typically completed 3–4-year professional degrees, including extensive training in anatomy, physiology, pathology, and diagnostics. This provides an excellent foundation for learning acupuncture at an advanced level. Physiotherapy uses a holistic approach to patient care, which complements theories underpinning acupuncture. Most UK physiotherapists choose to study/practise WMA.

    "abstract": "Background Despite many research publications, it is unclear how widely electroacupuncture (EA) and related modalities are used in everyday practice. It is also uncertain who uses them, for what conditions, and with what results. We aimed to survey practitioners about their use of and training in EA. We also sought to determine how much the open-access English-language database at http://www.electroacupunctureknowledge.com (EAK) is used, or might be used in the future, if updated. Methods A survey was developed using several rounds of consultation with a focus group and others. Professional acupuncture membership organisations were contacted to assess their willingness to notify their members. The survey was tested before its launch. Results Thirty-four professional organisations agreed to participate, together with two research bodies and six UK training institutes. Potentially, around 50 000 professionals practising acupuncture knew about the survey, to which there were 768 responses. Data were analysed for respondent demographics. Around 70% used EA, but &lt;25% used related electrotherapy modalities. Men were more likely than women to use more than one modality. Only around 7% of respondents used non-traditional acupuncture modalities without prior training. However, awareness and usage of the EAK database was low, although around 80% of respondents stated they might use the database in the future, primarily to improve clinical practice. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest survey on EA and related modalities ever conducted. As such, its results are likely to be of interest to acupuncture and other practitioners (whether or not they use EA), patients, policymakers, and funding agencies.",

Some of these treatment effects have been hypothesised to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. It was recently discovered that the posterior ramus of the spinal nerve (PRSN) at L2 forms not two but three branches.To examine the relationship between the acupuncture point BL23 and the L2 PRSN in order to consider the pathways possibly affected by BL23 acupuncture.Acupuncture needles were inserted through the skin at BL23 to a depth of 3 cm a total of 13 times in eight donor cadavers (seven right-sided, six left-sided). Leaving the needle in place, ventral dissection was performed to determine the PRSN anatomy between the L1 and L3 spinal segments. In four cadavers, the relationship between the L2 spinal nerve and sympathetic branches was additionally evaluated. Following dissection, three-dimensional (3D) data were acquired using a photo scanner and 3D structural images were created using 3D computer graphics software. One additional (female) cadaver was studied without insertion of an acupuncture needle (due to significant scoliosis).The L2 PRSN was divided into medial, intermediate and lateral branches. The needle inserted at BL23 came to lie in the region of the intermediate or lateral branches in all cases. Rami communicantes were found between the L2 spinal nerve and sympathetic trunk with fibres going on to supply the superior hypogastric plexus.Our findings suggest that acupuncture needles inserted at BL23 come into close proximity with the intermediate or lateral branch of the L2 PRSN, which could result in stimulation of both the somatic and sympathetic nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fatigue is experienced by more than 65% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Some studies have supported the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving the symptoms of MS. Objective: The present research was intended to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture plus amantadine compared with amantadine alone on fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in the remission stage of the disease. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 60 participants with RRMS suffering from fatigue were recruited and randomized equally to acupuncture (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups. The acupuncture group received treatment 2 to 3 times per week for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. Both the acupuncture and control groups received amantadine 100 mg daily and routine treatment with immuno-modulators. The primary outcome was the fatigue severity scale (FSS) score, which was evaluated at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks. The secondary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire score, measured at baseline and the end of the 4-week treatment period. Results: The severity of fatigue was reduced in both groups. However, after 4 weeks of treatment, the reduction of fatigue in the acupuncture group was more significant than in the control group ( P &lt; 0.01, mean difference (MD) = −1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): −1.83 to −0.45). Quality of life, including mental and physical status, was significantly improved in the acupuncture group compared with the control group ( P &lt; 0.05, MD = 9.09, 95% CI: 0.46 to 17.73). No adverse events occurred in any of the participants. Conclusions: Acupuncture combined with amantadine and routine care compared with amantadine and routine care alone appears to be an effective short-term treatment for reducing fatigue and enhancing quality of life, including physical function and mental status, in patients with RRMS.",

Evidence for the efficacy of most TrP acupuncture modalities is weak or lacking. Objective: To assess the effect of TrP acupuncture on pain, disability, gait and muscle activation in patients with CNLBP. Methods: From May 2019 to February 2020, a randomised, single-blind clinical trial was carried out involving 33 participants with CNLBP, divided into one of two intervention groups or a control group ( n = 11 per group). The intervention groups received TrP acupuncture or traditional acupuncture treatment three times a week for 4 weeks, and the control group remained on a waiting list and received no treatment. Pain, disability, gait and muscle activation were assessed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks of follow-up. Results: At baseline, the three groups showed no significant differences in age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI) or disease course ( p ⩾ 0.05). At 4 weeks, pain was relieved (measured by visual analogue scores, p = 0.036) and disability was improved (reflected by lower Oswestry disability index scores, p = 0.029) in TrP acupuncture versus waiting list groups. Moreover, lumbar extension range of motion was increased in TrP acupuncture versus both traditional acupuncture and waiting list groups ( p = 0.029 and p = 0.027, respectively). At 8 weeks, there were no significant differences in any parameter between the three groups ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: TrP acupuncture had a significant short-term effect on pain relief and disability in patients with CNLBP, but there was no evidence of a long-term influence (at 8 weeks following the intervention). Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed for verification in the future. Trial registration number: ChiCTR1900022838 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry)",

    "abstract": "Background: Prior research has shown that acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical therapy, may have a certain therapeutic effect in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, some studies have explored the effects of acupuncture on the brain functional networks of MCI patients to investigate the mechanism of action. Different studies have analysed the brain regions involved in acupuncture-induced changes, but (to our knowledge) these have not been summarized by a systematic review. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SinoMed, CNKI and other databases in Chinese and English to identify neuroimaging studies of acupuncture interventions in MCI patients. After two stages of literature screening, bias risk assessment and data extraction, brain regions with significant differences were input into GingerALE software. Based on the activation likelihood estimation algorithm, coordinate-based meta-analyses were conducted. Results: The changes in functional activation of 95 different areas in 8 trials, including 212 MCI patients, were analysed. The three most commonly used traditional acupuncture point locations in acupuncture interventions for MCI were KI3 ( Taixi), LR3 ( Taichong) and LI4 ( Hegu). The results of the ALE data analysis showed that, after acupuncture intervention, the degree of activation in the anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and cerebellar tonsil of MCI patients increased significantly. Conclusions: Acupuncture intervention for MCI appears to change the plasticity of brain function and improve the cognitive function of patients. Due to the small number and low quality of the included studies, the conclusion of this meta-analysis should be treated with caution.

    "abstract": "Background: Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (PGD) is one of the most common complications among patients who have undergone thoracic surgery. Acupuncture has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases and has shown benefit as an alternative therapy for the management of digestive ailments. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of acupuncture as a means to aid postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. Methods: In total, 112 patients aged 18–70 years undergoing thoracoscopic surgery between 15 June 2022 and 30 August 2022 were randomized into two groups. Patients in the acupuncture group (AG) first received acupuncture treatment 4 h after surgery, and treatment was repeated at 24 and 48 h. Patients in the control group (CG) did not receive any acupuncture treatment. Both groups received the same anesthetic protocol. Ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) was performed in the paravertebral spaces between T4 and T5 with administration of 20 mL of 0.33% ropivacaine. All patients received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after surgery. Results: Median time to first flatus [interquartile range] in the AG was significantly less than in the CG (23.25 [18.13, 29.75] vs 30.75 [24.13, 45.38] h, p &lt; 0.001). Time to first fluid intake after surgery was significantly less in the AG, as compared with the CG (4 [3, 7] vs 6.5 [4.13, 10.75] h, p = 0.003). Static pain, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) score, was significantly different on the third day after surgery (p = 0.018). Dynamic pain VAS scores were lower in the AG versus CG on the first three postoperative days (p = 0.014, 0.003 and 0.041, respectively). Conclusion: Addition of acupuncture appeared to improve recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function and alleviate posteoperative pain in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. Acupuncture may represent a feasible strategy for the prevention of PGD occurrence. Trial registration number: ChiCTR2200060888 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry)",

Thirty two patients awaiting hip arthroplasty with chronic pain of more than twelve months duration were included. Group A received acupuncture using a standardised technique of periosteal needling to the greater trochanter of the femur with three acupuncture needles. The treatment was repeated on three occasions at weekly intervals. Group B received an intra-articular/peri-articular hip injection of 20ml of 1% lignocaine + 80mg Depo-Medrone. Patients were assessed for pain intensity, mobility and pattern of analgesia usage pre-treatment and at one, two and four week intervals thereafter. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain intensity and analgesic usage following treatment. This decrease was greater in the acupuncture group. However, mobility remained unchanged in both groups. From the results of this study, periosteal acupuncture appears to be as effective as an intra-articular injection in relieving the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. However, due to the small numbers involved, statistical significance was not achieved.",

Forty-four patients were treated with electrical stimulation of the skin; 34 in group (1) and 10 in group (2). Following electrostimulation in all patients in both groups healing proceeded in a thoroughly organized manner, almost regardless of the severity of the type of wound or burn treated.

    "abstract": "Although it would be quite unacceptable to attempt most forms of treatment without defining the dose, acupuncture has so far remained without any means of quantification. Electrical and deep manual needling probably rely for their main effect on direct nerve and muscle stimulation. It is suggested that superficial needling acts by producing a cone of tissue damage, with release of inflammatory mediators which increase the sensitivity of local nerve endings so that trivial, incidental stimulation continues to induce CNS inhibitory effects for a prolonged period. The degree of local inflammatory effect can easily be recorded by measuring the area of skin flare. A simple formula is offered to determine the dose of acupuncture, based on skin flare recordings after experimental needling and theoretical considerations of tissue damage. Needles of varying shaft radius were inserted to a number of depths in the abdominal dermis and subjected to specific degrees of stimulation. The experimental data correlate well with the theoretical model. Needle response increases with depth of insertion, and with needle thickness although this is outweighed by the effects of manipulation if carried out. The formula derived for determining the dose of acupuncture which correlates with inflammatory response, as measured by skin flare, is (r + 0.1 l)K, where r is the radius of the needle shaft, l is the depth of insertion and K is 10 for unmanipulated insertions or 12.4 if the needle is manipulated.",

If the subject involves acupuncture, the problems can seem surprisingly great even for an established university research department. Most acupuncture reports from China are anecdotal in nature and reviewing the Western literature shows that difficulty in definition of techniques has allowed invasive and non-invasive acupuncture to be used interchangeably, with consequent inaccuracy in the reported results. Because of the physical nature of the treatment, not all accepted criteria for clinical trials are achievable and ethical committees may therefore be reluctant to grant approval. Even publication has been made difficult by scepticism from peer reviewers, although a more enlightened attitude is now gaining ground. If acupuncture is to become an accepted treatment, scientific evaluation by experienced research teams and perseverance in gaining publication for the results is vital.",

She had undergone trans-axillary resection of the first left rib following a left axillary vein thrombosis 18 months previously. Her symptoms had been principally attributed to nerve traction at surgery or nerve root entrapment from scar tissue. However, the drain passed through the free border of pectoralis major, and the myofascial trigger point that appeared to develop as a result of the muscle trauma, or the pain at that site, presented as a chronic and complex post-surgical pain problem. The pain and tingling resolved completely after two sessions of dry needling at a single myofascial trigger point in the free border of the left pectoralis major muscle.",

The faults noted were: scratch marks along or across the needle, metallic scuff, lumps and irregularities in the needle surface, needle-tip stubbed or malformed, and needle point off-centre. An additional test made was to wipe a number of needles firmly on white paper tissue. Some left grey lines, and these were regarded as evidence of metallic or oily residue from the needle surface which could have been deposited in the patient.

Information obtained included age, sex, diagnosis, duration of the problem, length of treatment (weeks), number of treatments, duration of each treatment (minutes), number of needles used, level of benefit obtained from the treatment, and recurrence of pain. There were many different conditions encountered. We found an association between the general practitioner using fewer needles and patients experiencing greater pain relief. This could be a reflection of treating myofascial pain syndromes, which often appear to respond well to a single needle in the key trigger point. Overall, we found that sixty-nine percent of patients had a good or excellent response to acupuncture treatment. We recommend acupuncture as a treatment option for patients who do not respond to the usual therapies (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for musculoskeletal conditions.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese Acupuncture in patients with mild asthma. The method used for evaluation of efficacy was total airway resistance at 5Hz (R 5 ) as measured by impulse oscillometry (IOS) – a forced oscillation technique, at baseline and after a bronchial challenge with voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation of cold air (IHCA). The study was a parallel group randomised placebo controlled trial with evaluator blinding. Twenty-seven asthmatics were recruited and 24 completed the study, 10 of them received acupuncture and 14 received a placebo treatment (mock-TENS). Treatment continued for 15 weeks, and efficacy was tested two weeks following the last treatment. Randomisation resulted in female over representation in the acupuncture group, but lung-function and bronchial responsiveness to IHCA were comparable in the two populations before the start of treatment (p&gt;0.05 vs. p&gt;0.05). There were no statistically significant effects of the treatment before (p&gt;0.05) or after IHCA (p&gt;0.05) in either of the groups. The statistical power of the study to show a clinically relevant difference in bronchial responsiveness to IHCA after treatment was near 80%. We conclude that there were no significant effects of traditional Chinese Acupuncture on airway status in our patients with asthma.",

It aimed to assess the type of patients referred to an acupuncturist, subsequent changes in health status, whether the effectiveness of acupuncture was related to the type of presenting problem and to examine which factors were predictive of the success of acupuncture. The referred patients had a wide variety of conditions which were categorised as to whether or not there was empirical evidence from trials of responsiveness to acupuncture (evidence based vs non evidence based). Patients completed measures of their health status prior to treatment and at two and six month follow ups. In addition, the referring GP's beliefs about the prognosis of the problem and the therapist's and patient's expectations of success were measured at baseline. The results showed that referred patients reported poorer health status than a historical sample of general practice patients and that they showed significant improvements in all aspects of health status following acupuncture. In particular, patients showed improved energy, pain, emotional reactions, sleep and reduced social isolation at two months which were maintained at six months. Physical mobility was improved at six months. In addition, the results indicated that the best predictors of effectiveness were the therapist's and patient's expectations of success at baseline. Effectiveness was not related to the category of condition (evidence based or not) nor to the GP's expectations about the prognosis of the condition. The results are discussed in terms of implications for the role of acupuncture in General Practice and selectively targeting patients who would be responsive to such an approach.",

Ten of the trials included about 100 patients or more. Five showed acupuncture to be superior to usual care in back pain, knee pain and headache. Acupuncture was superior to placebo for chronic knee pain, but not for fibromyalgia, or post-stroke rehabilitation. Acupuncture was not as good as conventional analgesia for oocyte collection. Conclusion The role of acupuncture is becoming more precisely established in treatment of chronic knee pain, back pain and headache. Acupuncture for chronic back pain is more cost-effective than many other medical interventions.",

Methods Randomised, single blind, placebo controlled trial. Patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to either 12 sessions of true acupuncture or 12 sessions of placebo acupuncture (Streitberger needle), these sessions taking place once a week. A baseline measurement was carried out, followed by further observations at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The clinical variables were the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis) index, knee pain measured by a visual analogue scale (pain VAS), the weekly consumption of diclofenac and the Profile of the Quality of Life of the Chronically Ill (PQLC). The two groups were compared for each of the clinical variables per protocol and by intention to treat. A multiple linear regression model for the dependent variables was constructed. Results Ninety seven outpatients were selected, with 88 remaining for the per protocol analysis; the analysis of homogeneity concluded that the lost subjects were not significantly different from those that completed the study. The multivariate per protocol model for the relative pain VAS variable showed a difference in improvement of 43.7% (95% CI 29.4% to 58.0%) for acupuncture, compared with the control group. In an intention to treat analysis, the relative improvement was 32.4% (20.3% to 44.4%). In a per protocol analysis, the total WOMAC showed a relative decrease of 52.0% (34.3% to 69.6%) in favour of the acupuncture group, or 37.6% (22.4% to 52.8%) in an intention to treat analysis. Conclusions The group treated with acupuncture showed significantly better effects, both clinically and statistically, in the reduction of pain intensity as measured by pain VAS, on the WOMAC index and in decreased consumption of diclofenac.",

Methods The programme included five randomised trials, a large observational study, a survey of physicians providing acupuncture, and three systematic reviews. Results The results show that, for all three indications, acupuncture, when compared to no treatment, produces a clear benefit that lasts for at least several months. However the effects of point-specific acupuncture only offered a significant advantage over minimal acupuncture in the treatment of OA knee. Conclusions The evidence from these trials – on the one hand, a clear overall effect of acupuncture and on the other hand, the lack of evidence supporting its superiority over sham acupuncture for all indications except osteoarthritis of the knee – leaves a considerable amount of room for interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Pain is one of the principal symptoms for which the general public seeks medical attention, and it is frequently treated by GPs. Although acupuncture is mainly practised in the private field, it enjoys growing acceptance in the public system too, which helps bring down the high cost of its use. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture and related techniques in treating non-oncological pain during nine years of activity at the Pain Treatment Unit (PTU) within the Andalusian Public Health System (Spain) in the field of primary healthcare.Retrospective review of 5981 electronically stored case histories of patients who sought treatment for non-oncological pain and were seen at the PTU between June 1997 and July 2006. We excluded from this review those patients who had on any occasion been recruited for clinical trials at the PTU. The primary result measure applied was the success rate, defined as an improvement of least 50% on the Global Assessment Index, which is made up of five variables: pain intensity, as measured on a numerical scale of 0-10, pain frequency, consumption of analgesics, level of incapacity and sleep disorders caused by pain (the latter four variables were measured on a 5-point Likert scale of 0-4).The majority (84.5%) of the patients treated were women, with a mean age of 58.8 years (range 8-93), and they attended the healthcare clinic because of pain present for over three months (88.8%) and mainly affecting the lower back (58.8%). In the 5690 patients who completed treatment, the mean success rate was 79.7%, with highest rates (93%) being achieved in patients with cephalalgia. The mean reduction in pain intensity was 5.5 (SD 2.5) points amounting to 67% fall from the baseline. There was a reduction of euro7.1 in the mean weekly expenditure on analgesics per patient. From the regression model, we conclude that the patients who suffered acute or sub-acute pain presented higher success rates than did those with chronic pain (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.53-2.48).Acupuncture seems to be effective in treating musculoskeletal pain, and presents no severe adverse events. With acupuncture treatment, the consumption of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs is considerably reduced.",

Background Non-cardiac chest pain is known to be a prevalent condition in the general population. Treatment options are limited. Given that acupuncture has a potential role in the treatment of chronic pain, this study was designed to establish the levels of interest in acupuncture among people with continuing non-cardiac chest pain. Methods This small study formed part of a larger retrospective cohort study, and was conducted with all 235 people who were given a diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain at the Rapid Access Chest Pain Unit in York within a 14 month period. We collected data on whether people continued to experience chest pain, and if so, whether they had considered, or would consider, acupuncture as a treatment. We used ordinal logistic regression to investigate potential covariates, including sex and age, that might be associated with this interest. Results In total, 161 (69%) participants returned questionnaires, 75 (47%) of whom were experiencing continued chest pain with a median duration of 5.4 months. Of these participants, 42% reported that they would consider acupuncture, 36% reported that they would not, and 22% did not know. In the ordinal regression model, we found no covariates significantly associated with the strength of participants’ interest in acupuncture. Conclusion People with continuing non-cardiac chest pain after attending a Rapid Access Chest Pain Unit have shown considerable interest in acupuncture as a primary care treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Both specific and non-specific factors, as well as the therapist, may play a role in acupuncture therapy. Recent results suggest that verum acupuncture has specific physiological effects and that patients expectations and belief regarding a potentially beneficial treatment modulate activity in the reward and self-appraisal systems in the brain. We suggest that acupuncture treatment may partly be regarded and used as an intervention that preconditions expectancy, which results in both conditional reflexes and conditioning of expected reward and self-appraisal. If so, acupuncture should preferably be applied before the start of the specific treatment (drug or behavioural intervention which is given with the intention of achieving a specific outcome) to enhance the specific and non-specific effects. This hypothesis is further supported by the suggestions that acupuncture may be viewed as a neural stimulus that triggers Pavlovian extinction. If this is the case, acupuncture should preferably be applied repeatedly (ie in a learning process) before the start of the specific treatment to initiate the extinction of previous unpleasant associations like pain or anxiety. Our clinical data suggest that acupuncture may precondition expectancy and conditional reflexes as well as induce Pavlovian extinction. Based on the above we suggest that acupuncture should be tried (as an adjunct) before any specific therapy.",

    "abstract": "Background Studies by individual acupuncture practitioners have given an indication that offering acupuncture in primary care may reduce the need for referral to secondary care and reduce the costs of prescriptions. It would be informative to find out whether these findings can be supported by data from other practices. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of surveying national data on referrals and prescribing. Methods Three primary care trusts (PCTs) were selected, and all practices within each trust were sent an email asking whether any member of the primary care team offered acupuncture, and if so how many appointments per week. Data on rates of referral to orthopaedic, physiotherapy, pain and rheumatology clinics were then sought from the PCT, both for the practices offering acupuncture and for the PCT as a whole. Similarly, data on costs of prescriptions for non-steroidal (NSAID) and non-opioid analgesic drugs were obtained from the Prescription Pricing Authority. Results Out of the 109 practices surveyed, a total of 14 (13%) offered acupuncture services to some extent. There was wide variation in provision between the different PCTs. The eight practices which offered at least one appointment per week for every 2000 registered patients were included in the analysis. The mean values (and SDs) for the three PCTs and for the eight acupuncture practices, respectively, were as follows: for referral to various clinics: orthopaedic 32.3 (16.2) and 27.4 (10.87); pain clinic 1.6 (1.3) and 2.8 (1.6); physiotherapy 13.4 (14.5) and 29.5 (10.0); and rheumatology 4.7 (2.3) and 6.4 (3.0). The mean values for costs of non-opioid analgesics were £1820 (£442) and £2008 (£762); and for NSAIDs were £4148 (£269) and £4476 (£1366), respectively. There were no trends towards a reduction of clinic referral or prescription costs. Conclusions We have conducted the first survey of the effects of provision of acupuncture in UK general practice, using data provided by the NHS, and uncovered a wide variation in the availability of the service in different areas. We have been unable to demonstrate any consistent differences in the prescribing or referral rates that could be due to the use of acupuncture in these practices. The wide variation in the data means that if such a trend exists, a very large survey would be needed to identify it. However, we discovered inaccuracies and variations in presentation of data by the PCTs which have made the numerical input, and hence our results, unreliable. Thus the practicalities of access to data and the problems with data accuracy would preclude a nationwide survey.",

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain syndrome characterised by central sensitisation resulting in hypersentivity of the skin and deeper tissues as well as fatigue. Possibly the princess in Hans Christian Andersen's ‘The Princess and the Pea’ suffered from FMS since chronic sleep disturbances are typical in FMS. These sleep disturbances have been attributed to a dysfunction in the systems regulating sleep and wakefulness resulting in loss of deep sleep. In addition, many patients with FMS experience cognitive dysfunction, characterised by impaired concentration and short term memory consolidation, a complaint also commonly reported in other sleep disorders. In recent reviews evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in FMS it has been concluded that acupuncture has no specific effect. A prerequisite for this conclusion is that all the major symptoms in the syndrome have been assessed. However, previous studies have generally focused on the pain alleviating effect of acupuncture in FMS. We have observed that not only pain but also sleep and cognitive dysfunction may be ameliorated in response to acupuncture, suggesting that these variables should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of acupuncture in FMS. Furthermore, the results demonstrated great individual variability apart from the systematic effects related to the group, indicating that individually performed treatment strategies are required. Our suggestion is supported by experimental and clinical studies showing that acupuncture may affect in somnia and alertness, and that there may be neurophysiologic bases for these specific effects.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) therapy was performed in two courses (14 treatment sessions) 1 month apart. A needle was inserted in the proximal (or medial) side of the painful joint and another needle was inserted in the distal (or lateral) side of the same joint and a 50 Hz stimulus was applied (3 s bursts with 1 s gaps) for 15 min. A visual analogue scale was used to evaluate pain intensity. Cold provocation testing was conducted before and after EA sessions to determine the vasomotor response. Visual analogue scale scores were lower after EA sessions than before. Before starting EA, the skin temperature of the right mid fingertip was 27.9°C and that of the left mid fingertip was 28.3°C. In contrast, after the EA sessions, the skin temperature of the right mid fingertip was 34.8°C and that of the left mid fingertip was 34.7°C. In the last EA session, the patient reported that the cold in her fingers and toes had eased and Raynaud's phenomenon, in which nail colour tone changed from white to red, had disappeared. In the cold-provocation test, before EA, the temperature recovery rates of mid fingertips after cold exposure reached over 80% in 20 min. In contrast, after EA had been completed, the temperature recovery rate exceeded 80% in 10 min, thus the delay of temperature recovery was alleviated.",

The expression of SDF-1 and MCP-3 was significantly increased by combined EA and BMSC treatment when compared with the other groups (P=0.01 to P<0.05), suggesting promotive effects of EA on the homing of BMSCs.The combination of EA and BMSC transplantation effectively repaired the impaired anal sphincters. The underlying mechanism might be associated with apparent promotive effects of EA on the homing of BMSCs. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the development of a non-surgical treatment method for FI secondary to muscle impairment.",

Objective To assess the effects and safety of acupuncture for AWS. Data sources Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Chinese Biomedicine Literature (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan-Fang Database were searched from their inception to August 2016. Study eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drug plus acupuncture or acupuncture alone for the treatment of AWS were included. Data collection and analysis Continuous data were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Results Eleven RCTs with 875 participants were included. In the acute phase, two trials reported no difference between drug plus acupuncture and drug plus sham acupuncture in the reduction of craving for alcohol; however, two positive trials reported that drug plus acupuncture was superior to drug alone in the alleviation of psychological symptoms. In the protracted phase, one trial reported acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture in reducing the craving for alcohol, one trial reported no difference between acupuncture and drug (disulfiram), and one trial reported acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture for the alleviation of psychological symptoms. Adverse effects were tolerable and not severe. Conclusion There was nosignificant difference between acupuncture (plus drug) and sham acupuncture (plus drug) with respect to the primary outcome measure of craving for alcohol among participants with AWS, and no difference in completion rates (pooled results). There was limited evidence from individual trials that acupuncture may reduce alcohol craving in the protracted phase and help alleviate psychological symptoms; however, given concerns about the quantity and quality of included studies, further large-scale and well-conducted RCTs are needed.

    "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on trigeminal neuropathic pain in rats and explore the potential mechanism underlying the putative therapeutic effect of EA. Methods: Trigeminal neuropathic pain behavior was induced in rats by unilateral chronic constriction injury of the distal infraorbital nerve (dIoN-CCI). EA was administered at ST2 ( Sibai) and Jiachengjiang. A total of 60 Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following four groups ( n = 15 per group) to examine the behavioral outcomes after surgery and/or EA treatment: sham (no ligation); dIoN-CCI (received isoflurane only, without EA treatment); dIoN-CCI+EA-7d (received EA treatment for 7 days); and dIoN-CCI+EA-14d (received EA treatment for 14 days). Both evoked and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors were measured. Of these, 12 rats ( n = 4 from sham, dIoN-CCI, and dIoN-CCI+EA-14d groups, respectively) were used to analyze protein expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel in the Gasserian ganglion (GG) by immunohistochemistry. Results: dIoN-CCI rats exhibited mechanical allodynia and increased face-grooming activity that lasted at least 35 days. EA treatment reduced mechanical allodynia and face-grooming in dIoN-CCI rats. Overall, 14 days of EA treatment produced a prolonged anti-nociceptive effect as compared to 7-day EA treatment. The counts of HCN1 and HCN2 immunopositive puncta were increased in the ipsilateral GG in dIoN-CCI rats and were reduced by 14 days of EA treatment. Discussion: EA treatment relieved trigeminal neuropathic pain in dIoN-CCI rats, and this effect was dependent on the duration of EA treatment. The downregulation of HCN expression may contribute to the anti-nociceptive effect of EA in this rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain.",

Acupuncture is one new and non-pharmacological option and a promising tool to reduce pain in neonates undergoing minor painful interventions during routine medical care. Objectives: This review summarises trials of acupuncture for pain reduction in neonates undergoing painful interventions during routine medical care. Data source: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, electronic clinical trials registry platforms and reference lists were systematically screened for trials from their dates of inception to February 2017 (English language database search). Study selection: Inclusion criteria were (1) preterm or term neonates, (2) acupuncture for painful medical interventions and (3) formal pain assessment as a primary or secondary study outcome. We included only randomised controlled trials. Data extraction: Data were extracted using a standardised protocol and individual risk of bias was assessed. Results: The literature search revealed a total of 12 196 records. After application of inclusion criteria, five studies were included in this review. Two studies demonstrated significant pain reduction, one found equal outcomes in comparison to standard care, and two showed significantly higher pain scores with acupuncture alone. Limitations: The main limitation of the results is the heterogeneity across trials in acupuncture modality, acupuncture point selection, control groups and pain assessment (heterogeneity: I 2 =87%). Conclusion: The results of this review suggest that acupuncture may have a positive pain-relieving effect in neonates. However, due to the low number of available high-quality trials and heterogeneity across the studies it is not possible to state clear recommendations.",

We aimed to assess the associations of acupuncture use with mortality, readmission and reoperation rates in hip fracture patients using a longitudinal population-based database. Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted using data for the years 1996–2012 from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Hip fracture patients were divided into an acupuncture group consisting of 292 subjects who received at least 6 acupuncture treatments within 183 days of hip fracture, and a propensity score matched “no acupuncture” group of 876 subjects who did not receive any acupuncture treatment and who functioned as controls. The two groups were compared using survival analysis and competing risk analysis. Results: Compared to non-treated subjects, subjects treated with acupuncture had a lower risk of overall death (hazard ratio (HR): 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24–0.73, p = 0.002), a lower risk of readmission due to medical complications (subdistribution HR (sHR): 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44–0.93, p = 0.019) and a lower risk of reoperation due to surgical complications (sHR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40–0.96, p = 0.034). Conclusion: This is the first study to suggest that postoperative acupuncture in hip fracture patients is associated with significantly lower mortality, readmission and reoperation rates compared with those of matched controls.",

This study was designed to explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on disordered jejunal motility in a rat model of stress induced by intracisternal (IC) injection of CRF. Methods A stress model was established by IC injection of CRF in Sprague–Dawley rats. GI motility was evaluated by assessing gastric emptying (GE), gastrointestinal transit (GIT) and jejunal motility in vivo. EA was performed at ST36. The functional roles of CRF receptor subtype 1 and subtype 2 (CRFr1 and CRFr2) were examined by IC administration of the corresponding selective CRF antagonists. Protein expression of CRFr1 and CRFr2 in the hypothalamus and jejunum was detected by Western blotting. Results IC injection of CRF significantly inhibited GE, GIT and jejunal motility. EA treatment remarkably improved the disturbed GI motility. Intriguingly, the disordered jejunal motility induced by central CRF was abolished by IC injection of a selective CRFr2 antagonist, indicating the essential role of central CRFr2 in mediating the stress-induced jejunal motor disorder. EA at ST36 decreased central and peripheral expression of CRFr2, which might be one of the potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of EA on jejunal dysmotility in this rat model of stress. Conclusion This study suggested that EA at ST36 could ameliorate disordered jejunal motility induced by stress, and that this might be associated with the down-regulation of CRFr2.",

Pharmacological treatment is limited in neonatal care and not recommended for minor painful interventions. Hence, non-pharmacological acute pain management is an important subject. Acupuncture could be a new strategy for neonatal pain prevention. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether laser acupuncture is non-inferior to oral sweet solutions in pain prevention.In total, 96 healthy term neonates were randomly assigned to receive either laser acupuncture with 10 mW at LI4 bilaterally (AG, acupuncture group) or 30% oral glucose solution (GG, glucose group) before heel lance for metabolic screening. The primary outcome was the difference in premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score between groups in a non-inferiority concept. Secondary outcomes were changes in heart rate and crying time.Median (interquartile range) PIPP scores were comparable in the AG and GG (12 (10-14) vs 12 (9-14), p = 0.981). Nevertheless, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of location shift exceeded the predefined margin for non-inferiority of 1 (95% CI: -1.000006 to 1.000059). Heart rate was found to be significantly lower after intervention (p = 0.048) and after heel lance (p = 0.015) in the AG versus GG. There was no difference in crying time between groups (p = 0.890).Laser acupuncture was not shown to be non-inferior to an oral glucose solution, possibly due to the higher than expected variability in PIPP scores within the studied groups. Future neonatal laser acupuncture studies for pain prevention with higher sample sizes are therefore warranted.",

Primary outcome measures for this cost-effectiveness analysis were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs and societal costs at days 28 and 365, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB). The NMB was calculated on the basis of the Norwegian cost-effectiveness threshold of NOK 275,000 (USD 35,628) per QALY gained. Missing data were replaced by multiple chained imputation.Eighty-six participants in the CG and 81 in the AG were included in the analysis. We found no QALY gain at day 28. At day 365, the incremental QALY of 0.035 was statistically significant. The differences in health care costs and societal costs were not statistically significant. Three out of four calculations led to negative ICERs (cost saving) and positive NMBs. For the health care perspective at day 365, the ICER was USD -568 per QALY and the NMB was USD 1265, with 95.9% probability of acupuncture being cost-effective.To our knowledge, this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of acupuncture for ALBP.

    "abstract": "Objective: Students have had to adapt to a “new normal” of online education at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This poses a considerable challenge to the conduct of online acupuncture courses. Here, we provide our experience and guidance for conducting an online experimental acupuncture course during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to compare the different perceptions of undergraduates to the educational environment between online and face-to-face learning approaches. Methods: This study included senior undergraduates majoring in acupuncture during the academic years 2015 (face-to-face) and 2020 (online only) for the Experimental Acupuncture course. A survey was conducted at the end of this course. The Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire was used to assess students’ perceptions. The results of students’ responses to online learning were compared with those assessed for face-to-face learning. Results: In total, 56/70 (80%) students in 2015 and 49/54 (91%) students in 2020 completed the questionnaire, respectively. Total DREEM scores were higher in the online learning group than in the face-to-face learning group (160.3 ± 21.9 vs 147.6 ± 17.9, p = 0.007), with improved students’ perceptions on four out of five dimensions (social self-perception, learning, atmosphere and academic self-perception). The positive aspects of their online learning experience included the acquisition of new knowledge and skills. The significant limitations of this course included the lack of practical classes. Conclusion: Students’ perceptions regarding the Experimental Acupuncture program were satisfactory for both online and face-to-face learning approaches, but even better with online learning. Online learning may be encouraged in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) education. However, a combination of face-to-face and online methods is likely to be required to maximize the benefits. We hope that our online Experimental Acupuncture program practices may assist in the development of online curricula for acupuncture during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Initial, focused and theoretical coding were used to identify a core category and several other categories.The core category, Reclaiming Control, was related to the sense of well-being experienced by most of the participants as a result of undergoing acupuncture care. The other categories were Gaining Sanctuary, Gaining Trust and Working Together. These categories reflected the processes of participants entering an aesthetically appealing, calm and relaxing space; developing confidence in the acupuncturists' ability to care for them; and negotiating strategies and sharing decision-making with acupuncturists about their care.Clinicians using acupuncture as a management strategy for low back pain may elicit an immediate sense of calmness in patients with subsequent well-being benefits. A sense of calmness may also be enhanced through providing a relaxing physical environment. The transactional and interpersonal processes of establishing trust and rapport, and shared decision-making are important for clients. Shared decision-making can be improved by clinicians carefully considering the explanation of issues and plans to a particular patient, especially by developing an understanding of each patient's worldview and using language that the suits each individual's healthcare orientation. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously as the results may be generalisable only to private practice in affluent countries, and whether the findings are representative beyond this setting remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is an excellent tool for the treatment of various conditions during pregnancy. As a non-pharmacological method, it is ideally suited to this delicate time period in a woman's life. Indeed one of its main advantages is arguably the avoidance of unnecessary medication, the potential harms of which are exemplified by the devastation caused by thalidomide, which was of course originally introduced as a treatment for pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting. Acupuncture may be used antenatally, for labour and delivery, and even during the postnatal period. Given the lack of any evidence of harm following acupuncture treatment during pregnancy,1 which is further highlighted by the accompanying paper by Carr,2 the aim of this editorial is to provide an overview of the current indications for obstetric acupuncture, to share my personal experience in this area, and to offer some practical suggestions for treatment.\n\nMuch of the acceptance of acupuncture within the scientific community is due to pioneering work that demonstrated its effectiveness for the treatment of nausea and vomiting. While most well-designed studies have focused on chemotherapy-induced or postoperative nausea and vomiting, there is evidence that acupuncture can also be effective in pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting across the spectrum from morning sickness to hyperemesis gravidarum.3 Around the time of delivery, it has been shown to be effective as a complementary or alternative technique for intrapartum analgesia,4 and acupuncture and/or moxibustion at BL67 is often used to promote cephalic version in breech presentation,5 ,6 typically between 33 and 35 weeks’ gestation. Acupuncture and related techniques may also be used to increase the …",

    "abstract": "Object To explore the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the hippocampus of rats undergoing heroin relapse and the mechanisms underlying the acupuncture-mediated inhibition of brain damage caused by heroin relapse. Methods 60 Sprague-Dawley rats (30 females and 30 males) were randomly divided into four groups: Control group, Heroin group, Heroin+acupuncture group, and Heroin+methadone group (n=15 each). In the latter three groups, a model of heroin addiction was established by successive increments of intramuscular heroin injections for 8 days, according to the exposure (addiction)→detoxification method. A UPR RT 2 Profiler PCR array was used to screen for differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining. The protein expression levels of the following three differentially expressed genes were detected by Western blot to validate the results of the PCR array: heat shock protein (HSP)70, HSP105, and valosin-containing protein (Vcp). Results The UPR RT 2 Profiler PCR Array detection results indicated that acupuncture increased the expression levels of the molecular chaperones HSP70, HSP105, and Vcp. The degree of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of rats in the Heroin+acupuncture and Heroin+methadone groups was significantly reduced compared with the untreated Heroin group (p&lt;0.01). Protein expression of HSP70, HSP105, and Vcp in the Heroin+acupuncture and Heroin+methadone groups was significantly higher than the Heroin group (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions The positive effects of acupuncture on brain damage caused by heroin may be closely related to up-regulation of HSP70, HSP105, and Vcp, and reduced apoptosis.",

Methods The quality of reporting for included papers was assessed against a subset of criteria adapted from CONSORT and STRICTA. CONSORT and STRICTA were developed in 1996 and 2001, respectively. Thus, for the date of publication we selected 2-year periods, at 5-yearly intervals: 1994–1995; 1999–2000; 2004–2005 and 2009–2010. These selections cover the periods before the publication dates of both guidelines (1996, 2001) and at least 3 years afterwards, and provide reasonably up-to-date data. We calculated the total score for each guideline and compared reported differences during different date ranges. Results For CONSORT items (maximum score 8), there was evidence of a slight improvement in reporting between 1994–1995 and 1999–2000 combined (2.5±0.6) and 2004–2005 and 2009–2010 combined (3.0±0.9) (difference 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). For STRICTA items (maximum score 17), there was evidence of a slight improvement in reporting between 1994–1995 and 1999–2000 combined (8.9±1.8) and 2004–2005 and 2009–2010 combined (10.3±1.6) (difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9). Conclusions The quality of reporting for studies of acupuncture for neurological disorders has generally improved since the implementation of STRICTA and CONSORT guidelines.",

The isometric twitch and tetanic tension of the FHL in the RT-EA, RT-HQ, and RT-EA-HQ groups were significantly higher compared to CON and RT groups. RT-EA treatment (with or without HQ) significantly increased GLUT4 protein concentration but had no impact on Akt-2.EA appears to be an effective treatment modality for increasing muscle mass and function when combined with RT.

This randomised, controlled trial involving 250 cancer patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery, has aimed to assess the use of electroacupuncture as the sole analgesic, but within a standard anaesthetic. It was found that while there was little difference between the per-operative requirement for anaesthetic drugs, all the non acupuncture group required fentanyl, compared to only 5% of the electroacupuncture group (P&lt;0.001). Time to spontaneous respiration (P&lt;0.02) and extubation (P&lt;0.001) immediately post-operatively was reduced in the acupuncture group. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was used for post-operative pain relief in the acupuncture group, while the control group received non-narcotic analgesics. There was no significant difference in the numbers of patients complaining of pain, but the requirement for additional analgesia was less when TENS was used (P&lt;0.01). There was no difference in the period of post-operative ileus as measured by the return of normal bowel sounds. However the return to normal self caring was significantly improved in the acupuncture group (P&lt;0.02). Both practically and economically this is probably the most important beneficial aspect of electroacupuncture demonstrated by this study.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective observational study was performed on shoulder pain cases seen in a community general practice. Two hundred and one patients were treated with acupuncture (on distant points plus local shoulder points), moxibustion and auriculotherapy. Data was retrieved from records over a three-year period to assess the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on pain, mobility and disability, and to compare perceived efficacy rates with published reports from Chinese acupuncturists. Using a four-point outcome scale in this series of 201 patients the study found: one patient (0.5%) reported no improvement, 12 (6%) simple improvement, 68 (33.8%) remarkable improvement, and 120 (59.7%) clinical resolution. Only two patients left the programme. In conclusion, treatment of soft tissue shoulder disorders with acupuncture and moxibustion in this series seems to have good clinical results in diminishing symptoms, shortening disease duration time and improving functional ability, even in long-lasting disease (up to 10 years). A combination of distant points plus local points, moxibustion and auriculotherapy seems to increase effectiveness, reduce the number of sessions per patient, and increase the time between sessions, suiting the needs of patients and those of a busy National Health Service clinic. The authors report results similar to those reported by Chinese acupuncturists when using similar diagnostic procedures, techniques, outcome measures and patients. This case series is the first step towards conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture efficacy in shoulder pain. Such trials are needed to confirm the perceived efficacy of acupuncture from observational studies.",

The aim of this project was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of self acupuncture in a pain clinic.A retrospective audit was conducted by postal questionnaire of all patients with chronic pain who were taught self acupuncture as a home pain management strategy in the previous three years. The study was conducted by a researcher not involved in the patient's treatment. The patients selected for self acupuncture were those who had responded to acupuncture previously, met certain criteria, and had been taught self acupuncture successfully. Patients were taught self acupuncture using three acupuncture points (LI4, ST44, LR3).Of 52 eligible patients (70% female) who were approached, 38 valid questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 73.1% . Of these, 76.3% were female; 86.8% (33) still used self acupuncture and 13.3% (5) had stopped; 86.8% of the patients continued to experience pain reduction with self acupuncture. The reported pain relief gained was 5.7 (SD 2.6) measured on a visual analogue scale, improvement in quality of life was reported by 73.7% and no serious adverse effects were reported.This audit suggests that self acupuncture is effective for pain relief and improves quality of life in this selected group of patients. Safety can be maintained provided that pre-selection is done with care, and appropriate training is carried out. Self acupuncture has considerable potential to reduce clinic waiting lists and appointment times for patients. Further research is required to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach.",

One hospital taught patients auricular self-acupuncture, another was planning to teach patients, and a third hospital had previously taught patients but stopped.

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis of the knee is common, and a major cause of disability in older people that is likely to increase over time. Some patients progress rapidly to needing surgery, whereas others will have persistent pain for many years. The aims of conservative treatment are to reduce pain and disability. There is evidence that several non-pharmacological therapies such as exercise, education and weight loss can have an effect in patients with knee pain, though the effect is usually only modest. Ultrasound and short wave diathermy are widely available, but not supported by evidence. Particular preparations of topical treatments are effective, as too is oral paracetamol (acetaminophen). Glucosamine is popular but not all trials have found it to have any effect. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective, though their effect is modest and their longterm value is not established. They are associated with significant adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which has a substantial mortality. They are particularly dangerous in the elderly. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors cause fewer gastrointestinal problems but increase the risk of vascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke. Herbal therapies have only sparse evidence in support. Intra-articular injections of steroids may be effective, at least for a short period, but hyaluronan has a longer duration of action. Patients prefer treatments that are safe, and are willing to forgo some effectiveness in favour of safety. In this context, acupuncture is a potentially valuable treatment for OA knee, and the evidence on effectiveness, safety and cost should be considered carefully.",

Evidence presented at the Kyoto conference shows that acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee has a biological effect, has a large clinical effect in practice, has negligible risk, and has a cost effectiveness which is well within the usual acceptable limit. On the present evidence, acupuncture is likely to offer an alternative to treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether acupuncture stimulation affects autonomic nerve function by measuring pupil diameters with electronic pupillography.Two studies were conducted (Experiment 1 and 2) in the Tsukuba University of Technology, Tsukuba, Japan. Experiment 1 examined the responses before, during and after acupuncture. Experiment 2 compared acupuncture and a no acupuncture control in a two period, repeated measurement crossover design. Twelve healthy male university students were recruited for Experiment 1 and nine healthy male university students for Experiment 2. The intervention was superficial acupuncture at the acupuncture point TE5. Following the insertion, gentle repetitive tapping stimulation was applied during the subject's exhalation phase in a sitting position for 90 seconds. The main outcome measures in Experiment 1 were pupil diameter, heart rate, pulse wave and blood pressure. In both experiments, pupil diameter was measured for three minutes before acupuncture stimulation, during stimulation and for three minutes after stimulation.In Experiment 1, a decrease in pupil diameter was observed after acupuncture stimulation (P=0.018) and a decrease in heart rate was observed during the stimulation (P=0.049). Moreover, a significant decrease of pulse wave amplitude was observed during and after acupuncture stimulation. In Experiment 2, a decrease in pupil diameter occurred after acupuncture stimulation (P=0.007), whereas no change occurred under the no acupuncture control.It is thought that the pupillary constriction observed after gentle, superficial acupuncture stimulation may be attributed to an increase of parasympathetic nerve function. Further study is necessary in order to further clarify the duration of the observed response and to elucidate the mechanisms behind it.",

To address this question we followed up participants of a past randomised controlled trial of acupuncture to assess outcomes after 5.5 to 7 years. Methods A postal questionnaire assessing pain, quality of life, disability, experience with back pain and healthcare resource use was sent to all 239 participants of the York Acupuncture for Back Pain trial. Results Response to the survey was low at 43.9%. Pain measured by the SF-36 Bodily Pain dimension was maintained in the acupuncture group since the last follow up 3.5 to 5 years previously. The usual care group had improved over the intervening years and there was now no evidence of a difference between the groups (difference −0.4 points, 95% confidence interval −10.1 to 9.7). The results were unchanged on sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation. In both groups back pain had not completely resolved and worry about back health was moderate. Physiotherapy and acupuncture were used at similar rates for continuing treatment. Discussion We theorise that exposure to a short course of acupuncture speeds natural recovery from a back pain episode, but improvements plateau after two years. Acupuncture is often accessed privately for long term management of back pain but is rarely available within the health service. While our study methods were robust, the low response rate means that our findings should be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "Background Periosteal acupuncture has shown promising results in clinical practice. The aim was to compare three patient groups: one with intramuscular acupuncture, one with periosteal acupuncture, and a third information control group, with respect to clinically relevant pain relief, physical functioning and intake of analgesics in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain in the neck or low back or both. We reported the psychological changes in these patients in a previous issue of this journal. Methods 144 consecutive patients with nociceptive pain for &gt;3 months, aged 18–70 years were alternately allocated to: intramuscular acupuncture (n=59); periosteal acupuncture (n=55); or control group with information only (n=30). All patients were encouraged to stay active. Acupuncture was administered with eight treatments during five weeks, and two optional additional treatments after one month. Pain was estimated with a daily VAS in a pain diary and with an average weekly pain score. Clinically relevant pain relief was defined as at least a 30% decrease from the initial value. Physical functioning was evaluated with Disability Rating Index. All estimations were performed prior to treatment, one week after, and one, three and six months after treatment. Results There were no differences between the effects of the two acupuncture methods. There were differences between each of the two acupuncture groups compared with the control group on all test occasions up to one month after treatment with respect to the pain diary and one week after treatment with respect to pain last week (P&lt;0.05). Pain relief as measured by a pain diary was obtained in 29 patients in the intramuscular acupuncture group, 25 in the periosteal acupuncture group, and 5 patients in the control group. Six months after treatment, 46% of the intramuscular acupuncture patients and 45% of the periosteal acupuncture patients had obtained pain relief in terms of the pain diary. The corresponding figure for pain last week was 29% in each group. Conclusion Periosteal pecking was no more effective than standard intramuscular acupuncture, but both were more effective than information only.",

This claim has a limitation because the inhibitory effect is deduced only from reduction in the maximum finger flexion (FF) force during the tonic flexion reflex by vibratory stimulation after acupuncture.The study was a crossover design with two conditions-acupuncture and control-to which 16 healthy volunteers were subjected. VFR in the upper extremity was induced by applying vibratory stimulation on the volar side of the middle fingertip of the right hand, before and after acupuncture at the right LI4 in 16 healthy volunteers. We measured the area under the curve (AUC) of finger flexion force and surface electromyogram (EMG) in the flexor muscles, in addition to the maximum FF force during vibratory stimulation. We compared AUC, surface EMG and maximum FF force in the acupuncture condition with those in the control condition. We also estimated the correlation between AUC, surface EMG and maximum FF force.AUC, surface EMG and maximum FF force were significantly reduced (p <0.01) after acupuncture compared with those of the control group. A strong correlation was observed in maximum FF force versus AUC (r=0.98, p <0.01) and surface EMG (r=0.77, p <0.01).Acupuncture at ipsilateral LI4 inhibited tonic activities in the finger flexor muscles during VFR, which suggests that afferent input with needle penetration has inhibitory effect on the motor neuronal activities in the reflex circuits of VFR.",

Egg binding is the failure of the oviduct to pass the egg down into the cloaca. In avian species the sciatic nerve runs through the middle of the kidney. Swelling of the kidney tissue due to the pressure exerted by the retained egg will cause pressure on the sciatic nerve which may lead to hind limb paresis/paralysis. Acupuncture was used to relieve any muscle, joint or nerve pain and to attempt to stimulate recovery of the sciatic nerve. Acupuncture was incorporated into a fairly intensive physical rehabilitation programme to help the penguin to walk again so that it could be re-introduced back into the sanctuary's captive colony.",

The animal was captured and kept in an aquatic pen, subsequently developing respiratory symptoms and locomotor disabilities. The respiratory symptoms resolved in response to antibiotic treatment. However, despite the use of nutritional supplements, the motor symptoms remained unchanged. After 16 months, the tortoise was given six acupuncture sessions. No other changes were made to its environment or management. The location of the acupuncture points was transposed from canine charts. After acupuncture, the animal's motor functions, which had remained unchanged during the preceding 16 months, were restored, enabling it to eat and walk unaided. The improvement persisted during 18 months follow up. The transposition of acupuncture points from canine charts is a viable alternative for chelonians.",

The clinic receives a diverse range of referrals from an expanding population of local general practitioners (GPs).This study explores the referral behaviour of GPs and other primary care users of the Gateway Clinic.A pragmatic mixed-methods approach was used, combining mapping of GPs' usage of the Gateway as taken from the clinic's database between the years 2000 and 2005, a questionnaire survey of the referring primary care practitioners in 2005, and data, including a thematic analysis of the interview transcripts from semi-structured interviews of a purposive sample of those GPs who refer.Doctors in the community refer a wide range of health problems to the Gateway Clinic. The most common referrals were musculoskeletal conditions (38-44%), general and unspecified conditions (11-14%), blood and immune system conditions (6-12%), psychological conditions (8-13%), neurological conditions (6-9%), gynaecological conditions (5-6%) and digestive conditions (5-6%). The health problems referred by local healthcare practitioners correlate strongly with the patient profile seen in private acupuncture practice. Between 2000 and 2005 numbers of healthcare practitioners increased by 218% resulting in a 300% increase in patient referrals made to the clinic; the mean frequency of referral per practitioner increased by 71%. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that positive clinical experience encourages GPs to increase the range of conditions they refer leading to the development of informal referral guidelines.The Gateway Clinic has become an increasingly popular referral resource. The influences that drive referral to the clinic are multiple and follow \"tacit guidelines\". GPs select patients on the basis of their individual clinical experience, informed by positive patient feedback and often only after more conventional medical treatment options have been exhausted.",

The Latin square design was used to allocate stimulation order. For all acupuncture stimulation interventions, a disposable acupuncture needle was inserted superficially at the acupuncture point. Gentle repetitive tapping stimulation was applied manually during the subject's exhalation phase of respiration, for 90 s. The pupil diameter was continuously measured for 2 min before stimulation, during stimulation and for 2 min after stimulation. Statistical analysis was conducted on serial changes in pupil diameter during acupuncture stimulation on each respective site and during non-stimulation session by analysis of variance and Fisher (least significant difference) multiple comparison, with linear analysis using a mixed model. Results Pupil diameter reduction occurred at 30 s after stimulation on ST7 (p=0.008) and 60 s after stimulation (p=0.014) compared with pre-stimulation. The decrease of pupillary diameter occurred 60 s after stimulation on TE5 (p=0.028) compared with pre-stimulation. On ST36, CV12 and during the non-stimulation intervention, no significant change in the pupil diameter was observed.

Proportions of studies that reported STRICTA and CONSORT items were compared for the years before and after implementation of STRICTA (2001) using Fisher's exact tests. Global differences across all study factors were investigated using hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis (PCA). Results 15 studies met our inclusion criteria. On average, 11 studies (74%) reported STRICTA items and eight studies (54%) reported CONSORT items. Differences in reporting between pre and post-STRICTA studies were found for two CONSORT items (randomised sequence and treatment provider) but no STRICTA items. However, the results of cluster analysis and PCA detected global differences over time for both STRICTA and CONSORT items.

Just under a third of leaflets (120, 30%) suggested conditions that might be helped by acupuncture, most commonly musculoskeletal pain, arthritis and injuries. By emphasising differences between individuals in acupuncture treatments and responsiveness, the leaflets fostered hope for positive effects without making any guarantees. Conclusions Information leaflets are broadly consistent with the evidence for acupuncture, but some claims are inconsistent with official advice from advertising regulators. An ethically sound, scientifically grounded and psychologically effective leaflet should accurately convey both benefits and risks of treatment, optimise patients’ expectations and allay concerns about needling. This study suggests that acupuncture leaflets might achieve these multiple functions but care should be taken to ensure adequate coverage of risks.",

This paper reports a pilot study that investigated whether menopausal symptoms responded to acupuncture, and if changes in the spectral analysis of HRV, either suppression of low frequency or augmentation of high frequency bands, corresponded with symptom report. Methods/interventions 12 healthy menopausal subjects were enrolled in this feasibility study. At baseline, subjects were experiencing moderately distressing menopausal symptoms, scoring at least 22 of a possible 44 points on the Menopausal Rating Scale. 10 traditional Chinese medicine-based, protocol acupuncture treatments were administered over a 4 week period, three times a week for 2 weeks, followed by twice a week for 2 weeks. Outcome measures Menopausal Rating Scale questionnaire, 11 menopausal symptoms were evaluated on a zero to four severity scale via self-administered daily checklist for 4 weeks. Dynamic measures of HRV (autoregressive model) were captured before, during and after acupuncture at each session. Spectral analysis of the heart rate was used to compute power in the low frequency and high frequency bands, and their ratio. Results All subjects complied fully with the protocol without any reported adverse events. While all 11 symptoms showed significant improvement, and one HRV measure changed, on average over the study period, there was essentially no support for a relationship between HRV, menopausal symptom report and acupuncture intervention.",

Acupuncture is an emerging alternative for several clinical conditions during this period. The objective of this study is to summarise evidence derived from systematic reviews (SRs) focusing on acupuncture for pregnancy-related acute conditions. Methods Review of SRs. A systematic literature search was carried out in several electronic databases, aiming to include all SRs assessing the effects of acupuncture for acute conditions during pregnancy. Methodological quality and quality of the publication/reporting of each SR were assessed by the application of AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), respectively. Results The initial search retrieved 11 492 records, of which 16 SRs met our inclusion criteria. The average AMSTAR score was 7.3, the lowest score being 3 and the highest 11. The lowest PRISMA score was 12, the highest 25, and the average PRISMA score was 19.9. The results support the proposal that acupuncture might be considered an option for alleviating pain during labour, for correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for inducing labour, managing nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, improving sleep quality, controlling nausea and vomiting associated with Caesarean delivery, and managing urinary infection. Conclusions Acupuncture might be an option for alleviating pain during labour, for correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. More studies are needed to confirm the effects of acupuncture for other pregnancy-related acute conditions.",

Objective: To compare the long-term risks of UTI among stroke patients treated with or without acupuncture treatment. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was based on data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan that included hospitalized stroke patients. We identified 19,286 patients aged 30 years and older who were hospitalized for newly diagnosed stroke between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. Considering immortal time bias, we compared the incidence of UTI during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in patients with stroke who did and did not receive acupuncture. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of UTI associated with acupuncture were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment experienced a lower incidence of UTI than those who were not treated with acupuncture (95.4 vs 110.0 per 1000 person-years) with an HR of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73–0.80). The association between acupuncture treatment and UTI was significant for both sexes and for patients older than 40 years of age, particularly for patients who had no history of medical conditions. Conclusions: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we raised the possibility that acupuncture treatment may be associated with a reduced risk of UTI among stroke patients. However, the protective effect associated with acupuncture treatment requires further validation using randomized clinical trials.",

In the present study, we explored the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation (TEAS) at an Ashi acupuncture point on expression of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using a rat model of MPS. Methods: 32 rats were divided into four groups: normal, MPS, MPS+TEAS and MPS+sham- TEAS. MPS was produced by a blunt strike to the left vastus medialis combined with eccentric exercise for 8 weeks. Rats in the MPS+TEAS group received TEAS (6–9 mA, 2 Hz, 30 min) treatment at the Ashi acupuncture point for 2 weeks; rats in the MPS+sham -TEAS group had the same electrodes applied but received no stimulation. Paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) was studied at baseline and on days 3, 7, 11 and 15 after treatment. Haematoxylin and eosin staining was used to examine for morphological changes in the left vastus medialis muscles; expression of p-JNK in the L3–L5 DRG was determined by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting after treatment. Results: Compared with the normal group, PWTL decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01) and the expression of p-JNK in the DRG increased in the MPS and MPS-sham-TEAS groups (P&lt;0.01); compared with the MPS group, PWTL was increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) and expression of p-JNK in the DRG was decreased in the MPS+TEAS group. However, when compared with the normal group, PWTL did not recover to baseline and expression of p-JNK was still higher. Conclusion: TEAS treatment may produce an analgesic effect, probably by inhibiting the expression of p-JNK in the DRG of rats with MPS.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Surgical treatment of neck pain often entails high costs and adverse events. The present cohort study investigated whether utilisation of acupuncture in neck pain patients is associated with a reduced rate of cervical surgery. Methods: The Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database was retrospectively analysed to identify the 2 year incidence of cervical surgery in Korean patients suffering neck pain from 2004 to 2010. The incidence was calculated and compared between patients receiving and not receiving acupuncture treatment using Cox proportional hazards models. Cumulative survival rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: The acupuncture and control groups included 50 171 and 128 556 neck pain patients, respectively. A total of 50 161 patients were selected in each group following propensity score matching with regard to sex, age, income and Charlson comorbidity index. The hazard ratio (HR) for surgery within 2 years was significantly lower in the acupuncture group compared with the control group (HR 0.397, 95% CI 0.299 to 0.527). In addition, subgroup analyses according to gender, age and income revealed consistent results for both men (HR 0.337, 95% CI 0.234 to 0.485) and women (HR 0.529, 95% CI 0.334 to 0.836); the results were consistently observed across all age and income strata. Sensitivity analysis with varying numbers of acupuncture treatments and treatment course duration also consistently indicated lower HRs for surgery within 2 years in the acupuncture group compared with the control group. Conclusions: A significantly lower HR for cervical surgery was observed in neck pain patients following acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture treatment may therefore be an effective method for managing neck pain, and has the potential to mitigate unnecessary surgery. These findings need to be confirmed by prospective studies.",

Methods: Three electronic surveys were conducted to gauge the breadth of knowledge and acceptance of acupuncture in post-acute stroke and rehabilitation care among three stakeholder groups: (1) traditional acupuncturists registered with the British Acupuncture Council (BAcC); (2) National Health Service (NHS) professionals attending the 2017 UK Stroke Forum conference; and (3) the UK network of Stroke Club co-ordinators. Results: Of 278 NHS respondents, 31% were doctors. Over half (52%) of all NHS respondents reported they had insufficient knowledge about acupuncture, its effectiveness (23%) or how to refer (21%). Only 12% had previously referred stroke patients for acupuncture but 46% thought that there was role for acupuncture in post-acute stroke care (50% were unsure). Two thirds of BAcC acupuncturist respondents had treated at least one stroke patient, with 70.1% having treated 1–5 stroke patients and 71% having provided treatment in the last year, most commonly for motor impairment (88.2%). Of 99 Stroke Club coordinators who responded, only seven had ever been asked about acupuncture by patients, but most felt there would be interest. Conclusion: Interest in the provision of acupuncture for post-acute stroke care was expressed by both NHS practitioners and acupuncturists. Further research is required on the acceptability of acupuncture to patients as well as evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness.",

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number of acupuncture therapy sessions, following which significant clinical improvement could be anticipated. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study in stroke patients who had received acupuncture therapy as an adjunct treatment at Trang Hospital—a non-academic provincial hospital in Southern Thailand—between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. Significant clinical improvement in activities of daily living (ADLs) was defined as an increase in the Barthel Index of ⩾10 points from baseline. Survival analysis techniques were applied to determine the optimal number of acupuncture therapy sessions. Results: Of 89 patients, 78% had a significant clinical improvement. Kaplan–Meier analysis estimated that 50% of the patients exhibited significant improvements by the eighth acupuncture therapy session. By the 16th session, the proportion of patients increased to 81%. Subgroup analyses revealed that the clinical improvement did not depend on baseline Barthel index, whereas early treatment (within 3 months of stroke onset) was associated with a faster response than late treatment. The median numbers of sessions required to achieve a significant improvement in the early and late treatment groups were 8 and 11, respectively. Conclusion: Stroke patients who were going to improve saw a significant improvement in Barthel index by the 16th acupuncture session and the marginal improvement declined substantially afterward. Our approach required minimal data available from the medical records of a non-academic facility, yet practical implication could be achieved.

The primary outcome was the response rate based on the overall treatment effect (OTE) 4 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes included dyspepsia symptom severity and adverse events. Results: In each group, 19 patients (91.5%) completed the study.

Methods A within trial cost-utility analysis with the primary endpoint for the economic evaluation being the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) and associated Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) over 14 weeks of treatment. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken with the endpoint being change in pain as measured on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Results Eighty-seven patients were randomised to acupuncture or usual care. Acupuncture resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity (8- and 14-week mean changes compared to usual care of −1.8 and −1.8, respectively), pain interference (8- and 14-week mean changes compared to usual care of −1.5 and −0.9, respectively) and indicators of quality of life and neurotoxicity-related symptoms. However, in the economic evaluation there was little difference in QALYs between the two arms (mean change 0.209 and 0.200 in the acupuncture and usual care arms, respectively). Also, costs yielded deterministic ICERs of HK$616,965.62, HK$824,083.44 and HK$540,727.56 per QALY gained from the health care provider perspective, the societal perspective and the patient perspective, respectively. These costs are significantly higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold of HK$180,450 that was used for the base case analysis.

BL40 needling sites were localized by World Health Organization (WHO) standards and were measured by MRI. As much as 70% of the value of AN (from the needle insertion point to the popliteal artery) was considered to represent the safe depth, and angle alpha between the BL40 straight line and the AN line was regarded as the safe angle. Results: Overall, mean safe depth regardless of BMI and sex was 18.51 ± 3.56 mm (95% confidence interval (CI), 17.88%–19.14%). Mean safe depth was 17.24 ± 3.14 mm in the low and normal BMI group, 18.76 ± 2.90 mm in the overweight group, and 22.01 ± 3.71 mm in the obese group. Thirteen patients (10.5%) had internal deviation of angle alpha (95% CI, 5.6%–15.3%), while 111 patients (89.5%) had external deviation (95% CI, 84.7%–94.4%). The mean internal and external deviations of angle alpha were 8.78° ± 2.92° (95% CI, 7.01°–10.55°) and 9.75° ± 3.46° (95% CI, 9.10°–10.41°), respectively. Conclusion: We would suggest that, when using a straight needle insertion at BL40, it is safe to advance a 25-mm needle approximately 12.5 mm, and 17.5 mm should be safe for patients with BMI greater than 28 kg/m 2 . Practitioners should decrease the depth of penetration when treating patients of low body weight or height.",

Three weeks later, 32 rats assigned to experiment 1 were randomly divided into four groups: two groups underwent MPOA lesioning (n=16) followed by EA at CV4, CV3, SP6 and bilateral Zigong (30 min per day) for 3 days (OVX+MPOA+EA group, n=8) or no treatment (OVX+MPOA group, n=8); and two groups underwent sham (S) surgery (n=16) followed by EA (OVX+SMPOA+EA group, n=8) or no treatment (OVX+SMPOA group, n=8). Plasma oestradiol and luteinising hormone (LH) were measured by radioimmunoassay and mature vaginal epithelial cells stained and quantified post-treatment. 30 rats assigned to experiment 2 were randomised to receive EA (OVX+EA group, n=15) or remain untreated (OVX group, n=15), following which push-pull perfusion in combination with high pressure liquid chromatography/electrochemical (HPLC-EC) detection was used to measure neurotransmitter release in the MPOA.EA significantly increased the percentage of mature vaginal epithelial cells and plasma oestradiol levels in sham MPOA-lesioned rats compared with MPOA-lesioned OVX rats (p<0.05). In sham MPOA-lesioned OVX rats, EA significantly decreased plasma LH levels compared with no treatment (p<0.01). HPLC-EC results showed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and β-endorphin levels in the MPAO were significantly increased in OVX rats following EA (p<0.01).The present study suggests that the MPOA plays a crucial role in EA treatment of abnormal reproductive function in OVX rats.",

Aim To examine for associations between maternal characteristics and response to acupuncture in terms of labour pain intensity in close proximity to the treatment (within 60 min) and over a longer time period (up to 240 min), and whether or not epidural analgesia is used, before and after adjustment for obstetric status upon admission to the labour ward. Methods Cohort study (n=253) using data collected for a randomised controlled trial. Associations were examined using linear mixed models and logistic regression analyses. Tests of interactions were also applied to investigate whether maternal characteristics were influenced by treatment group allocation. Results In close proximity to the treatment, advanced age and cervical dilation were associated with lower pain scores (mean difference (MD) −13.2, 95% CI −23.4 to −2.9; and MD −5.0, 95% CI −9.6 to −0.5, respectively). For the longer time period, labour pain was negatively associated with age (MD −11.8, 95% CI −19.6 to −3.9) and positively associated with dysmenorrhoea (MD 5.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.5). Previous acupuncture experience and advanced cervical dilatation were associated with higher and lower use of epidural analgesia (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9; and OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, respectively). No interactions with treatment allocation were found. Conclusions This study did not identify any maternal characteristics associated with women's responses to acupuncture during labour.

    "abstract": "Members of a medical acupuncture society were circulated by postal questionnaire to enquire into their acupuncture practice. Over half the replies were from general practitioners, with one third from anaesthetists. Most were using acupuncture for musculo-skeletal and general pain, but a large variety of conditions were reported as responding well by small numbers of practitioners, while others regarded these same conditions as being resistant to treatment. It is suggested that this was due to inadequate training, particularly for non painful disease which requires a more traditional and less Westernised approach. The British Medical Acupuncture Society has since modified its teaching structure to take account of this finding. Acupuncture is more popular with middle aged patients and, while medical referrals are common, most patients self-refer on the recommendation of friends and relations, but not until they have tried other therapies. Once they have experienced acupuncture they are more likely to come for initial treatment with any future problems. The majority (75%) of medical acupuncturists see less than 250 patients a year, and almost 50% see less than 100. Most seem to be conventional doctors who use acupuncture for particular problems in suitable patients. The authors believe that practising acupuncture from a firm base in conventional medicine is likely to give the greatest benefit to patients.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, low power laser therapy has become a popular treatment modality. While its use as an alternative to needles in acupuncture is contentious, the studies reviewed above demonstrate the possibility of analgesic effects with such treatments. However, the majority of the trials conducted to date can be criticised on a number of points. This has contributed to the criticism surrounding the technique. Furthermore, the clinical significance of such treatment parameters as wavelength, energy density and pulsing frequency are poorly understood. Further research is therefore necessary on a number of levels: clinically to validate the claims made on behalf of lasers, and experimentally to identify optimum values for treatment parameters. Hopefully, as research in this field progresses, clinicians will benefit from firm treatment guidelines. While in the final analysis lasers will probably never be able to replace needles, the potential advantages in their use in HLTVor hepatitis patients are obvious. Squeamish or very young patients may also react more favourably to laser rather than needle acupuncture. To this end, laser acupuncture represents a challenging and interesting field for future research.",

But using acupuncture trials to aid clinical decisions is not straightforward. Take the case of a patient consulting an evidence-based physician for chronic low back pain and asking whether acupuncture might be of value. The doctor searches MEDLINE and, as of May 2009, finds 65 English-language randomised trials. Even if the doctor were to obtain copies of all of these trials, he or she would find that the results were inconsistent. Some report acupuncture to be superior to sham (placebo) acupuncture1 while others show evidence that acupuncture is superior to no treatment but not sham2 and still others conclude that acupuncture is no better than usual care.3\n\nClearly what is needed is a meta-analysis to synthesise the results from the different studies. Indeed, many meta-analyses of acupuncture for chronic pain have been published. These studies have tended to come to somewhat indeterminate conclusions, such as “there is limited evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for chronic pain; and inconclusive evidence that acupuncture is more effective than placebo”.4 This appears to be because, until recently, acupuncture research was dominated by small trials of questionable quality.\n\nThe landscape of clinical acupuncture research has recently been dramatically altered by the publication of several large, high quality trials. These include the two NHS funded trials of acupuncture chronic headache disorders (n = 401)5 and back pain (n = 241)6 and the German Acupuncture Randomised Trials (ART) studies2 7 8 9 which randomised 300 patients each in four separate trials on osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, migraine and chronic tension headache.

    "abstract": "Recommendations for treatment are commonly based on results evaluating variation in systematic effects (group responses) from randomised controlled trials without taking the individual patient's variation into account. In the evaluation of acupuncture-related treatment effects, the trial design and statistical analysis used are a challenge since the assessed variables commonly have subjective properties and are based on the person's own self-report. Thus, the results that are seen are often varied, most likely due to inter-individual variation in rating of the actual variable such that the treatment effects are expressed more (or less) in some individuals than in others. The basis for the individual variation is probably multi-modal and could be related to the individuals' expectation, gender, genetic polymorphisms and the aetiology of the condition. The assessment methods used should preferably have proven useful in controlled trials, and the methods for statistical analysis should consider the non-metric properties of the variable and the contribution of the individuals' variation in the results. In order to evaluate the treatment effects more properly and increase the possibility of detecting any effectiveness, it is therefore important to assess the level of perceived dysfunction or symptom, taking into account the individual variation as well as the systematic effects (the effects of the group). In the evaluation of acupuncture effects, both systematic and individual variation should be reported allowing for the detection of subgroup effects and thereby leading to treatment recommendations that are more likely to be based on each individual's specific needs.",

In Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil, acupuncture has been integrated into the care pathways since October 2005. Since then, medical acupuncture has been offered for both inpatients and outpatients. Acupuncture has become an integrated therapeutic modality both for outpatients in the clinic setting and for inpatients in the wards. It has been observed that acupuncture performed in a hospital differs in specific characteristics when compared with acupuncture performed in an outpatient setting. The main differences found between inpatients and outpatients treatment are summarised and attitudes and cautionary measures to be taken into account during application of acupuncture in inpatients are suggested. Future plans for the service include offering acupuncture in the emergency ward and surgical centre. The description of this experience could encourage other hospitals to develop an acupuncture service.",

As such, examining acupuncture's use in a pragmatic, real-world setting would be valuable. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of acupuncture and prophylactic drug treatment (PDT) on headache frequency in patients with HDs, under real-world clinical conditions.Retrospective cohort study of patients with HDs referred to a pain clinic, using electronic health record data. Patients continued with tertiary care (treatment of acute headache attacks and lifestyle, meditation, exercise and dietary instructions) with PDT, or received 12 sessions of acupuncture over 3 months, instead of PDT under conditions of tertiary care. The primary outcome data were the number of days with headache per month, and groups were compared at baseline and at the end of the third month of treatment.Data were analysed for 482 patients with HDs. The number of headache days per month decreased by 3.7 (standard deviation (SD) = 2.9) days in the acupuncture group versus 2.9 (SD = 2.3) in the PDT group (p = 0.007). The proportion of responders was 39.5% versus 16.3% (p < 0.001). The number needed to treat was 4 (95% confidence interval = 3-7).Our study has shown that patients with HDs in tertiary care who opted for treatment with acupuncture appeared to receive similar clinical benefits to those that chose PDT, suggesting these treatments may be similarly effective of the prevention of headache in a real-world clinical setting.",

Methods: Nine databases were searched until June 2019. Only relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of EA for PMS were included. Results: Twelve trials involving 746 women were included. EA and hormone therapy (HT) did not significantly differ in terms of effective rate (risk ratio (RR) = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93 to 1.04), Kupperman index (KI) (mean difference (MD) = −0.25, 95% CI = −0.76 to 0.26) and serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (MD = −3.80, 95% CI = −11.59 to 3.98) or luteinizing hormone (LH) (MD = −2.51, 95% CI = −10.72 to 5.70). Serum estradiol (E 2 ) levels were significantly lower in EA versus HT groups (MD = −60.58, 95% CI = −71.93 to −49.23). Compared with sham EA, EA had a significantly greater effect on reductions in KI (MD = −4.71, 95% CI = −6.57 to −2.86) and hot flushes score/24 h (MD = −2.43, 95% CI = −2.93 to −1.93). There were no significant differences between EA and manual acupuncture (MA) in terms of effective rate (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.33) or serum FSH (MD = −2.87, 95% CI = −29.65 to 23.91), LH (MD = 2.73, 95% CI = −9.65 to 15.11) or E 2 (MD = 26.80, 95% CI = −12.06 to 65.65). However, it seemed that EA had a better effect than MA on KI (MD = −2.44, 95% CI = −4.80 to −0.08). Subgroup analyses indicated that EA may have more of a benefit in the pre-menopausal state (hot flushes score/24 h: MD = −1.66, 95% CI = −3.49 to 0.17) compared to post-menopause (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The effect of EA appeared broadly similar to HT and MA in the treatment of PMS, although EA-associated reductions in KI were superior to MA and sham EA, suggesting effects beyond placebo. The evidence base is limited by a small number of eligible studies, risk of bias and clinical/statistical heterogeneity, limiting our ability to draw firm conclusions. As such, additional larger scale, high-quality RCTs are needed.",

    "abstract": "The original empirical conjecture of auricular acupuncture (AA) consists of a claim that the entire human body is represented in a certain way on the auricle (eg, in the form of an inverted fetus, see figure 1A), and that the pathology of human organs leads to specific changes at these respective areas on the auricle. It is claimed that these changes can be identified as the areas with skin discolourations, which are tender on palpation. Moreover, the stimulation of these auricular areas, which are supposed to somehow be connected to the organ with ‘pathology’, is believed to improve the functioning of the impaired organ or relieve the related pain.1 The representation of the human body on the auricle is often called ‘somatotopic’, analogous to motor and sensory somatotops of precentral and postcentral gyri of the cortex, as described by Penfield and Rasmussen on the basis of experimental research.2 Interestingly, randomised clinical trials on the efficacy of AA have demonstrated that stimulation of the areas of auricle according to the AA empirical conjecture was effective as complementary treatment for a variety of pain syndromes and preoperative anxiety.3,–,5 However, no neuroanatomical pathways are known to connect the ‘diseased’ organs with the external auricle so that the observed phenomena cannot be explained by the underlying anatomy.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \n(A) The empirical conjecture of auricular acupuncture claims that the entire human body is represented on the auricle in the form of an inverted fetus.

The only treatment that seemed to have some positive effect, but of extremely short duration, was acupuncture.

Sensory stimulation in the form of acupuncture or ear acupressure may contribute to protecting patients from blindness when used as a complementary method to orthodox treatment in the form of drops, laser or surgery. The objective of this article is to provide a narrative overview of the available literature up to July 2012. It summarises reported evidence on the potential beneficial effects of sensory stimulation for glaucoma. Sensory stimulation appears to significantly enhance the pressure-lowering effect of orthodox treatments. Studies suggest that it may also improve blood flow to the eye and optic nerve head. Furthermore, it may play a role in neuroprotection through regulating nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and their receptors, thereby encouraging the survival pathway in contrast to the pathway to apoptosis. Blood flow and neuroprotection are areas that are not directly influenced by orthodox treatment modalities. Numerous different treatment protocols were used to investigate the effect of sensory stimulation on intraocular pressure, blood flow or neuroprotection of the retina and optic nerve in the animal model and human pilot studies. Objective outcomes were reported to have been evaluated with Goldmann tonometry, Doppler ultrasound techniques and electrophysiology (pattern electroretinography, visually evoked potentials), and supported with histological studies in the animal model. Taken together, reported evidence from these studies strongly suggests that sensory stimulation is worthy of further research.",

The current study aimed to study the adjunct effect of acupuncture on target tissue distribution of schisandra lignans when acupuncture is combined with Schisandra chinensis.A simple and reliable high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) method for simultaneous analysis of three bioactive lignans (schisandrin, deoxyschisandrin and schisandrin B) in rat tissues was established. Using this analytical method we evaluated whether acupuncture had a synergistic effect on the tissue distribution of schisandra lignans.Tissue concentrations of the three lignans in the group receiving acupuncture were significantly higher than those in the schisandra only group, suggesting that acupuncture may potently increase tissue concentrations of schisandra lignans. The highest concentrations of the three lignans occurred in the liver compared with other tissues, and tissue concentrations in the heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys were increased by 315%, 203%, 250% and 224%, respectively. In addition, retention times of the lignans in tissues were prolonged for a relative long time.Our date indicate that the combined use of acupuncture and Schisandra chinensis could produce a synergistic effect which could play a beneficial role on promoting the tissue distribution of lignans. This has supported our initial hypothesis. The HPLC-MS method showed good sensitivity in quantifying the three schisandra lignans in different tissues.",

Although acupuncture is becoming an increasingly popular, evidence-based option for treating pain, little is known about the potential influence of psychological factors on acupuncture use. Objective We aimed to evaluate the association between pain catastrophising and use of acupuncture in breast cancer survivors experiencing arthralgia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of arthralgic breast cancer patients. Patients were asked if they had used acupuncture since their cancer diagnosis. The Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) was used to measure negative coping styles related to the experience of pain. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between pain catastrophising and acupuncture use, adjusting for covariates. Results Of the 424 participants, 69 (16%) reported use of acupuncture since their breast cancer diagnosis. In multivariate analyses, compared to those in the lowest PCS score tertile, patients with the highest PCS scores were more likely to have used acupuncture (p=0.03). In particular, patients with high levels of rumination (p=0.005) and magnification (p=0.008) were more likely to have used acupuncture. Helplessness was not associated with acupuncture use (p=0.23). Conclusions High levels of pain catastrophising, and specifically the processes of rumination and magnification, were associated with greater acupuncture use. We believe this could have important implications for understanding which population is more likely to seek acupuncture treatment and how this alternative therapy could be better targeted to these patients.",

We aimed to explore the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) with manual stimulation on blood pressure (BP) and urine metabolites in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of hypertension. Methods After adaptive feeding (with a standard laboratory diet and distilled water) for 1 week, five normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats with normal BP formed the control group. Ten SHRs were randomised into two groups (n=5 each), one of which received MA at ST9 for a total of 14 days (SHR+MA group). The other (SHR group) and the WKY control group underwent needle insertion without manual stimulation. BP was measured pre- and post-acupuncture in all groups and urinary metabolic profiles were investigated using metabonomics methods based on 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and orthogonal to partial least squares discriminant analysis. Results A total of 46 metabolites were clearly separated in the urine by 1 H NMR. Loading plots showed significant changes in urinary metabolite contents after acupuncture treatment as well as significant differences between SHR and WKY rats. Acupuncture at ST9 in SHRs increased urine metabolites including α-ketoglutaric acid, N-acetyl glutamic acid, and betaine. Furthermore, systolic and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced after acupuncture. Conclusions Acupuncture may decrease BP in SHRs by improving the metabolic disorder associated with hypertension.",

Although the combination of behavioural counselling with FDA-approved medications offers the best evidence-based treatment approach, 12-month relapse rates remain at &gt;60%. Both healthcare providers and patients are searching for alternative treatment options. Most acupuncture trials have yielded poor results for smoking cessation; however, most trials have not used an intense treatment protocol and maintained treatment for at least 12 weeks. Methods We designed a pilot study to address these methodological problems. Twenty-eight smokers were recruited to attend two 1 h acupuncture sessions weekly for 12 weeks. Primary endpoints included completion rate, acceptability of the protocol and side effects. Secondary endpoints included carbon monoxide (CO)-confirmed, 7-day point prevalence quit rates at 12 weeks and 26 weeks. Results Sixteen of the 28 patients enrolled (57%) completed 12 weeks of treatment. Of the 17 patients who completed the end-of-study questionnaire, 94% (16/17) rated the programme as helpful, and 82% noted they would recommend it to friends for smoking cessation. Three of the 28 who initially enrolled in the study were confirmed abstinent at 12 weeks (10.7%); one of the 28 (3.6%) was abstinent at 26 weeks.

Objectives To determine the strengths and weaknesses of these two handle types for needle buckling. Methods The buckling load for acupuncture needles with these two different handle types was determined using a digital scale, and the stiffness of stainless steel wires used in different types of acupuncture needles was measured using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis machine. Results This study showed that an acupuncture needle with a copper coil handle was far more susceptible to buckling than a needle with a plastic stick handle. The average buckling force of acupuncture needles with plastic stick handles was 46.7% higher than that with copper coil handles for needles of 0.25 mm×30 mm, and 30.8% higher for needles of 0.25 mm×60 mm. Replacing a copper coil handle with a plastic stick handle could save about 100 tonnes of copper wires and 20 million metres of medical grade stainless steel wire a year worldwide. Conclusions The results from this study suggest that the common practice of using coiled copper for handles on acupuncture needles should be re-evaluated. Replacing a copper coil handle with a plastic stick handle would significantly reduce needle buckling and improve patient comfort and safety. This would also reduce the consumption of copper and medical grade stainless steel wire considerably.",

    "abstract": "Background Patients with gastrointestinal cancers often suffer from malnutrition and cachexia caused by inflammatory processes due to malignancy and therapeutic intervention. Evaluation of nutritional status and well-being of patients is essential to prevent or slow down the progression of cachexia. In addition, acupuncture as a complementary intervention may help reduce cachexia and unintentional weight loss. Methods Seven patients with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract enrolled in this pilot study were provided with eight acupuncture sessions in addition to their regular treatment schedule. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements were taken at every other acupuncture session to evaluate the body composition of patients. BIA is a fast, inexpensive and non-invasive method for evaluating fluid, fat and muscle mass distribution which correlates with nutritional status. Results All patients enrolled in the pilot study completed the acupuncture intervention and BIA measurements. The average weight loss and reduction in body weight was 1.3%, which is less than the average weight loss of 5% reported in the literature. Both phase angle and fat-free mass decreased in patients, indicating a worsening of the condition. However, a shift from intracellular to extracellular fluid was not observed, which is usually associated with a loss of cell integrity. Conclusions This pilot study indicates that patients tolerate acupuncture treatments well. The BIA results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. A larger randomised placebo-controlled study is currently being conducted to further investigate the influence of acupuncture and to provide insights into BIA as a reliable tool for evaluating body composition in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.",

While acupuncture is widely accepted as a useful non-pharmacological method for pain reduction, the mechanism of acupuncture is still debated—whether it works through the mechanical stimulation of skin and muscle nociceptors or through anatomically invisible APs and meridians. Some researchers have found that the electrical resistance of the skin over an AP is lower than that over a non-AP, and proposed the finding as indirect evidence of the existence of APs.1–6 However, the precision of skin electrical resistance measurement can be influenced by numerous factors such as dryness of skin, skin thickness, size of the sensing electrode, pressure applied on the electrode, inter-electrode distance, room temperature and humidity.7 Most of the previous studies on AP identification were done with the sensing electrode being stabilised by hand1–5; however, it is likely that small motions of the hand-held electrode could alter the reading of skin resistance and even bias the measurement.\n\nIn the present investigation, the AP LI4 and an adjacent skin site were selected for …",

Although there are some informative surveys and reviews, there are few international, exploratory studies detailing how physicians have accommodated medical acupuncture (eg, by modifying schedules, space and processes). Objective To examine how physicians integrate medical acupuncture into their practice. Methods Semi-structured interviews and participant observations of physicians practising medical acupuncture were conducted using convenience and snowball sampling. Data were analysed in NVivo and themes were developed. Despite variation, three principal models were developed to summarise the different ways that physicians integrated medical acupuncture into their practice, using the core concept of ‘helping’. Quotes were used to illustrate each model and its corresponding themes. Results There were 25 participants from 11 countries: 21 agreed to be interviewed and four engaged in participant observations. Seventy-two per cent were general practitioners. The three models were: (1) appointments (44%); (2) clinics (44%); and (3) full-time practice (24%). Some physicians held both appointments and regular clinics (models 1 and 2). Most full-time physicians initially tried appointments and/or clinics. Some physicians charged to offset administration costs or compensate for their time. Discussion Despite variation within each category, the three models encapsulated how physicians described their integration of medical acupuncture. Physicians varied in how often they administered medical acupuncture and the amount of time they spent with patients. Although 24% of physicians surveyed administered medical acupuncture full-time, most practised it part-time. Each individual physician incorporated medical acupuncture in the way that worked best for their practice.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the symptoms and quality of life (QoL) of patients with moderate or severe acne vulgaris (AV). Methods: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 12 treatment sessions of acupuncture or sham acupuncture over 4 weeks with 24 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the Skindex-16 scale total score at treatment completion. Secondary outcomes included Skindex-16 subscale score, Dermatology Life Quality Index scale total score, total lesion count and inflammatory lesion count, and visual analogue scale scores for itch and pain evaluation. Results: There was no statistically significant between-group difference for the primary outcome or any secondary outcomes after 4 weeks of treatment and at 16 and 28 weeks of follow-up, except for the Skindex-16 emotions subscale at week 4 (p = 0.026). No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusion: Acupuncture may not effectively relieve the symptoms of patients with moderate or severe AV, or improve QoL. Given the limitations of a relatively short treatment course compared to other studies and the likelihood that sham acupuncture is not inert, further studies with treatment durations of 12 weeks or longer and a waitlist (no treatment) control or Western medicine-treated control group should be considered to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on AV.

In this study, we examined the antidepressant effects of simultaneous acupuncture stimulation at GV20 and Yintang.We compared the antidepressant effects of manual acupuncture (MA) stimulation at GV20 and Yintang, compared to acupuncture stimulation at two control point locations on the back of the mice (overlying the spinal column) and imipramine administration in a forced swimming (FS)-induced mouse model of depression, and examined the mRNA and protein expression of neurotrophic factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-4/5 in the brains by real-time polymerase chain reaction in two different experimental schedules - preventive (MA given alongside FS modelling) and therapeutic (MA given after FS-induced depression was already established).MA at GV20 and Yintang significantly reduced the immobility time of mice with FS-induced depression in both preventive and therapeutic experimental designs, with effects that were comparable to those of imipramine administration. Immobility time following simultaneous acupuncture stimulation of the two control point locations overlying the spinal column was significantly suppressed only 2 weeks after the start of FS in the preventive effect experiment, and the suppressive effect was significantly lower than that of simultaneous acupuncture stimulation at GV20 and Yintang. In the therapeutic effect experiment, there was no change in the increase in immobility time after the end of FS. MA at GV20 and Yintang significantly increased the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in the preventive evaluation and NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 in the therapeutic effect evaluation.Our findings suggest that simultaneous acupuncture stimulation at GV20 and Yintang is effective for the prevention and treatment of depression, and the effect likely involves modulation of the expression of multiple neurotrophic factors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulation of the host response to infection. Acupuncture is used for treatment of inflammatory diseases; however, its effectiveness and safety as a complementary therapy for sepsis has not been fully explored. Methods: Data were retrieved from eight databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture plus conventional therapies versus conventional therapies alone were included. Pre-specified primary outcomes were mortality at 28 days and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores. Results: A total of 17 studies with 1099 participants were included in this study. In terms of the primary outcomes, acupuncture plus routine therapy reduced mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR)): 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52 to 0.91, p &lt; 0.001) and APACHE II scores (mean difference (MD): −2.84, 95% CI: −4.09 to −1.58, p &lt; 0.001) at day 7 after treatment compared with routine therapy alone. In terms of secondary outcomes, acupuncture plus routine therapy reduced white blood cell counts and levels of procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and lactic acid and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), and improved CD3+, CD4+ and monocytes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR at day 7 after treatment compared with routine therapy alone. However, acupuncture plus routine therapy had no significant effects on levels of IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratios compared with routine therapy alone. Quality of evidence was low to very low for all parameters (GRADE). Conclusion: The available evidence showed that combination of acupuncture and routine therapy may have benefit for sepsis compared with use of routine therapy only. Due to the low degree of certainty regarding its effects, further research is required. Trial registration number: ICRD42019141491 (PROSPERO).",

    "abstract": "Objective: Specification of interventions and selection of controls are two methodological determinants for a successful acupuncture trial. However, current practice with respect to these two determinants is not fully understood. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine the specification of interventions and selection of controls among published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture. Study design and setting: We searched PubMed for acupuncture RCTs published in core clinical journals and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) journals from January 2010 to December 2019 (10 years) and included RCTs that assessed treatment effects of acupuncture versus any type of control. We used network meta-analyses to explore whether there were differential treatment effects in patients with chronic pain when using sham acupuncture as a control versus using waiting list or no treatment. Results: Most of the 319 eligible RCTs specified well the style of acupuncture (86.8%), traditional acupuncture point locations (96.2%), type of needle stimulation (90.3%) and needle retention time (85.6%). However, other acupuncture details were less-frequently specified, including response sought (65.5%), needle manipulation (50.5%), number of needle insertions (21.9%), angle and direction of insertion (31.3%), patient posture (32.3%) and co-interventions (22.9%). Sham acupuncture (41.4%) was the most frequently used control, followed by waiting list or no treatment (32.9%). There was no differential treatment effect when using sham acupuncture versus waiting list/no treatment as a control (standardized mean difference = −0.15, 95% confidence interval: −0.91 to 0.62). Conclusion: Over a decade of research practice, important gaps have remained in the specification of acupuncture interventions, including response sought, needle manipulation, and co-interventions. While sham acupuncture has been widely used, waiting list or no treatment may also be considered as an appropriate control.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at ST36 and BL20 on the testicular tissues in a rat model of diabetes and to explore the mechanisms of action. Methods: A total of 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to a control group (n = 10), diabetes (D) group (n = 12) or diabetes + acupuncture (DA) group (n = 12). To model diabetes, rats in groups D and DA received an intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in citrate buffer (pH = 4.5; 0.1 M) after 2 weeks of high-fat diet administration. Under xylazine/ketamine anesthesia, stainless steel needles (30 mm × 0.25 mm) were inserted bilaterally at ST36 and BL20. The needles were connected to an EA device via cables, and EA was applied for 30 min (15 Hz frequency and 0.2–1 mA intensity) twice a week for 5 weeks. Results: The effects of EA at ST36 and BL20 on blood glucose levels and body weight, biochemical parameters, histopathological, morphometric and immunohistochemical findings, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis were evaluated. A significant decrease was detected in DA versus D groups in blood glucose levels, basement membrane thickness and apoptotic cell/tubule indices. In addition, there was a significant increase in the Johnsen scores, seminiferous tubule diameters, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, proliferation indices, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) immunoreactivities. Conclusion: EA had multiple positive effects on blood glucose homeostasis and testicular structure/function in this rat model of diabetes. EA may be effective at preventing or eliminating histopathological damage in the diabetic testis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for the impact of dry needling (DN) on hip pain and function. Methods: Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched systematically through June 2022 for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of DN on hip pain and function. Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used to assess risk of bias. Descriptive analysis was conducted to explain the outcomes and adverse events of DN in hip joint diseases. Meta-analysis was not feasible due to significant heterogeneity. Results: A total of seven eligible studies (including 273 patients) were included out of 2152 screened records. Five studies were in participants with hip osteoarthritis (OA; n = 3), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS; n = 1) or piriformis syndrome ( n = 1); the other two studies were conducted in healthy athletes ( n = 2). Two articles assessed changes in participants’ short-term visual analog scale (VAS) scores (&lt;1 week), one of which showed that DN significantly reduced pain ( P &lt; 0.05). One-week VAS scores were analyzed in three studies, all of which demonstrated reduced scores following DN ( P &lt; 0.05). Hip range of motion (ROM) and muscle force were also improved following DN. No serious side effects were reported. Conclusion: DN may be safe and effective at relieving hip pain and improving hip function. DN performs significantly better than several different types of control intervention (including sham DN, no treatment, corticosteroid injections and laser). Strong evidence (high degree of certainty around the results) is lacking, and future studies should ideally use longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes.

These include minimising the risk of transmission of infection, maintaining sufficient knowledge of anatomy to guide safe needling, and seeking an orthodox medical diagnosis before embarking on treatment. Beyond these basic principles, there are certain circumstances in practice that generate regular debate amongst practitioners. This article details advice on a limited selection of such circumstances. This advice has been drawn from a set of policy statements originally drafted to facilitate clarity and consistency within the teaching of Western medical acupuncture provided by the BMAS. It is not comprehensive, but covers the areas where there were the greatest differences in approach among the teaching staff. The original policy statements were also incorporated into the BMAS Code of Practice. By using the guidance in this article, in addition to applying sound clinical judgement and a knowledge of relevant anatomy, we hope that practitioners will minimise both the theoretical risks and the reported serious adverse events related to acupuncture, yet be able to practise unencumbered by illogical restrictions.",

She was receiving intensive in-patient multi-disciplinary rehabilitation but was struggling to participate fully due to pain and poor sleep quality. She received a course of acupuncture in addition to standard care and reported substantial benefits including reduction in pain, improved sleep and mood, and reduction in daytime fatigue. Effective symptom control allowed this patient to participate more fully in her rehabilitation programme. Reduction of knee pain and sleep disturbance was maintained until discharge, 15 weeks after the last acupuncture treatment. This case report suggests that acupuncture may be an option to consider for other patients with pain or sleep disturbance that is interfering with their rehabilitation programme.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of acupuncture on mild postpartum depression (PPD).15 patients diagnosed with PPD were enrolled in the study. Patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria received acupuncture therapy eight times over 4 weeks in the form of two 20-min treatment sessions per week. The treatment site was the BL67 acupuncture point (on the outside of the fifth toenail). After disinfecting the skin on the toes, sterile steel needles were gently inserted into the acupuncture point until the patient started to feel numb or swollen, a sensation known as de qi. Acupuncture was performed by the same doctor using HuanQiu stainless steel needles that were 0.2 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate the clinical effects of this therapy. Questionnaires were distributed to patients before therapy and 1 week after therapy and were immediately completed and checked.Treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement for all patients who adhered to therapy. The nine patients who completed treatment had an average pain score of 6.66 (SD 0.86); these patients' average pre-treatment pain score was 10.83 (SD 1.47). Six patients who did not complete treatment had an average pain score of 11.23 (SD 1.48); the average pre-treatment pain score of these patients was 10.5 (SD 2.21). Thus, symptoms did not significantly improve for patients who failed to adhere to the therapy. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to HAMD score before treatment (P=0.363). By contrast, asignificant between-group difference in post-treatment HAMD score was detected (P=0.001). Two patients discontinued treatment due to haemorrhage at the site of needling, and four patients discontinued treatment due to the inconvenience of traffic. There were no significant complications.Acupuncture therapy at BL67 may alleviate symptoms of mild PPD, however controlled clinical investigations are required to confirm its efficacy and effectiveness for this condition.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Emerging evidence has shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a positive effect on arthritis. This research provides the first critical, systematic examination of TCM practitioners’ perceptions of TCM use for people with arthritis. Methods An online survey was distributed to all TCM professionals including acupuncturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners registered with the Practitioner Research and Collaborate Initiative (PRACI) practitioner database. The survey questions focus on practitioner characteristics, practice characteristics and clinical management approaches regarding arthritis care. Results The survey attracted a response rate of 53% (n=52). The average age of the respondents was 49.9 years, more than half were female, and the majority held a bachelor degree or higher qualification. More than two thirds of TCM practitioners in our study worked with other health professionals, while they had a high level of referral relationships with a wide range of conventional, allied health and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers. Most of the TCM practitioners reported that their patients with arthritis used other treatments alongside TCM and a large number of the TCM practitioners who participated believed that TCM was effective for treating arthritis. Conclusions The TCM profession represents a substantial component of the healthcare field in Australia, and treating patients with arthritis appears to be an important area of TCM practice, among others. Further detailed research is needed to help ensure effective, safe patient care for those with arthritis who may be utilising TCM alongside a broader range of conventional medicine, allied health, and other CAM treatments.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cancer cachexia (CC) is a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Treatment options to prevent or halt the progression of CC are limited. Targeted acupuncture (TA) was used in GI patients with CC to evaluate for a potential gender effect. Patients and methods: Participants ( n = 30) were recruited from two outpatient clinics in the northern central part of Florida. All participants were diagnosed with CC and GI cancers. A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was used to compare TA to non-targeted acupuncture (NTA) over the course of 8 weeks. Primary endpoints were weight and body composition changes measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and biomarker analysis (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and leptin). Herein, gender differences across and within TA and NTA groups were examined as a secondary analysis. Results: A significant ( p = 0.026) interaction between weight and gender was noted, which manifested in a non-significant increase in the male intervention (MI) group, while TNF-α levels significantly increased by gender ( p = 0.028) and group ( p = 0.006) over the course of the study. All other groups either lost or did not change weight. The extracellular-to-intracellular water (ECW/ICW) ratio was significantly elevated for the TA group ( p = 0.02) and for males ( p = 0.009) at completion of the study. TNF-α and leptin levels were positively correlated within the MI group at the end of the study. Conclusion: A decrease in leptin in the MI group corresponded to higher appetite and weight gain. The elevated ECW/ICW ratio indicates an inflammatory response in the MI group. This gender-specific response may be based on hormone-specific regulation of food intake. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to support the results.",

Methods: 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats (7 weeks old) were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. A blunt strike injury and eccentric exercise were applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of rats in the experimental group once a week for 8 weeks as a MTrS modelling intervention. Subsequently, the rats were reared normally and rested for 4 weeks. At the end of the 12th week, the rats were examined for the presence of MTrSs defined by the detection of a palpable taut band exhibiting both a local twitch response and spontaneous electrical activity. After modelling, evocation of the H-reflex and morphological examination of muscle spindles and MTrSs were conducted. Results: The threshold (0.35±0.04 mA) of the H-reflex and latency (1.24±0.18 ms) of the M wave recorded at MTrSs were not significantly different to those at non-MTrSs (P&gt;0.05). Compared with non-MTrSs, a lower Mmax (4.28±1.27 mV), higher Hmax (median (IQR) 0.95 (0.80–1.08) mV) and Hmax/Mmax (median (IQR) 0.21 (0.16–0.40)), and shorter H wave latency (4.60±0.89 ms) were recorded at MTrSs (P&lt;0.05). Morphologically, there was a close anatomical relationship between the MTrS cells and the muscle spindles. Discussion: Compared with normal muscles, the H-reflex myoelectrical activity was enhanced and some muscle spindles might have been influenced by active MTrSs. Thus, muscle spindles may play an important role in the pathological mechanism underlying myofascial trigger points.",

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have reported that electroacupuncture (EA) induces a glucose-lowering effect by improving insulin resistance (IR) and reduces plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels in rats with steroid-induced insulin resistance (SIIR). In addition, EA can activate cholinergic nerves and stimulate endogenous opioid peptides to lower plasma glucose in streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the glucose-lowering effects of 15 Hz EA at bilateral ST36 in combination with acarbose (ACA). We hypothesized that EA combined with ACA would produce a stronger glucose-lowering effect than ACA alone. Methods: In this study, normal Wistar rats and SIIR rats were randomly divided into two groups: ACA and ACA + EA. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying the glucose-lowering effect, plasma FFA/insulin and insulin transduction signal pathway proteins were assayed. Results: Combined ACA + EA treatment had a greater glucose-lowering effect than ACA alone in normal Wistar rats (−45% ± 3% vs −19% ± 3%, p &lt; 0.001) and SIIR model rats (−43% ± 2% vs −16% ± 6%, p &lt; 0.001). A significant reduction in plasma FFA levels, improvement in homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index (−48.9% ± 4.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and insulin sensitivity index (102% ± 16.9%, p &lt; 0.001), and significant increases in insulin receptor substrate 1, glucose transporter 4, and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ protein expressions in skeletal muscle, were also observed in the ACA + EA group of SIIR rats. Conclusion: Combined EA and ACA therapy had a greater glucose-lowering effect than ACA monotherapy; this combined therapy could be more effective at improving IR in SIIR rats, which may be related to a reduction in plasma FFA levels and an elevation of insulin signaling proteins. Whether this combined therapy has an effect in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients still needs to be explored.",

EA was performed in the sacrococcygeal region using disposable sterile 0.40-mm-diameter acupuncture needles that were either 100 or 125 mm in length. Treatments were delivered once every other day. Before and after treatment, a questionnaire measuring symptom severity and quality of life associated with UUI was administered.The median total score (interquartile range) from the severity of symptoms and the quality of life questionnaire (Q-score) of the participants was significantly reduced from 12 (7.5, 15) before treatment to 3 (0, 6) after 6 (6, 12) EA treatments. The Q-score of urgency-predominant MUI and UUI was 8 (5, 14.5) and 12.5 (11, 15), respectively, before treatment; after treatment these were reduced to 2 (0, 7.5) and 4.5 (2, 6), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the Q-score between urgency-predominant MUI and UUI before and after treatment. Upon treatment completion, seven patients (28%) were 'cured' (improvement rate 100%). Treatments were considered 'markedly effective' (improvement rate 75% to <100%) in four patients (16%), 'effective' (improvement rate 50% to <75%) in eight patients (32%), 'minimally effective' (improvement rate 25% to <50%) in three patients (12%), and 'ineffective' (improvement rate <25%) in three patients (12%). The overall success rate (comprising 'cured', 'markedly effective' and 'effective' categories) was 76%, and no adverse effects associated with acupuncture treatment were reported.EA at the 'four sacral points' was associated with statistically significant improvements in UUI.",

However, the efficacy of acupuncture for OA is uncertain, as much of the evidence is inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to evaluate electroacupuncture (EA) in a rodent model of OA such that conclusions regarding its effectiveness for symptom or disease modification could be drawn. Methods: Ten 12-month-old male Hartley guinea pigs—which characteristically have moderate to advanced OA at this age—were randomly assigned to receive EA for knee OA (n = 5) or anesthesia only (control group, n = 5). Treatments were performed three times weekly for 3 weeks, followed by euthanasia 2 weeks later. Gait analysis and enclosure monitoring were performed weekly to evaluate changes in movement. Serum was collected for inflammatory biomarker testing. Knee joints were collected for histology and gene expression. Results: Animals receiving EA had significantly greater changes in movement parameters compared to those receiving anesthesia only. There was a tendency toward decreased serum protein concentrations of complement component 3 (C3) in the EA group compared to the control group. Structural and antioxidant gene transcripts in articular cartilage were increased by EA. There was no significant difference in total joint histology scores between groups. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that EA has a positive effect on symptom, but not disease, modification in a rodent model of OA. Further investigations into mechanistic pathways that may explain the efficacy of EA in this animal model are needed.",

The target population for this single-center prospective cohort study were military beneficiaries at a medical treatment facility located at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Participants who met inclusion criteria were treated with BFA in addition to routine standard care for pain (n = 69). The control group was composed of participants who received routine standard care only without BFA (n = 27). Pain was assessed by a self-reported pain scale (0-10) at the time of encounter, immediately after BFA (for the intervention group), then at 24 and 48 h afterwards.Mean pain for the intervention group decreased from 5.45 before BFA to 3.29 immediately following BFA to 2.21 at 24 h and to 2.10 at 48 h (p < 0.001). Thus, at all three post-treatment time points, mean decrease in pain surpassed a two-point reduction, deemed to be a clinically important difference. The BFA group had a greater reduction in pain compared to the no intervention group at 24 h (3.14 vs 0.59, p < 0.001) and at 48 h (3.26 vs 0.96, p < 0.001). Four intervention group participants (6%) reported an adverse reaction (three with pain at the insertion site) or complication (one with superficial infection).BFA provided by Internal Medicine residents appears to be a safe and effective adjunct therapy for pain management in an outpatient setting, but requires further validation by randomized controlled trials.",

EA and MLS were performed at bilateral ST36 or LI4. The expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was detected in local cutaneous tissues at the site of ST36 and LI4 by immunohistochemical staining.

The results of EA and MLS at LI4 were in parallel with those at ST36. In plasma, compared with the control group, the level of CORT increased after EA at ST36, while both ACTH and CORT were markedly increased after 43.5°C MLS. For LI4, plasma CRF and CORT increased after EA, while the levels of all three hormones increased following 43.5°C MLS.

    "abstract": "The use of visual illusions to study how the brain gives rise to a representation of the body has produced surprising results, particularly in relation to modulation of pain. It seems likely that this research has relevance to how we understand acupuncture analgesia. Acupuncture supplies several different kinds of signal to the brain: touch in the preliminary examination for tender areas; needle stimulation, mainly of Aδ fibres; and sometimes visual input from the patient's sight of the needle insertion. In the light of recent research, all these are likely to modulate pain. There are implications here for clinical practice and for research. Acupuncture may be more effective if patients can see the needles being inserted. The use of non-penetrating stimuli to the skin or minimal needle insertion at non-acupuncture points as control procedures becomes more than ever open to question and this, in turn, has relevance for claims that acupuncture is indistinguishable from placebo.",

    "abstract": "Objectives One theory about acupuncture suggests that pathological processes can cause measurable changes in electrical skin resistance (ESR) at acupuncture points (APs). Although the theory has yet to be proven, ESR measurements (ESRMs) form a frequently used part of contemporary acupuncture. The aim of this study was to test the so-called ‘electrical responsiveness’ of APs in the setting of a defined operative trauma. Methods ESRMs (n=424) were performed at the APs and surrounding skin of GB34 and ST38 in 163 participants using an impedance meter array developed for the purpose of ESRMs. For each group the percentage of measurements with a significantly different ESR between the APs and the surrounding skin was calculated and compared with each other. Measurements of four groups were compared: healthy control subjects (n=30) and patients after ophthalmic (n=29), hip (n=42) and shoulder (n=30) surgery. The influence of postoperative pain intensity was also assessed. Results Group comparison showed no significant differences for ST38. The ESRMs at GB34 had a significantly higher percentage of measurements with an increased ESR after ophthalmic (23.2%) and hip (22.2%) surgery, but not after shoulder surgery (7.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that an increase in pain intensity tended to lead to a decrease in the number of APs with ESR changes. Conclusion These results suggest that reactive changes in ESR at APs might exist. Pain and alertness seem to have an impact on ESR at APs. However, the current data do not allow for conclusions to be drawn concerning the clinical use of ESRMs.",

EA was performed at LI4 and LI10 contralaterally with stimulation beginning 20 min before SETT and lasting throughout SETT. The pharmacological interventions were given in a double-blind design 1 h before the SETT assessment. Results Subjects showed a hypoalgesic effect of the opiate and of the EA for subjective pain rating (EA p=0.0051; tramadol p=0.0299), and pain tolerance index (time/rating) (EA p=0.043; tramadol p=0.047) analysed using analysis of covariance. More subjects reached the strict time limit of 30 min (analysed by logistic regression and adjusted OR as a post-hoc analysis) under EA compared with most other experimental conditions. Only EA and tramadol were not significantly different (95% Wald confidence limits: non-treatment control vs EA 0.011 to 0.542; placebo pill vs EA 0.009 to 0.438; ibuprofen vs EA 0.021 to 0.766; tramadol vs EA 0.065 to 1.436).

In the first three subjects (group A) the intention was to insert acupuncture needles in the S3 and S4 foramina; in the remaining two subjects (group B) the intention was to insert acupuncture needles in the S2 and S3 foramina.CT scanning showed that in subject 1 of group A, the acupuncture needle intended for insertion in S3 was actually in the S4 foramen, and the acupuncture needle intended for insertion in S4 was actually distal to the sacral body. In subjects 2 and 3, the acupuncture needles were inserted accurately in the S3 and S4 foramina. In the three subjects who had acupuncture needles inserted in the S4 foramen, the tip of the acupuncture needle was an average distance of 6.0 mm from the rectum. The acupuncture needles inserted in subjects 4 and 5 of group B were inserted accurately into the S2 and S3 foramina.Inserting acupuncture needles into the sacral foramina of S2 and S3 at an angle of about 60° has the potential to be used for sacral nerve modulation by repeated electroacupuncture stimulation. Needling may be less accurate in subjects with higher body mass index. Because of the potential risk of perforating the rectum with the needle, this technique must be used by specialists only.2013-026.",

Spondylosis, the universal outcome of age, wear and tear, is probably the most common cause of neuropathic pain. By irritating nerve roots, spondylosis can lead to peripheral neuropathy and muscle shortening. Many myofascial syndromes (from Achilles Tendonitis to Tennis Elbow) caused by muscle shortening of spondylotic origin are customarily misconstrued as mundane local conditions. The spondylosis and muscle-shortening model can explain many musculoskeletal pain problems for which there is no alternative clinical diagnosis; it also enables these disparate syndromes to be grouped under one aetiological classification. Intramuscular stimulation effectively relieves pain by releasing muscle, which in turn relieves paraspinal muscle shortening and pressure on nerve roots, as well as stimulating the production of platelet-derived growth factor to promote healing.",

In order to simplify the Western medical usage of acupuncture, the author offers a composite view of needling techniques in which the term “Acupuncture treatment area” (ATA) refers to any suitable site of needle insertion. This may be a single traditional point, it may be a local painful area, a distant strong point, the periosteum around a joint, or it could be a large area of subcutaneous tissue, as in the lower abdomen.

For those who have integrated complementary practices into their work within the National Health System, issues of registration and regulation add a further complication. The publication of the Department of Health consultation document on proposals for statutory regulation of herbal medicine and acupuncture in March 2004 raises issues of particular significance for medically qualified practitioners (such as ‘medical acupuncturists’), and other health professionals whose practice includes complementary skills. This paper focuses on the educational implications of these recent developments and offers an informed perspective that includes a reflection on how education and training (as initial training and as continuing professional development) can best meet the needs of acupuncture practitioners in this fast-changing environment.",

For chronic back pain, exercise, pain management programmes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, and trigger point and ligament injections are also recommended. There appears to be increasing evidence in favour of the use of acupuncture. Acupuncture appears to be useful to treat back pain, but patients should probably be advised to take advantage of any pain relief obtained to maintain or increase their activity. Acupuncturists must be aware of the psychosocial dimensions of back pain, as well as the physical ones, and should be careful to educate their patients about the condition and not make them become dependent on acupuncture to treat every acute episode.",

The paper appears to show that there is a significantly reduced threshold and increased amplitude of an electrophysiological reflex (similar to the Hoffman (H-) reflex) when it is stimulated electrically from within an MTrP compared with normal muscle nearby.\n\nIt appears to be the first paper in which an electrophysiological reflex similar to the H-reflex has been recorded following an intramuscular electrical stimulus. The important finding of the paper is that the amplitude of this reflex as a proportion of the maximum direct muscle stimulus effect (measured peak to peak from the M-wave—the electromyography (EMG) recording of the direct muscle or motor nerve stimulus) appears to be significantly greater when elicited from within an MTrP than from within normal muscle tissue (non-MTrP).\n\nThe H-reflex was first described in 1910 by the German physiologist Paul Hoffmann.2 It is an electrophysiological equivalent of the stretch reflex (usually elicited as a tendon jerk in the physical examination), but it bypasses the muscle spindle.3 It is used in research as a non-invasive neurophysiological probe …",

Methods A randomised controlled double-blinded trial was performed. 48 healthy volunteers (94 eyes) were randomly allocated to three groups: acupuncture group—19 subjects (38 eyes) were submitted to a 20 min session of acupuncture (GB1, GB14 and BL1); sham group—14 subjects (27 eyes) were submitted to a 20 min session of acupuncture with needles inserted in false points; and control group—15 subjects (29 eyes) who underwent no intervention. All subjects had the IOP measured by a masked investigator using Goldmann applanation tonometry immediately before intervention, as well as 20 min and 24 h after. Results The mean (SD) IOP in the acupuncture group was 17.9 (3.3) mm Hg at baseline, 16.4 (3.9) mm Hg at 20 min and 16.3 (3.3) mm Hg at 24 h. The mean (SD) IOP in the sham group was 18.6 (3.3) mm Hg at baseline, 17.7 (2.6) mm Hg at 20 min and 15.9 (3.6) mm Hg at 24 h. The mean (SD) IOP in the control group was 16.9 (3.5) mm Hg at baseline, 16.5 (3.8) mm Hg at 20 min and 15.8 (3.3) mm Hg at 24 h. There was no statistically significant difference in the IOP variation (post-intervention minus baseline measurements) between groups after 20 min (p=0.13) and 24 h (p=0.21). Conclusion Acupuncture in the studied points did not produce significant short-term effect on the IOP of healthy individuals in comparison with control groups.

The main outcome measure for depressive symptoms was Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). For pain/myalgia, patients rated their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. Patients with a score greater than the cut-off point in either score were allocated to acupuncture treatment. The Chinese method of acupuncture was used.

Methods A randomised placebo-controlled single-blind trial was conducted in 36 healthy volunteers randomly distributed to control (no treatment), conventional acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups. The subjects were blind to the group allocation. The authors measured before and after treatment the pain threshold with the Painmatcher (Cefar Medical AB, Lund, Sweden) and the cold tolerance with the cold pressor test, together with the Visual Analogue Scale pain score. Results Electrical stimulation threshold and cold pressor tolerance both increased significantly in the control and the true acupuncture groups, but not the sham group. The changes in the true acupuncture group were highly statistically significant and amounted to 24% (pain threshold) and 44% (cold tolerance) increases in threshold. The changes in the true group were significantly greater than the control group but not significantly different from the sham group. The changes in the sham and control groups were not significantly different from each other. Conclusion Acupuncture at true, appropriate points was more effective than no intervention in raising pain threshold and tolerance in volunteers, and acupuncture at inappropriate points had an intermediate effect which was not significantly different from either. Thus acupuncture analgesia may not be a point specific effect.",

Methods: 90 animals were divided into three groups: C, control; A, acupuncture treatment (needled at traditional acupuncture points BL13, BL17 and ST36); M, moxibustion treatment (overlying same traditional acupuncture points). They were euthanased on days 7, 14 and 21 after injury for removal and preparation of tissue for analysis. Results: The treated groups (A and M) showed no changes regarding the structural analysis relative to the control (C) group. The total number of fibroblast cells in the A and M groups were significantly higher than those in the C group on days 14 and 21. The number of granulocytes was significantly less in the A and M groups compared with the C group on days 14 and 21. The total number of newly formed vessels increased on day 21 and was significantly higher in the A and M groups. The amount of birefringent collagen fibre detected on day 21 was significantly higher in the C group. The amount of glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline was similar between the groups. The amount of collagen I did not differ between the groups in any period, despite the increased amount detected over time. The amount of type III collagen did not differ between the groups but the detected amount decreased over the course of the experiment. The amount of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the A and M rats was similar but inferior to C rats across all experimental periods.

However, the mechanisms responsible for other cardiovascular changes induced by acupuncture, such as its effects on stroke volume (SV) and blood pressure (BP), remain obscure. Objective: To evaluate continuously the comprehensive cardiovascular changes occurring during acupuncture. Method: 20 healthy men participated in the study. HR, SV and BP were measured in the supine position using electrocardiogram, transthoracic impedance cardiography and continuous non-invasive finger blood pressure, respectively. Manual acupuncture stimulation using a stainless steel needle was performed at LI10 for 60 s after resting periods of approximately 15 min. Results: HR was reduced and SV increased, in parallel, during the period of acupuncture stimulation (P&lt;0.01, respectively). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased in the 10 s period of acupuncture stimulation compared with the 120 s pre-stimulation period (P&lt;0.01) and recovered close to the pre-stimulation reading instantly after the transient reduction. No change was observed in cardiac output (CO) derived from HR and SV. Conclusions: This study indicates that HR reduction during acupuncture does occur, as previous reports have indicated. SV increased during acupuncture stimulation in parallel with HR reduction and CO was maintained during these changes. Any reduction in DBP caused by acupuncture recovered to baseline, likely due to baroreflexes.",

Methods: This prospective, randomised, parallel-group, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted at a Chinese medicine centre in Hong Kong between May 2018 and February 2019. Eighty eligible community-dwelling subjects with PHP (mean age 59.7 years; 85% female) were equally randomised to receive EAWN therapy or remain on a waitlist. The treatment group received six 30-min sessions of standardised EAWN therapy over 4 weeks; the control group received no treatment. The outcome measures were the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for first-step pain, foot function index (FFI) scores and global rating of change (GRC) scale scores. Assessments were made at baseline, week 2 and week 4 (primary endpoint). The treatment group underwent additional assessments at week 8. Outcomes were evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Patients who received EAWN therapy exhibited greater improvements in the mean first-step pain VAS and all FFI scores than did those in the control group at weeks 2 and 4, with significant between-group differences (all P &lt; 0.001). Compared with baseline, there were significant decreases in mean first-step pain VAS scores at weeks 2 and 4, and FFI scores at week 4, in the treatment group but not in the control group. The improvements in the treatment group continued until week 8. GRC scores at week 4 indicated improvement in all treated patients and only 22.5% of the control group patients ( P &lt; 0.001). There were no study-related adverse events. Conclusion: EAWN therapy could be an effective treatment for PHP in middle-aged and older adults.

Our concern is that the authors conclude that “acupuncture may not be effective beyond placebo”, which we think is based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nDundee, who pioneered the use of acupuncture for postoperative nausea and vomiting, found that the timing of the treatment is critical. Acupuncture must be administered before the anaesthetic (around the time of the pre-anaesthetic) rather than just before or after induction of anaesthesia.2 Reviewers have commented on this as a prerequisite for the effectiveness of the treatment, since it is thought that general anaesthesia can block the effect of acupuncture, as can the use of local anaesthetics.3 …",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is a traditional therapy that stimulates specific acupuncture points on the human body. The number of users of acupuncture worldwide has steadily increased over the last 40 years.1 Acupuncture is thought to function in a therapeutic manner through homeostatic mechanisms, according to traditional literature. Thus, opposing symptoms such as hypertension and hypotension can be treated through acupuncture administered at the same points. For example, acupuncture at Bahui (GV20) has been shown to be effective in treating both hypertension and hypotension.2 In addition, acupuncture elicits a more effective response when it is applied to a pathological condition rather than during normal physiological status. Acupuncture at LI4 and PC6 reduces heart rate variability in a fatigued state, but it has no effect in normal state volunteers.3\n\nHerein we present additional clinical data supporting the idea that the effect of acupuncture is dependent on the participant's pathophysiological conditions.

    "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether a patient's preference for a doctor's face is associated with better assessments of relational empathy in the patient–doctor relationship after the first clinical consultation. Methods A total of 110 patients enrolled in a traditional Korean medical clinic participated in the study. Patients’ preference for doctors’ faces was assessed by a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, with 60 different pairs of six different Asian male doctors’ faces. One of the six doctors then carried out the initial clinical consultation for these patients. The patient–doctor relationship was assessed using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure. Results The data of all patients’ simulated preferences for a doctor's face and their assessment values of a doctor's relational empathy was compared, and no significant correlation was found between both values (r=−0.024, p&gt;0.809). Conclusions These findings suggest that the perceived empathy in the patient–doctor relationship is not influenced by the patient's preference for a certain doctor's face. The first impression of a doctor is often determined by his appearance and look. However, whether or not the patient particularly prefers a doctor's face does not seem to matter in developing a good patient–doctor relationship.",

These phenomena, although evoked within a matter of minutes, can outlast the surgical tissue injury for several hours or days and drive acute postoperative pain until the surgical wound has healed. 4 Pre-emptive analgesia is a treatment that prevents establishment of the altered sensory processing that amplifi es postoperative pain. The treatment should cover the entire duration of high-intensity noxious stimulation that can lead to establishment of central and peripheral sensitisation caused by incisional and associated infl ammatory injuries. Of these two injuries, the associated infl ammatory reactions are probably of greater clinical signifi cance. 5 Two approaches have been used to reveal pre-emptive analgesia. One is to demonstrate a reduction in pain intensity and/or analgesic use beyond the period during which an effective concentration of a drug is maintained in the vicinity of its site of action. This approach is based on a study design comparing preoperative treatment and non-treatment groups. The other approach is to prove that a treatment applied before surgery is more effective than the same treatment provided at the end of surgery. The latter has become the most common study design for preemptive analgesia. 6",

The members of this structure-related family of proteases, comprising more than 25 members, differ from each other, particularly in their location in the cell and the specificity of substrate proteolysis. The gelatinases, referred to as MMP-2 and MMP-9, are the main contributors to many cardiovascular diseases.1 For example, by degrading extracellular proteins such as collagen and elastin, MMP-2 triggers proliferation and migration of many cell types, thus favouring conditions ranging from angiogenesis and embryogenesis to hypertension, aortic aneurysm, inflammation and cancer.2\n\nTo protect MMPs from abnormal autoproteolysis or uncontrolled tissue degradation, MMPs are synthesised with an autoinhibitory propeptide which binds its cysteine thiol to the zinc ion in the catalytic domain. As soon as MMPs are secreted from cells the cysteine–zinc bond is disrupted by other proteases or by oxidising compounds, setting free the catalytic domain.1 Tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are the main inhibitors of MMP activity and bind to the catalytic site of MMPs non-covalently in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio.

We report a case of LCPD that was treated late and had a poor prognosis, but improved significantly during a prolonged course of acupuncture. A 12-year-old boy reported to an orthopaedic clinic in 2006 with limping and was diagnosed with LCPD. Surgeons applied orthosis without improvement and decided to perform surgery in 2008. However, the parents declined the surgical option and took the boy to an acupuncture clinic the same year. Needle acupuncture for 20 min and laser acupuncture locally on the hip joint area for 5 min were applied. After 30 sessions of acupuncture, the boy started to improve clinically. Imaging studies showed that new bone cells started to develop in the femoral head. After 130 sessions in 2010 the radiographic appearance showed almost 90% improvement, and after 196 sessions, in August 2012, he was fully recovered.

The objectives of the present study were to investigate whether acupuncture point sensations were experienced during acu-TENS, and whether such sensations were associated with any concomitant changes in autonomic nervous system activity. Methods This study adopted a single-blinded, randomised, controlled trial methodology. A total of 36 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group (acu-TENS on right LI4 and LI11 points); control group (acu-TENS to bilateral kneecaps); or placebo group (sham acu-TENS on right LI4 and LI11 points). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), SD of the NN interval (SDNN) and low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF) were measured before, during and after intervention. The Hong Kong Chinese version of the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (C-MMASS) index was used for quantifying the acupuncture point stimulation sensations. Results The experimental group showed a significant increase in HR (mean (SD) 73.5 (6.3) to 75.9 (6.7) bpm, p=0.027), MAP (88.5 (4.5) to 91.0 (4.1) mm Hg, p=0.004), SDNN (143.36 (8.58) to 153.69 (7.64) ms, p=0.002) and LF/HF (1.26 (0.19) to 1.31 (0.21), p=0.037) during the intervention. The control group showed a significant increase in SDNN (140.21 (8.72) to 143.39 (9.47) ms, p=0.009) and LF/HF (1.21 (0.09) to 1.23 (0.12), p=0.033). There were no significant physiological changes in the placebo group. Overall C-MMASS indices for the experimental, control and placebo groups were 3.23 (0.3), 2.14 (0.6) and 0.29 (0.32), respectively. The between-group difference was statistically significant (F=139.24, df=2, p&lt;0.05). However, correlation analysis did not support any association between sensation intensity and physiological responses in any groups (γ ranged from −0.36 to 0.25). Conclusions This study showed that ‘acupuncture point sensations’ were experienced during acu-TENS to LI4 and LI11, but such sensations were not associated with physiological responses induced during the stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Aims To analyse the cost effectiveness of using the moxibustion technique to correct non-vertex presentation and to reduce the number of caesarean sections performed at term. Method A deterministic model of decision analysis has been developed to analyse the cost of treatment in which heat is applied by moxibustion (the combustion of Artemisia vulgaris) at acupuncture point BL67 for pregnant women with non-vertex fetal position at 33–35 weeks’ gestation. This approach was compared with conventional treatment recommendations based on the knee-chest posture technique. The costs were obtained mainly from data provided by the Andalusian Public Health System. Effectiveness data for the baseline analysis were taken from a previous clinical study. A secondary analysis was performed based on a meta-analysis conducted using random effects analysis, by reference to studies published in recent systematic reviews of moxibustion versus conventional treatment, in order to make the results generalisable to other healthcare settings. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed under diverse assumptions to assess the uncertainty of the result. Results The baseline analysis shows that the application of moxibustion prevents 8.92% of deliveries with non-vertex presentation compared with conventional treatment, with an average cost saving of ¢107.11 per delivery, mainly due to the cost saving from avoiding the need for caesarean section. The meta-analysis revealed a relative risk of the version of non-vertex presentation at term of 0.34 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.76). The sensitivity analysis showed that moxibustion can avoid 0.34 caesarean sections, with an incremental cost per delivery ranging from ¢68 to −¢640 for moxibustion versus conventional treatment. Conclusions Moxibustion treatment applied at acupuncture point BL67 can avoid the need for caesarean section and achieve cost savings for the healthcare system in comparison with conventional treatment.",

Methods Sixty-three healthy students and staff members were recruited through convenience sampling. First, real or sham acupuncture was randomly administered to the left LI4 point while subjects could not observe the needle tip. A real or sham needle tip was then shown to the subjects. Finally, a random combination of real or sham acupuncture needles were randomly administered to the left and right LI4 points, this time with the subjects observing the procedure. In all conditions the subjects gave their judgement as Yes or No in response to questions asking them to identify the needle type. The proportion of correct judgements (P(C)) was computed for the last part of the trial in left and right LI4 points, and the rates of correctly identified needles for each trial were obtained. Results The subjects’ accuracy of discrimination between the real and sham acupuncture needles in left and right LI4 points was not significantly different from that based on pure guess (P(C)=0.50 (chance level)), which indicates complete inability to discriminate between needles. The rates of correctly identified needles using touch, vision and a combination of both senses were not significantly different (p=0.807). Conclusions The findings from this study show that this sham acupuncture device successfully blinded subjects to real and sham press needles, suggesting that it is effective for subject blinding in studies on acupuncture using press needles, and facilitating evaluation of the effects of acupuncture in placebo-controlled trials using a rigorous scientific research methodology.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be effective at improving hyperandrogenism and follicular arrest in PCOS; however, its mechanism of action remains to be deciphered.In this study, we investigated whether EA improved follicular development in an obese rat model of PCOS and regulated the expression of adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).EA was administered at CV3, CV4 and ST40. Changes in body weight, paraovarian fat, estrus cycle, ovarian morphology, levels of related hormones, and glucose and lipid metabolism were evaluated. In addition, protein and mRNA expression of adiponectin, AMPK and ACC was measured.The body weight and paraovarian fat of rats in the EA group were reduced, while estrus cyclicity and ovarian morphology improved. Levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced in the EA group, as well as blood glucose levels. Furthermore, levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone were reduced in the EA group, while estradiol levels were increased. Protein and mRNA expression of adiponectin, AMPKα1 and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was found to be increased in the EA group, while protein and mRNA expression of ACC were significantly reduced.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that EA improved follicular development and metabolism and regulated expression levels of adiponectin, AMPKα1, LKB1 and ACC in our obese rat model of PCOS.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sepsis is defined as organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled response to infection and is followed by a high incidence of cognitive dysfunction, which can severely affect patients’ quality of life. Previous studies have suggested that electroacupuncture (EA) is protective against sepsis-associated cognitive dysfunction and that pyroptosis plays a vital role in cognitive function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EA on cognition and neuronal pyroptosis in a mouse model of sepsis. Methods: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Mice were randomly divided into three groups (control, CLP and CLP + EA). EA was performed at bilateral ST36 for three consecutive days after the surgery. The 7-day survival rate of each group was observed on the seventh day after the surgery. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to test cognitive function from the 8th to 12th day after the surgery. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to determine the structural integrity of hippocampal neuronal membranes and the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampal tissues, respectively. Expression of nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1), caspase-1 and gasdermin-D (GSDM D) in hippocampal CA1 neurons was detected by Western blotting and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and caspase-1 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Compared with the CLP group, 7-day survival rates and cognitive function were significantly improved in the CLP + EA group. After EA treatment, the integrity of the hippocampal CA1 neuronal membrane and mortality of hippocampal neurons were significantly decreased, and expression of NLRP1, caspase-1 and GSDM D was downregulated. Conclusion: EA can alleviate cognitive dysfunction and neuronal pyroptosis in septic mice.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in drinkers with chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial across multiple centers, involving 224 drinkers. Patients received either acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as participants who had a reduction of 6 points or more from baseline in the National Institute of Health—Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) total score at weeks 8 and 32. Secondary outcomes measures included the Global Response Assessment (GRA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5). Results: One hundred and twelve drinkers were included in each group (n = 224 in total). The proportion of responders in terms of NIH-CPSI was 58.9% versus 40.3% in the acupuncture group (AG) and sham acupuncture group (SAG), respectively, with a statistically significant difference of 18.6% ( p = 0.002) at week 8. Higher proportions of responders with respect to NIH-CPSI ( p &lt; 0.001 at week 32) and GRA ( p &lt; 0.001 at week 8 and p = 0.01 at week 32) were observed in the AG compared with the SAG. No between-group differences were found in the changes in IPSS at any assessment time point. Changes in IIEF-5 score were significantly higher in the AG than in the SAG at weeks 20 and 32, while the difference was not statistically significant at week 8. Conclusion: Acupuncture appeared to alleviate the symptoms of pain among drinkers with CP/CPPS and improve their quality of life, but had no demonstrable effect on urinary tract symptoms or erectile function among these patients.

    "abstract": "Objective: Neuropathic pain can be provoked by high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) activation of toll-like receptor (TLR)4/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported to effectively alleviate neuropathic pain with few side effects, but its precise mechanism of action remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore whether 2 Hz EA stimulation suppresses TLR4/NF-κB signaling in the DRG following spared nerve injury (SNI) in a rat model. Methods: In this experiment, SNI rats were given 2 Hz EA once every other day for a total of 21 days. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was measured to assess SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, and western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence staining were used to determine the levels of pain-related signaling molecules and pro-inflammatory mediators in the DRG. Results: SNI up-regulated HMGB1, TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor-88 adaptor protein (MyD88) and NF-κB p65 protein expression in the DRG. In addition, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that SNI induced higher levels of TLR4 and MyD88 in the DRG. We also demonstrated co-localization of TLR4 and MyD88 with both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and isolectin GS-IB4 in the DRG of SNI rats, respectively. Meanwhile, 2 Hz EA stimulation effectively reversed the elevations of HMGB1, TLR4, MyD88 and NF-κB p65 induced by SNI in the DRG, which was coupled with amelioration of SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Conclusions: The results of this study suggested that inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the DRG by 2 Hz EA might be exploited as a therapeutic option for neuropathic pain.",

One group (15 patients) had treatment sessions lasting 20min, and the second group (13 patients) had treatment for only 5min. A visual analogue score (VAS) was used to measure the levels of pain before treatment, at the end of a ten week course of weekly acupuncture treatments and again after 6 months. The results showed that patients in both groups had a good response, both short and long term, to acupuncture, and that there was no significant difference in benefit between the groups at the end of their course of treatment or after 6 months. However, this may not necessarily mean that the shorter time of stimulation can be used in preference to the more traditional longer treatment sessions, as there was an imbalance between groups in the pre-treatment VAS and the trial size was inadequate to give a reliable result. There was good clinical tolerance and most patients were able to continue working during the course of treatment. There thus seems no benefit to be gained by advising patients to take sick leave during acupuncture treatment for neck and shoulder pain.",

Temperature changes were evaluated with the needles immersed in a test tube containing Ringer's solution, and electrical resistance was evaluated with a multimeter. The morphology of the needles, pre- and post-treatment, was examined with a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 600), and the composition of the needles was evaluated using RX diffusion with Oxford Instruments software.Ringer's solution contained in the test tubes examined did not present temperature changes. No changes were observed in the needles under investigation with respect to electrical resistance, morphology, or composition with a protocol applying 3-mA intensity for 3 s and three applications. However, important morphological alterations were observed that affected needle composition after 50 applications (at 3 mA for 3 s).PNE, applied according to conventional protocols, appeared to be safe and athermal, and did not provoke a loss of metal particles or modify the morphology of the needles used when studied in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Bone loss induced by microgravity is a serious problem in space flight. However, the effects of acupuncture stimulation on osteoporosis induced by microgravity have not been studied. With the goal of developing an effective countermeasure, our aim was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at BL20, BL23, and SP6 on osteoporosis induced by simulated microgravity in rats.Thirty male Wistar rats (aged 10 weeks) were randomly divided into three groups: healthy control group (CON, n = 10), hind limb unloading by tail-suspension group (T-S, n = 10), and EA treatment group (TRE, n = 10). Rats in the T-S and TRE groups were subjected to tail-suspension at -30° for 30 days, while the CON group experienced freedom of activity. In this period, the TRE group received EA treatment at BL20, BL23, and SP6 for 30 min every other day, which continued for 30 days. The microarchitecture of the proximal tibia and the biomechanical features of the femur in the rats were analyzed. In addition, the levels of serum biomarkers bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and osteocalcin (BGP) were measured.Compared with the CON group, the value of bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and trabecular number (Tb.N) of the tibias in the TRE group remarkably decreased (p < 0.01). However, these changes were markedly less than those of the T-S group after 4 weeks of EA treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, the serum concentration of BGP in the TRE group was also significantly higher than that of the T-S group (p < 0.05).These findings indicate that EA stimulation at BL20, BL23, and SP6 retards osteoporosis induced by hind limb unloading in rats.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain (NP) is a complex disease that remains challenging to treat. Low-frequency dense-and-disperse (DD) electroacupuncture (EA) has been used as adjuvant therapy for neuropathic pain; however, its analgesic effect decreases as stimulation time increases, or when it is repeatedly used. We hypothesized that a new frequency parameter could improve the effectiveness of EA, and aimed to compare the efficacy and duration of the analgesic effect between classic DD-EA and non-repetitive and non-sequential frequency (random frequency (RF)-EA) in neuropathic rats. Furthermore, the effect of RF-EA at local traditional acupuncture point locations versus auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS) was evaluated.Male Wistar rats with peripheral neuropathy were subjected to a single session of DD-EA or RF-EA for 20 or 40 min at ST36 + GB34. An additional group of rats was treated with RF-EA for 20 min using aVNS at the appropriate ear point locations. Paw pressure test, von Frey filaments and spontaneous pain scores were evaluated. Sham-operated rats were used as controls.In all, 20 min of RF-EA reversed hyperalgesia (for 24 h) and allodynia (for 8 h), showing a longer analgesic effect than DD-EA. Both RF-EA and DD-EA induced partial inhibition of spontaneous pain for 8 h. Forty minutes of DD-EA did not interfere with the NP phenomena; however, RF-EA induced significant long-term analgesia. aVNS induced an analgesic effect similar to local stimulation.This pilot study shows that RF-EA at both local traditional acupuncture point and auriculotherapy point locations induces long-lasting analgesia in neuropathic rats, and more effectively so than classical DD-EA.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of hot flushes and its impact on serum hormone levels in menopausal women.A total of 10 databases were searched from their inception to August 2018. Reference lists of reviews and included articles were also hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, or acupuncture versus hormone therapy (HT), as treatment for menopausal hot flushes were included. Outcomes included hot flush frequency, hot flush severity and serum hormone levels of estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 software.Thirteen RCTs including 1784 patients were selected, seven of which were available for meta-analysis. Compared with sham acupuncture, acupuncture significantly decreased hot flush frequency (mean difference (MD) -0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.64, -0.05], I2 = 54%) from baseline to the end of study, but did not impact end scores of hot flush frequency (MD 0.19, 95% CI [-0.61, 0.99], I2 = 0%) or severity (MD 0.02, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.17], I2 = 0%). No differences were found between acupuncture and HT in serum levels of E2 (MD 6.56, 95% CI [-3.77, 16.89], I2 = 76%), FSH (MD 1.06, 95% CI [-1.44, 3.56], I2 = 0%) or LH (MD -3.36, 95% CI [-13.37, 6.65], I2 = 89%).Acupuncture may not decrease hot flush frequency, but yet appears to have similar effects on serum hormone levels as HT, that is, increased E2 and decreased FSH and LH. Considering that no firm conclusions could be drawn due to the low quality and limited number of included trials included, further high-quality RCTs need to be conducted.",

    "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture has shown benefit in preventing migraine attacks, but there has been no clear recommendation about the number of treatment sessions that should be provided. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether 5 sessions of acupuncture treatment is non-inferior to 10 sessions for migraine. Methods: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial across five hospitals in Thailand. Migraine patients were randomly assigned into two groups: treatment with 5 sessions of acupuncture (group A) or 10 sessions of acupuncture (group B). Acupuncture was performed twice a week. We measured the number of migraine days, average pain severity according to a 0–10 numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, comparing 4 weeks after treatment versus baseline. Results: Of 156 patients, 83 and 73 patients were assigned to groups A and B, respectively. Comparing 4 weeks after treatment with baseline, the mean reduction in the number of headache days in groups A and B was 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8 to 7.9) days and 6.4 (95% CI 4.5 to 8.4) days, respectively (p = 0.97). The mean difference between the reduction in headache days of the two groups was −0.1 (95% CI −2.5 to 2.4) days, which included the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of −1. The mean reduction of NPRS scores in groups A and B was 4.5 (95% CI 3.8 to 5.1) and 3.8 (95% CI 3.1 to 4.5), respectively (p = 0.17). Both groups showed an improvement in quality of life. Conclusion: Both 5 and 10 sessions of acupuncture were associated with apparent benefits in terms of preventing migraine attacks, reducing the severity of the headache and improving quality of life, based on comparisons between baseline and follow-up in both study groups. Although we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of 5 sessions versus 10 sessions of acupuncture, the effects in the two groups were not significantly different and the temporal effects appeared to last for at least 1 month.

Although acupuncture is a frequently used therapy for musculoskeletal complaints, little is known about the effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Objectives The aim of this study was to (i) compare the HRQoL of patients undergoing routine acupuncture treatment for musculoskeletal complaints with a Dutch population sample; (ii) investigate changes in HRQoL during the course of acupuncture treatment. Methods An observational study of 26 patients between 18 and 65 years of age in a single acupuncture practice was performed. HRQoL was measured on eight functional domains using a RAND-36 health survey at baseline and after six and 12 treatment sessions. Baseline RAND-36 scores were compared to data from a Dutch population sample (n=1063) using t test, and longitudinal data were analysed using repeated measurement analyses. Results At baseline, patients had significantly lower RAND-36 scores compared to the Dutch population sample for three domains: role-physical limitations (51.9 vs 79.4; p&lt;0.001), bodily pain (49.3 vs 79.5; p&lt;0.001) and social functioning (75.5 vs 86.9; p=0.005). During the course of treatment, RAND-36 scores increased significantly for five domains: physical functioning (79.3 vs 97.4; p&lt;0.001), role-physical functioning (51.4 vs 94.1; p&lt;0.001), bodily pain (47.3 vs 95.7, p&lt;0.001), social functioning (74.5 vs 92.0, p&lt;0.001) and vitality (69.1 vs 85.7; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The observed improvements in HRQoL suggest a subjective, clinically relevant, benefit of routine acupuncture therapy in treating musculoskeletal complaints.",

    "abstract": "Whether, or how far, acupuncture effects can be explained as due to the placebo response is clearly an important issue, but there is an underlying philosophical assumption implicit in much of the debate, which is often ignored. Much of the argument is cast in terms which suggest that there is an immaterial mind hovering above the brain and giving rise to spurious effects. This model derives from Cartesian dualism which would probably be rejected by nearly all those involved, but it is characteristic of “folk psychology” and seems to have an unconscious influence on much of the terminology that is used. The majority of philosophers today reject dualism and this is also the dominant trend in science. Placebo effects, on this view, must be brain effects. It is important for modern acupuncture practitioners to keep this in mind when reading research on the placebo question.",

The medical history revealed that at age of four the patient developed her first episode of rheumatic fever, without obsessive-compulsive behaviour. However, the patient showed symptoms compatible with Sydenham’s chorea such as choreiform movements, hypotonia, motor agitation, loss of coordination, gait disturbances and impediment of speech, associated with joint pain, most prominent in at the temporo-mandibular joint. The patient has been treated since then with haloperidol. Therefore, during the two pregnancies she presented an exacerbation of her previous symptoms of Sydenham’s chorea, which is a very common finding, reporting mainly limitation in the opening of mouth associated with pain and clicks in the temporo-mandibular joint. It is important to emphasise that she did not stopped taking the medication during the pregnancies. Additionally, the pregnancy proceeds normally with any recurrence of the chorea and complications, and her daughters are not affected by any disease.\n\nThe conventional treatment for temporo-mandibular joint pain (occlusal splint) was not able to reduce these symptoms exacerbated during the pregnancies so five years after the second pregnancy the dental department referred her to the acupuncture treatment.\n\nAn evaluation of the patient’s disease history revealed that the …",

Limitations of these devices include potential inaccuracy of measurement, as the distribution of muscle stiffness may be heterogeneous, as well as inability to visualise the muscle. Furthermore, changes in muscle stiffness during acupuncture needling cannot be evaluated. An ultrasound-based shear wave imaging technique has recently been developed to measure muscle stiffness.3 Benefits of using ultrasound include the ability to visualise the muscle under investigation and to quantify changes in muscle stiffness over time. Ultrasound as an imaging modality has many potential uses in acupuncture research and education,4 and can be successfully used to explore its physiological and physical effects.5 The aim of this study was to measure the effects of acupuncture needling on muscle stiffness using shear wave elastography.\n\n### Acupuncture needle insertion\n\nWe performed acupuncture needle insertion on two healthy volunteers (one male, one female) who were part of the study team.

    "abstract": "By reviewing the assessment of internal validity in relevant systematic reviews (SRs), the aim of this study was to identify how critical appraisals of risk of bias (RoB) inform the synthesis of evidence in SRs of acupuncture for pain relief.SRs were searched in Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of SRs from their inception to 30 December 2014. Only SRs of acupuncture for pain relief were included. Basic information, types of RoB appraisal tool, whether or not there was domain-level assessment of RoB, whether or not the reviews ranked studies by RoB, plus whether or not (and, if so, how) RoB appraisal was incorporated into the synthesis were determined.A total of 91 SRs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Over half of the SRs (85, 64.8%) used standard tools, such as the Jadad quality score and the Cochrane RoB tool, followed by adapted tools (n=23, 25.3%). Of the 85 SRs that assessed RoB, 29 (34.1%) presented domain-level assessment and 71 SRs (83.5%) included ranking of the studies based on RoB assessment. Of these 71, 35 (49.4%) used a cut-off threshold score and 26 (36.6%) required all criteria sum-up. Of the 85 SRs that assessed RoB, 48 (56.5%) incorporated RoB appraisal into the data synthesis.Although most SRs of acupuncture for pain relief conducted some form of RoB assessment, nearly half of them failed to incorporate the RoB assessment into the synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture at Erjian on chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).Prospective case series.Nine patients with chronic CSC were recruited and each patient received 12 sessions of acupuncture treatment. Subjective symptom measures included complications, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein leakage (via fluorescein fundus angiography), and central subfield foveal subretinal fluid (on optical coherence tomography (OCT)) at 3 months. Successful treatment was defined as the complete resolution of subretinal fluid observed by the OCT following completion of treatment.After 2 months of treatment, two patients showed improvements in visual acuity, a significant reduction in subretinal fluid and an improvement in BCVA to 0.5±0.10 (mean±SD). By contrast, four patients experienced no significant changes. After 3 months of treatment, four patients showed improvements in visual acuity and complete resolution of the subretinal fluid (mean BCVA=0.6), while parameters in two patients remained unchanged. Compared to baseline (before treatment), the proportions of patients experiencing visual improvement at 2 and 3 months were 33% (n=2) and 67% (n=4), respectively. No major complications were observed during the treatment course.Acupuncture might be a promising supplementary therapy for patients with CSC. However, this is ultimately only an exploratory study with a small sample size and no untreated comparator group to control for the natural history of the condition. Randomised controlled trials will be needed to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Background: High-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with a high symptom burden including sleep disturbance. Here we present the results of a secondary analysis of a randomized, sham-controlled trial assessing the effect of acupuncture on sleep quality during HSCT. Methods: Adult multiple myeloma patients undergoing inpatient and outpatient autologous HSCT were randomized and blinded to receive either true or sham acupuncture (by licensed acupuncturists) once daily for 5 days starting the day after chemotherapy. Sleep onset, total sleep time, sleep efficiency percentage and sleep-onset latency time were assessed using an actigraphy-based sleep monitor. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to compare the average area-under-the-curve of five acupuncture intervention days for each sleep outcome between groups, adjusted by baseline score and inpatient or outpatient chemotherapy stratum. Results: Over 32 months, 63 patients were enrolled. Participants undergoing true acupuncture experienced a significant improvement in sleep efficiency when compared to sham (−6.70, 95% CI −13.15, −0.25, p = 0.042). Subgroup analysis showed that the improvement was more prominent in the inpatient setting (−9.62, 95% CI −18.76, −0.47; p = 0.040). True acupuncture tended to improve wake time after sleep onset (WASO; −10.95, p = 0.054). Between-group differences in other sleep related variables were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our data suggest that true acupuncture may improve certain aspects of sleep, including sleep efficiency and possibly WASO, in multiple myeloma patients undergoing HSCT. By studying patient reported outcomes in future larger scale studies, acupuncture’s role in improving sleep quality during HSCT treatment could be further elucidated.

Protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is involved in the contraction of the detrusor muscle. Aims: To investigate whether PKA signaling mediates the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the excessive contraction of the bladder detrusor in NB. Methods: Sixty rats were randomly divided into control, sham, NB, NB + EA, and NB + EA + H89 (a PKA receptor antagonist) groups. The modified Hassan Shaker spinal cord transection method was used to generate a NB model. After EA intervention for one week, urodynamic tests were used to evaluate bladder function, hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to assess morphological changes, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the concentration of PKA, and Western blotting was conducted to measure the protein levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain kinase (p-MLCK)/p-MLC. Results: The results showed that NB resulted in morphological disruption, impairment of urodynamics, and decreases in the concentration of PKA and the protein levels of p-MLCK/p-MLC. EA reversed the changes induced by NB dysfunction. However, the improvement in urodynamics and the increases in the concentration of PKA and the protein levels of p-MLCK/p-MLC were inhibited by H89. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the PKA signaling pathway mediates the beneficial effect of EA on excessive contraction of the bladder detrusor in a rat model of NB.",

Ample experimental evidence exists for acupuncture to be considered as a modality of peripheral sensory stimulation, but present clinical research has not incontrovertibly validated the use of acupuncture on patients with chronic pain. A basic understanding of the neuro-physiology of pain and its differentiation does provide better indications for its use.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of acupressure and acupuncture at the Pericardium 6 (PC.6) point in relieving post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is well known. Lengthy manual stimulation of the needles, or electrostimulation, is inconvenient and incurs extra costs. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the antiemetic action of semi-permanent acupuncture needles (SPANs), a cheap and convenient method of administering acupuncture, in the first 48 hours following gynaecological surgery. Patients (n = 36) having total abdominal hysterectomy were studied in a randomised, placebo controlled trial. Study group patients had SPANs inserted in PC.6 on both wrists. The control group had SPANs inserted into sham points on their forearms. There was no difference in the median nausea scores between the groups; however six patients suffered moderate or severe nausea during the second 24 hours in the control group, with none in the study group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the nausea score between 8 and 24 hours in patients who had previously experienced PONV, was lower in the study group (median score 2) compared to the control group (median score 4) (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that the use of SPANs does not reduce the overall incidence of nausea and vomiting but does appear to reduce the severity of nausea in the second 24 hours, and has a greater effect on patients who had had nausea and vomiting after a previous anaesthetic.",

The articles consisted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials, and case series studies. The hypertension papers also involved some cohort studies. In general, sample sizes of these studies were small. Acupuncture in these papers was used as a secondary intervention for treating hypertension and as a tertiary intervention for stroke rehabilitation. The RCTs (the top of the hierarchy of evidence) of hypertension showed that acupuncture was not more effective than sham acupuncture or the anti-hypertensive drug, reserpine; however, all the case series suggested that acupuncture was an effective treatment. The RCT evidence for stroke showed that the effectiveness of acupuncture was similar to that of conventional treatment. The conclusion was that from the papers analysed there is insufficient evidence to show that acupuncture produces better results than other treatments for hypertension or stroke.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is an ancient therapy with a variety of different explanatory models. A cascade of physiologic effects has been reported, both in the peripheral and the central nervous system, following the insertion of a needle. Clinical trials testing the specific claims of acupuncture have generally tried to focus on testing the efficacy of applying specific techniques and/or specified points. However, different conditions may respond differently to different modes of stimulation. Also, insertion of needles into the body can stimulate effects not dependent on the locations of stimulation. Recently, it was demonstrated that both superficial and deep needling (with de qi/Hibiki) resulted in amelioration of patellofemoral pain and an increased feeling of wellbeing. One area in the brain that is affected by acupuncture stimulation is the limbic system. The limbic system consists of a group of brain structures, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and their interconnections, and connections with the hypothalamus, septal area, and portions of the tegmentum. It contains many of the centres related to emotion and reward. The pleasurable aspect of the acupuncture experience has largely been ignored as it has been considered to be part of its antinociceptive effects. It has previously been reported that physical exercise and electroacupuncture in animals result in modulation of the peptidergic content in limbic structures. These results are supported by recent animal studies in Japan that have clearly demonstrated that acupuncture results in the activation of the reward system. These findings are supported by positron emission tomography studies in patients, which showed that the insula ipsilateral to the site of needling was activated, as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and the midbrain. Taken together, these results suggest that acupuncture, as well as the patient's expectation and belief regarding a potentially beneficial treatment, modulate activity in the reward system.",

Rehabilitation of these injuries may therefore require extensive and innovative physical modalities and exercise activities that enhance mobility. Disuse in limbs can occur in any brain injury derived from different etiologies and advances in rehabilitation indicate that neuromuscular stimulation of both the nerve supply and muscle groups involved impacts plasticity and prepares the limbs for stronger muscle responses during functional activities. Combined therapies are apparently more productive than monotherapies and this may include electroacupuncture and functional electrical stimulation to expedite recovery. The combination of mixed physiotherapeutic interventions also encourages biokinetics, hydrotherapy and robotic rehabilitation over a prolonged period to enable the patient to achieve functional goals. Recovery may not be achieved within a period of 6 months post injury as has previously been accepted and may even require lifelong participation.",

    "abstract": "Background Evidence for the effect of minimal acupuncture in infants with colic is limited. Aim To compare the effect of standardized minimal acupuncture, individualized acupuncture (where traditional acupuncture points were chosen according to the infant’s symptoms) and no acupuncture on objective measures of stooling, feeding and sleeping in infants with colic (based on diaries) and perceived changes in these parameters (based on parental questionnaires). Methods This was a secondary analysis of a multicentre randomized controlled three-armed trial conducted in four counties in Sweden between January 2013 and May 2015 (ACU-COL). The effect on crying has already been published and showed a decrease in crying time for the acupuncture groups. Infants, 2–8 weeks old, who cried and fussed for more than 3 h/day for more than 3 days/week, and thereby fulfilled the criteria for infantile colic, received four extra visits to their ordinary child health centre. The infants (n = 147) were randomly allocated via a computer-generated list to standardized minimal acupuncture at LI4 for 5 s (group A, n = 48), semi-standardized individual acupuncture with a maximum of five insertions for up to 30 s (group B, n = 49), or no acupuncture (group C, n = 48). The parents and the ordinary staff were blinded. Data were collected using: (1) diaries at baseline, during the two intervention weeks and 1-week follow-up; and (2) questionnaires with quantitative and qualitative components used at the second and fourth visits and during a follow-up telephone call. Outcomes were the changes in frequency of stooling and in hours of sleep per day. Results There were no differences between groups for stooling, feeding, or sleeping at any time point according to data from the diaries. At the follow-up phone call, more parents in groups A and B (compared to group C) perceived that feeding and sleep had changed and that the symptoms of colic had improved.",

    "abstract": "Background The proportional method of acupuncture point location (APL) currently taught at Endeavor College of Natural Health and advocated by the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) was found to be imprecise and/or inaccurate in previous student studies. The ruler and elastic methods of APL were identified as more accurate or precise than the proportional method of APL but were not well received by student participants. Use of an adjustable ruler may overcome barriers to uptake of the more accurate APL methods. This pilot study was the first to evaluate the comparative accuracy of the adjustable ruler and the proportional methods of APL in first-year students at a major Australian acupuncture training college. Methods After 10 weeks of in-class instruction in both proportional and adjustable ruler methods of APL, student participants (n = 14) attempted location of three acupuncture points (LI10, SP6 and ST38) on a volunteer using both APL methods of interest. A self-administered questionnaire and lecturer field notes elucidated attitudes to implementation of both APL methods. Results Points marked using the adjustable ruler were closer to the correct location than those marked using the proportional method across all three acupuncture points. Students and lecturers rated the adjustable ruler more highly than the proportional method for ease of learning and ease of use. Conclusion Encouraging results with the adjustable ruler method warrant further larger scale studies. Use of the adjustable ruler method of APL should be considered for use in point location training at educational institutions teaching traditional acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cervical pain is a problem with a high prevalence of ~13% of the population, and is more common in women (16.5%). The most affected age group is 65–74 years. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of self-applied acupressure for decreasing benign-origin cervical pain, under the supervision of a health professional and in combination with usual treatment, as well as to examine its impact on the patient’s self-perceived health condition and their opinion of the technique. Methods: Pragmatic, multicenter, controlled clinical trial randomized by healthcare center. A total of 160 patients with benign-origin cervical pain between 18 and 65 years of age who attended primary care were included from 12 healthcare centers in the autonomous community of Madrid by consecutive sampling, and randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. The main outcome variable was pain intensity measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and secondary variables were self-perceived quality of life (EuroQol-5D utility index) and functional ability (neck disability index). An explanative model of generalized estimating equations was built taking into account the lack of independence among observations. The analysis was performed over 6 months. Results: In total, 150 patients completed the study. Mean age was 45 years (SD: 10.7), 86.7% were women, 86.2% were currently employed, and 57.9% did not perform any physical exercise. Average days experiencing pain was 32.9 (SD: 2.8) and 80% were undergoing previous pharmacological treatment. The quality of life utility index after 3 months was 1.6 points (95% CI: 0.54–2.71) higher in the intervention group. The pain score on the VAS was 0.16 points (95% CI: 0.80–0.48) lower in the intervention group. The health professional explained 10.4% of the reduction in pain observed on the VAS throughout the medical visits. Conclusion: Acupressure applied in addition to usual practice appeared to improve cervical pain in the long term. The effectiveness of this technique was partially explained by the health professional that trained the participants on technique application. Trial registration number:: NCT01855893",

Methods The participants consisted of 55 healthy individuals who had no known eye diseases or pupil abnormalities. Experiment 1 compared pupillary responses between acupuncture stimulation and no-stimulation groups under light adaptation. Experiment 2 compared pupillary responses to acupuncture between two conditions (dark and light adaptation) with a two-period repeated measurement crossover design. For both experiments the pupil diameter was continuously measured for 3 min before stimulation, during stimulation and for 3 min after stimulation. For all acupuncture stimulation interventions an acupuncture needle was inserted superficially at the TE5 acupuncture point followed by gentle tapping stimulation for 90 s. Results In experiment 1 the pupil diameter was significantly decreased during (p&lt;0.01) and after stimulation (p&lt;0.0001) compared with the pupil diameter before stimulation under light adaptation. No significant difference was noted in the serial changes in pupil diameter in the no-stimulation group. In experiment 2 the pupil diameter was significantly decreased 90 s after stimulation (p&lt;0.05) and 150 s after stimulation (p&lt;0.05) under light adaptation conditions. Furthermore, the pupil diameter was significantly decreased 120 s after stimulation (p&lt;0.05) and 150 s after stimulation (p&lt;0.01) under dark adaptation conditions. No significant difference in the serial changes in pupil diameter was noted between the groups. Conclusions This study shows that pupil constriction occurs following acupuncture stimulation under light adaptation and this response is no different from that seen under dark adaptation.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the electrically induced force and fatigue characteristics of muscle taut bands in rats. Muscle taut bands were dissected out and subjected to trains of electrical stimulation. The electrical threshold intensity for muscle contraction and maximum contraction force (MCF), electrical intensity dependent fatigue and electrical frequency dependent fatigue characteristics were assessed in three different sessions (n=10 each) and compared with non-taut bands in the biceps femoris muscle. The threshold intensity for muscle contraction and MCF at the 10th, 15th and 20th intensity dependent fatigue stimuli of taut bands were significantly lower than those of non-taut bands (all p<0.05). The MCF at the 15th and 20th intensity dependent fatigue stimuli of taut bands were significantly lower than those at the 1st and 5th stimuli (all p<0.01). The MCF in the frequency dependent fatigue test was significantly higher and the stimulus frequency that induced MCF was significantly lower for taut bands than for non-taut bands (both p<0.01). The present study demonstrates that the muscle taut band itself was more excitable to electrical stimulation and significantly less fatigue resistant than normal muscle fibres.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) meridians and points run vertically, reflecting their function in the Zhang-Fu system (meridian pattern). However, the trunk's spinal nerves show a traverse orientation, or a 'horizontal pattern'.The aim of the present work was to evaluate, via a cognitive quasiexperiment, whether the clinical indications of the points on the trunk are associated with their meridian function or with their innervation and visceral-somatic connection.The points in each dermatome of the trunk were considered crosswise, regardless of their meridians. The clinical indications for each point were differentiated into two mutually exclusive categories: (a) vertical distribution effect (VDE) or 'meridian pattern', when indications were quite different regarding the indications for the other points on the dermatome; and (b) transverse distribution effects (TDE) or 'horizontal pattern', represented by mainly local or segmental indications except for Shu-Mu points. After observing that the proportions between both categories often exceeded 60% in pilot samples, 60% was adopted as the reference value.A total of 22 dermatomes accommodated 148 points with 809 indications, of which 189 indications (23.4%) exhibited VDE features, whereas 620 (76.6%) exhibited TDE features.A TDE/VDE ratio of 3 : 1 implies that the clinical indications for the points of any dermatome on the torso are similar, regardless of their meridians, and suggests that most of the indications for trunk points involve a 'horizontal pattern' due to their neurobiological nature. These findings may help in understanding acupuncture's neurobiology and clarify some confusing results of clinical research, for example, excluding sham acupuncture as an inert intervention for future clinical trials.",

This raises the question of how much placebo effect is experienced by a patient with dementia.

    "abstract": "Acupuncture has been suggested as helpful in reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), but no controlled study has yet been published. The hypothesis of this randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, therefore, was that traditional Chinese acupuncture improves subjective as well as objective signs in this condition. Patients were included when suffering from clinically and scintigraphically confirmed acute RSD of the upper or lower limb, with a history between one and four months. They were randomly assigned to either traditional acupuncture (group A) or sham acupuncture (group S). Treatments were applied five times a week for three weeks, each session lasting for 30 minutes. Both groups received identical standard treatments in addition. The primary outcome variable had been pre-defined to be pain, as measured by visual analogue scale assessed before each treatment. Subjective success was also recorded by the patients on a rating scale. Due to force of circumstances, only 14 patients were entered into the study, therefore no test statistics could be performed and the data was evaluated descriptively. At baseline, pain was almost identical in both groups. During the course of the study, patients in group A demonstrated a more pronounced reduction of pain: 28.6% ± 1.9 vs 17.9% ± 2.4 (Mean ± SEM). Similarly, subjective success was rated to favour traditional acupuncture. It is concluded that acupuncture may be useful in the management of pain in patients with acute RSD, but that the present results are not conclusive. Larger, rigorous studies are required to answer the question.",

    "abstract": "European mistranslations of original Chinese texts have not merely introduced incorrect concepts to Western acupuncturists, but have adversely affected treatment methods. The French diplomat Soulie de Morant published an important treatise, “L'acuponcture Chinoise”, in 1939; this has formed the basis of Westernised “traditional” Chinese acupuncture. Because he had no medical background, he was unable to interpret the medical significance of traditional Chinese concepts in the texts that he had read. More, he could not see that a firm basis of medical knowledge is necessary for the reliable practise of acupuncture, thus unwittingly introducing acupuncture as a playground for lay therapists. The two most important mistranslations were: i. the use of “point” for Xue-wei, which would be better translated as “foramen” to give the impression of a three dimensional structure; and ii. Qi, which is a particularly difficult concept to translate, but is certainly not equivalent to the Western term “energy”. These errors have now been accepted into standard usage through their transcription into modern, Western language, Chinese textbooks. Western acupuncturists are mainly unaware of the substantial anatomical basis for the nomenclature in acupuncture, and indeed of the anatomical knowledge of the ancient Chinese physicians as expressed in original Chinese medical texts, examples of which are given in this paper.",

    "abstract": "In acupuncture research two main issues have to be addressed. One is whether the needle has a biological effect of its own. The other is whether acupuncture is of help to patients in their daily lives. With reference to this, acupuncture is a complex form of treatment in which the needles modulate physiological mechanisms of the body and the doctor supports the patient to achieve a life-style that assists with this. To evaluate the biological effects of needling, a randomised, controlled trial group of 49 patients with angina pectoris had acupuncture while cardiological, neurophysiological and psychological observations were made in a mutually independent manner. Needling was found to improve the working capacity of the heart. In addition, acupuncture was found to activate cardiovascular autoregulatory mechanisms in 24 healthy persons. To evaluate the effect of acupuncture in daily life, a controlled trial group of 69 patients with severe angina pectoris were followed for 2 years after treatment. The incidence of cardiac death or myocardial infarction was 7%, compared to 15–21% for the control group of published results concerning invasive treatments. Due to clinical improvement, surgery was postponed in 61% of the patients. The annual number of in-hospital days was reduced by 90%, leading to a US$ 12,000 saving for each patient.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture therapy for rehabilitation following stroke is very popular in China and has also been investigated in the West, notably in Scandinavia. The traditional method is body acupuncture using yang meridian points. Yin meridians are probably more beneficial when treatment has been delayed for some months after the stroke. Scalp acupuncture, either the Japanese Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture, a microsystem which requires great accuracy, or a Chinese variety such as the Zhu approach or the Shanghai scalp technique, has become very popular and published work has demonstrated superiority to traditional body acupuncture. Additionally, a new technique, Xingnao Kaiqiao, has been developed that uses strongly stimulated body points to induce twitching in the affected limbs. This method seems to have given good results in large-scale usage and is not difficult to learn. However, all of these acupuncture techniques require many sessions of treatment and are thus, with perhaps the exception of Yamamoto scalp acupuncture, heavily labour intensive. None the less, the benefits in terms of cost savings as well as effective return to an independent life-style are clear.",

This has led reviewers to suggest that acupuncture may not only be contraindicated in such patients but that prophylactic antibiotics should be given. This study investigated the use of acupuncture treatment in patients with proven valvular heart disease and observed whether endocarditis developed in such patients. All patients in a single-handed GP practice with proven valvular heart disease, including those with prosthetic valves, were identified over a ten-year period. Those who had undergone acupuncture treatment underwent a clinical examination and diagnostic tests, which focused on the signs, symptoms and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of endocarditis and included a transthoracic echocardiogram. Autopsy findings were reviewed in any patient who died. Based on these clinical and laboratory data, using the modified Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of endocarditis, patients were identified as having definite or possible endocarditis, or the diagnosis was rejected. All patients underwent brief acupuncture with no skin disinfectant and no prophylactic antibiotics were given. Semi-permanent needles were avoided. Thirty-six patients with valvular heart disease underwent a total of 479 acupuncture treatments over a ten-year period. The median number of treatments was 9 (range 1-72), with a follow-up after treatment of 5.75 years (range 0.5-10 years). Definite endocarditis was not found in any patient, but two patients had possible endocarditis, eventually discounted by both negative blood cultures and echocardiography. In conclusion, brief acupuncture was safe in this small cohort of valvular heart disease patients and no case of endocarditis was detected over a ten-year period.",

The patients were observed for a further year to assess the effectiveness and duration of the treatment effect. Using the 'measure yourself medical outcome profile' (MYMOP) questionnaire, the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment was measured, and patients were categorised into no effect, improved or much improved. A total of 140 patients were audited over the one-year period. No effect was seen in 31% of patients, a further 31% were improved, and 38% were much improved. Those with a shorter duration of symptoms appeared to show the most benefit. During the one-year post-treatment observation period 50% of patients required further treatment. In conclusion, acupuncture appears to have been an effective treatment in the author's General Practice population. In this audit acupuncture seems to have had a short duration of effect. It is believed that this has lead to an increase in workload, not only as a result of patient demand, but also due to recurrence of symptoms following the initial success of treatment.",

Objective: To investigate the influence of EA parameters on the excitability of M1 in healthy individuals. Methods: A parallel, double blind, randomized controlled trial in healthy subjects, evaluating the influence of an EA intervention on M1 excitability. Participants had a needle inserted at LI4 in the dominant hand and received electrical stimulation of different frequencies (10 or 100 Hz) and amplitude (sensory or motor threshold) for 20 min. In the control group, only a brief (30 s) electrical stimulation was applied. Single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled with electromyography was applied before and immediately after the EA intervention. Resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential, short intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation were measured. Results: EA increased corticospinal excitability of M1 compared to the control group only when administered with a frequency of 100 Hz at the sensory threshold ( p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant changes in the other measures. Conclusion: The results suggest that EA with an intensity level at the sensorial threshold and 100 Hz frequency increases the corticospinal excitability of M1. This effect may be associated with a decrease in the activity of inhibitory intracortical mechanisms.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of acupuncture on “in vivo” variations in oral microcirculation in healthy subjects. Methods An exploratory study was conducted on 40 healthy subjects: 20 cases (mean 55.90, SD 16.04) and 20 controls (mean 51, SD 11.91). Videocapillaroscopy was used to detect variations in oral microcirculation. This method permits an accurate and non-invasive in vivo study of the capillaries of the oral mucous. The site selected for this pilot study is the lower lip since it is the simplest to investigate and is more readily accessible. Assessments were carried out in three phases: t 0 before the application of the needles; t 1 one minute after the application; t 2 five minutes after the application; similar time points were used for the control group. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Results The study showed characteristic changes in oral microcirculation induced by acupuncture. The tortuousness of capillary loops and in the diameter of the afferent loop changed significantly (p&lt;0.05) over time in the acupuncture group but not in the controls. Conclusions The findings lend support to our expectation that acupuncture may generate significant variations in oral microcirculation in healthy adults. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the therapeutic role of acupuncture in oral pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) significantly affects the quality of life in male haemodialysis patients. This study reports the observed effects of acupuncture for ED in a non-diabetic haemodialysis patient. A 43-year-old man undergoing haemodialysis received 12 sessions of manual acupuncture over 6 weeks and was observed for 6 months after the end of treatment. Total International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire scores of the patient were changed from 32 at baseline to 60 at post-treatment evaluation, which means there was a significant improvement of ED. All International Index of Erectile Function subscales also increased. This beneficial effect lasted up to 6 months after the end of treatment. No adverse events were observed. An interview revealed that the lowered self-esteem of the patient was restored with the improvement of ED following acupuncture. Further controlled studies are needed to determine whether acupuncture might be a feasible and useful treatment option for erectile dysfunction in haemodialysis patients.",

There are a few reports which indicate that postoperative pain management is prerequisite for the patient's optimal recovery, but surveys in the UK and the USA have identified an unacceptable prevalence of poor pain control after surgery, which might increase the risk of a chronic pain state. The conventional treatment of postoperative pain includes systemic medications such as opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other non-opioid agents. In our case, the rehabilitation lasted for 6 months without significant benefit. After that period our patient was treated with EA. By the end of the first EA session the relief of pain was notable and after a course of 10 treatments the patient reported complete relief of the symptoms with no recurrence during a 2 year follow up period. In conclusion, this might indicate that EA could be useful for postoperative pain management.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of acupuncture alone in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial, but the benefit of acupuncture added to usual care has rarely been studied. We aimed to examine the benefit of acupuncture added to usual care through network meta-analysis (NMA).PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from their inception to 1 July 2021, without any language restriction. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the effect of acupuncture alone or acupuncture combined with usual care for IBS were included. The primary outcome was improvement of global IBS symptoms. Standard NMA was performed to compare differential combinations of acupuncture (including manual acupuncture (MA) and electroacupuncture (EA)), and component network meta-analysis (CNMA) was subsequently performed to determine whether acupuncture provided additional benefits to usual care. The effect size of an intervention was measured using relative ratio (RR).We included 25 RCTs (n = 3041 participants) after screening 582 retrieved articles. Five RCTs were classified as low risk of bias. The results of standard NMA showed that MA combined with usual care ranked the most effective (sham acupuncture as common comparator; RR = 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.12)). The results of CNMA showed that MA was the most effective component (RR = 1.38 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.70)) when added to usual care.Acupuncture provided additional benefits to usual care, and it might be considered as adjunctive therapy for patients who respond inadequately to usual care.",

Methods: Experienced acupuncturists, rated, in terms of perceived needling quality, three acupuncture needle brands as high (A), medium (B) and low (C) quality. Next, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the tip and surface finish of the needles of each brand were analyzed. A mechanical test was developed and performed to evaluate the compressive force required to insert the needles through a smooth surface (silicon). In addition, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and dispersive energy spectroscopy (DES) were conducted to analyze the material composition of the needles and presence of oxidation. Results: SEM images revealed that needle brands A and B presented a sharper tip and a more regular surface finish in comparison to brand C. In the insertion test, needle brands A and B had similar performance characteristics, with A requiring less force to penetrate the silicon device when compared to B, while C failed to penetrate the silicon and complete the test. The XRF analysis did not reveal any differences in material composition between the three brands. However, brand C exhibited particles embedded on the needle surface and DES confirmed oxidation. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that perceived needling quality by acupuncturists can be correlated with physical–chemical properties of the needles, especially those related to finishing quality of the tip and the surface of the needles.",

This study aimed to survey healthcare professionals' attitudes towards A/A, influencing factors and barriers to implementing this effective non-drug intervention into peri-operative care.A validated, anonymous survey with 43 questions was emailed or distributed as a hard copy at meetings to anaesthetists, midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists and surgeons at a public hospital in Australia. Descriptive data were presented. Influencing factors were explored using chi-square analysis. Multinomial logistical regression was used to identify the influences of confounding factors.A total of 155 completed surveys were returned, reflecting a response rate of 32%. The majority of participants were female (69%), nurses/midwives (61%) and aged between 20 and 50 years old (76%). Eighty-three percent of respondents considered A/A 'clearly alternative' medicine or 'neither mainstream nor alternative'. Eighty-one percent would encourage patients to use acupressure for PONV if it was offered at the hospital. Previous personal use of A/A was the key factor influencing attitudes and openness to clinical use. The key barriers to implementation were perceived lack of evidence and lack of qualified providers and time.Hospital-based healthcare professionals strongly supported the evidence-based use of A/A for PONV despite considering the therapy to be non-mainstream and having limited A/A education or history of personal use, providing a positive context for an acupressure implementation study. Significant gaps in training and a desire to learn were identified.",

    "abstract": "Background: Electroacupuncture (EA) can effectively relieve visceral hypersensitivity (VH). However, its mechanisms are still unclear. Objective: To investigate the impact of EA on VH caused by ileitis, and whether EA relieves VH by modulating the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS). Methods: Thirty male native goats were randomly divided into a saline-treated control group (Saline, n = 9) and three 2,4,6-trinitro-benzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-treated VH model groups that underwent injection of TNBS into the ileal wall to induce VH and remained untreated (TNBS, n = 9) or received six sessions of EA (for 30 min every 3 days) (TNBS + EA, n = 6) or sham acupuncture (TNBS + Sham, n = 6). The visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD) was measured after each EA treatment. Three goats in the Saline/TNBS groups were euthanized after 7 days for histopathological examination; the remaining 24 (n = 6/group) underwent sampling of the ileal wall, T11 spinal cord and brain nuclei/areas related to visceral regulation and ascending pain modulation system on day 22. Expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: VMR to CRD was greater in TNBS-treated goats than in saline-treated goats (p &lt; 0.01) from day 7 to 22. After day 7, EA-treated goats showed a decreased (p &lt; 0.05) VMR compared with untreated TNBS-exposed goats. TNBS treatment decreased CB1R and increased FAAH and MAGL expression in the ileum and related nuclei/areas; this was reversed by EA. Conclusion: EA ameliorates VH, probably by regulating the ECS in the intestine and nuclei/areas related to visceral regulation and descending pain modulation systems.",

Objective: To investigate the role of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment on the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization in a septic rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24) were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each): control (Ctrl), ALI (LPS) and pre-EA (LPS + EA pretreatment). ALI and pre-EA rats were injected with LPS via the caudal vein. Pulmonary edema was assessed by left upper pulmonary lobe wet-to-dry (W/D) ratios. Lung injury scores were obtained from paraffin-embedded and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the left lower pulmonary lobe. Inflammatory activation was quantified using serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-10 levels measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Macrophage phenotype was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Results: Mean lung W/D ratio was significantly lower and serum IL-1β levels were decreased in pre-EA rats compared to ALI rats (P &lt; 0.05). TNF-α mRNA expression was decreased and mannose receptor (MR) and Arg1 mRNA expression was increased in the lung tissues of pre-EA rats compared to ALI rats (P &lt; 0.01). Arg1 protein expression was similarly increased in the lung tissues of pre-EA rats compared to ALI rats (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: EA pretreatment may play a protective role by promoting macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype in a septic rat model of LPS-induced ALI.",

Inclusion criteria included a pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment PROMIS score. Patient demographics and previous treatments tried were recorded. Documented events other than acupuncture that were thought to interfere with PROMIS scores were recorded, and no further scores were used after these events. A maximum of nine visits after the initial visit were used. The PROMIS domains assessed included anxiety, depression, pain interference and physical function.Seventy-two patients who had been treated with SMA met the inclusion criteria. Sixty-five of the patients (90%) had chronic pain. For their presenting complaint, 59 (82%) had previously sought treatment from another non-operative provider, 60 (83%) had tried physical therapy, and 20 (28%) had even had surgery. Despite this, SMA appeared to be able to significantly improve PROMIS anxiety at visits 1-3 and PROMIS depression at visit 3. After just one treatment, minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were reached in 32%-44% of patients for PROMIS anxiety, 17%-36% for PROMIS depression, 28%-29% for PROMIS physical function, and 21%-36% for PROMIS pain interference, based on low and high cut-offs of a range of quoted MCID values.In a difficult patient population with musculoskeletal pain, SMA is a technique that can likely be used to improve PROMIS anxiety and depression, although no firm conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled clinical audit. Of note, MCIDs were sometimes obtained even after just one treatment.",

    "abstract": "A study was undertaken to compare the differences in ease of intubation, emotional distress and physical discomfort during oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in 3 groups of patients: sedated with intravenous diazepam, receiving acupuncture, or being part of a control group having neither treatment. Patients were given the option of sedation. Those that declined were randomly divided into two groups, either receiving acupuncture or acting as a control. Patient distress was measured by two independent methods: direct observation by the attending nurse and a self-report questionnaire. The observed and self-reported physical discomfort were significantly reduced in the sedation group compared to controls, but there was no significant difference in any measurement between the acupuncture and the control groups. Respiratory complications were least in the acupuncture group and there was some evidence of benefit from acupuncture in relieving emotional distress.",

Courses of six to eight sessions of traditional and trigger-point acupuncture were offered for a specified range of conditions. Pain and use of analgesics were measured routinely. A prospective observational study is presented of the outcome for a series of 41 patients, who had a mean age of 57 years and pain duration of 3 years. The mean score for daytime pain fell from 6.8 (SD 1.2) to 4.9 (2.5) points which is highly significant (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 30 patients (73%) had reduction in pain of at least 33% and 22 patients (54%) had a reduction in pain of at least 50%. Analgesic intake (without distinguishing between different analgesic medication) was reduced from a mean of 17 (15.3) tablets per week to a mean of 6 (7.9). Patients with normal X-rays had a much better response to acupuncture than those whose X-rays showed significant degenerative changes. In response to these findings, financial support has been provided to continue the acupuncture clinic.",

However, the main purpose of this letter is to draw attention to the possibility that it may be because of this considerable central sensitisation that some patients with this disorder may be found to have large, well circumscribed areas of tenderness rather than the more commonly described tender and trigger points. This was first brought to my attention when some years ago a female patient with this disorder together with her medical acupuncturist travelled an appreciable distance to see me to enquire why needling, despite being carried out only superficially , invariably gave rise to distressing soreness at the needling site and an exacerbation of the pain. It did not take long to work out that the reason for this was that, despite the needling being carried out",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture appears to reduce the mechanosensitivity of peripheral nerves in animal models; yet, this possibility has not been demonstrated in humans. Objectives The main objective of this exploratory trial was to evaluate the immediate effects of acupuncture on the mechanosensitivity of the median nerve, measured by the elbow extension range-of-motion (EE–ROM) at pain onset and maximum tolerance during the upper limb neurodynamic test 1 (ULNT1). Additional objectives were to test the effects of two different points in ULNT1 responses and critically appraise pre-/post-intervention changes for conducting future research. Methods Thirty-one asymptomatic individuals, randomly assigned to the PC group (n=14) or the LU group (n=17) by the coin flip procedure, underwent acupuncture (leopard spot needling) at PC5 or LU5”, respectively. Two-way mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time (pre-intervention vs post-intervention) as the within-subject factor and group (PC vs LU) as the between-subject factor, plus time×group interaction, were used to determine the effects of acupuncture therapy on EE–ROM at pain onset and maximum tolerance during ULNT1. Results At baseline there were no differences between groups (p&gt;0.05). After acupuncture, mean EE–ROM increased 3.1° at pain onset (p=0.029, η 2 p =0.154) and 5.6° at maximum tolerance (p=0.002, η 2 p =0.277) with no differences between groups (p&gt;0.05, η 2 p &lt;0.01). Conclusion Immediately after acupuncture, the mechanosensitivity of the median nerve appears to be reduced as observed by an increase in EE–ROM during the ULNT1. Further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Trial Registration Number NCT02150915; Post-results.",

The concern about electrolytic corrosion of needles during EA has not been conclusively addressed.To examine whether corrosion of stainless steel acupuncture needles occurs after EA to establish the safety profile of this therapy.The study comprised four EA sessions on healthy participants mimicking a common clinical practice, with needle surface examinations conducted immediately after each session. Used acupuncture needles that did not undergo electrical stimulation and unused needles taken from the original package were also examined as control comparisons. Two commonly used types of single-use, silicone-coated, stainless steel needles were selected for the experiment. The ES-160 digital acupunctoscope (a charge-balanced electric stimulator) was used to deliver electrical stimulation, and an oscilloscope was used to record the waveforms and electric currents. All needles were sterilised before examination by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), where images of needle tips and shafts were taken for further analysis.32 needles were examined under the SEM. As the main findings, the SEM images showed the surface finish, burr attachments and surface characteristics of needle samples. No evidence of electrolytic corrosion was detected on any needle that underwent electrical stimulation for 30 min delivered by a charge-balanced acupunctoscope in healthy participants. The choice of a charge-balanced acupunctoscope is recommended to avoid any potential corrosion of needles in EA clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Background: Whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) is a common musculoskeletal condition that frequently occurs following a road traffic collision. Physiotherapy is often prescribed to help with the symptoms and injuries. Research evidence has demonstrated that acupuncture may be beneficial, but no studies have examined the routine clinical use of acupuncture by physiotherapists for treatment of WAD. Therefore, a physiotherapy service evaluation was conducted to examine the effects of acupuncture on WAD following a road traffic collision. Methods: This study involved 87 patients who attended a private physiotherapy practice following a road traffic collision after referral by their solicitor as part of a personal injury claim. Patients were included if they had been diagnosed with WAD (grades I–III) and received acupuncture as part of their treatment. An average of three sessions of acupuncture were received, which primarily involved needling of traditional acupuncture points and/or myofascial trigger points of the neck and upper/lower back. Results: Pain significantly reduced ( p &lt; 0.001). Musculoskeletal outcome measures including neck disability index, Oswestry low back pain scale and Quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (Quick-DASH) scale also significantly improved (all p &lt; 0.001). Adverse events were minor. The majority of the patients (n = 66) were able to return to full-work duties following treatment. Conclusion: Acupuncture appears to be an effective clinical treatment for WAD following a road traffic collision and should be considered by physiotherapists working with such patient groups.",

    "abstract": "Background: Our objective was to investigate whether the effect of a brief and standardised acupuncture approach persists after the end of the acupuncture treatment (post-treatment effect) and whether the anticipation of future acupuncture treatment affects menopausal symptoms (pre-treatment effect). Method: This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial where women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms were offered weekly acupuncture treatment over five consecutive weeks and randomised (1:1) to an early intervention group that received treatment immediately and a late intervention group with a 6-week delay. The acupuncture style was Western medical, administered at CV3, CV4 and bilateral LR8, SP6 and SP9. Acupuncturists were general practitioners. The effect was evaluated repeatedly during and after the interventions using scales from the validated MenoScores Questionnaire (MSQ) for hot flushes (HF), day and night sweats (DNS), general sweating (GS) and menopausal-specific sleeping problems (MSSP) with a 26-week follow-up period (corresponding to 21 or 15 weeks post-treatment for the early and late intervention groups, respectively). Multivariable linear mixed models were used to analyse the extent and duration of effects. Results: Seventy participants were included in the study. Four participants dropped out. Furthermore, one participant was excluded from the short- and long-term follow-up analyses after the insertion of a hormonal intrauterine device, and nine participants were excluded from the long-term follow-up analysis due to the initiation of co-interventions. For each of the four outcomes, the effect was sustained up to 21 weeks post-treatment with an effect size that was only slightly diminished. A small, but significant, pre-treatment effect was observed in the HF scale scores. The same trend, although not significant, was observed in the DNS and MSSP scale scores. No serious harms were reported. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the overall effect of a brief and standardised acupuncture treatment on menopause-relevant outcomes was sustained up to 21 weeks post-treatment and that there was a small pre-treatment effect.",

Objective: To analyze the profile of acupuncture utilization of primary care physicians who completed an introductory course of acupuncture between 2011 and 2018. Method: A survey using an electronic questionnaire was sent to all 119 physicians who completed the course. Results: Fifty-five physicians answered the questionnaire. The majority of them reported continuation of the practice of acupuncture in scheduled appointments and on spontaneous demand. The most commonly used principles of point selection were traditional acupuncture point function, myofascial trigger point needling and point protocols. As barriers to the practice of acupuncture, time limitation and inadequate physical space were predominant. The participants described the problem-solving potential of the procedure and good patient acceptance as facilitators. The most common problems treated with acupuncture were musculoskeletal pain, and mood and anxiety disorders. A reduction in referrals to specialists and reduced prescription of pain medications were also reported. Most physicians answered that they often combined acupuncture with other medications or associated acupuncture with other complementary practices. The main adverse events reported by the participants were vascular trauma and fainting. Conclusion: Most primary care physicians who completed the introductory course and answered the survey still used acupuncture in their routine, primarily for the management of musculoskeletal conditions and mental health conditions. These physicians reported reductions in specialist referrals and prescription of pain medication after integrating basic acupuncture skills into primary care practice.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess the use and reporting of risk of bias (RoB) tools in systematic reviews (SRs) of acupuncture. Study design and setting: We extracted and analyzed information relating to RoB in acupuncture SRs via Medline, Embase and the Chinese CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), WanFang and VIP databases from their inception to 24 November 2017. Three subgroup analyses were used to check the influence of language, journal type and impact factor, following which we used descriptive analysis. Results: We included 825 acupuncture SRs, of which 48% used the Cochrane RoB tool. Only 36% used the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0 at time of writing) with higher proportions among Cochrane SRs (65%) versus non-Cochrane SRs (34%), and high impact factor journals (58%) versus low or no impact factor journals (28% and 38%, respectively). In the last decade, there were notable increases in the use of the Cochrane RoB tool and Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0, of 43% and 19%, respectively. Chinese-language SRs demonstrated proportionally higher tendencies to report an incorrect Cochrane Handbook version, increasing by 14% in the last 5 years. Additionally, 7% SRs did not report any results, and only 10% reported relatively complete and adequate RoB assessment. Cochrane SRs reported more complete assessments than Chinese-language or non-Cochrane English-language SRs. Conclusion: Use and reporting of RoB tools were suboptimal. Proportionally, use of the Cochrane RoB tool and Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 was low but rising. Our results highlight the prevalence and concerns of using unsuitable tools and the issue of incomplete RoB reporting. RoB tool application requires further improvement.",

    "abstract": "In acupuncture practice, inserting a long needle (with its shaft measuring 40 mm or more) by only holding the needle handle without touching the shaft represents a significant challenge. The long fine needle shaft can easily bend (also known as ‘buckle’) during insertion. Although one may use a guide tube or a needle inserter to help the initial insertion, buckling will still occur when advancing the needle in soft tissue to reach the depth required for therapeutic effect. In a recent study we reported that the buckling of the acupuncture needle could be significantly reduced by changing the design of its handle.1 However, as shown in figure 1A–C, it is impossible to prevent long needles from buckling by simply having a stiffer handle, even after using conventional guide tubes for the initial insertion. Consequently, some clinicians use the other hand to hold the lower part of the needle shaft to assist further insertion. However, this approach would violate the guidelines for clean and safe clinical practice of acupuncture stipulated by the WHO, the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and other professional bodies.2–5\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \nCommonly used acupuncture needles and guide tube: (A) needle with copper coil handle; (B) needle with plastic handle; (C) needle with stainless steel …",

It had sustained a severe crush injury to the right hind leg in a road traffic accident 2 years earlier, necessitating amputation. On examination, the cat had an area of alopecia along the dorsum, extending from the thoracolumbar junction to the pelvis, caused by excessive self-grooming. Sometimes the cat appeared to attack its back. When I touched the lumbar area a twitch response and muscle spasm were elicited, and dorsal skin rippling and piloerection were present. The cat began to growl with stronger palpation to the area. I found significant discomfort on palpation of the longissimus dorsi muscles, especially in the thoracolumbar area with multiple myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), often seen in animals after limb amputation owing to the alteration in gait. The owners informed me that the cat had become less social since the onset of the signs and occasionally twitched whilst being stroked, jumped off the owner and ran away. Frantic licking behaviour often followed. Trichograms and skin scrapes disclosed no underlying dermatological problems and there were no lesions visible on the skin in the alopecic areas. No other abnormalities were found on clinical examination. Feline hyperaesthesia syndrome was considered to be the most likely diagnosis, possibly caused by phantom pain, as the symptoms had …",

Methods Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two study groups: SC and SC+acupuncture. Rats in both groups received intragastric SC extract at 5.0 g/kg. Rats in the SC+acupuncture group additionally received acupuncture stimulation at ST36 for 30 min after SC administration. Acupuncture needles were rotated bilaterally for 1 min, left in situ for 20 min, then electrically stimulated for 10 min at 50 Hz frequency and 1–3 mA intensity. A sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry procedure was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of three bioactive lignans (schisandrin, deoxyschisandrin and schisandrin B) in rat plasma. Results There were significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between the two study groups in various pharmacokinetic parameters. Area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC 0–t ), area under the plasma concentration–time curve to time infinity (AUC 0–∞ ) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) for schisandrin, absorption half-life (T 1/2α ) and AUC 0–t for deoxyschisandrin, and C max for schisandrin B were increased in the SC+acupuncture group compared with the SC group. T 1/2α for schisandrin B only and time to peak concentration (T max ) for all three lignans were reduced following acupuncture. Conclusions Acupuncture stimulation at ST36 affects the pharmacokinetics of SC in rats. Acupuncture may have a beneficial role in promoting the absorption of lignans from extracts of SC.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture using two or four needles on experimental contact thermal pain in healthy volunteers. Methods Forty two participants were randomised into three groups: four-needle group (LI4, LI11, LI10, TE5), two-needle group (verum at LI4, LI11 and mock at LI10, TE5) and mock acupuncture group (LI4, LI11, LI10, TE5). Each participant rated pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) to a series of noxious stimuli administered to the forearm 2°C above the heat pain threshold during needling and immediately after removal of the needles. Results Experimentally-induced heat pain intensity (VAS) during and after the intervention was lower than pre-intervention but there were no statistically significant differences in this change between groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the time taken for pain intensity to decrease by 33% from pre-intervention. However, a 33% decrease in pain intensity within 3 min of needle insertion was observed for 13 participants (92.9%) in the four-needle group compared with 66.7% of participants in the two-needle group and 57.1% in the mock acupuncture group. There was less variance in VAS in the four-needle group, suggesting more consistency in hypoalgesic response when using more needles. Conclusions There is tentative evidence that four needles may be superior to two needles in generating rapid onset hypoalgesia. The findings suggest that further investigation is warranted.",

Four of the fifteen acupuncture patients had complete remission of symptoms compared with none from the control group. The rest of the acupuncture group had a variable response, but a small, significant improvement in overall symptom score was demonstrated, as was a shortening of duration of hay fever symptoms. The start of the hay fever season for some patients was later than expected, which may have resulted in reduced effectivity of the acupuncture, thus treatment may be better starting at the beginning of May to cover the peak of symptoms in early June. The results of this pilot study have shown that single point (Liver 3) acupuncture given for hay fever prophylaxis in a clinic setting was effective, safe, easily reproducible, acceptable and inexpensive (the material cost of the treatment was less than 50p per patient).

    "abstract": "Meridians are regarded as the base upon which traditional acupuncture theory is built but, although much research time has been spent on their investigation, no coherent scientific theory has emerged to explain their structure or mode of action. There have been several hypotheses that offer sufficient evidence for a partial explanation for certain meridians. This paper suggests that there is indeed no single answer, but that the various hypotheses should be combined, accepting that different explanations are likely for different meridians or parts of the body. The most useful tool for investigation seems to be the phenomenon of propagated sensation along meridians. Experiments indicate that physical transmission occurs most generally through the interstitial space, specifically along the neurovascular bundles, rather than through vascular channels. The mechanism of meridian activity is likely to be via neuro-transmitters, found particularly along meridian lines, and by ionic movement. This review of research literature, much of which has emanated from China, concludes that there is a real structural basis for the meridians, but that this structure is the orderly arrangement of normal tissues along the line of meridians rather than any special histological feature.",

As the results of clinical studies are rarely identical, the fairest judgement on the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention is generated through systematic review of clinical trials. Systematic reviews have to demonstrate that all the available evidence that fulfils appropriate criteria has been considered. Once systematic reviews have established the current evidence on a given subject, this knowledge needs to be implemented in clinical practice. Applying the rules of evidence-based medicine to acupuncture proves it to be effective for some conditions and ineffective for others, while its effects on many medical problems remain inconclusive: this indicates areas that require further research. Evidence based medicine should not be regarded as a threat to acupuncture, but as a challenge and an opportunity Importantly, this approach is strongly in the interests of patients.",

The first Chinese electrostimulators were certainly unsophisticated compared with modern equipment, but they were also unsafe.2 Burns were common, as the pulse width had not been corrected to avoid a heating effect at needle sites, and electrolysis through the medium of body tissue fluid caused breakdown of needles over a period of constant flow. Likewise, although acupuncture has been used as an analgesic probably since Stone Age times,3 acupuncture ‘anaesthesia’ for operative purposes is also a product of the 1950s,4 the first use reportedly being for dental extraction.

Methods Twenty-one patients (16 women; mean age 46 years; range 23–61 years, 17 Chinese, 2 Malays, 2 Indians) underwent 10 acupuncture sessions scheduled twice a week for 5 weeks. The lowest TMS intensity to elicit phosphene perception is defined as the phosphene threshold. TMS was performed before the first and last sessions, and at 2 months’ follow-up. Results Acupuncture resulted in reduction of headache frequency, duration and severity over the course of treatment. However, this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the phosphene threshold over a similar time course. The baseline threshold before acupuncture treatment had no predictive value for outcome of treatment. Conclusions Although acupuncture was effective in treating migraine, the use of occipital cortex excitability as an adjunctive parameter to evaluate treatment response was not suitable. The relief of migraine with acupuncture may be related to separate neural pathways independent of occipital or visual processes in the human brain.",

For further exploration, thresholds of homolateral and contralateral mental foramina were determined before and after acupuncture in a subgroup of 13 participants in the acupuncture group. Results Acupuncture at LI4 increased the perception thresholds of the left mental foramen in the acupuncture group significantly (p&lt;0.01). The increases were significantly greater than in the control group for all frequencies, and significantly greater than sham acupuncture for 250 Hz and 5 Hz. In the subgroup, only the CPTs at 5 Hz increased significantly for the contralateral mental foramen. Conclusions Acupuncture at LI4 increases the perception threshold in the mandibular area, but not in the arm. This finding is probably related to the analgesic effect of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Auricular acupuncture (placement of press needles) was applied at the stomach point (according to Nogier) and sometimes at the point of psychological balance (Shenmen) for the control of anxiety and for help in weight loss in 800 patients over a two year period. Press needles were inserted and left in for 10 to 15 days at the auricular acupuncture point and resited again after 4 to 5 days. At the same time, instructions were given for the standard treatment of obesity (information leaflet, low calorie diet, aerobic exercise, behaviour modification, psychological support, etc.). The patients were followed up for a period of one year. The participants were 683 women and 117 men aged between 15 and 76 years. The Body Mass Index (weight/height) was used to determine the degree of obesity, and cases were divided into three groups according to the number of acupuncture sessions as follows: 468 patients (Group A) had one acupuncture session, 278 (Group B) 2 to 4 sessions, and 54 (Group C) had over 4 sessions, all conducted at 15 to 20 day intervals. A reduction in overeating was reported by 81.1% of patients, and 46.7% of the 697 patients who had noted anxiety symptoms claimed that treatment had helped in the reduction of anxiety. Regular exercise was encouraged, and started by 43.4% of the 703 who had no such habit. There was no significant weight loss in 35.2% of patients. During the first 3 months there was an overall significant weight loss in 64.8% and 35.5% at 6–12 months. The percentage weight loss was higher in Groups B and C and remained higher at six months and one year after the start of acupuncture treatment. Group B presented a good six month result in 61.2% of patients and a good annual result in 39.1%. In Group C results were 88.9% and 77.8% respectively. The control of overeating and anxiety using auricular acupuncture al the stomach and Shenmen points in this audit has been beneficial. Its correct use in an integrated obesity control programme may prove of significant long tem help.",

In this article she presents a vivid picture of what it is like to introduce acupuncture to remote rural populations in parts of the developing world. She describes the rapidly growing demand of the local populations following just word-of-mouth spread that a new treatment was available; the different needle length requirements of the impoverished locals compared with the average well-fed westerner; and the simple, safe and effective treatment regimes that she developed and introduced to the local trained nurses, in order to cope with the numbers of patients and to provide continuity of care after her departure. Sarah also comments on the emerging pattern of response that she has observed amongst her patients, and enters into a brief discussion of why this might be so. Early influences on her technique include Felix Mann, Chan Gunn, and a period of study at the Nanjing College of TCM in China. Whilst in the United Kingdom Sarah divides her time between private practice and working as a police surgeon, but is planning return trips to both Bangladesh and Ethiopia, plus fresh pastures in Vietnam and Kerala in south west India.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory pain is the most common type of pain encountered clinically. The analgesic effect of acupuncture has been well-documented.The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of chemokine CXCL1 in the serum on manual acupuncture (MA)-induced antinociception.Rats with inflammatory pain of the right hind paw were induced by intraplantar (i.pl.) administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). After wards, the CFA-injected rats were treated daily with MA at ST36 from Day 1 to Day 7, and thermal nociceptive thresholds (paw withdrawal latency; PWL) were analyzed. The concentration of CXCL1 in the serum of the rats was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the first and the last MA treatment. Subsequently, the rats were injected with two doses (5 or 10 μg) of recombinant CXCL1 through the tail vein daily from Day 1 to Day 7 or injected with two doses (6.4 or 16 μg) of anti-CXCL1 antibody using the same methods and course at 30 min before MA, and the PWLs were measured again. Finally, naloxone (500 μg, 0.1 mL) was administered by i.pl. injection into the inflamed paw 5 min before the last MA treatment or last injection of recombinant CXCL1.MA significantly increased the PWLs and upregulated the expression of serum CXCL1 in the CFA-injected rats. Without acupuncture, repeated tail vein injection of recombinant CXCL1 showed an analgesic effect on CFA-induced inflammatory pain. Conversely, the neutralization of serum CXCL1 by anti-CXCL1 antibody decreased MA-induced antinociception in a time-dependent manner. Anti-CXCL1 antibody injected just once before the first MA did not affect MA-induced antinociception. The analgesic effects of MA and recombinant CXCL1 were reversed by an i.pl. injection of naloxone.This study indicates MA at ST36 had an analgesic effect on inflammatory pain and found a novel function of CXCL1. Increased serum CXCL1 had an antinociceptive effect on inflammatory pain induced by CFA. CXCL1 in serum appeared to be a key molecule involved in the peripheral mechanism of MA-induced antinociception.

We aimed to systematically assess the methodological and reporting quality of studies conducted on acupuncture for experimental cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). Methods: A comprehensive search in six databases was performed for animal research concerning acupuncture for CIRI. Two authors independently selected articles, extracted data, and assessed the methodological and reporting quality of identified articles using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool, and Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guideline, respectively. Results: A total of 24 studies were identified. Only 1 article (4%) achieved a decent overall rating in using SYRCLE (percentage of items with “low risk” ⩾50%). Of the 22 items on the SYRCLE tool, only 8 items (37%) were rated as “low risk” of bias in more than 50% of the included studies. Of the 39 items of ARRIVE, 20 (51%) items were rated as “low risk” in more than 50% of the included studies. Conclusions: The methodological and reporting quality of included studies was generally low, which demands further improvement. These findings should inform the development of evidence-based guidelines for future preclinical research assessing the effect of acupuncture on CIRI.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute pain significantly delays early physiological recovery and results in chronic functional disability in patients with traumatic multiple rib fractures (MRFs). This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the feasibility of acupuncture combined with multidisciplinary care during recovery in patients with traumatic MRFs. Methods: Twenty patients with traumatic MRFs who were admitted to a regional trauma centre in South Korea were enrolled. A combination of acupuncture and multidisciplinary inpatient ward management was provided at the trauma ward. Patients were permitted to continue acupuncture treatments at outpatient clinics for 3 months after the traumatic events. Clinical outcomes, including pain, acute physiological recovery, quality of life, patient satisfaction with the care provided, respiratory function and use of opioids, were evaluated up to 6 months after trauma. Results: Seventeen (85%) participants completed the 6-month follow-up. One patient withdrew consent during admission due to discomfort after three sessions of acupuncture. The proportion of patients with above-moderate level of pain decreased from 95% at baseline to 41% at 6 months. Quality of life appeared to deteriorate consistently throughout the study period. Around 80% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the acupuncture treatments and stated that they found acupuncture to be acceptable. Over 94% of respondents reported slight or considerable improvement. Conclusion: The provision of acupuncture combined with multidisciplinary care for recovery in patients with traumatic MRFs was feasible in a regional trauma centre in South Korea. Randomised trials are needed to investigate the role of acupuncture combined with multidisciplinary care in the future. Trial registration number: KCT0002911 (Clinical Research Information Service)",

    "abstract": "A hyperdynamic circulation and impaired vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors are observed in portal hypertension (PHT) rats. Inflammation is a major contributor to the hyperdynamic circulation state in murine models of PHT. Electroacupuncture (EA) may ameliorate the inflammatory response and limit arterial vasodilatation and portal pressure. This study investigated the possible mechanisms underlying putative hemodynamics effects of EA in normal and PHT rats.PHT was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery over 4 weeks in rats. Sham-operated and BDL rats were treated with low-frequency EA (2 Hz) at ST36 10 min three times weekly for one or two consecutive weeks (for a total of 3 or 7 treatments, respectively). Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α (6-keto-PGF1α) were analyzed, and hemodynamic variation and contractile responses to phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate and phenylephrine in aortic and superior mesenteric arterial rings were recorded. Inducible (i) and endothelial (3) nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), and protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) levels were determined by Western blotting.EA significantly reduced portal pressure and serum TNF-α, NOx and 6-keto-PGF1α levels compared to the untreated BDL group, enhanced maximum contractile responses in the aorta, up-regulated PKC-α, and down-regulated iNOS and COX-1 levels. In addition, EA decreased the aortic angiogenesis signaling cascade, reflected by down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) abundance and transforming growth factor β receptor (TGFβR)I/II expression, as assessed by immunostaining.EA attenuates TNF-α, NO and 6-keto-PGF1α overproduction, modulates the vascular levels of constitutive NOS and PKC-α, blunts the development of the angiogenesis cascade, and enhances vascular contractile force in PHT rats.",

Data from the survey were extracted, analysed using descriptive statistics and translated into SA teaching guidelines.One hundred thirty-eight acupuncturists completed the survey. Nineteen percent of participants had taught SA. The most common symptoms for which acupuncturists taught SA were pain, nausea, anxiety, hot flushes, headaches/migraines and breathlessness. The six most commonly taught traditional acupuncture point locations were LI4, ST36, SP6, PC6, LR3 and TE5. No participants had received reports of adverse effects from their patients.Acupuncturists who teach SA find it to be an acceptable and safe option for patients. The presented data have important implications for guiding the practice of SA.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs contribute to the establishment and development of obesity by affecting many biological and pathological processes, such as adipocyte differentiation, hepatic lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and neurological regulation of obesity. As a clinical intervention approach, acupuncture has been shown to be effective in the treatment of obesity and other metabolic diseases. Our previous whole genome study in central nervous system (CNS)-specific Stat5 knockout (NKO) obese mice found that electroacupuncture (EA) could reduce body weight and promote white browning.To clarify the effect of EA on miRNAs and understand how it regulates gene expression.Twelve-week-old male Stat5NKO mice with body weight 20% greater than that of Stat5fl/fl (control) mice were divided into a Stat5NKO (model) group and EA-treated Stat5NKO + EA group. A cohort of Stat5fl/fl mice of the same age were included as the control group. EA was administered under isoflurane anesthesia at unilateral ST36 and ST44 daily (left and right sides were treated every other day), 6 times per week for a total of 4 weeks. The miRNA profile was generated and miRNA regulatory networks were analyzed in the Stat5 nestin-cre mice before and after EA treatment. Autophagy-related proteins in adipocytes were detected after over-expression of miR27a.EA altered abnormal miRNA expression, including miRNA27a expression, and reduced the autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and ATG12.We found that EA could regulate miRNA27a-mediated autophagy-related proteins and promote white fat browning, which may contribute to weight loss. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNAs potentially driving the effect of EA on white fat browning through the autophagy process.",

This study compared pain levels during surgical termination of first trimester pregnancy by suction evacuation (SE) under local analgesia with and without the use of acupuncture.In all, 60 nulliparous women undergoing SE before 10 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned into one of the following three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomization list. In the control group, women received oral diazepam 5 mg and intramuscular (i.m.) injection of pethidine 30 and 15 min, respectively, prior to SE. In the acupuncture group, women received acupuncture 10 min before SE until the end of SE while oral diazepam 5 mg and i.m. injection of normal saline were given. In the combined group, women received acupuncture in addition to the drugs in the control group. Data from 52 participants were analysed. Pain scores during and after SE, post-operative side-effects and satisfaction levels were compared.The three groups had similar baseline characteristics. The median pain levels during SE differed significantly between the control, acupuncture, and combined groups (80, 50 and 66 mm, respectively, p = 0.03). Pain levels during SE in the acupuncture and combined groups were significantly lower than that of the control group. However, the anxiety scores did not differ between the three groups after SE (p = 0.86).Acupuncture can provide additional benefit in terms of pain relief in women undergoing first trimester termination of pregnancy by SE under local analgesia.",

The primary focus of the acupuncture was pain relief; however, two acupuncture points (PC6, SP4) were included in both treatment series because of possible effects on both costal or chest pain and cardiac arrhythmias, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) teaching and limited research. As recorded by her pacemaker, estimated weekly episodes of AF in the patient decreased significantly, and percentage time in AF decreased with borderline statistical significance, from the pretreatment estimates during the second series of treatments (weekly AF episode estimates: pretreatment =71.4; second series =16.5, difference estimates =−54.9, 95% CI −6.5 to −103.3, P=0.02; percentage time in AF estimates: pretreatment =30.6; 2 second series =18.0, difference estimates = −12.6, 95% CI 0.9 to −26.0, P=0.08).

Acupuncture and moxibustion (AM), essential categories of Kampo medicine, are taught in a few medical schools today. However, the current state of postgraduate AM education is unknown.To compare medical residents' awareness of AM before their AM education in the 4th year of medical school with that after completion of their 2-year postgraduate medical residency.We conducted a postal questionnaire survey of medical residents at the end of their 2-year residency. We required a signature on this questionnaire so that we could examine for changes in their awareness of AM with those determined by similar, signed, former questionnaire surveys conducted before and at the end of their 4th-year AM lectures in medical school (reported previously). The completed questionnaires were returned by mail or facsimile.Among 93 residents, there were 72 (77.4%) effective responses. Only three residents (4%) had opportunities to learn AM during residency. Among the 68 residents who were not afforded the opportunity to do so, after completing their two-year residency, 32(47%) stated that they would like to study AM. Interest in AM was significantly less than that of the proportion of medical students (81%) who were initially interested in AM when surveyed just before their fourth year lectures on AM.Postgraduate AM education for medical residents appears to be relatively scarce in Japan. Moreover, medical residents' levels of interest in AM were lower than those demonstrated before their 4th-year AM lectures in medical school.",

The rats were assigned to one of three groups, that received EA treatment (EA group), minimal acupuncture (MA group) or remained untreated (Control group). In the EA group, EA stimulation (5 ms, 50 Hz, 20 µA, 20 min) was applied to the rupture region over a period of 90 days (five times/week). In the MA group, needles were inserted into the same positions as in the EA group but no electrical current was applied. After 90 days the tendon was measured to calculate the cross-sectional area of the rupture region. Then, the mechanical strength of the tendon was measured by tensile testing.No significant differences were observed between the three groups in cross-sectional area of the injured tendon. For maximum breaking strength, the EA group showed a significantly higher threshold compared with the Control group (P<0.05) but not the MA group (P=0.24). No significant difference was seen between the MA group and the Control group (P=0.96).Given the EA group showed a significant increase in maximum breaking strength, it is likely that EA stimulation increases the mechanical strength of a repaired tendon after long-term recovery, and EA stimulation could be useful for preventing re-rupture.",

    "abstract": "Acupressure effectively reduces the amount of nausea experienced, both in the first trimester of pregnancy, and after either opiates or cytotoxic agents. The aim of this randomised, controlled study was to establish whether it could also reduce any sensation of nausea related to the taking of maxillary dental impressions. The sample comprised 8 males and 14 females, with a mean age of 14.64 years and whose self-registration of nausea following an impression was greater than 33% of a 100mm visual analogue. The test involved a second impression with prior application of pressure on either PC.6, the sixth point on the Chinese pericardial meridian, or a placebo point on the forearm of the patient's dominant limb. A random mental choice as to which point to press was made by each patient, and double blind conditions prevailed. After the withdrawal of the impression, another visual analogue was marked. Of the 9 patients who had used the placebo point during the test impression, there had been a mean reduction of 29% in the scale of nausea experienced. Of the 13 who had used the PC.6 acupressure point, the mean reduction was 30%. The difference was not significant. Three and a half minutes of acupressure on PC.6 did not reduce the sensation of nausea induced by tactile stimulation of the soft palate in this small sample of susceptible patients.",

    "abstract": "Spinal segmental dysfunction, although used in clinical practice by medical acupuncturists, musculoskeletal physicians, physiotherapists and osteopaths, is not a concept which is familiar to the majority of medical practitioners. The concept implies that a problem in the function of a spinal segment may cause symptoms without necessarily being caused by physical pathology. Studies of the dysfunctional spinal segment have shown that physical stress, emotional stress and visceral disease all cause a reaction at the dysfunctional segment more easily than at normal segments. In the same way that individuals may have asymptomatic latent trigger points which may later become symptomatic, so individuals may have asymptomatic dysfunction which later becomes symptomatic under the influence of appropriate stimuli. There is some evidence that the clinical features of segmental dysfunction may be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. The detection of segmental dysfunction is a clinical skill worth developing and the properties of the dysfunctional segment are worthy of further research.",

    "abstract": "A preliminary study correlating the wrist and gall bladder body areas with their auricular acupuncture points, through recording the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) at the corresponding brain localisation, showed that stimulation of the “Wrist” auricular point activates the primary cortical somatosensory area of the upper extremity on the contralateral hemisphere in a similar way to direct median nerve stimulation. A “placebo” point 5 to 8mm from the “Wrist” auricular point was used as a control: no activation in the brain area was observed. In patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, SEP traces obtained both by direct median nerve stimulation at the wrist, and by stimulation of the “wrist” auricular point, were altered in a similar manner and only on the damaged side. Similarly, “gall bladder” auricular point stimulation activates the corresponding cortical somatosensory area in the same way as direct stimulation of the T7 intercostal nerve. Again, a “placebo” point, 5 to 8mm away from the “Gall bladder” auricular point, was used as a control, and activation in the brain area was not observed. Also, in patients with cholelithiasis, both the SEP traces evoked by T7 direct intercostal nerve stimulation and those evoked by “Gall bladder” auricular point stimulation were altered in the same manner. These results demonstrate that there is correlation between the activation of specific areas of brain cortex and stimulation of their corresponding auricular acupuncture points, and indicate a convergence into the same cortical somatosensory area of nerve impulses coming from the body organ itself and from the auricular point corresponding to that organ. This might be taken as suggesting neurological support for a functional somatic relationship of auricular points.",

Methods The medical records of all patients who underwent breast lump excision under AAA in combination with electrical stimulation at traditional acupuncture points in 2016 were examined. All of them (n = 17) received electrostimulation (2–4 Hz) using single needles inserted at bilateral LI4 and PC6. They also underwent insertion of four acupuncture needles at the lump site, which were electrically stimulated at 30 Hz frequency. Results All surgical procedures were successful with minimal use of analgesics and local anesthetic. The median pain score reported was 1/10 (interquartile range (IQR) = 2/10) at the first hour, and slightly increased to 2/10 (IQR = 2/10) between 24 and 48 h of the surgery. No major postoperative adverse events were documented, except for drowsiness in one case. Conclusion AAA was found to be generally safe and effective for anaesthesia and analgesia in breast lump excision. However, a large-scale randomized controlled study is required to verify the findings.",

Methods: Studies were identified from English and Chinese databases from their inception to September 2020. The outcomes of interest were remission incidence, number of daily attacks, incidence of positive cold stimulation tests and incidence of cold provocation tests. We conducted meta-analysis and network meta-analysis using meta and gemtc. Results: Six trials (n = 272 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Pairwise meta-analyses show that acupuncture was associated with increased remission incidence (risk ratio (RR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.34), decreased daily number of attacks (weighted mean difference (WMD) = −0.57, 95% CI = −1.14 to −0.01), and increased incidence of positive cold stimulation tests (RR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.27 to 2.11). There was not enough evidence to associate acupuncture with decreased incidence of positive cold provocation tests. The network meta-analyses did not demonstrate significant results for the effectiveness of any acupuncture treatments (electroacupuncture or manual acupuncture ± moxibustion), compared with controls, in terms of remission incidence or daily number of attacks, possibly due to small sample sizes and a lack of statistical power. Conclusion: The use of acupuncture may be effective for the treatment of Raynaud’s syndrome in terms of increasing remission incidence, decreasing daily number of attacks and increasing incidences of positive cold stimulation tests. However, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes, very low quality of evidence and high risk of bias. Future large-scale RCTs are warranted.",

In her linked paper,2 Stuyt reports the provision of auricular acupuncture as an option in a residential drug rehabilitation unit for 231 patients, many with drug dependence and personality disorder (dual diagnosis). Those who chose acupuncture showed several apparent benefits in comparison with those who did not, including improved programme completion rates and increased long-term smoking cessation. It should be emphasised that the study was naturalistic with all the advantages that brings (eg, patients’ behaviour and choices are not distorted by rigid trial procedures), but also with several limitations from an evidence-based aspect, including non-randomisation of patients and no chemical validation of smoking cessation.\n\nThe 10% quit rate for smoking cessation at 1 year seems to be a highly respectable figure in this population with high dependence on chemical substances, and further research is justified to replicate the effects in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).

Also, it is stated that determination of electroacupuncture (EA) intensity “was generally accompanied by mild muscle contraction in the index finger”.1 According to Anatomy for Acupuncture by Dorsher and Cummings (http://www.anatomy.tv/atv2/mainwindow.aspx?ref=0&titleid=26&svrid=0&App=acupuncture), sensation from the skin of the first dorsal web space is conveyed by the terminal radial nerve, and the muscles most often needled at this point are the first dorsal interosseous and adductor pollicis brevis, both of which are innervated by the ulnar nerve (myotome C8-T1). Deep needling closer to the first metacarpal bone may penetrate flexor pollicis brevis, which is innervated by the ulnar and median nerves (myotome C8-T1), but this is not usually achieved with needling to 1.25 cm depth at LI4. If the needle were to have been directed ventrally to the second metacarpal bone (in the direction of SI3, on the ulnar border of the hand at the level of the palmar crease), the needle might have reached the first lumbrical, which is also innervated by the median nerve.2 In this case, flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint with extension of the interphalangeal joints of the second finger would have been elicited with EA.\n\nWhen describing …",

    "abstract": "Dr Felix Mann, born in 1931, was an inspiration to doctors who wanted to find out more about acupuncture. He himself had gone from Malvern College to Christ's College Cambridge, to Westminster Hospital and on to Ottawa, to return to Europe via Strasbourg there to become medical assistant to Dr Jean Schoch, whose anthroposophical thinking encouraged a doctor to continue to observe phenomena faithfully even when no explanation or even the ghost of an underlying theory is on offer. Felix once showed me his library which contained part of his inspiration—the complete works of Goethe. This way of thinking was praised by Aldous Huxley in a preface to one of Felix's books: “From telepathy to acupuncture, unusual facts get ignored by the very people whose business it is to investigate them—get ignored because they fail to fit into any of the academic pigeonholes and do not suffer themselves to be explained in terms of accredited theories”.\n\nGiven permission to proceed in this way allowed Felix to cope with the apparently bizarre practice of acupuncture where, for example, recurring headaches can be relieved by a few sessions in which only one needle may be placed in the foot. This was the subject he studied in Munich, Vienna and Montpellier and finally China, where he learnt to read Chinese.\n\nWith a flair for timing, Heinemann published some of his work when President Nixon visited Chairman Mao Zedong in 1972. Before ordering American Universities to investigate acupuncture, President Nixon said, “There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially …",

The aim of this psychophysical study was to investigate the subjective sensations of VA compared with conventional manual acupuncture (MA) and non-penetrating sham acupuncture (SA). Methods 30 young healthy volunteers (21 men and 9 women) received VA, MA, and SA at LI4 and LI10 in a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over manner. After 25 min of treatment, the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) acupuncture sensation scale (MASS), McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and numerical rating scale (NRS; 0–10) were employed followed by the acupuncture credibility and indication scale. Adverse events were investigated after treatment. Data were analysed using Friedman's test for repeated measures on ranks and post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction. Results The MASS scores were significantly higher during MA and VA compared with SA at both LI4 and LI10 (p&lt;0.017). Treatment with VA evoked significantly higher vibration sensations compared with MA and SA (p&lt;0.005). Treatment with SA yielded significantly lower NRS and MPQ scores compared with MA and VA (p&lt;0.001) with no difference between MA and VA (p&gt;0.05). Blinding of participants was achieved for SA and MA; however, VA was correctly identified in 29 of 30 subjects due to the characteristic vibrational stimulation. No serious adverse events were recorded for any of the treatments. Conclusions Subjective sensations were influenced by treatment mode, with MA and VA yielding higher stimulation responses compared with SA. VA evoked specific vibrational sensations beyond MA, which might have specific effects in various disorders.",

However, its involvement in electroacupuncture (EA) treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) remains unclear.Over four experiments, we randomized 111 rats into: control, untreated model (CGN) or EA-treated model (CGN + EA) groups, a model group receiving EA after PVN damage (CGN + EA + Lesion) or untreated model groups injected with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding human M4 muscarinic receptor (CGN + hM4D) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (CGN + EGFP). CGN was modeled by intraperitoneal injection of bovine serum albumin for 2 weeks. Rats in the CGN + EA and CGN + EA + Lesion groups received EA at bilateral ST36 and KI3 for 14 days. Urine/serum samples were collected to evaluate inflammatory factors and changes in renal function.EA inhibited the release of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, and decreased urine protein (PRO), creatinine (Cre) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. PVN damage influenced the effect of EA on the levels of these parameters. EA appeared to inhibit the firing frequency and spectral energy of PVN neurons. In the viral vector experiment, levels of PRO, Cre, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in the CGN group were increased in CGN versus control groups (p < 0.0001), decreased in CGN + hM4D versus CGN groups (p < 0.05) and did not differ between CGN + EGFP and control groups (p > 0.05).Our findings indicate that EA at ST36 and KI3 improves CGN in this rat model by weakening the activity of PVN neurons, alleviating impairment of renal function impairment and restricting the release of inflammatory factors.",

Methods: An MI model was constructed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 4 weeks of treatment, echocardiography was used to detect changes in cardiac function, and Masson’s trichrome staining was used to detect collagen deposition. In addition, immunofluorescence staining was applied to examine von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive vessels, the expression of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and proliferation marker Ki67, and the number of c-kit-positive, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-positive, and Sca-1-positive endogenous stem cells in the infarcted area. In addition, the expression of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 and stem cell factor (SCF) was detected. Results: EA increased the ejection fraction after MI, reduced collagen deposition and cellular apoptosis, and increased the number of blood vessels compared with an untreated model group. EA significantly promoted cellular proliferation, except for myocardial cells, and significantly increased the number of c-kit-, CXCR4- and Sca-1-positive stem cells. Moreover, the expression of SDF-1 and SCF in myocardial tissue in the EA group was significantly higher than that in the (untreated) MI group. Conclusions: EA appears to promote angiogenesis and reduce collagen deposition, thus improving the cardiac function of rats with MI. The underlying mechanism of action may involve endogenous stem cell mobilization mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 and SCF/c-kit.",

Data were collected retrospectively between 2002 and 2021 in seven clinics in Switzerland through automated data extraction of existing medical records. The treatments described are standard care at the facilities where they took place.A total of 11,233 patients were included. In those with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or above, a positive effect on body weight was noted with a peak average body weight loss of approximately 17.5 kg reached after 7 months. Long-term stabilization was at about 15.5 kg after 18 months. Significant male-female differences (p < 0.01) were observed with women losing less weight. Differences were also noted between overweight, obese and extremely obese patients suggesting a BMI-dependent effect. Maximum weight loss of patients with BMI of 35 kg/m2 or above was 29.8 ± 12 kg, while it was 18.8 ± 8 kg for obese patients (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m2) and 12 ± 7 kg for overweight patients (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m2), reflecting a significant overall difference between groups (p < 0.01). Compliance to the protocol by patients and physicians seemed to be another differentiating factor; more adherent patients appeared to lose more weight and preserve body weight loss better over time.Although this study lacked a control group and was retrospective and observational in nature, a program of acupuncture combined with a very low-carbohydrate diet appeared to be effective at inducing weight loss among obese patients. The observed weight reduction in this retrospective chart review represents a good starting point for further investigation of this approach via a comparative evaluation.",

Methods: Sixteen male Sprague–Dawley rats (7 weeks old) were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. A blunt striking injury and eccentric exercise were applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of rats in the experimental group once a week for 8 weeks to establish an MTrP model. Subsequently, the rats were reared normally and rested for 4 weeks. After modeling, the skeletal muscles at the MTrPs (and non-MTrPs at the same anatomical position) were extracted from the two groups of rats for in vitro cell culture experiments of single muscle fibers. Potential contractile nodules in the MTrP group were exposed to different concentrations of acetylcholinesterase, whereas non-MTrP cells were exposed to acetylcholine. The morphological changes of muscle cells in each group were observed. Results: By culturing MTrP cells in vitro, large contractile nodules remained in single MTrP muscle fibers, whereas some contractile nodules were twisted and deformed. After the addition of different acetylcholinesterase concentrations, no obvious morphological changes were observed in the contractile nodules in the MTrP group. After the non-MTrP cells were exposed to different acetylcholine concentrations, no significant morphological changes were observed in the single muscle fibers. Conclusion: MTrP cells can continue to maintain contractile morphology in vitro, but whether the recovery of such contractile nodules is related to acetylcholine remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) on glucose and lipid disturbances in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis. Methods: The PCOS rat model was induced by continuous administration of letrozole (LET) combined with a high-fat diet (HFD). Female Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the following four groups: control, control + EA, LET + HFD and LET + HFD + EA. EA was administered five or six times a week with a maximum of 20 treatment sessions. Body weight, estrous cyclicity, hormonal status, glucose and insulin tolerance, lipid profiles, liver inflammation factors, liver morphology and changes in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway were evaluated. Results: The rat model presented anovulatory cycles, increased body weight, elevated testosterone, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, IR, liver inflammation, hepatic steatosis and dysregulation of the insulin-mediated PI3-K/Akt signaling axis. EA reduced fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, area under the curve for glucose, homeostasis model assessment of IR indices, triglycerides and free fatty acids, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, low-frequency EA downregulated mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, upregulated mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, increased protein expression of phosphorylated (p)-Akt (Ser473), p-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β (Ser9) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), increased the ratio of p-GSK3β to GSK3β and downregulated protein expression of GSK3β. Conclusion: An obese PCOS rat model with IR and hepatic steatosis was successfully established by the combination of LET and HFD. EA improved dysfunctional glucose and lipid metabolism in this PCOS-IR rat model, and the molecular mechanism appeared to involve regulation of the expression of key molecules of the PI3-K/Akt insulin signaling pathway in the liver.",

    "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture is a potentially effective non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia. Objective: We observed the responses of patients with insomnia to acupuncture in routine clinical practice. In addition, we explored patient characteristics that might affect the treatment response to acupuncture for insomnia. Methods: Medical records of patients with insomnia in a Korean medicine clinic with baseline Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores ⩾8 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores ⩾5 were reviewed. Acupuncture was applied at ST43, GB41, ST41, SI5, HT3, KI10, HT7 and ST3, for 1–2 months. The ISI and PSQI were measured monthly to assess insomnia severity. The effect of acupuncture over time was analyzed using a multilevel linear model for repeated measures. In addition, logistic regression was used to explore predictors of treatment response. Results: A total of 91 patients with insomnia aged 59.2 ± 12.5 years (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) (90.1% female) were included in the analysis. After the acupuncture treatment, ISI scores were significantly reduced by −3.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) = −4.99, −2.50) and −4.69 (95% CI = −6.22, −3.16) after the first and second month, respectively. The PSQI global scores also improved, and sleep duration showed a tendency to increase by 0.35 h (95% CI = −0.17, 0.86) after acupuncture treatment. Three cases of mild fatigue were reported. In addition, higher baseline pain/discomfort predicted a greater likelihood of response after acupuncture treatment (odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.10, 2.60). Conclusion: In a real-world setting, the insomnia of outpatients in a clinic was slightly alleviated after acupuncture treatment. These findings require validation by randomized controlled trials.",

This has lead to some being inaccurate, on occasion dangerously so. Systematic literature reviews should involve six key elements: a clearly focused question; a thorough search for relevant studies; explicit criteria for including studies in the review; explicit criteria for judging the validity of the studies; an appropriate method of data synthesis; and suitable interpretation of the data presented. These ensure that the review is replicable and that reasons for the author's conclusions are explicit. Systematic reviews require considerable skills and resources. It is unlikely that all future reviews published in complementary medicine journals will constitute methodologically sound systematic reviews. It is suggested that authors of non-systematic reviews reflect on the possible shortcomings of their work and avoid making strong recommendations.

Each of the KHA micromeridians are lettered and correspond to one of the body meridians (Figure 1). One can treat a wide range of problems using this modality and it is possible in many cases to administer treatment without use of needles.",

Examination must be thorough, based initially on a careful history and examination before more sophisticated tests are used. Routine X-rays should be avoided where possible as radiological scanning techniques allow a more precise diagnosis to be made in some patients. Treatment should be simple and non-invasive in most patients. The most important part of such treatment is to ensure that the patient understands the reason for avoiding surgery and seeks to learn how to control the pain in everyday life.",

The author has used a device that delivers an electrical stimulation to acupuncture needles (electroacupuncture) that is frequency modulated by the sound of classical music being played to the patient. In a randomised controlled trial, patients with migraine or cervical tension headache were divided into two groups (25 each). One group received standard electroacupuncture at 100Hz while the other had music sound electroacupuncture stimulation. Pain levels were scored by the patients on a five point scale. Analgesia obtained by the standard electroacupuncture group was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). That obtained by the music sound electroacupuncture group was highly significant (P&lt;0.001).",

Natural immunity, representing a first line of defence in viral infections and cytotoxicity to a variety of tumour cells, is strongly influenced by frequent exercise. This regulation includes interaction between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems and central mechanisms including the endogenous opioids are of great interest here. Chronic activation of endogenous opioid systems augments natural cytotoxicity, and the possible involvement of opioids in the exercise-induced enhancement of natural immunity is discussed. Few reports are available on acupuncture and its effect on immune function but, interestingly, the effects of acupuncture and physical exercise are somewhat similar. The physiological significance as well as the underlying mechanisms of the reported changes in natural cytotoxicity after exercise training and acupuncture is as yet unclear. However, moderate exercise training has been associated with elevated natural immune function and reduced upper respiratory tract infections and available epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that moderate physical exercise may protect against several forms of cancer.",

The greatest innovation is a new range of open access journals published only on the internet, aimed at rapid publication and universal access. In most cases authors pay a publication charge for the overhead costs of the journal. Journals that are published by professional organisations primarily for their members have some functions other than publishing research, including clinical articles, conference reports and news items. A small number of these journals are permitting open access to their research reports. Commercial science publishing still exists, where profit for shareholders provides motivation in addition to the desire to spread knowledge for the benefit of all. A range of electronic databases now exists that offer various levels of listing and searching. Some databases provide direct links to journal articles, such as the LinkOut scheme in PubMed. Acupuncture in Medicine will continue to publish in paper format; all research articles will be available on open access, but non-subscribers will need to pay for certain other articles for the first 12 months after publication. All Acupuncture in Medicine articles will in future be included in the LinkOut scheme, and be presented to the databases electronically.",

However, in contrast with NICE back pain guidance,4 they did not make a positive recommendation for acupuncture. Importantly, as reported in one of the linked papers,5 the approach to the health economic analysis in the NICE osteoarthritis guideline compared verum and sham acupuncture whereas the NICE back pain guideline compared acupuncture with usual care.

In order to explore the extent of surface markings of abnormally tender regions in more detail an improved method is proposed whereby the pressure algometer is not kept still. It is slid over the tissues at a predetermined downward pressure and velocity to produce compressive, tensile and shear stress within underlying tissues. It is moved over surrounding non-tender regions until it reaches the surface overlying an abnormally tender region where a PPT is evoked. The probe is removed immediately and the skin marked. When this is repeated from different directions, the boundary of the surface markings of a tender region will appear in corresponding detail. Provided that this 'sliding pressure algometer' produces sufficiently similar amounts of stress when applied on separate occasions, it can be used to monitor the progress of a condition or the effects of treatment. To reduce cost and increase availability, this pressure algometer may be made of a plastic syringe converted into a gas-tight chamber.",

    "abstract": "The concept of comorbidities as a challenge for healthcare systems has recently been given increasing attention in leading medical journals. Many patients suffering from chronic pain, especially those who are older or poorer, have more than one pathology (multimorbidity) or more than one set of manifestation of one pathology (comorbidity). These patients present a difficult problem in industrialised societies, with services that are highly specialised and compartmentalised. Systematic reviews of interventions for patients of this kind do not mention acupuncture. Acupuncturists claim that their treatment promotes general well-being and can help with multiple symptoms, but evidence for this claim is currently lacking. Longitudinal research with prospective data collection regarding the effect on morbidity burden is needed.",

A questionnaire was sent to 200 general practitioners, of whom 145 responded. The treatments studied were acupuncture, homoeopathy, herbal medicine, spinal manipulation, faith healing; and hypnosis. Of the 145 general practitioners, 55 (38%) had received some training in complementary medicine and 22 (15%) wished to arrange training. Overall, general practitioners knew little about the techniques of complementary medicine. Despite this 86 doctors (59%) thought that the complementary techniques being assessed were useful to their patients: 110 (76%) had referred patients for this type of treatment over the past year to medically qualified colleagues and 104 (72%) had referred patients to non-medically qualified practitioners. Most (93%) of those who responded believed that complementary practitioners needed statutory regulation; only 3% thought that they should be banned. The method of regulation most favoured was through a central and independent national body. General practitioners’ views about complementary techniques were most influenced (in a positive manner) by observed benefits to their patients (41%) and personal or family experience of benefit (38%). The results of the study show a surprisingly high interest in complementary medicine among general practitioners in the Avon area.",

Using this assessment tool, practitioners with medical acupuncture training will be able to select the cases most likely to be helped by their acupuncture skills.",

Its scientific status remains unclear and will be hard to establish as long as the criteria of evidence-based medicine are required to prove therapeutic effectiveness. The most consistent therapeutic effects have been shown by patients suffering from pain or nausea. Diseases based on structural disorders have disclosed unconvincing results.\n\nBioethics should be expectant in case acupuncture does confirm its place in medical therapeutics, for developing world countries would develop a keen interest in an effective procedure that may be less expensive than pharmacological agents. A five-point programme is suggested in order to eventually substantiate the incorporation of acupuncture in national health policies: (a) select disorders with high probability of successful response; (b) concentrate on diseases that do not have adequate therapies; (c) research using appropriate strategies, preferring crossover, historical or active control group methods instead of placebo controls; (d) standardise the therapeutic technique; (e) professionalise practitioners. Should acupuncture solidly confirm its usefulness, it would be ethically improper to withhold it especially from those patients who have not been helped by current therapies or do not have access to them.\n\nAlternative medicines have been gaining momentum in Western cultures for a variety of reasons, including: high medical costs with insufficient insurance coverage; increasing presence of managed medical services; and loss of confidence in practitioners and pharmaceutical companies. Acupuncture is the one alternative therapeutic procedure that has profited most from this shift in patients’ orientation, to the point where there is no agreement as to whether it belongs to the bulk of alternative medicines or is to be classified as a “therapy within a modern health service”.1 It has been plausibly …",

Gastric emptying, caecal arrival time, small intestinal transit and eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces were calculated at 3, 9, 15 and 21 dpi. At 21 dpi, intestinal worm recovery was counted. Results EA at ST36 and CV12 slowed gastric emptying over the course of infection time. An accelerated intestinal transit was observed in the ST36 group, and after CV12 treatment the same effect was observed at 9 and 15 dpi. At 9 dpi, EPG was increased in the CV12 group. ST36 treatment decreased EPG at 9 and 15 dpi. At 21 dpi, both the ST36 and CV12 groups had increased EPG and worm numbers. No changes were observed in the other parameters analysed. Conclusions EA at ST36 and CV12 provoked changes in gastrointestinal transit that may be beneficial to the host during S. venezuelensis infection; however, based on the number of worms and EPG at 21 dpi, the indication for EA in the treatment of strongyloidiasis needs to be carefully assessed.",

    "abstract": "Objective To determine whether integrative medicine, combining acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine with conventional rehabilitation during subacute stroke, is an effective comprehensive rehabilitation strategy for daily life activities, neurological deficits, motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment and depression. Design Randomised controlled trial: patients were randomly assigned to a conventional rehabilitation (CR) group or an integrative medicine rehabilitation (IMR) group with CR plus acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Setting Single-centre inpatient teaching hospital, China Participants 120 Patients aged 35–80 years, with a recent first incidence of subacute ischaemic stroke Main outcome measures Measured at baseline (week 0), mid-point (week 4), week 8 and follow-up (week 20). Primary outcome measurement Modified Barthel Index (MBI) Secondary outcome measurements The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Fugl-Meyer Assessment; the Mini-Mental State Examination; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; depression, Hamilton’s Depression Scale; Self-Rating Depression Scale. Results The primary outcome measurement, MBI, showed significant improvement in the IMR group compared with the CR group. The IMR group also showed significant improvement across all of the secondary outcome measures (repeated-measures analysis of variance group*time; independent Student’s t test). Limitations A small placebo bias may exist, but measures were undertaken to limit it. Sample sizes for cognitive impairment and depression in this study were small. Results cannot be generalised to one type of treatment only. Conclusion This trial, evaluating a treatment protocol commonly used in clinical practice, demonstrates that comprehensive rehabilitation including acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine may comprehensively improve subacute stroke outcomes. Trial registration number ChiCTR-TRC-12001972.",

    "abstract": "Knee pain should never be considered in isolation. It must be effectively investigated and accurately diagnosed where possible, to differentiate the various forms of arthritis, identify causes of inflammation and exclude metabolic and other factors. Surgical treatment, including arthroscopy and joint replacement, is a very effective option and should now be considered at an earlier stage before severe deformity has occurred. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should generally be avoided except in topical form. Intra-articular steroid injection may often be used after diagnostic aspiration of the joint. Acupuncture is very acceptable to patients but must be viewed as part of an overall treatment plan. It is effective in acute and anterior knee pain. In chronic pain it should logically be used where the diagnosis is known and where joint aspiration is not necessary, and it is the treatment of choice for advanced rheumatoid patients who are inadequately controlled on other therapy - 60% have lasting benefit. The drawback is that clinics may be overwhelmed by the demand for repeated courses of treatment, since the relief is often excellent but rarely permanent.",

    "abstract": "In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) three syndromes are said to be associated with conjunctivitis sicca: Liver-Yin deficiency, Liver-Yang excess and Liver fire. The diagnosis of one of these syndromes requires the use of a specific combination of points for acupuncture. We used an extensive questionnaire of autonomic nervous system disturbances to suggest points that should be treated on a western medical basis. This prospective study was performed to answer two questions: i. Is it possible to associate the complaints of our patients with a TCM syndrome? ii. Is there any difference between the results using a TCM combination of points and those selected with our western method? Thirty seven patients with conjunctivitis sicca were enrolled in the study and asked to complete two questionnaires. In one, autonomic nervous system complaints were evaluated; in the second, the symptoms of the three relevant TCM syndromes were specifically asked for. The results of both questionnaires were compared. Our “western medical” combination of points for therapy consisted of local points, and points related to the autonomic nervous system complaints and to the five Chinese elements. In total we recorded 29 different symptoms associated with conjunctivitis sicca. According to the TCM questionnaire, 21 patients had a deficit of Liver-Yin, 5 had a Liver-Yang excess and 10 suffered from Liver fire. One patient had symptoms of Liver-Yin and Liver-Yang. Yet all patients had symptoms of more than one Chinese syndrome. Only 4 out of 37 patients seemed to belong clearly to only one TCM syndrome. So the evaluation of symptoms according to the TCM system proved to be inadequate compared with the western “autonomic” system. Points for therapy resulting from the western system were similar to the points proposed by the TCM system. We conclude that the points proposed by both methods are similar for the treatment of conjunctivitis sicca, but we believe that for western medical doctors it is easier to find a successful combination of points with the western method asking about complaints of the autonomic nervous system.",

    "abstract": "This reports the second part of a single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind clinical trial with crossover. It has aimed to assess whether PC.6 acupressure could reduce nausea related to maxillary dental impression taking. The selection criterion was a self registration of nausea greater than 33% of a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) following an initial maxillary impression (control) in patients referred for treatment. Exclusion criteria were: current medication with a secondary emetic or anti-emetic effect, prior knowledge of PC.6 acupressure, a recent history of nausea, and the first trimester of pregnancy. Twenty three entered the trial and 18 completed. The test involved a second and third impression with prior application of finger pressure on either PC.6 or a dummy point on the forearm The initial point was chosen by the patient, leaving the other point to be pressed subsequent to crossover. The mean level of nausea was recorded by patients after PC.6 acupressure and also after pressure at a dummy point. These recordings were then compared. The sample consisted of 6 males and 12 females, and the mean age was 14.74 years. The mean difference in nausea between PC.6 acupressure and pressure at the dummy point was −0.39mm % of the VAS (SD 40.48mm %). The 95% Confidence Interval was −20.52 and 19.74mm %, and the difference was not significant. Three and a half minutes of PC.6 acupressure did not significantly reduce nausea experienced with a maxillary impression, compared with pressure at the dummy point, in this small sample: both showed a mean reduction of 50% on the control figure.",

The author suggests that a non-linear, fractal approach, similar to that of Chaos theory, offers a tool to understand Qi; the yin-yang and five phases theories of Chinese philosophy can be regarded as fractals. Qi, as the “net of life”, can also be looked on as an information network with close parallels to the computer-based web of the internet. This article therefore suggests a new Western definition of Qi, proposing that: “The Qi of Chinese medicine is inter-cellular information communicated within the body: information which enables all bodily functions and is a key component in regulation”. Referring to Qi as information offers the chance to integrate Chinese medical philosophy with current biological research on cellular communication.",

Doctor volunteers were needled in either the vagus area or a control area of the ear, and pulse rate changes were measured over the following 30 minutes. No significant differences were found in the pulse rate changes of the two groups.

    "abstract": "Visual disorders present a special problem of treatment due to their frequent occurrence. The type and prevalence change according to the socioeconomic status of the country concerned and its health service development. Among these disorders, some involve the neurological system, such as: retinitis pigmentosa, Usher's Syndrome, premature retinopathy, amblyopia and congenital rubella. These diseases are considered to have a bad prognosis, with visual acuity loss leading to blindness, and the neurological damage has been considered irreversible. The scientific literature has little to say about the physiopathological mechanism of their degenerative processes. However metabolic changes seem to be implicated. Similar metabolic changes have been investigated in sensori-neural hearing loss, where a metabolic acidosis due to increased levels of lactic and pyruvic acids, together with enzyme disorders of the cytochrome-oxidase system have been reported. Taking as a working hypothesis that the same type of metabolic disorder exists in these visual disorders, an electroacupuncture therapy was designed that aimed to produce visual improvement through metabolic rebalance. Brief case histories are given of 44 patients having various visual disorders with neurological involvement who showed improvement with electroacupuncture. No side effects or adverse reactions were recorded following this treatment. The author proposes that electroacupuncture should be considered as a suitable alternative treatment for visual disorders with neurological involvement. Also, the previously accepted irreversibility of these disorders must be seriously questioned.",

Methods: We recruited chronic back and neck pain participants who received six sessions (twice weekly) of true electroacupuncture versus sham electroacupuncture or 3 weeks of gabapentin versus placebo treatment. QST profiles, pain scores, and functionality profile were obtained at baseline (visit 1) and after three sessions (visit 4) or six sessions (visit 7) of acupuncture or 3 weeks of gabapentin or placebo. Results: A total of 50 participants were analyzed. We found no differences in QST profile changes (p = 0.892), pain reduction (p = 0.222), or functionality (p = 0.254) between the four groups. A major limitation of this pilot study was the limited number of study participants in each group. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that a large-scale clinical study with an adequate sample size would be warranted to compare acupuncture and medication therapy for chronic pain management.

Main outcome measures: While sitting in a chair, each subject underwent measurements of PPT and ACROM (ipsilateral and contralateral side flexion and rotation, flexion and extension) preintervention, (immediately) postintervention, and at 24 h, 72 h and 7 days. Results: Superficial and deep DN produced an increase in PPT at 7 days with respect to preintervention levels. Furthermore, superficial and deep DN produced a decrease in cervical flexion at 24 h and an increase in ipsilateral rotation until 72 h, increasing to 7 days in the case of deep DN. On the contrary, superficial DN produced an increase in ipsilateral and contralateral side flexion after intervention, unlike deep DN that produced a decrease at 24 h. Furthermore, superficial DN produced an increase in contralateral rotation at 24 h and deep DN decreased extension at 72 h. Conclusion: A single intervention of superficial or deep DN did not produce statistically significant changes in PPT or goniometry measurements.

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of post-treatment electroacupuncture (EA) on the electrophysiological properties of ventricular muscle in rats with ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury.Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into sham-operated (SH), IR and IR + EA groups (n = 8 each). The IR model was generated by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 min. After establishing the IR model, EA was administered at PC6 for 30 min while opening the coronary artery and allowing reperfusion for 30 min. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure and monophasic action potential (MAP) of cardiac muscle in the outer membrane of the antetheca of the left ventricle before coronary artery ligation (T0), after coronary artery ligation for 30 min (T1) and after reperfusion for 30 min (T2) were recorded. At the same time, ventricular electrophysiological parameters including ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), conduction velocity (CV) and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were measured. Then, the cardiac function and the levels of creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were monitored. Based on these data, monophasic action potential amplitude (MAPA), the maximum depolarization velocity (Vmax) and the MAP durations at 50% and 90% repolarization (MAPD50 and MAPD90) were calculated to determine the incidence of arrhythmia during reperfusion.Compared with the SH group, the IR group showed an obviously decreased HR as well as reduced mean arterial pressure, Vmax, CV, ERP and MAPA. All indices of cardiac function except left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) decreased (i.e. ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS) and rate of the ventricular pressure rise/drop (±dp/dt)). Furthermore, the MAPD50 and MAPD90 were prolonged, and the levels of CK-MB and cTnI increased (p < 0.05). In comparison to the IR group, HR and the mean arterial pressure were increased. All indices of cardiac function except LVEDP increased (LVSP, LVEF, FS and ±dp/dt). Vmax, CV, ERP and MAPA were also increased in the IR + EA group. However, MAPD50 and MAPD90 were distinctly shortened, and the levels of CK-MB and cTnI decreased (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in VFT between the three groups (p > 0.05).EA post-treatment can relieve prolongation of repolarization and slowed depolarization of ventricular muscle during IR, thus decreasing the rate of incidence of reperfusion arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated inflammatory condition that is highly prevalent worldwide. The aim of this pilot trial was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of self-administered acupressure for AR. Methods: A randomized, single-blind, non-specific controlled clinical trial was conducted at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Melbourne, Australia. Fifteen AR patients were randomized into two groups: self-administered acupressure at five specific acupressure (SA) points or five non-specific acupressure (NSA) points (1 min/point, twice a day), and treated for 4 weeks with an 8-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was the change in 7-point scale symptom severity. Secondary outcomes included the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire and standardized activities (RQLQs), medication usage, adverse events and participants’ opinions of the blinding method. The Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 26 was used for data analyses. Results: Fourteen participants completed the study and no major adverse events were reported. No statistically significant differences between SA and NSA groups were identified in 7-point scale symptom severity scores, RQLQs or medication usage. However, participants in the SA group believed that SA was useful for AR and recommended it for self-care. The credibility of the blinding method was successful. No adverse effects were considered to be related to the intervention. Conclusion: Acupressure is feasible and appears to be safe for self-administration by AR sufferers. Experience from this pilot study has guided minor amendments to the protocol. A large-scale randomized controlled trial is warranted to further investigate the efficacy and safety of self-administered acupressure for the management of AR.",

    "abstract": "Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness. Sometimes long inpatient treatment is necessary, increasing the anxiety that comes with hospitalization and the necessary weight gain. Safe, non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies that improve subjective health are called for. Objective: The aim of this non-randomized, mixed-methods observational study was to describe the utilization rate and nurses’ experiences of ear acupuncture in a highly specialized clinic for eating disorders in Sweden, in which acupuncture had been implemented as part of routine clinical care. Twenty-five patients with AN-treated voluntarily or by law were included. The semi-standardized National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol, sometimes combined with needling at 2 traditional acupuncture point locations on the body, had been implemented as a voluntary adjunct to usual care, twice weekly. To evaluate the acceptance of acupuncture, the study examined how often patients chose acupuncture when offered on schedule, and how often they asked for extra acupuncture sessions. Patients rated their subjective health using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), treatment satisfaction with usual care and acupuncture, and health-related quality of life with the RAND36 instrument. A credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) was used to measure confidence in treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to follow the patients’ recovery. Nurses’ experiences of giving acupuncture as a part of routine care were captured in interviews, and analysed with content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: Despite an initially moderate level of trust in acupuncture, the utilization rate of the scheduled acupuncture was 89% and patients asked for extra acupuncture sessions on 28 occasions. No serious side effects were reported. Nurses’ experiences of providing acupuncture were positive. They were generally enthusiastic, although they reported finding it difficult to organize group treatments and to find time for acupuncture sessions if they were not scheduled. Conclusion: Further research into the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in psychiatric care is needed. This study provides relevant information for clinicians as well as researchers planning future randomized controlled trials.",

Attention is drawn to the manner in which myofascial pain syndrome in the anterior chest wall may arise as a result of primary trauma or anxiety-induced activation of myofascial trigger point (MTrP) nociceptors and also as a result of the secondary activation of MTrPs situated in a zone of cardiac pain referral, and how myofascial pain syndrome may develop in patients with mitral valve prolapse. It is explained that, because of an appreciable incidence of concomitant costochondritis and CAD pain and of MTrP and CAD pain, and because dry needling in both myofascial pain syndrome and costochondritis may relieve underlying CAD pain, it is not infrequently necessary in cases of anterior chest wall pain to carry out a detailed cardiological assessment including electrocardiographic exercise testing and radionuclide cineangiography.",

    "abstract": "The study of folk medicine by anthropologists and medical historians has revealed an astonishing array of ingenious methods to relieve pain (Brockbank, 1954). Every culture, it appears, has learned to fight pain with pain: in general, brief, moderate pain tends to abolish severe, prolonged pain. One of the oldest methods is cupping, in which a glass cup is heated up (by coals or flaming alcohol) and then inverted over the painful area and held against it. As the air in the cup cools and contracts, it creates a partial vacuum so that the skin is sucked up into the cup. The procedure produces bruising of the skin with concomitant pain and tenderness. Cupping was practised in ancient Greece and Rome as early as the 4th century B.C., and was also practised in ancient India and China. Over the centuries, the method spread to virtually all parts of the world, and cups of various sizes, shapes and materials have evolved. Cupping has been used-and is still widely practised-for a large variety of ailments, including headaches, backaches, and arthritic pains. Cauterization is yet another ancient method. Generally, the end of an iron rod was heated until it was red-hot, and was then placed on the painful area, such as the foot in the case of gout, or on the buttock, back or leg in patients with low back pain. Often, however, the cautery was applied to specifically prescribed sites distant from the painful area. The procedure, of course, produced pain and subsequent blistering of the area that was touched by the cautery, but reportedly also led to the relief of chronic pain (Elliott, 1962). The same effect was achieved by two other procedures: rubbing blistering fluids into the skin, or applying a cone ofmoxa (made from the leaves of the mugwort plant) to a site on the body, setting the tip of the cone aflame, and allowing it to burn slowly until it approached or reached the skin. Again, the procedure produced pain and, while used for all kinds of diseases, was often prescribed specifically for painful conditions (Brockbank, 1954; Elliott, 1962). There are countless other methods that resemble the ones just described, and which are usually labelled as 'counter-irritation'. It is evident that the one factor common to all ofthem is that they produce pain to abolish pain. The pain was usually brief and moderate but its effect was to relieve or abolish a much more severe, chronic pain. These methods, of course, did not always work, but they obviously worked well enough to have survived as procedures of folk medicine throughout the world for thousands of years. Do these procedures work better than a placebo? There are no experimental studies, but the evidence from studies of acupuncture suggests that they do.",

There is an increasing body of evidence that acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment option, and its use has become widespread in pain clinics, hospital rheumatology and physiotherapy departments, and in general practice. Medical acupuncture is now based firmly on modern physiological principles, and an understanding of the opioid and other neurotransmitters involved in needle stimulation has made clinically useful acupuncture practice readily accessible to medical practitioners.",

Through the measurement of displacement, rotation, torque and force, studies have found significant variations in amplitude and duration of needling between practitioners when instructed to perform acupuncture in their own fashion, but the movement was consistent between acupuncturists.3 4 In addition to the displacement, the aim of our study was to analyse the magnitude and speed of needle movement during the lifting and thrusting movements of tonification and sedation.\n\nThe participants were recruited from both public and private Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics in Singapore. Ethics approval was sought from the Singhealth’s Centralised Review Institutional Review Board (CIRB Ref: 2016/2765).\n\n### The experiment\n\nThe acupuncture needle insertion was conducted on floral foam (figure 1A).

ResultsChanges in the DBAS total, \"consequences\", \"worry/helplessness\", and \"sleep expectations\" subscale scores mediated the effect of CBT-I on ISI, but not on sleep-diary-derived SE, while none of the DBAS scores mediated the effect of acupuncture.Compared with acupuncture, CBT-I resulted in a significantly greater reduction in the DBAS \"sleep expectations\" subscale score and had a significantly greater indirect effect of treatment on ISI through changes in DBAS total and \"worry/helplessness\" subscale scores. ConclusionsThe role of dysfunctional cognitions about sleep as mediators of improvement is relatively less important in acupuncture compared with CBT-I.",

Objective: To analyze the muscle activity of the short head of the biceps femoris (SHBF) and long head of the biceps femoris (LHBF) after the application of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to the common fibular versus tibial nerve compartment of the sciatic nerve. Methods: Thirty-eight healthy subjects received electrical stimulation (asymmetric biphasic rectangular waveforms) through a needle in the sciatic nerve. The sample was divided into two groups in which the technique was applied to the lateral compartment versus medial compartment of the nerve, respectively. The protocol used included 5 s of stimulation at a frequency of 100 Hz and a phase duration of 350 ms, followed by 55 s of rest, for 5 min. The electrical activity of the SHBF and LHBF and the muscle strength of the knee flexors was assessed by surface electromyography during isometric knee flexion in the prone position. Results: Neither group showed significant changes (p &gt; 0.05) in any variable after the intervention compared with baseline values. Similarly, there were no significant differences in any of the study variables when comparing both groups (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Selective stimulation of the sciatic nerve by percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation had no measurable effects on muscle activity in the SHBF or LHBF, regardless of the approach applied.

Methods: An MI model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery of wild-type (WT) C57/BL and β 1 -AR +/– mice (heterozygous for β 1 -AR gene deletion). EA treatment was administered at HT5-HT7 or LU9-LU8. We evaluated cardiac function by measuring ST segment displacement, ischemic area and serum levels of creatine kinase (CK)-MB and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Pathological morphology/apoptosis of myocardial tissue were examined using hematoxylin–eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. Norepinephrine (NE) levels in myocardial tissue were detected by ELISA. Levels of β 1 and post-receptor PKA signaling components were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results: EA stimulation at HT7-HT5 could better regulate the level of β 1 -AR in myocardial tissue than that at LU9-LU8. Following EA, the ST segment, serum CK-MB/ LDH and area of myocardial infarction were decreased in WT mice, and the degree of myocardial pathology/apoptosis and expression of cleaved caspase-3 were decreased. Myocardial levels of Gs protein (Gs), adenylate cyclase (AC), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), L-type voltage-gated calcium channel α1C (Cav1.2), serine phosphate 16-phospholamban (p-PLB s16 ) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase 2a (SERCA2a) increased after EA. However, these effects of EA were not replicated in β 1 -AR +/– mice. Interestingly, myocardial NE content decreased after EA in WT and β 1 -AR +/– mice. Conclusion: EA may enhance cardiac function and reduced MI area/apoptosis by restoring the activity of β 1 -AR and post-receptor PKA signaling.",

    "abstract": "Background: Considering the importance of cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the development of acupuncture over the past few decades, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on patients’ exercise tolerance, heart rate and blood pressure after CABG. Methods: Thirty-four patients with a history of recent CABG were recruited between 2019 and 2020 for this clinical trial and randomly divided into two groups receiving acupuncture plus cardiac rehabilitation (group A) and cardiac rehabilitation alone (group B). In both groups, exercise-based rehabilitation exercise was performed. Group A additionally received acupuncture at PC6, PC4, HT7 and GB20 bilaterally. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate and Borg scale score were evaluated before, during and after the course of the treatment. Results: Heart rate was significantly lower in group A compared to group B after completion of the course of the treatment (P = 0.022). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or Borg scale scores (P &gt; 0.05). Nevertheless, the Borg scale scores showed a significant decrease within each group over time (P &lt; 0.001), reflecting an improvement in the patients’ ability to tolerate activity after cardiac rehabilitation with or without acupuncture. Conclusion: Acupuncture in combination with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation was more effective at decreasing heart rate than cardiac rehabilitation alone after CABG. Both approaches appeared to be similarly effective at improving exercise tolerance. In this study, the addition of acupuncture at the aforementioned traditional acupuncture point locations to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation did not affect blood pressure.

The aim of this study was to further explore the potential role of astrocytes in the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on neuropathic pain by focusing on the glutamate–glutamine cycle. Methods: 69 male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a normal control group, untreated chronic constriction injury (CCI) model group and EA-treated model (CCI + EA) group. EA was applied bilaterally at ST36 and GB34. Pain thresholds were assessed using behavioral tests and thermal stimuli. We examined the co-expression of glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) via immunofluorescence and measured the expression levels of GLAST, glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 and glutamine synthetase (GS) using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To validate the impact of GLAST/GLT-1 in the analgesic effect of EA, an additional 30 SD male rats were divided into groups receiving intrathecal saline, GLAST antagonist or GLT-1 antagonist alongside EA. Results: Post-CCI, pain thresholds were decreased, GLAST expression was diminished, and spinal Glu levels were increased. EA treatment reversed these effects, improved pain thresholds and GLAST/GLT-1 expression in astrocytes, and reduced Glu levels. Antagonist administration negated the analgesic effects of EA. Conclusion: Repeated EA administration inhibited CCI-induced chronic neuropathic pain in rats, corresponding to a reversal of decreased expression of GLAST and GLT-1, which may have accelerated the clearance of Glu and thereby reduced its concentration. Regulation of the astroglial glutamate–glutamine cycle is a potential target of EA.",

Rats treated with EA for 4 days were subjected to WIRS for 6 h. Microscopic lesions, oxidative stress and TRPV1, substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and gastric tissues were detected. The results indicated the development of AGMLs with a substantial increase of TRPV1/SP in the DRG and TRPV1/SP/MDA (malondialdehyde activity) in the stomach, and a significant decrease in CGRP/NO/SOD (superoxide dismutase) in gastric tissues, using a combination of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TRPV1 signaling pathways likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of AGML. In addition, EA pretreatment protected gastric mucosa lesions induced by WIRS by reducing the expression of TRPV1/SP in the DRG and gastric mucosa, as well as up-regulating gastric CGRP/NO. Antioxidant mechanisms are likely to at least partially mediate the protective effects of EA against AGML.",

It is now clear that there are two specific disorders of body musculature, each with its own defined pattern of symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a disease of unknown aetiology, predominantly affecting women, that gives generalised muscular pain, a disturbed sleep pattern, morning stiffness and fatigue. Tender spots are found at certain charecteristic sites. The Myofascial Pain Syndromes, on the other hand, can usually be related to some form of trauma and are normally localised to particular muscles with readily palpable myofascial trigger points at specific spots according to the pattern of pain referral. Acupuncture may be a rapid and effective treatment for both disorders, often giving long lasting relief in Myofascial Pain Syndromes, but offering only repeated short term responses to Fibromyalgia sufferers.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) has recently aroused great interest and has been linked to a number of therapeutic actions of acupuncture. It was originally discovered about 45 years ago to have a vasoconstrictor effect in the clotting mechanism, but is now known to be involved in numerous body processes including the modulation of a number of anterior pituitary hormones. Multiple 5-HT receptors have been identified and drugs with specific receptor action are being developed. Sumatripan is a 5-HT 1 stimulator which has a vasoconstrictive effect, relieving migraine headaches. Ondansetron is a blocker of 5-HT 3 receptors in the gut, thus being a very effective antiemetic in oncology treatment. Fluoxetine prevents 5-HT reuptake and thus has an antidepressant effect. As well as being endorphin mediated, the analgesic action of acupuncture has been shown to rely partly on 5-HT release: notably from nerves electrically stimulated at 200Hz. Acupuncture is a potent antiemetic, possibly acting by the same mechanism as ondansetron. It also has antidepressant action, perhaps through altering 5-HT mobilisation in the brain. Even the treatment of drug withdrawal symptoms by electroacupuncture may be by restabilising 5-HT at a normal level.",

CISCOM showed the greatest sensitivity, followed by Medline and SCI; all three usually provided abstracts, but CISCOM did not provide authors’ addresses. Other databases had features that might make them useful for particular purposes. SCI, British Library and Embase covered a different range of journals from Medline, including acupuncture specialist journals, but of these three only SCI contained an additional relevant reference; it also had the advantages of secondary references and associated correspondence. Indexing of Medline appeared to be more effective for acupuncture than for some other complementary and orthodox medical subjects. It was concluded that the CISCOM search was the most sensitive, and that Medline and SCI had other benefits which were significant.",

A number of variations to the units have been designed to improve the efficacy of stimulation, however there remain 3 basic forms: continuous, pulsed and acupuncture-like. Before rejecting the method as ineffective for any patient, it is important to have an adequate trial of treatment of at least a fortnight during which all forms of available stimulation are tried, with electrodes placed in a variety of positions on the skin for a minimum of an hour at a time. Failure is generally due to lack of perseverence or unrealistic expectations.",

    "abstract": "Background For clinical trials of acupuncture, it would be desirable to have a sham procedure that is indistinguishable from the real treatment, yet inactive. A sham needle has been designed which telescopes instead of penetrating the skin. The Park Sham Device involves an improved method of supporting the sham needle and requires validation. Objective To test whether the sham procedure using the new device is: 1. Indistinguishable from real needles, and 2. Inactive. Design Two subject and assessor-blind, randomized controlled trials. Study samples: Study 1: 58 patients included in a clinical trial of acupuncture for acute stroke. Study 2: 63 healthy, acupuncture naïve, adult volunteers. Intervention: Real or sham acupuncture using the Park Sham Device. Settings: 1. District general hospital, 2. University laboratory. Measurements: 1. The form of treatment that patients believed they had received 2. Experience of de-qi, as judged by three acupuncture experts. Results Study 1: No patient in either group believed s/he had been treated with the sham needle. Study 2: In 40 volunteers for whom experts achieved consensus, the relative risk of experiencing de-qi with real acupuncture to that with sham acupuncture was 15.38 (95% CI 2.26 to 104.86). The inter-rater reliability of all 13 experts, calculated from their judgements on 10 subjects selected by randomisation, was 0.52 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.61). Conclusions Results suggest that the procedure using the new Park Sham Device is both indistinguishable from real acupuncture and inactive. It is therefore a valid control for acupuncture trials. The findings also lend support to the existence of de-qi, a major concept underlying traditional Chinese acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To undertake a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a population of patients with persistent low back pain, when given access to an acupuncture service, gain more relief from pain than those offered usual management only, for equal or less cost. Methods The study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (n=241). Suitable patients are identified by their general practitioners. Patients randomised to the experimental arm are offered the option of referral for up to 10 individualised treatments from one of six qualified acupuncture practitioners. The control group continues to receive usual management from their general practitioner. The primary scale used for measuring change is the Bodily Pain (SF–36) at 3 months and 12 months post randomisation. The main outcome is cost-effectiveness at 12 months. Results A total of 43 general practitioners participated in the trial and 241 patients were randomised. All patients randomised to the option of acupuncture chose to receive treatment. Clinical outcomes at 3 months show that the SF-36 Bodily Pain scores improved by 29.4 and 24.9 points in the acupuncture and normal management group respectively (p=0.125). Patients in the acupuncture group reported lower levels of worry at three months (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions It is possible to conduct a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial of acupuncture in a primary care setting. Acupuncture is seen as an acceptable treatment by patients with low back pain. Clinical outcomes at three months suggest that the acupuncture group are in less pain than the control group.",

Methods: We included cases of high-frequency shoulder disorders—adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff syndrome, shoulder impingement syndrome, and sprain and strain of the shoulder joint—stratified from the Korea NHIS-NSC database between 2002 and 2013; cases were classified into two groups based on a history of acupuncture treatment performed at least twice within 6 weeks (acupuncture group: n = 111,561; control group: n = 71,340). We examined propensity scores and hazard ratios (HRs) for the frequency of acromioplasty, within 2 years of the first treatment or first examination in the acupuncture and control groups, respectively; cumulative survival rates were estimated using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Results: Following propensity score matching, no differences were observed between the acupuncture and control groups for variables including sex, age, income and the Charlson comorbidity index. In addition, the incidence rates of acromioplasty within 2 years were lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group (HR 0.264; 95% confidence interval 0.224–0.311). Based on differences in sensitivity analyses for the numbers of acupuncture sessions and treatment duration, the frequency of acromioplasty within 2 years was lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group. Conclusion: This study found that the frequency of acromioplasty was reduced in patients with shoulder disorders who had been treated with acupuncture. Although the findings need to be verified by prospective randomized clinical trials, these results imply that acupuncture may be effective at reducing the incidence rate of shoulder surgery.",

    "abstract": "Background: Moxibustion treatment involves a combination of thermal and chemical stimulation applied by the combustion of moxa wool. The quality of moxa wool is considered to be an important factor in moxibustion treatment traditionally and clinically. However, despite its importance, quantitative and objective methods for determining moxa wool quality are lacking. Methods: Moxa wool and commercial indirect moxibustion (CIM) device specimens were randomly collected, dried and strained through sieves of various sizes for 10 h. After sieving, the residues remaining on each sieve were collected. The collected samples were weighed and microscopically observed. Results: In this study, we observed that fibres mainly remained on sieves sized 425 μm, and particles were smaller than 300 μm. The residues between 425 and 300 μm varied between the products. In addition, moxa wool for direct moxibustion (DMW) exhibited significantly more fibres than moxa wool for indirect moxibustion (IMW). Most of the CIM devices using moxa wool had a quality similar to IMW, except for one CIM brand using moxa wool that contained three times more waste particles than IMW. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the sieving method is useful for testing the quality of moxa wool even after the CIM manufacturing process. The sieve sizes of 425 and 300 μm could be used as a yardstick to determine the quality of moxa wool. Although this approach requires larger scale validation against existing standard methodologies, we believe it has great potential to be used to improve and safeguard the quality of moxa wool contained in commercial moxibustion devices.",

    "abstract": "There are no regulations governing the practice of acupuncture in Lebanon as it is not yet registered as a profession. To our knowledge, no studies have ever been conducted in Lebanon regarding the practice of acupuncture. The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the knowledge of Lebanese physicians about acupuncture, with the intent of conducting larger scale studies and developing strategies aimed at refining this knowledge in the future, and the ultimate goal of setting guidelines for acupuncture practice in Lebanon.An online survey looking into physicians' knowledge of acupuncture, its mechanisms of action, effectiveness, indications and safety, and physicians' understanding of its concepts, was circulated to 4651 physicians registered in the Lebanese orders of physicians.One hundred forty-nine physicians (3.2%) completed the survey. Most study respondents stated that they were unaware of the difference between traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) and Western medical acupuncture (WMA). Overall, 30% of respondents had personally used and/or referred patients for acupuncture. Physicians who had personally tried acupuncture were more likely to refer patients for acupuncture (p < 0.001). Those who know the difference between WMA and TCA were more likely to have tried or referred for acupuncture (p = 0.004). 72% believed that acupuncture and other integrative medicine modules should be introduced in medical curricula in Lebanon.Interest in acupuncture among physicians in Lebanon appears to be limited, based on the low response rate. Among respondents, physicians who had tried or referred patients for acupuncture appeared to be more well informed about different acupuncture styles.",

Outcome measures reported in the SRs were classified into 11 domains and 67 unique outcomes. No SR completely reported COS. In COS released in 2016, 75% of outcomes (6/8) were only reported by ⩽5% SRs. In COS released in 2019, the reporting rate was very low (from 0% to 17%) for 73.3% of outcomes (11/15). SRs published in the most recent 5 years had a significantly greater possibility of reporting COS (odds ratio (OR) = 4.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33 to 16.88, p = 0.016).Core outcomes were rarely reported in systematic reviews of acupuncture for OA, with considerable heterogeneity in the use of outcomes. The publication of COS in the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) database may help promote the reporting of COS. We encourage systematic reviewers to use relevant COS.",

In this study, in vivo fluorescence imaging (IVFI) was applied to display and evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on liver function (LF) in mice with chronic alcoholic liver injury (cALI).IVFI of the Cy5.5-galactosylated polylysine (Cy5.5-GP) probe targeting the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) and liver indocyanine green (ICG) clearance was performed to visually evaluate the effect of EA at ST36 and BL18 on liver reserve function and hepatic metabolism in mice with cALI. In addition, changes in ASGPR expression, serum indexes of LF, and hepatic morphology were observed.After EA at ST36 and BL18, the ASGPR-targeted fluorescence signals (FS) in the liver increased significantly in cALI mice (p < 0.05) and exhibited relationships with liver ASGPR expression, liver ICG clearance, liver histology, and serum marker levels of LF in cALI mice undergoing EA intervention.As displayed by IVFI, EA at ST36 and BL18 appears to improve liver reserve function and inhibit the development of liver injury in mice with cALI. EA may have potential as a treatment strategy to protect against ALI.",

These patients were compared with a similar group of 19 who received a larger dose to a tender spot at the lateral epicondyle, without any initial acupuncture treatment. In the acupuncture with steroid group: 13 patients had benefited following two treatment sessions, two after three sessions and one was no better at the end of the permitted three treatments. In the steroid alone group: 13 had had benefit after two sessions, three after three and three were unsuccessful. This suggests a trend towards increased and more rapid success in the acupuncture with steroid group, but the small number of patients precluded useful statistical analysis. The physical advantage in using acupuncture before administering local corticosteroid injection is that a lower dose of steroid can be used, with consequent reduction in the risk of tissue necrosis and inflammatory reaction.",

It was found that out of 521 patients examined, almost every one had a different combination of tender ear points, but that different specific groups of ear points were found routinely in the majority of patients in each of three categories of alopecia. The author suggests that when auricular acupuncture is used to treat alopecia, points should be selected from the tender spots found, rather than from a standard list of recommended points.",

    "abstract": "Seventy-four patients having acupuncture for chronic pain were asked to complete a self-appraisal questionnaire and a linear-scale pain score in order to evaluate the efficacy of their treatment. The study revealed that 75% of patients had at least moderate symptom relief in 3 out of 5 parameters. In analysing the differing response of patients with various sites of pain, it was found that 95% of patients with chronic head, neck or arm pain obtained good symptom relief, 85% with migraine or facial pain and 63% with low back pain. The response to the questionnaire was compared to the pain score for each patient, and the result was used to assess both the current response and the suitability of that patient for further treatment. It is hoped that this study will form the basis of further audits, in order that acupuncture treatment may be focused on those patients who need it most and who are getting maximum benefit from it.",

In a clinical series of patients who had already failed to respond to oral drug treatment, rest and physiotherapy thus acting as their own controls, 63% recorded an excellent result after corticosteroid injection and a further 26% had a good result. Inspection of anatomical specimens shows that the common extensor origin at the lateral epicondyle is variable in size and shape and that the male and female humeri are very different in character at this area. Epicondylitis is much more common in the female: 19 out of 27 in this clinical series. A technique is described for selecting the most tender spot, at which the injection should be sited. This is rarely at the epicondyle itself. Also, when the lesion is recurrent, tenderness is usually noted at a new site. For an average-sized tender lesion, a 1 ml injection of the mixture methylprednisolone 40mg and lignocaine 10mg per ml is ideal; however in order to reduce the incidence of skin atrophy, superficial lesions should receive a smaller volume of more dilute suspension.",

The visiting student can learn of the traditional theories and methods of diagnosis and have a chance to see and use treatment techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, herbal medicine, Chinese massage and qigong. The Chinese people in general use both Western and traditional medicine, trying one and switching to the other if the first is ineffective, and Chinese traditional doctors make use of Western diagnostic techniques when necessary.",

The problem is likely to become more prevalent in the future due to the ageing population, particularly in those over 80 years of age. Research, most of it uncontrolled so far, suggests that simple acupuncture starting in the acute phase, within 24–72 hours of the appearance of the skin eruption, could, if combined with anti-viral medication, produce a substantial reduction in the incidence and severity of post herpetic neuralgia. Further controlled clinical trials conducted at primary health care level are urgently needed.",

(iii) Cultural/political: There is a steady increase in the availability of information about, and training in acupuncture by way of books, Journals and training courses.

It helps to slow or reverse the process whereby anxiety, depression and other forms of psychological distress are transformed into physical symptomatology. This process, termed “somatisation”, is little understood in Western medicine, although it is implicated in many of the cases seen in general medical practice. Traditional Chinese medicine provides an explanation of how endogenous factors encompassing negative emotions and psychosocial stress can generate illness. This paper specifies acupuncture points and procedures to be used in managing general psychosomatic illness, as well as controlling the severe distress experienced by some psychosomatic patients.",

She was the eldest of three children and was raised in a humanistic parental style. Her early years were influenced by the narrow views of a communist regime under which her father retrained as a master goldsmith to avoid the restrictions placed on academics. As the daughter of such a parent, Walburg was singled out and compelled to do a perfect dive off a high diving board simply in order to graduate from her high school. Already as a child she dreamed of journeys to the Far East and her long-term first career aspiration was to become an Ambassador in China. She began her university education studying Chinese and Mongolian studies at the University of Leipzig (with the famous Professor Erkes), followed by medicine in Leipzig and at the Charite in East Berlin.\n\nDriven by the desire to live and think freely, she was compelled to break away from the East German regime and, on 10 August 1961 at the age of 21, Walburg convinced her entire family and organised them to escape to the West. The Berlin Wall was erected 3 days later.⇓\n\n\n\nIn Frankfurt she continued her medical education, focusing on psychosomatics in the environment of early ‘anthropological psychiatry’ (Kuhlenkampf, Zutt). She met and married a general surgeon and had three children. At the same time she established her own clinic in Bad Homburg, and from the start she practised integrative medicine, struggling against many prejudices and hostilities at that time.\n\nAs a young doctor, Walburg developed a …",

J Am Board Fam Med 2015;28:697–705.\n\nPragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) (n=54) of auricular acupuncture plus standard treatment versus standard treatment.\n\n### Methods\n\nAdults presenting with sore throat were randomly enrolled for either standard treatment (ibuprofen 600 mg) or standard treatment plus ear acupuncture (points chosen from cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, point zero, Shenmen ; unilateral or bilateral, semipermanent needles, to stay in place until falling out spontaneously). Antibiotics were prescribed depending on the result of a rapid Streptococcus antigen test. Pain scores (not defined) were measured before treatment, and 15 min, 6, 24 and 48 h post-treatment.\n\n### Results\n\nFifty-six patients were enrolled, two were lost to follow-up. As shown in figure 1, participants in the acupuncture group reported significantly lower pain scores at 15 min (2.6 vs 6.0; p<0.0001), 6 h (2.5 vs 4.8; p=0.0005), and 24 h (1.9 vs 4.1), but not at 48 h (1.3 vs 2.3; p=0.063). Less consumption of pain relief medication was reported in the acupuncture group. No significant difference was found between the two groups with regards to time off work.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \nSore throat pain scores, units not stated. Based on J Am Board Fam Med 28:697–705.\n\n\n\n### Comments\n\nThe authors found significant improvement in pain relief from ear acupuncture added to pain relief medication. They achieved the number of subjects required according to their power calculation. The treatment was properly described and illustrated. However, there was no sham acupuncture group, and no blinding. From the perspective of a general practitioner (GP) in the National Health Service, how clinically significant is a treatment that gives benefit for <48 h, in a condition that settles spontaneously within a few days?\n\n▸ Sriprasert I, Suerungruang S, Athilarp P, et al .

    "abstract": "Traditional ideas about acupuncture are popular today in the West, where their presumed antiquity is an important part of their appeal. Enthusiasm for acupuncture is often coupled with condemnation of the ‘reductionism’ that is supposed to characterise modern medicine. Yet present-day Chinese researchers often wish to reconcile acupuncture with science; it is notable how many papers from China are now appearing in the pages of Acupuncture in Medicine. This approach is quite similar to that advocated by Felix Mann in the 1970s, which essentially regards acupuncture as a form of sensory stimulation that modifies the activity of the nervous system and relies on a modern understanding of anatomy and neurophysiology.1\n\nFrom this outline we see that there must have been a considerable shift in opinion in China in the fairly recent past. Hitherto there has been little information available to Westerners to explain how, when, and why this occurred. The gap in our knowledge has now been filled, thanks to a new book by Andrews,2 and the answers that she comes up with are surprising, to say the least. Anyone who thinks there was a more or less continuous progression in acupuncture from the earliest times to the present, perhaps with one or two temporary interruptions along the way, is in for a shock. What we see instead is a major discontinuity followed by a pretty radical reconstruction.\n\nAndrews is an associate professor of East …",

Firstly, the muscles at LI4 are innervated mostly by the C8 and T1 spinal nerve roots. We performed the interscalene blockade under ultrasound guidance, which significantly improves its success rate. Roots C8 and T1 can be clearly visualised by ultrasound and it has been reported that successful sensory and motor blockade can be achieved in 99% of patients following ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus blockade.3 Secondly, we assessed sensation and motor function after brachial plexus blockade and demonstrated these to be completely absent in 11 of 12 participants after brachial plexus blockade (table 1). Moreover, participants had no acupuncture sensation during electroacupuncture (EA) after brachial plexus blockade (in the EA+NB session).2 This suggests that roots C8 and T1 were blocked in most, if not all, participants in our …",

He could recount exactly the case details of the first person on whom he used penicillin—a young woman with a very serious eye infection, which would otherwise have killed her, but who recovered fully within 24 hours. For his generation of doctors, particularly facing the consequences of the war, the availability of antibiotics had a huge impact.\n\nAs soon as possible, Baldry was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps.

Since then acupuncture has become popular in the treatment of a variety of addictions ranging from tobacco to benzodiazapines and over 20 controlled trials have been reported, although the success rates have varied considerably. Suggested modes of action have included sympathetic inhibition, parasympathetic inhibition and endogenous opioid release. A possible site of action is the medullary locus caeruleus which affects fear and anxiety control.",

In view of the increasing interest in complementary medicine and the paucity of scientific information in this field, the need for further rigorous, controlled clinical trial is cogent",

No relationship was found, but overall there was a greater sensitivity on the left in 69.5% of subjects. Twenty patients (10 male and 10 female) were selected and tested both at Liver 3 and with electro-acupuncture to both ears. A clear relationship was found between the side of greater sensitivity at Liver 3 and the more sensitive ear to electro-stimulation. It is suggested that bilateral testing of Liver 3 could be a useful guide to the selection of the side for treatment in auriculo-therapy.",

Neurophysiological explanations, whilst still not wholly adequate, will eventually provide an accurate and adequate account of the processes involved. In contrast, scientific studies attempting to validate the existence of acupuncture meridians have been uniformly unsuccessful. Why then does this vitalistic concept persist in many acupuncture practices, even in the Western world? The answer is that it provides a credible model of the patient's symptoms and of the treatment procedure. Acceptance of this shared model strengthens the therapeutic relationship and is likely to facilitate the treatment process.",

In the present study the CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 was injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) to Wistar rats to see its effect on the analgesia induced by electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation. A marked potentiation of EA-induced analgesia was observed. This potentiation was more prominent when EA of higher frequency was used, showing a rank order of 100Hz &gt; 15Hz = 2/15Hz ≫ 2Hz. In a strain of rat with acoustically-evoked epileptic seizures (P77PMC rats), an extraordinarily strong analgesic effect was observed when EA of 100Hz was used; an effect similar to that in Wistar rats pre-treated with L-365,260. However, icv injected L-365,260 did not potentiate the analgesic effect induced by EA of any frequency in P77PMC rats. The results suggest that high frequency EA is more likely to increase the release of CCK-8 in the CNS as compared to low frequency EA; and also that P77PMC rats may have a functional deficit of the central CCK system probably due to a reduced rate of release of CCK-8 in the CNS, following EA stimulation.",

Fifty eight children have been treated using a combination of scalp acupuncture, soft laser therapy and intensive exercise.

Scalp acupuncture is more practical than body acupuncture as the needles are well out of the way and do not interfere with muscular movement. The neurological benefits are not confined to the development of more normal physical capacity, but extend also to an improvement in mental ability.",

The pharmacological treatment relies upon non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the acute stage, and prophylactic drugs in the chronic state to control the level of circulating uric acid. In traditional Chinese medicine an over-rich diet is thought to cause a build-up of damp and heat internally that causes phlegm to stagnate. There is also disturbance of the Spleen and Kidney. Treatment thus involves Spleen and Stomach acupuncture points (SP.3 and 6, and ST.36 and 40) to control heat and damp and reduce phlegm. Other local points are used according to the joint involved. A case history is discussed illustrating the treatment and a series of 10 patients is reported in which there is a 70% success in reducing the chronic level of serum uric acid and the frequency of acute attacks.",

    "abstract": "Background: Conventional therapy may be inadequate for many patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may be a viable alternative, but its effectiveness for axSpA is unknown. We are currently conducting a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of a TCM collaborative model of care (TCMCMC), which combines usual rheumatologic care with acupuncture for patients with axSpA. This nested qualitative sub-study aims to identify facilitators of and barriers to the implementation of the TCMCMC. Methods: We conducted individual in-depth interviews with participants who had completed the acupuncture regimen to elicit opinions on the facilitators of and barriers to the implementation of the TCMCMC. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Twelve participants were included, with data saturation occurring after 10 interviews. The analysis revealed both a number of important ‘facilitators’ and ‘barriers’. Facilitators to the implementation of the TCMCMC included effectiveness of TCM to relieve symptoms, inadequacy of conventional treatment and positive social perceptions of TCM. Barriers included scepticism towards TCM, inability of TCM to provide instant relief, needle-related discomfort, variable effectiveness of TCM influenced by physicians’ skills and experience and the high cost of TCM. Recommendations to overcome barriers included further patient education about TCM. Conclusion: Policymakers should take into account the various feasibility factors identified in this study when developing and implementing a TCMCMC.

    "abstract": "This report concerns a case that shows the apparent successful use of acupuncture and moxibustion in treating hypersexuality. The patient was a 60-year-old Chinese woman with a history of uraemia for 4 years and hypersexuality for 7 months, the latter being a rare condition. The presenting symptoms were persistent sexual desires and fantasies, in addition to being irritated when her continuous sexual urges could not be satisfied. In order to control her sexual desire the patient had tried almost all viable therapeutic methods, including use of sedatives, but the symptoms could not be mitigated any further even after consulting eight different hospital departments. However, after 10 days of acupuncture and moxibustion, all her symptoms related to the problem were resolved. A year later, she presented with a slight relapse with similar symptoms and was again treated with acupuncture and moxibustion, with subsequent resolution of symptoms. Over the following 2 years, such symptoms have not recurred. Based on the findings from this case, we conclude that use of acupuncture and moxibustion may be an effective treatment for hypersexuality in clinical practice.",

With rising use of complementary and alternative treatments by the public, and little in the way of good clinical evidence to support, or indeed, fund it, it seems like a good time to encourage more professionals and practitioners to discover their ‘inner scientist’, and learn the art of a conducting a good and fruitful research project.\n\nSo where do we start? Clinical Research In Complementary and Integrative Medicine, A Practical Training Book (CM Witt, K Linde) is a book written for this very purpose.

It has acquired international goodwill through its provision of financing or loans for infrastructure projects, trade agreements and major economic investments in these countries.1 Within this structure is the Human Resources Development Cooperation Program, sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce, China, from which multiple programmes related to several sectors of the Chinese economy (eg, the health sector) are offered.2 Under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce, the International Training Course on Clinical Application of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Tuina towards Developing Countries is organised by the International Exchange Center of Shanxi Provincial Health Department in Taiyuan.\n\nFirst introduced in 1998, the training course is held once or twice a year bringing together health professionals from several developing countries. The programme, which has trained about 700 healthcare professionals since its inception,2 aims at imparting knowledge on current practices in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and at fostering a strong and enduring friendship and cooperation between China and its developing country allies. It is structured in the form of lectures, demonstration classes, field trips and clinical attachments in hospitals. Apart from studies on acupuncture conducted by notable Nigerian anaesthetists like Professor Beatrice Umeh, the practice of acupuncture in Nigeria is yet to gain significant momentum. This article presents the author's bird's eye-view as a participant in the 2010 training module.\n\nOn 13 April 2010, the Nigerian delegation, led by me, embraced the chilly-cold spring weather at the Beijing International Airport from Abuja, Nigeria, en-route Taiyuan city, to participate in the 12th International Training on Clinical Application of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Tuina towards Developing Countries.

ISBN: 978-0-7020-3109-0.\n\n\n\n‘There is no doubt that our body is a moulded river’ (Novalis, cited on p 125)\n\nThis is an unusual book, by an osteopath who went on to train in acupuncture but felt dissatisfied with the usual explanatory models of both treatments. Three primary themes weave their way through his writing: movement, archetypal postures and meridians.\n\nAs an osteopath, his focus remains biomechanical—on shape, posture and movement (or ‘coherent changing of shape’). In attempting to understand how the body moves in a holistic way, he has developed the conventional ‘muscle chains’ of osteopathy into what he calls ‘contractile fields’ (CFs), primary patterns of movement that span the whole body, as against the elements of movement or the different muscles in isolation (the ‘dissective paradigm’). Although he sees his CF model as only a starting point in mapping the muscle matrix, he also rather pretentiously describes it as ‘an idea whose time has come’.\n\nThe opposite of movement is rest. Beach describes what he believes are the archetypal postures of human life, used throughout our evolution (and certainly before the evolution of the chair), and emphasises the importance of incorporating ‘floor living’ and ‘erectorcise’ (rising from the floor) into our modern lifestyle if we are to remain posturally healthy.\n\nThe author's third theme is that of the traditional meridians of Chinese medicine, not as conduits for qi and blood or mere mnemonics for point location, but as ‘emergent lines of shape control’. He suggests that the CFs underlie the traditional meridians of acupuncture, and that the acupoints were derived from the ‘hand-holds’ of manual (manipulative) therapy, a somewhat puzzling suggestion given that they have never been taught in this way …",

Acupuncture in critically ill patients improves delayed gastric emptying: a randomized controlled trial. Anesth Analg 2011;112:150–5.\n\n[OpenUrl][1][CrossRef][2][PubMed][3][Web of Science][4]\n\nRandomised controlled trial (RCT) of PC6 stimulation to promote gastric emptying (n=30).\n\n### Methods\n\nThirty mechanically ventilated neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients were recruited who had delayed gastric emptying, defined as a gastric residual volume (GRV) >500 ml for ≥2 days, after surgery for subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage or traumatic injury. They were randomised to two groups. The ‘acupuncture stimulation’ group had bilateral transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation at PC6 at 7 Hz and 7–13 mA depending on the patient's wrist size. This was given for one 30-min period daily then 5-min periods every 2 h. The conventional promotility drug treatment group (DTG) were given metoclopramide initially, followed, if unresponsive, with cisapride (until this drug was withdrawn from the market, after which erythromycin) over a period of 6 days. Patients in the stimulation group did not receive any conventional promotility drugs. Successful treatment (ie, tolerance of feeding) was defined as GRV <200 ml per 24 h.\n\n### Results\n\nDemographic and haemodynamic data were similar in both groups. After 5 days of treatment, 80% of patients in the PC6 stimulation group successfully developed feeding tolerance compared with 60% in the DTG group. GRVs are shown in figure 1 and there were significant differences between the groups (eg, p = 0.005 on day 1). Overall, the feeding balance in the PC6 stimulated group improved significantly on all days of treatment in comparison with the DTG group. Patients in the DTG group did not show an increase in feeding balance until day 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \nGastric residual volume per day.\n\n\n\n### Comment\n\nMalnutrition remains a severe problem in the recovery of critically ill patients and leads to increased in-hospital morbidity and in-hospital stay. Even though early enteral nutrition has been shown to improve overall patient outcomes in the ICU, tubefeed administration is often complicated by delayed gastric emptying and …\n\n [1]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DAnesth%2BAnalg%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1213%252FANE.0b013e3181fdfac8%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Apmid%252F21081772%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [2]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181fdfac8&link_type=DOI\n [3]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=21081772&link_type=MED&atom=%2Facupmed%2F29%2F2%2F154.atom\n [4]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=000285454300024&link_type=ISI",

    "abstract": "Objective Response of Chinese acupuncture compared to conservative orthopaedic treatment and unspecific needling in pain treatment on CSP. Design Prospective, randomized controlled trial with three blinded parallel groups; follow up three months. Setting Outpatients of 26 orthopaedists, who have attended a 140 hours training course on acupuncture. Patients Four hundred and twenty seven out-patients with a history of CSP ≥ six weeks, VAS ≥ 50 mm were selected; three random groups, six weeks treatment. 308 patients reported after three months follow up. Two strata: age 25–45 and age 46–65. Interventions Group 1: VAP: 15 treatments of verum acupuncture (VAP). Group 2: SHM: 15 treatments of non-specific needling, sham acupuncture (SHM). Group 3: COT: conventional conservative orthopaedic treatment (COT). Patients were blinded to allocation between verum and sham acupuncture. Main Outcome Measures Primary endpoint: pain reduction ≥ 50% on VAS three months after the end of the treatment protocol. Secondary endpoints: global assessments on a 4-score scale directly after the end of the treatment protocol. Results The results after three months follow up are: Highly significant effect of CAP over SHM and COT in the whole sample (P&lt;0.0001) and in Stratum1 (P&lt;0.001) and Stratum2 (P&lt;0.001).

    "abstract": "This review on auricular acupuncture (AA) represents something of a personal exploration for me. I was reasonably open minded when I attended Paul Nogier's historic course on AA for the BMAS in 1983, summarised by a fine cartoon portrait of the ‘great man’.1 Scepticism grew as this wonderfully charismatic person, his bald pate and long, impressive visage hanging forward over the lecture stand, recounted the birth of auriculotherapy. One day, he was examining an ear at the antihelix where it had been cauterised to treat low back pain; the sun slanted across it, casting into relief the segments of antihelix cartilage at that very spot: Nogier suddenly recognised its similarity to the segments of the lumbar spine—and AA was born. This story of serendipity did not have quite the same ring as Florey's Penicillium mould landing on a bacterial culture on a Petri dish.\n\nNogier then related how he worked out the correspondence between ear points and body sites (somatotopic representation), in the form of an upside-down fetus, based on patient examination, and one particular interpretation of the ear's innervation. An audience member politely enquired whether he had done any objective testing to confirm the correspondence, such as thyroid blood tests for thyroid points. Regretfully not. Credibility fell further the following day when we learnt that, apparently, the inverted image sometimes did not fit the patient. In which case the body could be upright, ‘phase II’. Or, then again, sometimes it is reversed from left to right, ‘phase III’. But there was no way of telling which one to apply when.\n\nOver the years since that event, I gradually came to believe that the AA story is half right: there is not much evidence (from anatomy, or from clinical studies) in support of any correspondence between ear points and …",

    "abstract": "Your readers will be aware of the serious military and political disturbances that have prevailed in Iraq in recent years and which led to severe deterioration in medical services. At the Red Crescent Hospital for Gynecology & Obstetrics in Baghdad, we suffered not only a prolonged shortage or absence of routine drugs used in anaesthesia (specifically suxamathonium, oxytocin and nitrous oxide) but also continued loss of qualified and assistant staff. Anaesthetists therefore found it necessary to use non-standard techniques for caesarean section, involving a high percentage of halothane despite its known effect of uterine relaxation.\n\nI am writing concerning my experience of using acupuncture techniques to counteract uterine relaxation during caesarean section, and in resuscitation of the newborn. In my series of 200 women anaesthetised in the period 2004–2006, 70% were primiparous and 30% had previous uterine scars. There was an average of 60 deliveries per day at the hospital of which about 40% required caesareans. It was more usual for women to have their babies at home as this was safer, given the dangers of crossing town, so only those …",

Published by Urban & Fischer (Elsevier), Munich (2008) 421 pages, €79.95 (hardback) 978-3-437-57970-7\n\nThis is a book of fundamental importance for the acupuncture profession. Most medical acupuncturists will be aware of the concepts of “segmental acupuncture” outlined by Bekkering and van Bussel.1 However, physiotherapists who practise acupuncture may be more familiar with trigger point therapy, and the majority of traditional acupuncturists will have little knowledge of either approach. All will benefit from reading this textbook which, as the subtitle claims, may well be a key to understanding many aspects of acupuncture, neural therapy (a method of treatment using local anaesthetic injections) and indeed manual therapy, in terms of Western anatomy. It will also be useful to other health professionals as an aid to diagnosis.\n\nDr Wancura is a highly experienced acupuncture practitioner, the co-author of several works on acupuncture since 1974, and involved in the study of the “forgotten knowledge” of segmental anatomy since 1965. The present book is the summation of her own knowledge on the subject, a comprehensive if not all-inclusive review of the extensive literature published in German (around 240 references), in comparison to which that available in English looks very minimal indeed! In fact, only 10 English language publications are listed here, although much of the author’s base material derives from works by Henry Head and James Mackenzie translated into German. (In all, nearly 7% of the references are translations from English. The proportion of papers translated from German in a comparable English textbook would be far less.)\n\nThe book is richly illustrated (116 illustrations, many in two or more parts) and divided into 10 chapters: (1) an introduction to the segments and metamerism; (2 and 3) on the role of the peripheral spinal and autonomic nervous systems in the segments; (4–7) on the dermatomes, myotomes, sclerotomes and enterotomes (viscerotomes); (8) on the connections within and between the …",

Patients hate the side effects of medication. I don’t treat patients with schizophrenia with acupuncture: would this book change my mind?\n\n\n\n\n\nA large collection of international experts have been drawn together to give their views on the diagnosis and medical treatment of the condition with a dedicated chapter on neuroimaging, which concludes only that schizophrenia is associated with frontal and temporal brain dysfunction. One quarter of the book is taken up with scientific discussion of the disease, which is covered well, but you have to ask yourself whether you would prefer to read this in a conventional medical textbook rather than a book on acupuncture.\n\nThe next two chapters look at sleep disturbance because “insomnia is associated with almost all psychiatric disorders” and a poor quality of life. An increase in total sleep with anti-psychotic medication, with an increase in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep …",

This yielded 23 articles reporting the use of BIS during evaluation of the effects of acupuncture. Except for the paper by Zheng et al 1 recently published in this journal, none of these articles mentioned the possible interaction of the acupuncture point stimulation procedure with EEG, which is the primary signal used in the BIS algorithm for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia. We present a clinical case which supports the concerns of Zheng et al on the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) on EEG.\n\nAfter giving informed consent, a 73-year-old woman received auricular EA during elective extracranial skin surgery. …",

As readers may recall, we were somewhat exercised by the NICE guidelines on osteoarthritis in 2008.1–3 NICE calculated the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture by comparing it with sham acupuncture. We argue that cost-effectiveness comparisons are only useful in making a decision about treatment if they compare treatments that are actually available. Therefore, they should have compared acupuncture with usual care, as they did with back pain.2 Recently, Latimer and colleagues4 showed what a dramatic difference it makes which control you select: acupuncture for osteoarthritis is clearly cost-effective against usual care, but not against sham acupuncture.\n\nNICE …",

The understanding of how acupuncture can modulate the pain experience has recently been enhanced by the elucidation of the role of C fibre afferents on the limbic system. C fibre deactivation of the limbic system can only occur in the presence of intact corticosubcortical neuronal pathways. The normal development of these pathways is determined by social factors in the early years of life. The effect of acupuncture treatment for low back pain may be determined by successful relationships between the mother and child in the first 18 months of life.",

The background to traditional herbal medicine and various forms of acupuncture encountered during their visit is discussed, as are some case histories. They report that clinical experience in China suggests that the combination of traditional Chinese and Western treatment techniques offers better results than either method alone.",

The prophylaxis of both these two types of headache involves reducing each of these various inputs and therefore a polytherapeutic approach is essential. The measures required include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and acupuncture. The aetiology and treatment of primary myofascial trigger point cephalaigia is also discussed.",

The overall response showed good or very good benefit for 29% of patients, while 44% had none. The most responsive age group was the 10 to 14 year olds with 50% success; there was no difference between boys and girls. Children with the most severe mental retardation and those with day time faecal and urinary incontinence responded less well. The benefit felt by the whole hospital community at the reduction of bed wetting was substantial. The author believes that acupuncture for enuresis in mentally and physically handicapped children is an effective and worthwhile treatment.",

Simple manual acupuncture treatment gave rapid pain relief, induced healing of the ulcer, and restored peripheral sensation.",

    "abstract": "The primary focus of many animal studies of electroacupuncture (EA) is on the overall effects of the treatment, without due consideration of the impact of how the needles are applied in animal models. Most experimental studies of EA use anaesthesia before needle insertion and electrical stimulation, or alternatively use restraining devices while the animals remain awake, either of which may confound the effects of the needling per se. In a recent study, Wang et al 1 reported that rats remained in a polyethylene cylinder during the application of EA, without the need for either restraints or anaesthesia. Based on this observation, and given the potential difficulties that may be encountered during the application of EA, we set out to create a novel bottle-based device to help facilitate administration of EA without the use of anaesthesia or restraints.\n\nA customised bottle device was fashioned out of a wooden board and six 500 mL polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles. The necks of the bottles were cut off, fixed to the wooden surface, and used as burrows (figure 1). The cut edge of each bottleneck was covered with electrical tape to avoid any injury. Using this device it was possible to stimulate up to six conscious animals simultaneously without anaesthesia or restraints, thus …",

    "abstract": "Background/Objective: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The most widely available treatment options to assist patients in smoking cessation are limited by side effects and moderate efficacy at best. Acupuncture may be an effective option for smoking cessation. The goal of this study was to establish the need for and interest in acupuncture therapy to potentially assist with smoking cessation from a patient perspective. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among patients aged 18 years or older whose medical record reported current tobacco use with English as their preferred language. REDCap surveys were administered to patients during office visits and included questions regarding opinions and use of all treatments available for smoking cessation (including acupuncture) as well as perceived barriers to acupuncture treatment. Results: A total of 57 surveys were distributed, and 42 (74%) were completed. Most patients reported previous attempts at quitting (76%) and had tried a variety of treatments including nicotine replacement (45%), Chantix (varenicline; 23%), Wellbutrin (bupriopion; 19%), “cold turkey” (65%) and hypnosis (3%). No respondents reported having tried acupuncture for smoking cessation. Conclusion: When comparing treatment options, patients reported more interest in acupuncture than other treatment options with a statistically significant difference in the level of interest between acupuncture and bupropion. All barriers (cost, time and effectiveness) were equally rated on a Likert-type scale with a median of 50 on a 101-point scale.",

The answers showed that 95% of GPs attending a course were using acupuncture as a treatment at least once a week, but 39% of hospital doctors had not practised acupuncture after their course. Point finding and the treatment of musculoskeletal pain were considered to be the most useful subjects in the course, while auricular and electro- acupuncture were the least popular. Those who had joined the BMAS thought that the most important functions of the Society were meeting other medical acupuncturists, attending further courses, and this Journal. The least important were accreditation and the availability of learning resources.",

There are various methods of deactivating MTrPs; that recommended is superficial dry needling. Pain referral patterns from facet joint and MTrP nociceptors are similar, so failure to obtain appreciable pain relief from MTrP deactivation necessitates a diagnostic, fluoroscopically controlled, facet joint block. Disc pain may occur either because of damage to the innervated annulus fibrosus of an intact disc, or because of nerve root pressure when a disc ruptures. Most whiplash patients (75%) become pain free within 3–6 months. The remainder are said to have the late whiplash syndrome. This was formerly thought to be due to neuroticism or compensation seeking avarice, but it is currently considered to have a genuine organic basis. Possible causes include overlooked facet joint damage, undetected disc damage and various self perpetuating MTrP pain persisting mechanisms.",

Changes in heart rate, stroke output and peripheral vascular resistance were measured, so that the degree of change could be charted for each acupuncture point. It became clear that certain groups of ear points induced a fall in blood pressure by influencing change in one or more of these cardiac parameters. The ear has a particularly rich nerve supply derived from several cranial and upper cervical nerves and it is possible to explain the hypotensive action of specific groups of acupuncture points by reference to their innervation. The most effective auricular acupuncture points for hypertensive patients of each circulation type can thus be accurately predicted.",

    "abstract": "It is not sufficiently well recognised that the reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and the myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) may develop concomitantly. This happens because they have similar aetiological factors, with trauma being by far the commonest. Everyone is liable to develop nociceptor pain as a result of trauma-induced activation and sensitisation of C afferent skin and Group IV muscle nociceptors; also A-β mediated pain as a result of the sensory afferent barrage produced by these nociceptors giving rise to sensitisation of dorsal horn transmission neurones. With most people these neural changes lead only to the development of MPS. In a minority of people, possibly those with a genetically determined predisposition, this sensory afferent barrage also causes changes to take place in the sympathetic nervous system, with the development of a characteristic burning type of sympathetically mediated pain. This may develop alone or in association with myofascial trigger point pain. There is much controversy concerning the mechanisms for development of RSDS pain. One theory is that the pain develops as a result of the nociceptor-induced sensory afferent barrage setting up aberrant sympathetic efferent activity. This results in the release of noradrenaline which binds to α-1 adrenoreceptors in the walls of the nociceptors, exciting them further. Much research, however, still has to be done before the development of sympathetically maintained pain can be adequately explained. It is stressed that for the successful treatment of RSDS early diagnosis is essential. Treatment involves sympathetic blockade either by the injection of local anaesthetic into a sympathetic ganglion, or by the regional infusion of a catecholamine depleting drug. Sympathetically maintained pain is morphine resistant and is therefore unlikely to be relieved by acupuncture, the analgesic effect of which is mediated by opioid peptides. The main place for acupuncture is in the treatment of concomitant myofascial trigger point pain. It is emphasised that in all cases of RSDS it is essential to search for myofascial trigger points and, when present, to deactivate these by means of acupuncture stimulation of A-δ nerve fibres present in the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the trigger point sites.",

As an alternative, medical acupuncturists have embraced the use of trigger points with enthusiasm. However, trigger point therapy is not always applicable; needling of non-tender areas is necessary and effective for many problems, particularly non-painful ones. A neutral terminology to describe needling of therapeutic zones is suggested. These “acupuncture treatment areas” will vary in size, and their effectiveness may depend on the accuracy with which they are defined and treated. The intention is to provide a purely descriptive, theory-neutral concept that will aid students to use forms of acupuncture based on many theories, without bewilderment.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is one of the oldest healing methods which is used in traditional medicine. in modern medicine we are witnessing a renaissance of this ancient treatment applied mainly in the management of chronic pain. A number of modern technological changes are being applied to replace, or modify, the classical needle treatment Among many of the modalities used at present are light, in the form of laser, and electrical stimulation. CODETRON TENS, the novel addition to Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), has been evaluated in a clinical trial, over a two year period, in a multidisciplinary pain clinic on patients who came for acupuncture therapy. Indications, effectiveness and experiences with this form of treatment are presented.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is indicated for a broad spectrum of painful and non-painful conditions. Medical acupuncture is the practice of therapeutic acupuncture by or under the direct supervision of a medical doctor. Integrated practice implies that the acupuncturist is fully trained and certified in both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Complementarity implies that the acupuncturist is a medical doctor who utilises this therapy in a competent, selective manner. Both models add to rather than detract from the practise of family medicine. Traditional Chinese concepts are discussed within the context of an integrated medical acupuncture practice in Canada.",

    "abstract": "Clinically, audit is the systematic, critical analysis of the quality of medical care. In order to indulge in audit it is necessary initially to identify an area of concern and define standards in that area. If there are none generally accepted in the field to be audited then they must be derived from a statement of the ideal situation, tempered with the expectation of current practice. The advantages of audit are that it encourages education by discussion, can identify the means of improving clinical efficiency and, most importantly, it aims to improve the quality of medical care. Audit is a pointless exercise unless it results in beneficial change. The circle should be completed by monitoring the audit after a suitable interval to assess the extent of any change in practice and to see if there has indeed been an acceptable improvement in quality. An audit of acupuncture practice in the rheumatology department of the Wycombe Health District resulted in better standardisation of acupuncture usage within the clinics and, by highlighting the degree of patient benefit from this treatment, a more enthusiastic acceptance of the technique by new members of the department. Improved care for patients was seen in the introduction of a check list of contraindications to acupuncture, better provision of information leaflets and explanation of side effects, and more detailed assessment of outcome with better communication with GPs. Following this positive experience of audit, it is seen as an essential tool in the delivery of modern medical care, despite the time, commitment and hard work that successful audit demands.",

The BMJ issue was the last of Dr Richard Smith, their editor retiring after 25 years. He chose to devote much of his final issue to articles complaining of the increasing and unnecessary assault course to be run for ethical committee approval in even the most simple of medical research projects. 2 The current 68 page application form is reputed to take over 40 hours to complete (a full working week for a medical secretary) at considerable financial cost. 3 The BMJ contributors were clearly of the opinion that the administrative burden was stifling research, and their leader writer noted that since audit studies are still relatively unregulated ‘much research is now conveniently rebadged as audit’. 4",

    "abstract": "I am a fifth year medical student at Leeds University and have just come back from my elective period visit to China. The aim of my elective was to gain experience in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly looking at acupuncture which had been an interest of mine, and which had prompted my trip to China so I could see it practised in its country of origin. When I arrived I was jetlagged and disorientated yet extremely excited about beginning my elective within a culture so different from my own. I struggled to hoist my luggage into the back of a taxi outside the airport and off we went on the hour-long drive into Shanghai city centre. As we got closer the neon colours got brighter and I became more and more anxious about how I would find my way to the hotel I had booked, not knowing a single word of Chinese. I was in luck when I happened to be dropped off fairly near to another large hotel which had an English speaking receptionist who guided me towards where I needed to be. Feeling quite vulnerable with a considerable amount of luggage, in a strange place that was now dark, I began the walk to my hotel. Crossing the road was a difficult task in itself as I have never experienced such busy, chaotic roads, filled with an array of vehicles including many more bicycles and motorbikes than I was used to. I was later told to be more wary of vehicles on two wheels than four when crossing the road. It became apparent that the two-wheeled vehicles did not follow the same rules as everyone else! The next day I had to get up pretty early to make it to my first session at the acupuncture department of Yue Yang Hospital. Yue Yang is an international teaching hospital, where people come from all over the world to learn more about the practice of TCM. The hospital uses about 30% Western medicine and 70% TCM in its treatment of patients, but there are only a few doctors with knowledge of Western medicine. Most of the doctors at the hospital are keen to spread information about TCM to other countries throughout the world. One of our mentors, Dr Dong, travels fairly regularly to America where he teaches Western doctors and TCM therapists how to perform acupuncture effectively following TCM principles. TCM doctors train for about five or six years to practise acupuncture and are all highly skilled and knowledgeable about the principles of diagnosis and treatment of disease using acupuncture as well as other therapies including herbal remedies. This is quite different from the UK where acupuncture can be practised without such extensive training and knowledge, which led me to wonder whether this was the same kind of acupuncture. We spoke a lot with doctors at the hospital during their lunch breaks. Doctors like Dr Dong who had travelled abroad told us that most of the acupuncture practised in the West is practised contrary to TCM principles, that is to say, according to the meridian system and theories of energy flow through the body. He told us that this could be dangerous and so part of his work involved travelling abroad to teach people the correct way to practise acupuncture. I was shocked to hear this, as I know many people who have received acupuncture here in the UK who have said that they have received much benefit from their treatment. I told Dr Dong this and he said that short term relief can often be gained from applying needles locally to a painful area, but that this effect would not last. He also said that applying needles to certain meridians may have adverse effects on other parts of the body which connect with the same meridian. I attended my first clinic which was run very differently from any clinic I had seen in the UK. Patients did not have appointments but formed a queue outside the room. About five or six patients could be treated at any one time on beds and chairs set up within a small room, which meant there was little privacy for any of them. This, however, did not appear to bother patients in the slightest, who would Sarah Wells medical student Leeds University, UK",

If true, this would be embarrassing for BMJ (publisher) and the BMAS (owner), and insulting to the reviewers and editorial board, all of whom are committed to AiM’s scientific integrity. I aim to counter Salzberg’s accusation with some facts from the journal activity in 2015/6, a period which covers the current and previous editors.\n\nThe usual meaning of a ‘fake’ journal is one whose editorial board and peer review system are fictional, whose funding is not transparent, and which accepts articles for publication simply because the author pays. So Salzberg accuses AiM’s publishers of ‘being more concerned about their bottom line than about scientific integrity’. But payment for open access is optional, reviewers and editors are blinded to payment, and payment was made for only 17% of AiM’s papers in 2015/6. The journal website2 will confirm the authenticity of AiM’s editorial boards and the transparency of its funding, and also show that the journal: is widely indexed, including by Medline; is a …",

    "abstract": "Background: This study examined the stratified anatomy of the traditional acupuncture point Jingbi and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus, and investigated neural pathways that could be affected by acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi. Methods: Twelve dissected specimens were used to study the pathway of an acupuncture needle inserted at Jingbi. The stratified anatomy and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus were studied. Our samples were grouped by gender and cause of death for comparative analysis. Results: All needles ( n = 24, on both sides of a total of 12 cadavers) punctured the anterior scalene muscle medial to the brachial plexus and external jugular vein, lateral to the phrenic nerve and internal jugular vein, and superior to the clavicle and subclavian artery/vein. The depth of needle insertion at Jingbi on the right side of male samples was 28.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 22.5–30.8) mm, which was approximately 8 mm deeper than for female subjects ( p &lt; 0.05). The needle was 3.0 (IQR, 2.0–5.0) mm and 7.0 (IQR, 5.5–8.0) mm medial to the brachial plexus on the left and right sides, respectively. Conclusion: Deep needle insertion at Jingbi can puncture the anterior scalene muscle. The mechanism of action of acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi might be related to its close relationship with the brachial plexus. Significant differences in needling depth were observed when our samples were grouped by gender. More studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is one of the main treatments for prostate cancer. Short-term ADT of between 6 months and 3 years is often used in combination with radiotherapy to treat localised and locally advanced prostate cancer. Permanent or intermittent ADT is used to treat metastatic disease. Hot flushes affect 44-80% of men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer, with around 27% saying they are the most distressing side effect.1 A recent UK survey found 30.7% of men treated with ADT reported moderate or major problems with hot flushes.2 Low testosterone levels are thought to cause dysfunction in thermoregulation in the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral vasodilatation.3 Symptoms include a feeling of warmth, flushing of the skin, perspiration, chills, anxiety and palpitations. A variety of treatments have been evaluated and there is evidence of efficacy for several of them, however they all have additional side effect profiles. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Association of Urology recommend offering medroxyprogesterone or cyproterone acetate.4-5 NICE has said there is currently a lack of evidence to support the use of complementary therapies. Addressing the side-effects of cancer treatment is one of the top ten Living with and Beyond Cancer research priorities established by the National Cancer Research Institute. However, there is little evidence on the standard of care that UK clinicians offer to men suffering with hot flushes.",

    "abstract": "joe@chan23.fsnet.co.uk Editor – We read with interest the study by Chan et al into the effect of needling HT7 on psychological stress in hospice staff. We agree that stress in hospice staff is an important problem and that a simple effective treatment would be useful. However, although Chan et al aimed to measure reductions in psychological stress, we feel that the outcome measure they chose was inappropriate. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale has not been validated as a measure of psychological stress in the general population and a fall to below 12 or 13 in their study population is meaningless as this threshold was determined in postpartum women. There have been numerous studies examining stress within hospice staff and the use of a previously used tool would have been more appropriate. The general health questionnaire (GHQ) is a widely used and acceptable method of establishing minor psychiatric illness in the general population and has also been validated for use in occupational settings. Chan et al do not comment on how they determined user friendliness. The 12 point GHQ takes on average less than 5 minutes to complete (the same time as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and is generally well received. We agree that a further, controlled study is now required but hope that a more appropriate outcome measure will be used.",

    "abstract": "Alon Lotan started his working career as a battlefield paramedic in the Israeli army. This was a fairly brutal introduction to the structure and function of the human body, and he started to wonder about alternative ways of treating the individual. Consequently, following his time in the army, he sought training in TCM. He developed an interest in the process of education, and, combined with skills as an illustrator, he embarked on a project to help acupuncture students in learning point location. The result is this guide, which he describes as the tool he was looking for when learning point location himself. As well as drawing on his own experiences, he travelled to 30 traditional schools across the US to compile relevant information. In a somewhat self-effacing way, he does not consider himself to be an author, but rather a composer of illustrations and notes. This book has an appearance unlike any other acupuncture point location guide. The most striking difference is in the novel diagrams used, and the space for the student’s notes alongside. The diagrams are very impressive line drawings that meld body surface outline with the relevant deeper, usually skeletal, structures. The diagrams illustrate appropriate orientations to facilitate practical point finding, and include all the relevant anatomical features for location. Another unique concept is the author’s suggestion that the student colour in the anatomical features in the diagrams. This is particularly sensible in regard of the blood vessels, usually arteries, included in some of the diagrams, as in their original form they are not prominent. Whilst the diagrams are, for the most part, excellent anatomical representations, this reviewer would have liked to see more features relevant to safety, for example, the brain and spinal cord, pleural and pericardial reflections, and the kidneys. The notes are clear and concise; however, there is no mention of needle angulation or depth, two parameters that are critical to safe needling. Indeed there are no notes of caution for needling at any of the dangerous points, with the exception of a comment that ST17 is a reference point only, and not for needling. This text does what it claims to do – aid the accurate location of acupuncture points. The diagrams are far superior to those in most of the existing point location guides. The book may be improved by the inclusion of ‘extra’ (i.e. nonmeridian) points, and would certainly be more valuable with the addition of graphical material and text that promote safe needling practice; however, as a point location guide, it is certainly one of the best on the market.",

    "abstract": "The cost of back pain in terms of morbidity and fall in income to patients, and loss of manpower to industry is remarkably high: it has been estimated that half the population has or has had backache. Thus a simple and efficacious treatment has been much sought after. A series of 115 patients with chronic backache seen in general practice over a period of 10 years was reviewed. They had all been treated with injection of corticosteroid in lignocaine to tender spots on the back. The men showed a progressive incidence of backache to their fifties, with reducing incidence in retirement, while the women had an even spread through all ages from puberty. The proportion responding to treatment was similar for all age groups and was unrelated to length of history. A good response to injection was reported by 54% of patients overall, but this was reduced to 41% if prolapsed disc had been diagnosed on x-ray. A second series of 57 patients with backache was investigated on a single-blind, randomised, controlled basis. Three groups were compared: lignocaine injection only, lignocaine with triamcinolone acetonide, and lignocaine with methylprednisolone acetate. There was no statistical difference between the two forms of corticosteroid, but there was a significantly greater benefit (p=0.001) from corticosteroid injection to tender spots in the back than from lignocaine injection alone.",

    "abstract": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, battlefield acupuncture (BFA) was offered to veterans with chronic pain in multidisciplinary group visits.We aimed to assess the impact of cessation of BFA due to COVID-19 and to determine the utility of different aspects of the group visits for chronic pain management.Participants who had attended at least three BFA group visits completed questionnaires assessing the impact of treatment interruption on pain, overall function and desire to resume treatment.Thirty-nine veterans were surveyed; 49% responded to the questionnaire. Ninety percent (17/19) agreed that BFA was an important part of pain management and that their pain had worsened after treatment interruption. Seventy-four percent (14/19) responded that they were taking more pain medications since BFA had ended. Ninety-five percent (18/19) responded that BFA improved daily function; 79% (15/19) agreed that BFA improved their sleep. Ninety-five percent (18/19) were interested in resuming BFA. Camaraderie was mentioned as the most helpful aspect of the group by 8/19 (42%) of participants. Participation of health psychology and nutrition were each mentioned as a most helpful aspect of the group by 5/19 (26%) of participants.Our results suggest that participants may have believed that BFA, camaraderie, and input from nutrition and health psychology services were important contributors to their pain control. The results also suggest that veterans may have suffered worsening pain, used more pain medications, and had worsening quality of sleep and daily function during the COVID-related clinic disruption, and that they were interested in resumption of the program.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Notalgia paraesthetica is a condition associated with itching, and unassociated with a rash, that affects a segment of the body innervated by T2-T6 dorsal spinal nerves. It is believed to be a type of neuropathy. This single-handed practice reports one such case. It also describes a further eight cases of “neurogenic” pruritus which share similar characteristics to this condition but are in segments of the body innervated by cervical and lumbar spinal nerves. Traditional acupuncture has been described to help with skin conditions and this study was performed to see if it was successful in this type of pruritus. Patients and Methods Over a nine-year period in a practice with an average list size of 2000 patients, nine patients aged 41 to 79 years presenting with segmental itching were identified. Other causes of pruritus were excluded by clinical examination, as well as by haematological and biochemical tests. Drug induced causes were also excluded. Duration of pruritus was six weeks (range 4 – 52 weeks). In eight patients itching was restricted to dermatomes innervated by the spinal nerves of the cervical spine, in two by the dorsal spine and in two by the lumbar spine. In three patients pruritus occurred in dermatomes innervated by two separate areas of the spine. Clinical examination revealed restricted cervical or lumbar movements in seven patients. Paravertebral tenderness and/or spasm of the paravertebral muscles was found in the areas of pruritus in seven patients. Skin changes associated with sympathetic nerve over-activity were noted in five patients. Six of the nine patients had x-ray evidence of degeneration of the spine. Results All nine patients were treated by deep intramuscular stimulation of the paravertebral muscles in the dermatomes affected by pruritus. In total a median of three treatments (range 2 – 5) was required to resolve the pruritus. Recurrence of symptoms occurred in four patients within 8 to 12 months of their last treatment over a period of follow-up of 0.5 – 9 years (median one year). Repeat acupuncture treatment resolved the pruritus. Discussion The term neurogenic pruritus describes and encompasses all conditions associated with segmental itching unassociated with a rash. The clinical signs of this condition are suggestive of an early neuropathy as a result of a degenerative condition of the spine. This is the first report of symptoms of such a condition being treated successfully by acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long recognised the use of acupuncture in psychological medicine. Classically the acupuncture meridians or channels are each linked to particular emotions, for example, joy and sadness (heart channel), panic and anxiety (kidney channel), anger and frustration (liver channel). By correct diagnosis, acupuncture intervention can be useful in the restoration of emotional well-being. Today it is realised that this restoration of emotional health is due to neuromodulation at the higher centres. Results of the NIH funded depression study by Allen, Hitt and Schnyer (1998) were encouraging. The study demonstrated acupoint specificity (p &lt; 0.05) for mood disorders. Unfortunately, the study was single blinded. This study is based on the NIH study. The research team hoped to reproduce the significant results achieved then. With laser as the modality, the advantages were obvious: non-invasive modality, randomised double blind control achievable, no infection risk and ease of training community-based doctors to utilise the technique. Method This pilot study utilised laser acupuncture in an outpatient population with mild to moderately severe depression with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale of 12 to 30. Normal was less than or equal to BDI of 10. Recruitment was through family practices (called general practices in Australia) and newspapers. Recruits were each screened by a psychiatrist to confirm their suitability. They were then randomised into sham laser and true laser groups. Each patient received twice a week sessions for a month, followed by once a week sessions for another month. BDI scores were taken fortnightly to ensure none of the patients deteriorated. The acupuncturist was also blinded. BDIs were repeated at one month and three months post laser. Results Thirty patients were recruited and randomised into true and sham laser. Four patients were withdrawn, two from each arm of the study. The rest completed the laser sessions. Of those who completed the study, one patient did not respond to any of the post laser follow up BDI requests. Another patient did not complete the three-month follow up BDI. Results showed a markedly significant improvement in the active group (p&lt; 0.001) at the end of the course of treatment with a sustained difference one month after treatment (p&lt;0.05). Discussion The markedly significant results were unexpected. They do however make laser acupuncture a serious contender as a third standard management option in the treatment of depression in the community. Laser acupuncture could stand alone, or be used together with counselling, psychotherapy or drug therapy. These latter areas of mixed management need to be explored. In the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Programme over 30% of participants terminated treatment early due to adverse effects, lack of improvement or desire to change therapies. These were based on psychological and/or pharmacological treatments. Patients were obviously searching for more satisfactory treatments, non-chemical in nature and without adverse effects. An important point to note from this laser study is that the series of treatments maintained their significance for the month after completion. This suggested that follow-up or maintenance laser acupuncture sessions were important for patient well-being and the one month mark could be indicative of appropriate timing. The research team recommends larger and more specific studies to confirm these findings and explore the wider clinical implications. The team is keen to perform a multicentre study but is restricted by funding issues.",

They are the first in a series planned to investigate acupuncture in this area of gynaecology. 1. A high impedance in the blood flow of the uterine arteries has been shown to reduce the pregnancy rate of in-vitro fertilisation treatment. So ten healthy, but infertile, women with a high uterine artery pulsatility index were treated with electroacupuncture twice a week over a period of four weeks. There was a significant reduction (p&lt;0.0001) in pulsatility index that was maintained for a further two weeks. 2. Twenty-four women with polycystic ovary syndrome were treated with electroacupuncture over a period of three months. Ovulation patterns were observed by daily recording of basal body temperature over nine months, including three months before treatment and three after. The main outcome was that electroacupuncture induced regular ovulation in more than a third of the women. The women were found to fall into two categories: a group in whom regular ovulation was induced following electroacupuncture who were less androgenic and had less metabolic disturbance, and a group who were more affected by the syndrome and who did not respond to treatment.",

However, following the successful treatment of a very severely affected patient who had suffered more than 15 recurrences per year, an alternative regime was instituted. This involved body acupuncture to immunomodulating points, direct irradiation of the herpetic lesions with He-Ne laser, daily application of aloe vera extract, and specific dietary restrictions. Using this regime they report complete recovery, with no herpetic recurrence for more than a year, in up to 83% of their patients. They also measured immunological parameters before and after treatment, finding that: serum IgG, C3 complement fraction, and the protease inhibitors α1-antitripsin and α2-macroglobulin all increase, while secretory IgA and C3 complement fraction in urine normalise. These preliminary results have encouraged continuation of the clinical trials of this method.",

The indications discussed are: metatarsal fracture, bruised finger, headache, pain in the hypochondrium, and abdominal Herpes zoster. Its use in these cases is shown to illustrate four important principles of treatment: select lower points for upper diseases, use points on the right for symptoms on the left and vice versa, restrict needling to few but effective points, and apply one point to many purposes.",

Pain relief was the reason for 76.4% of treatments. The condition of no patient in the 500 worsened following therapy, and 18 patients suffering from malignant disease all obtained beneficial symptomatic relief. The High Frequency Ozone Therapy apparatus uses a variety of electrodes ranging from simple probes to elaborate brush or comb devices for application directly on the skin surface or aerially above it. Treatment is most effective if given through a layer of natural textile (wool or cotton). Stimulation through synthetic material, however, may provoke pain.",

The course involved 137 hours of lectures, mainly on traditional Chinese medicine, but covering electroacupuncture analgesia, ear and scalp acupuncture, plum-blossom needling, cupping and Qigong The 168 hours of classical training was in small groups at one of the ten Beijing hospitals or at the centre's clinics. Having completed the course and found it a clinical experience difficult to rival, the author suggests that much of benefit has been lost from traditional acupuncture in its westernisation.",

Acute treatment is rarely successful; avoidance of exposure to the sun is isolating for the patient; and prophylaxis is too prolonged or unsafe. According to traditional Chinese pathogenic understanding, acupuncture seems to be the treatment of choice for improving symptoms of superficial heat energy. A maximum of 3 sessions over 3 days using acupoints L1.11 and SP.10 led to significant improvement of acute symptoms within 2 days. This treatment was effective for several weeks, including exposure to the sun, for all 4 patients observed over the whole season. Thus acupuncture should be integrated in the dermatological treatment of so-called solar allergy.",

It is usually the result of trauma to the affected limb, which may be quite minor. Three stages of the syndrome are described, associated with increasingly severe symptoms and deterioration of prognosis. Sympathetic blockade is probably the treatment of choice, although acupuncture can be beneficial in the early stages. To be effective, treatment must be started early as the physical changes may become irreversible.",

Free airflow, away from patients and attendants should be ensured during moxibustion. Wherever possible, an alternative heat source such as a lighter, should be used for acubustion. The use of a suitable antihistamine for prophylaxis is recommended whenever moxibustion must be applied to individuals or by acupuncturists with allergic tendencies.",

Electrostimulation was begun about 30 minutes before the start of shock-wave lithotripsy and continued until the end of treatment. The number of shock waves varied between 400 and 1200 per patient. The favourable results obtained with the above method may be compared with those obtained with classical epidural anaesthesia as well as with drug premedication with Droperidol, Fentanyl, and Diazepam. The good sedative and analgesic effect which was obtained by acupuncture widens its field of application.",
