    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop and validate a method for identifying Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes by using Medicare claims data. We used self-reports of diabetes status from participants in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to determine disease status, and then we examined these participants' Medicare claims. Using self-reported diabetes status as the \"gold standard,\" we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of claims data in identifying beneficiaries with diabetes. We found that to construct a method that is adequately sensitive (> or = 70%), highly specific (> or = 97.5%), and reliable (kappa > or = 0.80), researchers must combine information from different types of Medicare claims files, use 2 years of data to identify cases, and require at least 2 diagnoses of diabetes among claims involving ambulatory care. Since these criteria are met by more than one method, the choice of method should be governed by the goals of the research as well as more practical concerns.",

    "abstract": "Clinical vignette-based surveys have been used for more than 30 years to measure variation in physicians' approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with similar health problems. Vignettes offer advantages over medical record reviews, analysis of claims data, and standardized patients. A vignette-based survey can be completed more quickly than a record review or standardized patient program. Research has shown that vignette-based surveys produce better measures of quality of care than medical record reviews when used to measure differential diagnosis, selection of tests, and treatment decisions. Although standardized patients are preferred when measuring communication and physical examination skills, vignettes are more cost-effective than standardized patients when assessing clinical physicians' decision making. Vignettes offer better opportunities to isolate physicians' decision making and to control case-mix variation than do analyses of claims data sets. Clinical vignette-based surveys are simple and economical tools that can be used to characterize physicians' practice variation.",

Using a data set of an urban teaching hospital patient discharges, this study aimed to determine whether a significant effect of neighborhood characteristics, measured by the Area Deprivation Index, could be observed on patients' readmission risk, independent of patient-level clinical and demographic factors. This study found that patients residing in more disadvantaged neighborhoods had significantly higher 30-day readmission risks compared to those living in less disadvantaged neighborhoods, even after accounting for individual-level factors. Those who lived in the most extremely socioeconomically challenged neighborhoods were 70% more likely to be readmitted than their counterparts who lived in less disadvantaged neighborhoods. These findings suggest that neighborhood-level factors should be considered along with individual-level factors in future work on adjustment of quality metrics for social risk factors.",

Out of 3743 references, the authors included 157 cross-sectional studies evaluating 7891 websites using 13 readability scales. The mean readability grade level across websites ranged from grade 10 to 15 based on the different scales. Stratification by specialty, health condition, and type of organization producing information revealed the same findings. In conclusion, online health information in the United States and Canada has a readability level that is inappropriate for general public use.

The Veterans Health Study (VHS) was designed to assist the VA in monitoring outcomes and measuring the case mix of patients who use the VA. The Veterans SF-36 (short form functional status assessment for veterans) was administered to 2425 veterans receiving ambulatory care. Measures of the Veterans SF-36 were strongly correlated with sociodemographics and morbidities of the veterans. Young veterans had poorer mental health status than older veterans. Veterans who used ambulatory care in the VHS reported lower levels of health status, reflecting more disease than a non-VA civilian population. These measures of health are important indicators of the disease burden or case mix of the patients and are pertinent to health systems such as the VA for resource allocation decisions and as outcomes of care.",

Reported rates of turnover vary widely, both because of differences in reporting methods and by type of healthcare organization and provider. A common contributor to turnover is a mismatch between physicians' expectations and organizational culture or rules, although greater understanding of ways to assess and to predict such mismatch is needed. The costs and consequences of physician turnover are substantial and may include: (a) financial consequences, (b) effects on patient satisfaction, and (c) effects on the organization or practice as a whole, related to the experience of other healthcare providers, and effects on institutional public relations. Our review suggests that greater attention to physician turnover is needed to clarify its frequency and predictors, and strategies to lessen its occurrence.",

DRG-based algorithms had significantly lower hospital admission rates (57% and 65% vs 73.2%), lower 30-day mortality (5.0% and 5.8% vs 10.7%), shorter length of stay (3.9 and 4.1 days vs 5.6 days), and lower costs (US $4543 and US $5159 vs US $8585). Claims-based identification algorithms for defining pneumonia in administrative databases are imprecise. ICD-9-based algorithms did not influence patient variables in our population.

Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for identification of MHC varied by algorithm (0.65-0.86, 0.68-0.77, respectively). PPV was optimized by requiring ≥2 instances of MHC ICD-9 codes or by only accepting codes from mental health visits. NPV was optimized by supplementing VHA data with Medicare data.

    "abstract": "Patient experience is one of key domains of value-based purchasing that can serve as a measure of quality and be used to improve the delivery of health services. The aims of this study are to explore patient perceptions of quality of health care and to understand how perceptions may differ by settings and condition. A systematic review of multiple databases was conducted for studies targeting patient perceptions of quality of care. Two reviewers screened and extracted data independently. Data synthesis was performed following a meta-narrative approach. A total of 36 studies were included that identified 10 quality dimensions perceived by patients: communication, access, shared decision making, provider knowledge and skills, physical environment, patient education, electronic medical record, pain control, discharge process, and preventive services. These dimensions can be used in planning and evaluating health care delivery. Future research should evaluate the effect of interventions targeting patient experience on patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Favorable patient experience and low complication rates have been proposed as essential components of patient-centered medical care. Patients' perception of care is a key performance metric and is used to determine payments to hospitals. It is unclear if there is a correlation between technical quality of care and patient satisfaction. The study authors correlated patient perceptions of care measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores with accepted quality of care indicators. The Hospital Compare database (4605 hospitals) was used to examine complication rates and patient-reported experience for hospitals across the nation in 2011. The majority of the correlations demonstrated an inverse relationship between patient experience and complication rates. This negative correlation suggests that reducing these complications can lead to a better hospital experience. Overall, these results suggest that patient experience is generally correlated with the quality of care provided.",

Although this technology can provide opportunities in diagnosis and treatment processes, there still may be challenges and pitfalls related to various safety concerns. To shed light on such opportunities and challenges, this article reviews AI in health care along with its implication for safety. To provide safer technology through AI, this study shows that safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards are key strategies, whereas cost, risk, and uncertainty should be identified for all potential technical systems. It is also suggested that clear guidance and protocols should be identified and shared with all stakeholders to develop and adopt safer AI applications in the health care context.",

The Delphi technique was employed to obtain consensus and rank order responses. Patients perceived survey length to be important, whereas providers and administrators perceived time to collect data and patient health literacy, respectively, as the greatest barriers to PRO implementation. The greatest perceived benefits were the ability to track changes in clinical symptoms over time, improved quality of care, and better disease control among patients, providers, and administrators, respectively. These results may guide the development of novel frameworks for PRO implementation by addressing perceived barriers and building on the perceived benefits to encourage adoption of PROs.",

The annual mean rate of BSIs dropped from 2.5 infections/1000 catheter-days in 2004 to 0.76 in 2013. A subset analysis found nearly double the percentage of ICUs with a mean rate of <1 infection/1000 catheter-days in 2013 compared with baseline.

Disability was associated with higher age-adjusted rates of: poverty; living alone; low education; inability to work; obesity; and being frequently depressed or anxious. Disabled women generally reported screening and preventive services at rates comparable to all women. Women with major lower extremity mobility difficulties had much lower adjusted odds of Papanicolaou smears (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.9), mammograms (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9), and smoking queries (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.8).

To accomplish this goal, the VHA has organized more than 100 different quality improvement activities according to a structure-, process-, and outcomes-focused quality management accountability framework (QMAF) that targets 10 interrelated dimensions of quality management (QM). Each of these dimensions utilizes a defined strategy and employs a menu of quality assessment and assurance tactics.

We calculated agreement, sensitivity, and specificity for the chart versus several administrative data-based algorithms. Using 1999 data and requiring 1 administrative diagnosis, observed agreement ranged from 0.98 (atrial fibrillation) to 0.85 (hyperlipidemia), and kappas were generally high. Sensitivity varied from 38% (tobacco use) to 97% (diabetes); specificity exceeded 91% for 10 of 11 diagnoses. Requiring 2 years of data and 2 diagnoses improved most measures, with minimal sensitivity decrease. Agreement between the database and charts was good.

A group-oriented culture had a significant positive correlation with CQI implementation, whereas hierarchical and rational culture types were negatively correlated with CQI implementation.

A group-oriented culture and a greater extent of CQI implementation were positively (but not significantly) associated with the estimated overall percentage of MAEs reported.

    "abstract": "The use of \"clinical\" versus \"administrative\" data sets for health care quality assessment continues to be debated. This study directly compares the University HealthSystem Consortium Clinical Database (UHC CDB) and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) in terms of their assessment of complications and death for 26 322 surgery patients using analyses of variance, correlation, and multivariable logistic regression. The NSQIP had more variables with significant correlation with outcomes. The NSQIP was better at predicting death (c-index 0.94 vs 0.90, P < .05) and complications (c-index 0.78 vs 0.76, P = .07), especially for higher risk patients. The UHC CDB missed and misclassified several major complications. The data sets are similar in their explanatory power relative to outcomes, but the clinical data set is better, particularly at identifying higher risk patients and specific complications. It should prove more useful for initiating and monitoring clinical process improvements because of more clinically relevant variables.",

This article presents the results of a 12-month multicenter collaboration assessing HH compliance rates at US health care facilities by measuring product usage and providing feedback about HH compliance. Our results show that HH compliance at baseline was 26% for intensive care units (ICUs) and 36% for non-ICUs. After 12 months of measuring product usage and providing feedback, compliance increased to 37% for ICUs and 51% for non-ICUs. (ICU,P = .0119; non-ICU,P < .001). HH compliance in the United States can increase when monitoring is combined with feedback. However, HH still occurs at or below 50% compli- ance for both ICUs and non-ICUs.",

It is anticipated that the availability of EHR-extracted data will allow quality assessment without the expensive and time-consuming process of medical record abstraction. A review of the data requirements for the indicators in the Quality Assessment Tools system suggests that only about a third of the indicators would be readily accessible from EHR data. Other factors involving complexity of required data elements, provider documentation habits, and EHR variability make the task of quality measurement more difficult than may be appreciated. Accurately identifying eligible cases for quality assessment and validly scoring those cases with EHR-extracted data will pose significant challenges but could potentially plummet the cost and therefore expand the use of quality assessment.",

Students were able to identify many of the teamwork and communication problems entrenched in our current health care culture. Interactive learning was important to the learning process and, on evaluation, deemed a valuable experience.

Satisfaction data were collected from the federally mandated Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey for 4349 adult patients admitted to any surgical unit over an 18-month period. Patients' perceptions of pain control and staff's efforts to control pain were associated with their overall satisfaction scores. These perceptions varied widely among services and nursing units. Interestingly, patient satisfaction was more strongly correlated with the perception that caregivers did everything they could to control pain than with pain actually being well controlled. The odds of a patient being satisfied were 4.86 times greater if pain was controlled and 9.92 times greater if the staff performance was appropriate. Hospitals may improve their patients' satisfaction by focusing on improving the culture of pain management.",

Cases were selected from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program local database. Of 1840 cases, 156 patients (8.5%) were readmitted within 30 days of the procedure. Surgical site infection was the most common readmission cause (32%), followed by obstruction or ileus (17%). IRR was moderate for readmission cause (60% agreement, κ = 0.51), substantial for readmission in relation to surgical procedure (92%, κ = 0.70), and lowest for potential preventability of readmissions (57%, κ = 0.18). Results suggest that readmission cause and relation to surgical procedure can be determined with moderate to high degree of IRR, while preventability of readmissions may require stricter definitions to improve IRR.",

The authors conducted an exploratory quantitative analysis of hospitals' Facebook pages to assess whether Facebook \"Likes\" were associated with hospital quality and patient satisfaction. The 30-day mortality rates and patient recommendation rates were used to quantify hospital quality and patient satisfaction; these variables were correlated with Facebook data for 40 hospitals near New York, NY. The results showed that Facebook \"Likes\" have a strong negative association with 30-day mortality rates and are positively associated with patient recommendation. These exploratory findings suggest that the number of Facebook \"Likes\" for a hospital may serve as an indicator of hospital quality and patient satisfaction. These findings have implications for researchers and hospitals looking for a quick and widely available measure of these traditional indicators.",

Quality decreased significantly when summary length exceeded 2 pages and when the delay from patient discharge to summary delivery increased. Summary content that increased quality most included admission diagnosis (mean 8.2; 95% confidence interval [7.7, 8.61]), pertinent physical examination findings (6.6 [6.0, 7.2]) and laboratory results (6.8 [6.3, 7.4]), procedures (7.1 [6.7, 7.61]) and complications in hospital (7.1 [6.6, 7.51]), discharge diagnosis (8.8 [8.4,9.1]), discharge medications (7.9 [7.4, 8.41]), active medical problems at discharge (7.8 [7.4, 8.21]), and follow up (6.6 [6.0, 7.11]).

    "abstract": "Because the identification and reporting of medication administration errors (MAE) is a nonautomated and voluntary process, it is important to understand potential barriers to MAE reporting. This paper describes and analyzes a survey instrument designed to assist in evaluating the relative importance of 15 different potential MAE-reporting barriers. Based on the responses of over 1300 nurses and a confirmatory LISREL analysis, the 15 potential barriers are combined into 4 subscales: Disagreement Over Error, Reporting Effort, Fear, and Administrative Response. The psychometric properties of this instrument and descriptive profiles are presented. Specific suggestions for enhancing MAE reporting are discussed.",

Using multigroup structural equation modeling, the results supported the model's robustness. Physician service, waiting time, and nursing satisfaction explained 48%, 41%, and 11% of overall satisfaction plus 92% and 93% of female and male satisfaction, respectively. Unit increases in physician service satisfaction increased waiting time, nursing, and overall satisfaction by 0.991, 0.844, and 1.031 units, respectively. Unit increases in waiting time satisfaction increased nursing and overall satisfaction by 0.417 and 0.685 units, respectively. A unit increase in nursing satisfaction increased overall service satisfaction by 0.221 units. The investigation offers an alternative paradigm for measuring and achieving emergency department satisfaction, hierarchically related to patient expectations, where the primary provider has the greatest clinical utility to patients, followed by waiting for the primary provider, and then by nursing service.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes care, morbidity, and mortality are usually worse in poor minority populations compared with non-minority ones. This report evaluates evidence-based process and outcome measures of diabetes care in diabetic patients followed in a free medical clinic and compares them to published results. The following process measures compared favorably with measures of the general population: dilated eye and foot exams and measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels; concentrations of total cholesterol; fasting triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; and proteinuria (by dipstick). Process and outcome measures in 89 diabetic patients referred to a Diabetes Management Program in which diabetes care was delivered by pharmacists following detailed algorithms (experimental group) were compared with measures in 92 diabetic patients who received diabetes care in the general clinic setting (control group). The patients in the experimental group had a slightly longer duration of diabetes and more microvascular and neuropathic complications, and more diabetic patients were taking insulin than were patients in the control group. All of the process measures listed above were more frequent in the experimental group. Compared with the control group, the initial glycated hemoglobin level (% +/- SE) in the experimental group was significantly (P < .001) higher (8.8 +/- 0.2 versus 7.9 +/- 0.2) but fell significantly (P < .03) more (-0.8 +/- 0.2 versus -0.05 +/- 0.3). The lack of a greater decrease in the glycated hemoglobin levels in the experimental group was not related to the inability of the pharmacists to follow the algorithms, the patients' refusal to follow the recommended medication adjustments, or the lack of appropriate self-monitoring of blood glucose in insulin-requiring patients. It was inversely related (r = -0.36, P < .03) to the number of missed visits, i.e., the greater the number of broken appointments, the less the glycated hemoglobin fell. In conclusion, diabetes care for a poor minority population in a free clinic setting can compare favorably to care in the general population. Pharmacists following detailed algorithms can enhance this care further. Administrative and support system changes that minimize the number of missed visits might further improve diabetes care in this population.",

No significant relationships existed between JCAHO categorical accreditation decisions and IQI/PSI performance. Few relationships exist between JCAHO scores and IQI/PSI performance.

Unplanned reoperations occurred frequently after vascular (6.5%) and colon surgery (5.7%) and were caused predominantly by errors in surgical technique (70%) and patients' comorbidities (21%). Mortality for patients requiring unplanned reoperations was significantly higher than for patients who did not require reoperations (10.3% versus 4.0%). Unplanned reoperation rates can be an indicator of quality of care. However, a prospective, well-defined registry is essential to ensure an accurate assessment of the quality of care provided.",

Most errors were omissions errors (48.8%) and the source was administration (54%) or transcription errors (38%). Variables associated with a medication error included unique number of medications (polypharmacy), patient gender and race, RN staffing changes, medical and nursing interventions, and specific pharmacological agents.

Average LOS was 2.5 days longer, and charges were $17 194 higher for the transfused cohort (P < .0001). Odds of death were 1.7 times higher (P < .0001) and odds of infection 1.9 times higher (P < .0001) for the transfused cohort. Increased provider awareness and recognition of the frequency and potential negative outcomes of blood products transfusion may encourage the adoption of novel approaches to minimize intraoperative and early postoperative bleeding, reduce transfusion requirements, and most important, improve patient-level postoperative outcomes and health-related quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Leadership walkrounds (WRs) are widely used in health care organizations to improve patient safety. This retrospective, cross-sectional study evaluated the association between WRs and caregiver assessments of patient safety climate and patient safety risk reduction across 49 hospitals in a nonprofit health care system. Linear regression analyses using units' participation in WRs were conducted. Survey results from 706 hospital units revealed that units with ≥60% of caregivers reporting exposure to at least 1 WR had a significantly higher safety climate, greater patient safety risk reduction, and a higher proportion of feedback on actions taken as a result of WRs compared with those units with <60% of caregivers reporting exposure to WRs. WR participation at the unit level reflects a frequency effect as a function of units with none/low, medium, and high leadership WR exposure.",

Resident physicians are often at the front lines of providing care for patients. In many instances, however, QI and PS initiatives exclude trainees. By aligning the goals of the health system with those of the residency program to engage residents in QI and PS projects, there is a unique opportunity to fulfill both a corporate and educational mission to improve patient care. Here, the authors briefly describe one residency program's educational curriculum to provide foundational knowledge in QI and PS to all its trainees and highlight a resident team-based project that applied principles of lean thinking to evaluate the process of responding to an in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. This approach provided residents with a practical experience but also presented an opportunity for trainees to align with the health system's approach to improving quality and safety.",

The feasibility of characterizing safety culture in EMS was evaluated by examining response rate, item missingness, EMS chief administrators' perceptions of the EMS-SAQ, as well as psychometric properties.The results confirm feasibility with a high response rate, acceptable internal consistency, and model fit validity. However, some agencies voiced concerns about respondent burden and the wording and face validity of several EMS-SAQ items. Variation in safety culture scores across EMS agencies within a single geographic area, as well as variation across respondent characteristics, warrants further investigation.",

One study each also measured time to first intervention, restraint use, overnight transfusions, and out-of-hours deteriorations. Studies that reported funding had higher quality scores.

As health care costs continue to rise, providers are pressed to deliver efficient, high-quality care at flat to minimally increasing rates. Inherent systemwide inefficiencies between payers and providers at various clinical settings pose a daunting task for enhancing collaboration and care coordination. A change from Medicare's fee-for-service reimbursement model to bundled payments offers one avenue for resolution. Pilots using such payment models have realized varying degrees of success, leading to the development and upcoming implementation of a bundled payment initiative led by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Delivery integration is critical to ensure high-quality care at affordable costs across the system. Providers and payers able to adapt to the newly proposed models of payment will benefit from achieving cost reductions and improved patient outcomes and realize a competitive advantage.",

A total of 515 637 respondents from 1052 hospitals completed the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Nine organizational factors were tested as predictors of error reporting using weighted least-squares multiple regression. Error feedback was perceived as the most significant predictor, while organizational learning was another significant factor. It also was found that although management support for patient safety was significantly related to error reporting among clinical staff, this association was not significant among management. This difference is relevant because managers may not be aware that their failure to demonstrate support for safety leads to underreporting by frontline clinical staff. Findings from this study can inform hospitals' efforts to increase error reporting.",

The group process was facilitated by the Infection Director and the quality management specialist. The group was made of medical, nursing, and respiratory therapy staff. Quality improvement techniques were used to define the process of care for ventilated patients in the ICU. \"State of the art\" care was defined after a literature review and brainstorming sessions. Current practice and new concepts were then forged into a realistic protocol for the ICU. The resulting protocol was introduced into the ICU in May 1992. The information was communicated to Respiratory Therapy and ICU staff in writing and at department meetings. After a 4-month introductory period and learning curve process, a decrease in the endemic rate of ventilator-associated LRI was reduced in the fourth quarter of 1992. The mean 1993 LRI rate was 21 LRI/1000 ventilator days versus 26 LRI/1000 ventilator days in 1992 before protocol implementation. This equates to 18 LRI prevented in 1993. This represents a savings of $126,000. There was a significant decrease in the process variation of the monthly mean LRI/1000 ventilator days in 1993 from 1992. To date, there continues to be improvement with a mean of 16 LRI/1000 ventilator days reported in 1994. The ICU staff developed a multidisciplinary process evaluation and monitored staff implementation of the protocol over time. The results of the evaluation were used as feedback to measure protocol implementation. This was found to improve compliance with the protocol. Both the process (care of ventilated patients) and the outcome (number of LRI) have been improved through use of continuous quality improvement concepts and transdisciplinary interventions.",

We randomly sampled 991 adults who underwent elective open diskectomies at 30 nonfederal acute care hospitals in California. Postoperative complications were specified by reviewing medical literature and by consulting clinical experts. We compared hospital-reported ICD-9-CM data and independently recoded ICD-9-CM data with complications abstracted by clinicians using detailed criteria. Recoded ICD-9-CM data were more likely than hospital-reported ICD-9-CM data to capture true complications, when they occurred, but they also mislabeled more patients who never experienced clinically significant complications. This finding was most evident for mild or ambiguous complications, such as atelectasis, posthemorrhagic anemia, and hypotension. Overall, recoded ICD-9-CM data captured 47% and 56% of all mild and severe complications, respectively, whereas hospital reported ICD-9-CM data captured only 37% and 44%, respectively, of all mild and severe complications. These findings raise questions about the validity of using administrative data to ascertain postoperative complications, even if coders are carefully hired, trained, and supervised. ICD-9-CM complication codes are more promising as a tool to help providers identify their own adverse outcomes than as a tool for comparing performance.",

    "abstract": "Persons who are blind or have low vision face special challenges in obtaining care that is safe, effective, timely, and patient centered. To explore perceptions of care and recommendations for improvements, we conducted 8 interviews with experts and 2 focus groups with 19 persons, all of whom are blind or have low vision. Interviewees perceived that they confront special barriers to care because of being blind or having low vision. Barriers fell into 4 broad categories: basic respect, including concerns about physicians thinking they cannot participate fully in their own care; communication barriers, including difficulties interacting with physicians and office staff; physical access barriers, including difficulties getting to and around physicians' offices; and information barriers, including receiving written materials in inaccessible formats (eg, not in Braille, large print, or audiotape). Using common courtesy and individualized communication techniques, physicians and office staff could improve health care experiences of blind and low-vision patients.",

The study collected data from multiple sources at a primary health care clinic in an academic teaching hospital serving an urban population, including patients' charts, structured interviews with patients, a survey of physicians' general perspectives and beliefs concerning diabetes mellitus, and a physician's structured review of barriers to tight control for individual patients. One hundred thirty-five patients with scheduled appointments were eligible for the study, of whom 94% had had a recent hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). Seventy-seven of 88 patients (88%) who presented for their appointments consented to the interview, 48 of 50 providers (96%) returned useable surveys, and providers completed individual assessments for 96 patients (71%). Patients had a mean age of 61 years, an average of 7.60 diagnoses, and an average of 8.96 prescriptions. Their diabetes control was less than ideal, with less than 15% having normal or near normal control and almost a quarter having poor control. Correlations of HbA1C with age and show rate were seen. Physicians' assessments showed that motivation and understanding of diabetes and compliance with diet and medications correlated with diabetes control. Neither patient knowledge nor physician knowledge appeared to be a problem, nor did either correlate with diabetes control. The number of barriers to control were many, with over half of the patients having five or more barriers. Tight control of blood glucose is felt to be an important aspect of quality care for diabetic patients. In this study, a representative sample of diabetic patients had less than ideal diabetes control. This population was receiving their care in an urban setting and had many comorbid illnesses and many barriers to control. Age, motivation, understanding of the disease, show rate, and compliance with diet and medications had statistical correlations with diabetes control. In order to improve the quality of care for diabetic patients, barriers to care must be addressed.",

We classified 212 patients discharged with a diagnosis code for pneumonia as to whether or not they had CAP, using three administrative data-based systems (Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) alone, principal diagnosis alone, and a complex algorithm). We examined agreement with classification by clinician chart review. We also compared the length of stay (LOS) and mortality among the CAP populations identified with different methods. Agreement between the clinical review and the three administrative data methods ranged from 86 to 80%. Classification by DRG performed least well. Populations defined by claims data had similar mortality but shorter mean LOS (9.70, 9.40, and 7.91 days for the algorithm, principal diagnosis and DRG methods, respectively) than the clinically defined population (10.85 days). We conclude that studies of CAP using populations identified by claims may underestimate LOS.",

Electronic prescribers were compared to traditional prescribers in terms of demographics, practice type and location, technology use, and beliefs about E-RX. A total of 1104 physicians responded, 19% of whom prescribed electronically. Electronic prescribers were more likely to be generalists practicing in academic or publicly funded centers, have fewer years in practice, and work in technology-equipped offices. They also held different beliefs versus traditional prescribers in terms of E-RX limitations and its potential to improve medication safety and prescribing efficiency. In addition to financial incentives established by MMA, adoption can be stimulated by improvements in the technology and on organizational commitment.",

Leaders must see patient safety problems as problems with their system, not with their employees. Leaders need to give providers information to make and monitor system progress. All medical errors, including near misses, and processes associated with all adverse events may provide information for system improvement. Improving systems should produce better long-term results than educating workers to be more careful.",

Approximately 5000 elderly persons were randomly sampled from 65 000 households in West Texas.

Slightly more than 12% of the participants were not satisfied or barely satisfied with health care received. Those who reported higher health confidence, lower self-rated overall health, having emotional problems, or who were men were less likely to be satisfied with health care. A simple survey tool based on single-item questions identified by the current study might be useful for monitoring patient satisfaction, self-rated health, and health confidence in primary care settings and hence might assist management in capturing the basic picture for improving health care quality.",

New technology, the changing needs of patients, and economic pressures all contribute to the need for health organizations to modify practices continually. Quality improvement (QI) of current processes is central to these efforts. To best manage the introduction of change through QI in a health organization, a focus on the people side of change is necessary. Change management is any action or process taken to smoothly transition an individual or group from the current state to a future desired state of being. The authors provide an overview of the steps to design and execute QI projects that require change management. Key steps for successful change management include assessing readiness for change, establishing a sense of urgency, assembling the steering team, developing an implementation plan, executing a pilot, disseminating change, and anchoring the change within the organization. Adoption of change management practices increases the odds of success because focus is placed on the people in the organization who make things happen.",

Overall mortality and early mortality (occurring in the first 48 hours) were examined, taking into account whether a patient was admitted on a weekend or a weekday, in addition to other parameters. Weekend admissions were associated with a significantly higher inhospital mortality than weekday admissions among patients admitted to an internal medicine service (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-1.08). Differences in mortality persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and coexisting disorders (OR = 1.071; 95% CI = 1.046-1.097). Analyses of deaths within 2 days after admission showed larger relative differences in mortality between weekend and weekday admissions (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.22-1.33). For patients admitted to an internal medicine service via an acute care visit to the emergency room, admission on weekends is associated with higher mortality than admission during the week.",

Teams that evaluate intervention effectiveness are independent of those that implement the intervention.

This article describes how to incorporate DES into QI departments and programs in order to support QI efforts, develop high-fidelity simulation models, conduct experiments, make recommendations, and support adoption of results. The authors describe how DES-enabled QI teams can partner with clinical services and administration to plan, conduct, and sustain QI investigations.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients commonly experience poor sleep quality in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of various modifiable factors. To address this issue, an ICU-wide, multifaceted quality improvement (QI) project was undertaken to promote sleep in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical ICU (MICU). To supplement previously published results of this QI intervention, the present article describes the specific QI framework used to develop and implement this intervention, which consists of 4 steps: (a) summarizing the evidence to create a list of sleep-promoting interventions, (b) identifying and addressing local barriers to implementation, (c) selecting performance measures to assess intervention adherence and patient outcomes, and (d) ensuring that all patients receive the interventions through staff engagement and education and regular project evaluation. Measures of performance included daily completion rates of daytime and nighttime sleep improvement checklists and completion rates of individual interventions. Although long-term adherence and sustainability pose ongoing challenges, this model provides a foundation for future ICU sleep promotion initiatives.",

The algorithm has been used previously to assess the appropriateness of ED visits at the community or facility level. In this analysis, the authors explain how the Billings algorithm works and how it can be applied to individual physician practices. The authors then present illustrative data from 2 years of Medicare claims data from 5 states. About one third of ED visits are deemed appropriate, and about half could have been treated in a primary care outpatient setting. Another 15% were deemed preventable or avoidable.",

Follow-up analysis demonstrated reduced medication discrepancies by >2 per patient and obtaining 100% adherence with reconciliation. Pharmacists reviewed discharge medications, reaching 100% by study end, leading to a 40% reduction in medication safety issues. LOS remained short, and delayed discharges were reduced by 14%; 7-day readmission rates decreased by 50%. Acute rejection and infection rates also significantly decreased. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative can improve medication safety in kidney transplant patients, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes.",

This paper reports empirical evidence from a study of QI implementation in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals that supports this hypothesized linkage. The findings suggest that the extent to which top management becomes directly involved in QI activities determines the degree of QI implementation. Additionally, study findings suggest that a culture emphasizing innovation and teamwork provides an important foundation for implementing a QI initiative. We discuss the implications of these findings for organizational leaders interested in implementing QI.",

    "abstract": "To determine changes in hospital mortality that oc curred in association with the dissemination of data by a regional initiative to profile hospital performance, we con ducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted before and subsequent to dissemination of comparative data in 1992. The analysis included 101,060 consecutive eligible discharges from 30 hospitals in Northeast Ohio with eight diagnoses: acute myocardial infarction, con gestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive airway disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pneumonia, stroke, coronary artery bypass surgery, and lower bowel resection. Baseline (1991, N = 35,629) mortality rates were compared to rates during three subsequent periods (July-December 1992, N = 20,392; January-June 1993, N = 23,070; and July-December 1993, N = 21,969). Mortality rates were risk-adjusted using validated multivariable models based on data abstracted from patients' medical records. For all conditions, risk-adjusted mortality declined from a base line rate of 7.5% to rates of 6.8%, 6.8%, and 6.5%, respec tively, during the three subsequent periods. Using weighted linear regression analysis to estimate trends across peri ods, declines in mortality rates were significant for CHF (0.50% per period; P = 0.002) and pneumonia (0.38% per period; P = 0.03). We conclude that hospital mortality de clined in association with the dissemination of compara tive data. Although changes in hospital care were not directly examined, the results suggest that initiatives to examine provider performance may have a beneficial im pact on quality of care.",

The concept of patient percep tions differs from the more commonly measured concept of patient satisfaction, in that perceptions measure whether a patients' needs and expectations are met, in addition to satisfaction. One of the most accurate and efficient means of measuring patients' perceptions is through the use of surveys. As with all standardized data collection, creating and performing high quality surveys of patients' perceptions can be challenging. Valid and reliable patient survey data can enable prac titioners to identify areas for improvement, and demon strate to external reviewers the quality of care they provide to their patients.",

The theory presented is that under the stress of anxiety and physical illness, some patients regress to childhood needs; physicians are not generally trained to fill such needs. Thus, these patients, angry because of this, express their anger in malpractice suits. This theory has been taught to physicians and medical students as part of a physician continuing medical education (CME) seminar on Loss Prevention/Risk Management through demonstration of active-listening techniques to seminar participants. Physicians who understand and can respond appropriately to the emotional needs of their patients are less likely to be sued.

Analysis of variants through multiple regression was used to determine associations between the average daily throughput time and factors commonly assumed to have significant influence on patient throughput time. Our data analysis found that patient throughput was significantly affected by the number of inpatient admissions from the emergency department, daily census in the main emergency department, pediatric volume, and the number of ambulance arrivals. Several factors that were commonly assumed to affect patient throughput time, such as nursing hours worked and day of the week, were not significant.",

Clinic-based pharmacists offered support to patients with diabetes through direct teaching about diabetes, frequent phone follow-up, medication algorithms, and use of a database that tracked patient outcomes and actively identified opportunities to improve care. From September 1999, to May 2000, 159 subjects were enrolled, and complete follow-up data were available for 138 (87%) patients. Baseline HbA1c averaged 10.8%, and after an average of 6 months of intervention, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 1.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.3). In predictive regression modeling, baseline HbA1c and new onset diabetes were associated with significant improvements in HbA1c. Age, race, gender, educational level, and provider status were not significant predictors of improvement. In conclusion, a pharmacist-based diabetes care program integrated into primary care practice significantly reduced HbA1c among patients with diabetes and poor glucose control.",

The authors searched MEDLINE for relevant articles published between 1950 and 2006 and reviewed the evidence to assess the relationship between the personal aspects of primary care quality and patients' health status and health services utilization. These personal aspects, which include patient-physician continuity and communication, are distinct from the technical aspects of primary care, which include ordering tests, treatments, and referrals. Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that greater continuity of care is associated with less use of hospitals and emergency departments and lower health care costs; effective communication may be associated with better health status. The limited available evidence suggests that higher quality in the personal aspects of primary care is associated with some but not all outcomes of care. Additional research is needed to define these relationships more clearly.",

To learn from medical incidents and improve patient care, care-givers need to: (1) elicit input from all staff involved in the incident, (2) use a structured framework to investigate all underlying contributing factors, and (3) assign responsibility for management and follow-up on recommendations. Many MMCs lack these key elements. The specific aims of this article are to describe the use of the learning from a defect tool as a strategy to meet ACGME requirements, advance medical education, and enhance traditional MMCs in one fellowship program at an academic medical institution. In addition, this approach improved patient care and provided a foundation for our fellows to use to address patient safety defects after fellowship.",

Senior residents in our graduate medical education program took responsibility for a capstone quality improvement project designed to transform them into champions for health care quality. Residents (n = 26) participated alone or in pairs in a 1-month faculty-mentored rotation at the Veterans Administration Hospital during the 2007-2008 academic year. They completed a Web-based curriculum, identified a quality-of-care issue, applied Plan—Do—Study—Act cycles, authored a report, and engaged colleagues in their innovations during a department-wide presentation. Results indicated that residents demonstrated significantly enhanced knowledge and attitudes about patient safety and quality improvement and provided consistently positive faculty and rotation evaluations. In addition, residents generated 20 quality improvement project proposals with a 50% rate of hospital-wide implementation, leading to meaningful changes in the systems that affect patient care.",

A total of 63 endoscopists in the United States entered data on 18 182 procedures over 3 years. Results in academic and community practices were similar, but there were significant and expected differences in the complexity of practice and key quality metrics between endoscopists performing more than and fewer than 100 cases per year. The study provided useful data on variations in ERCP practice in the United States and will assist in planning the development of national projects in this field.",

The authors performed a prospective multisite validation study of an organizational communication climate assessment tool in 13 geographically and ethnically diverse health care organizations. Communication climate was measured across 9 discrete domains. Patient and staff surveys with matched items in each domain were developed using a national consensus process, which then underwent psychometric field testing and assessment of domain coherence. The authors found meaningful within-site and between-site performance score variability in all domains. In multivariable models, most communication domains were significant predictors of patient-reported quality of care and trust. The authors conclude that these assessment tools provide a valid empirical assessment of organizational communication climate in 9 domains. Assessment results may be useful to track organizational performance, to benchmark, and to inform tailored quality improvement interventions.",

Patient satisfaction scores (0-100 scale) with communication improved significantly on medicine wards: nurse communication (+6.4, P < .001), physician communication (+4.0, P = .04), and involvement in decision making (+6.3, P = .002). Patient satisfaction scores did not change significantly on surgical wards. There was no secular trend, and the authors excluded a trend in overall patient satisfaction.

The essence of operational improvement is organizational learning. This article presents a framework for identifying leverage points for improvement based on organizational learning theory and applies it to an analysis of current practice and controversy. Organizations learn from others, from defects, from measurement, and from mindfulness. These learning modes correspond with contemporary themes of collaboration, no blame for human error, accountability for performance, and managing the unexpected. The collaborative model has dominated improvement efforts. Greater attention to the underdeveloped modes of organizational learning may foster more rapid progress in patient safety by increasing organizational capabilities, strengthening a culture of safety, and fixing more of the process problems that contribute to patient harm.",

A 2-step linear regression model was employed; first, to control for objective components’ influence on U.S. News score ( R 2 = 0.365; P &lt; .001), then, to isolate the subjective component of reputation’s effect on U.S. News score ( R 2 = 0.565; P &lt; .001).

The privately insured predominantly reported primary care infrastructure barriers-wait time in clinic and for an appointment, constraints related to conventional business hours, and difficulty finding a primary care provider (because of geography or lack of new patient openings). Half of those insured by Medicaid and/or Medicare also reported these infrastructure barriers. In contrast, the uninsured predominantly reported insurance, income, and transportation barriers. Given that insured nonurgent ED users frequently report infrastructure barriers, these should be the focus of patient-level interventions to reduce nonurgent ED use and of health system-level policies to enhance the capacity of the US primary care infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "To catalyze learning in Health Systems Science and add value to health systems, education programs are seeking to incorporate students into systems roles, which are not well described. The authors sought to identify authentic roles for students within a range of clinical sites and explore site leaders' perceptions of the value of students performing these roles. From 2013 to 2015, site visits and interviews with leadership from an array of clinical sites (n = 30) were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to identify tasks and benefits of integrating students into interprofessional care teams. Types of systems roles included direct patient benefit activities, including monitoring patient progress with care plans and facilitating access to resources, and clinic benefit activities, including facilitating coordination and improving clinical processes. Perceived benefits included improved value of the clinical mission and enhanced student education. These results elucidate a framework for student roles that enhance learning and add value to health systems.",

    "abstract": "Timely microbiological diagnosis is necessary to optimize treatments, improve antimicrobial stewardship, and improve patient and population health outcomes. For example, in a recent randomized clinical trial of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the use of syndromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic test panels led to faster and more targeted microbial treatment.1 Similarly, other hospital-based studies have demonstrated the impact of rapid microbiological diagnosis on faster treatment optimization, improved antimicrobial stewardship, decreased length of hospitalization, and enhanced infectious disease surveillance and infection control practices.2 Yet, in the outpatient setting where 80%–90% of antibiotics are prescribed3,4 and per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 28% of the 236.4 million antibiotic prescriptions dispensed from community pharmacies in 2022 were considered unnecessary,5 the impact of faster microbiological diagnoses on prescribing practices is unknown. In outpatient settings, patients with suspected infection typically receive broad empiric antimicrobial therapy rather than directed therapy based on the identification of the infecting pathogen.2 Empiric antibiotic prescribing often occurs because of the inability to rapidly identify the pathogen causing an infection.2 Studies indicate that more than 50% of outpatients with acute upper respiratory infections receive antibiotics, even though viruses are typically responsible.6–8 This overprescribing contributes to unnecessary drug exposure for patients and escalates antimicrobial resistance, a top global health threat with significant economic costs.9 While past studies suggest reluctance of clinicians to modify initial empiric antibiotic prescribing patterns despite subsequent availability of antimicrobial susceptibility reports,10 this attitude may be shifting, driven in part by innovations that enable results to be available faster. Improvements in panel and platform design, specimen collection and transport, and result reporting interpretation and turnaround time render diagnostic results that are more rapidly actionable for outpatients. This in turn offers the potential to disrupt empiric antibiotic prescribing. With the aim of understanding, if the availability of such faster testing is being used to guide prescribing decisions, a survey was administered to outpatient health care providers with routine access to syndromic PCR-based tests that provide next-day results in the United States (HealthTrackRx, Denton, Texas). Multiple syndromic panels were available including for respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, wound, and other infections. Each panel included unique pathogen targets according to the most common causes for the specific infectious syndrome in the United States. Providers used their discretion on medical necessity, but received information on (1) syndromic panel selection based on relevant patient symptoms, (2) relevance of the organisms on each panel, (3) sample collection, and (4) results interpretation. The providers' medical specialty, level of training, and familiarity with the laboratory testing platform/service (extremely, very, somewhat, or not familiar) were recorded. Among physicians (Medical Doctors [MD]/Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine [DO]) and nurse practitioners (NP)/physician assistants (PA) very or extremely familiar with the testing and involved with interpreting test reports/providing treatment recommendations, a proportional odds model was used to examine how specialty (primary care [including primary care, pediatric, women's health, or internal medicine] versus urgent care) and level of training (MD/DO versus NP/PA) influence the impact of the testing on their antibiotic prescribing. Seven hundred and ten providers were surveyed (N = 710). Among 384 (94 MD/DO, 290 NP/PA) respondents, 346 (90.1%) were extremely or very familiar with the testing platform of which 325 (93.9%) were involved with interpreting test reports and providing treatment recommendations. Turnaround time and accuracy were test characteristics ranked by providers as most valuable to their practice. Of the 325 respondents involved with interpreting test reports and providing treatment recommendations, 319 reported data on prescribing decisions. Of these, most (97.5%) use test results to make prescribing decisions with equal numbers prescribing upfront and then adjusting treatment later if needed (ie, empirically prescribing) (48.6%) versus awaiting test results before prescribing antibiotics (48.9%). More NP/PA providers compared with MD/DO providers (52.1% versus 39.0%, respectively, P = 0.0451) and those in primary compare versus urgent care practices (61.2% versus 39.1%; P = 0.0002) reported withholding antibiotic prescriptions pending test results (Table 1). When asked if the provider noticed any change in antibiotic prescribing after incorporating the PCR test in their decision-making, 92.1% confirmed changes, with 9.4% reporting more antibiotic prescribing, 25% noting fewer antibiotic prescriptions, and 57.6% noting improved self-reported accuracy of antibiotic prescriptions. Logistic regression analysis indicated that NP/PAs compared with MD/DOs (odds ratio: 2.27, 95% confidence interval: 1.26–4.09; P = 0.0059) and those in primary care compared with urgent care practices (odds ratio: 2.83, 95% confidence interval 1.71–4.67; P < 0.0001) were more than twice as likely to withhold antibiotic prescriptions pending test results (Table 1). Table 1. - Provider-reported Use of Rapid PCR Test Results to Make Antibiotic Prescribing Decisions. MD/DO (n = 94) NP/PA (n = 290) P value Primary care (n = 153) Urgent care (n = 187) P value Familiar with the test 89 (94.7%) 257 (88.6%) 0.0873 153 (93.5%) 164 (87.7%) 0.0741 Interpret results and provide treatment recommendations 80/89 (89.9%) 245/257 (95.3%) 0.0638 135/153 (88.2%) 160/164 (97.6%) 0.0011 Withhold antibiotic prescriptions pending test results 30/77 (39.0%) 126/242 (52.1%) 0.0451 82/134 (61.2%) 61/156 (39.1%) 0.0002 Adjusted odds ratio of diagnostic versus empiric prescribinga OR = 1.0 OR = 2.2795% CI: 1.26–4.09 0.0059 OR = 2.8395% CI: 1.71–4.67 OR = 1.0 <0.0001 aAdjusted for specialty and care (primary versus urgent) facility.Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; MD/DO, Medical Doctors/Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine; NP, nurse practitioners; OR, odds ratio; PA, physician assistants. These results suggest that, in comparison with historical practices,10 outpatient providers are now using newly available PCR test panels to guide antibiotic prescribing, with almost half awaiting test results to determine if antibiotics are appropriate. This change in prescribing behavior may lead to more accurate prescribing as well as fewer empiric antibiotic prescriptions. Primary care providers were more likely than urgent care specialists to await test results to prescribe. Empiric prescribing decisions depend on several factors, including how sick the patient is, underlying comorbidities and risk of progression, how quickly the result will return, patient expectations/preferences, and the ability to reach the patient for timely follow-up. Primary care providers may have infrastructure in place and long-term relationships with patients to enable timely follow-up. Further, patients visiting urgent care practices may be sicker, requiring antibiotics upfront. The willingness of NP/PAs to forgo empiric prescribing may also reflect patient acuity. Understanding why some practitioners continued to prescribe empirically despite the availability of rapid and clinically actionable PCR results was beyond the scope of this survey. Additionally, while this survey targeted respondents familiar with the testing platform, limiting the generalizability of the results, the findings suggest that access to next-day test results offers the opportunity to combat overprescribing. To fully appreciate the potential impact of such testing, the cost of multiplex PCR tests must also be considered. Multiplex PCR panels cost between $170 and $643/test, depending on the panel and setting of care,11,12 with patient out of pocket costs typically $150 or less. Prospective, randomized trials in the outpatient setting that take into account the costs of the testing are needed to confirm the impact of rapidly available test results on antibiotic prescribing and, ultimately, to understand how such changes influence patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance reduction in the long-term. Confirming the cost-effectiveness of the testing would further inform and influence payer reimbursement decisions. In summary, the introduction of rapid, clinically actionable molecular diagnostics in outpatient settings—where most infections are diagnosed and unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed—provides a vital tool for targeted therapy and reducing empiric overprescribing. With the capability to identify the infecting pathogen within 24 hours, outpatient providers are increasingly using these test results to guide antibiotic administration, with many waiting for results before prescribing. Based on users' perceptions, these tests also appear to be guiding antibiotic selection. Indeed, the availability of rapid molecular diagnostics may be shifting practices away from empiric antibiotic prescribing in outpatient settings.

    "abstract": "Guidelines for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) start with a risk assessment using a pretest probability (PTP) tool, followed by D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) depending on risk. The project aimed to develop an electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) to encourage broader use of a validated PTP scoring tool in emergency departments (EDs) to more accurately diagnose PE and to reduce unnecessary CTPAs. To identify a value set to accurately identify CTPA and abnormal D-dimer tests using standard classification systems and clinical vocabularies (ie, Current Procedural Terminology [CPT], Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINC], systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms [SNOMED CT]) across 3 academic United States health care systems. A comprehensive value set to identify CTPAs was selected, which contained 31 codes. Additionally, each health care system had unique, site-specific codes to more granularly identify CTPAs. Three health care systems representing 38 EDs from across the country submitted data from all ED encounters between September 12, 2022, and January 11, 2023. Imaging types were reviewed from each of the CPT codes and LOINC. The project evaluated whether a D-dimer was obtained using CPT and LOINC and whether the D-dimer result was elevated using SNOMED CT. The number of ED encounters, PTP use, and diagnosis of PE using different codes were determined. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value for selected codes were calculated. Over a 4-month study period, 270,214 encounters were included from 38 EDs. 11,794 ED encounters with CTPAs during the study period, using the site-specific codes were identified. The comprehensive value set had a PPV of 63.4%. Restricting the CTPA value set to CPT code 71275 or LOINC 88322-3 improved the PPV to 82% with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The restricted value set captured the highest proportion of relevant site-specific codes. D-dimer values were identified using LOINC codes 48065-7 and 91556-1 at Site 1 and 48067-3 at Site 2. SNOMED CT codes were not used at any site to identify elevated D-dimer results. Different D-dimer tests with different normal ranges were used at each site, and only one site provided an abnormal flag for D-dimer results. Heterogeneity in the use of nationally standardized codes for labs and imaging tests limits the ability to measure and compare quality across health care organizations for CTPA and D-dimer results. Restricting the identification of CTPA to CPT Code 71275 or LOINC 88322-3 resulted in high sensitivity and specificity, but false positives remain. Additionally, coding for an abnormal D-dimer test result is not standardized across institutions. Therefore, the currently available value sets cannot be used to develop eCQMs whose aim is to evaluate whether CTPA is ordered appropriately based on the PTP risk level and laboratory testing.",

Estimates of current blood transfusion risks (4- 12) , and the costs of transfusion complications (13—17), are summa rized in Table 1. In addition, emphasis on the costs of health care has raised issues related to the costs of blood transfusion (18, 19). Finally, recent guidelines have emphasized that in the elective transfusion set ting, no blood transfusion is a desirable outcome (20, 21). Furthermore, these guidelines along with consen sus conference recommendations (22) have emphasized that if blood is to be transfused, autologous (the pa tient's own) blood is preferable to allogeneic (from an anonymous, volunteer donor) blood. Thus, the costs of blood conservation, for which an increasing array of technologic procedures and products have become available (Table 2), have also become an issue (23).

We report here on the success of a clinical pathway in reducing antibiotic overuse in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis. The charts of 181 children admitted for bronchiolitis were reviewed to determine whether antibiotic use was reduced in patients managed using a clinical pathway compared with a matched group of patients managed without use of the pathway (non-pathway group). Only 9% of the pathway patients received antibiotics compared with 27% of the nonpathway group. No negative effects were seen on other quality measures including unplanned return for care. Furthermore, for patients managed using the clinical pathway, cost and length of stay were significantly reduced. Overall, the study suggests that implementation of a clinical pathway may be an effective means to change physician practice and reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, while maintaining or improving other aspects of quality of care.",

Most believe adverse events are preventable (61%) and think improved teamwork (88%), better procedural training (74%), and improved sign-out (70%) would reduce medical mishaps. Forty-seven percent of trainees agree computerized order entry and restricted work hours would prevent adverse events. Although 60% feel malpractice fears inhibit discussion, 80% of trainees agreed physicians must disclose adverse events to patients and grow more comfortable with disclosure as training progresses (P for trend<.01). In conclusion, trainees believe adverse events are preventable and are poised to respond to many components of the patient safety movement.",

In the past 4 years (2002 to 2006), 70 PSRs have been conducted, and more than 900 area staff members have participated. Staff attendance averages 8 to 10 unit or area staff members per session. Patient safety rounds have proven to be a concrete, inexpensive mechanism to enhance patient safety.

Hospitals identified significant as well as other key factors that resulted in the adoption and/or nonadoption of medication and culture of safety practices. Informants also identified strategies used to overcome barriers that were experienced. Facilitators to both practices include administrative leadership support and education and training. The resistance to change was the most significant barrier identified in both the safe medication process interviews and the culture of safety interviews. Implementing safety practices can be a difficult process, replete with organizational, financial, and professional barriers. Strategies identified by our informants to overcome these barriers may assist other hospitals currently facing this challenge.",

Rather than focusing solely on quality improvement measures or cost-saving measures, there is a recent emphasis on the value of health care.

It is important that the outcomes measured are patient centered and that both the outcomes and costs are measured over time with long-term follow-up.

Following the seminar, physicians were presented with 4 clinical vignettes and asked to describe what tests, treatments, counseling, or referrals they would recommend. Physicians who viewed the seminars were significantly more likely to recommend guideline-consistent care to patients in the vignettes. For example, physicians who viewed the diabetes seminar were significantly more likely to order an eye exam for diabetes patients (63%) compared with physicians in the control group (27%).

There is now good evidence from randomized controlled trials that surgical treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, decompression for spinal stenosis, and decompression and fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis all offer significant clinical benefit in the face of serious back and radicular pain when compared with nonsurgical care. Studies of nonsurgical and surgical treatments for chronic low back pain are inconclusive, limited by study design/methodology. Continuing to increase study quality in the field of spine surgery is more important now than ever before. Optimizing diagnostic specificity, surgical indications, and measuring outcomes with validated instruments should help the spine care community acquire essential data to provide the highest quality evidence-based care, while simultaneously eliminating procedures that lack evidence of efficacy or value.",

Data were collected for a 2007 University HealthSystem Consortium Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE) Benchmarking Project that explored VTE in AMCs. Prophylaxis was considered appropriate based on 2004 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines. A total of 33 AMCs from 30 states participated. In all, 48% of patients received guideline-directed prophylaxis-59% were medical and 41% were surgical patients. VTE history was more common among medical patients with guideline-directed prophylaxis. Surgical patients admitted from the emergency department and with higher illness severity were more likely to receive appropriate prophylaxis. Despite guidelines, VTE prophylaxis remains underutilized in these US AMCs, particularly among surgical patients. Because AMCs provide the majority of physician training and should reflect and set care standards, this appears to be an opportunity for practice and quality improvement and for education.",

Those who enroll and use a patient portal have different demographic characteristics and interest levels in selected portal functions (eg, e-mailing providers, viewing medical records online, making appointments) and initially perceive only limited improvements in care because of the portal. These differences have potential market implications and provide insight into selecting and maintaining portal functions of greater interest to patients who use the portal.",

As of January 31, 2013, 37 US states and territories (71%) had adopted laws requiring HAI data submission, most of which were enacted and became effective in 2006 and 2007. Most states with HAI laws required reporting of central line-associated bloodstream infections in adult intensive care units (92%), and about half required reporting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections (54% and 51%, respectively). Overall, data submission requirements were found to vary across states.

The pandemic tested existing remote monitoring efforts, revealing numerous operating challenges including device management, centralized escalation protocols, and health equity concerns. The continuation of these programs required addressing these concerns while expanding monitoring efforts in ambulatory and transitions of care settings. Building on these experiences, this article offers insights and strategies for implementing remote monitoring programs at scale and improving the sustainability of these efforts.

    "abstract": "Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), increasingly used for research and quality measurement, are lauded for their potential to improve patient-centered care, both through aggregate reporting and when integrated into clinical practice. However, there are few published studies of the resultant use of PROMs in clinical practice. This case study describes the implementation and use of PROMS in a Midwestern multispecialty medical group orthopedic practice among patients undergoing total knee and hip surgery. Specifically, rates of PROMs use by care teams are tracked over time once made available in the electronic health record. During this time, the orthopedics department achieved a patient PROMS survey response rate of 68% at baseline, 58% 3 months post-surgery, and 55% 12 months post-surgery. However, these data were only accessed by the care teams for fewer than 1% of associated clinical encounters. This suggests that making PROMs available for care team review in the electronic health record, even when coupled with relatively high response rates from patients and departmental leadership support is not enough to encourage integration of PROMs into clinical care for patients. Additional effort is required to identify barriers to PROMs use in clinical care and to test methods to enhance use.",

A noncategorical approach to quality measurement, rather than one based on illness status or specific condition, is necessary to adequately measure quality for the majority of children, both healthy and ill. One promising noncategorical measure of pediatric health care quality is health outcome, specifically health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), a brief, practical, reliable, valid, generic pediatric HRQOL measure, is a suitable candidate measure. Ongoing research to validate the PedsQL as an outcome measure of health care quality is described.",

    "abstract": "The prevention of medication administration errors (MAEs) represents a central focus of hospitals' quality improvement and risk management initiatives. Because the identification and reporting of MAEs is a nonautomated and voluntary process, it is essential to understand the extent to which errors may not be reported. This study reports the results of 2 multihospital surveys in which over 1300 staff nurses in each survey estimated the extent to which various types of nonintravenous (non-i.v.) and intravenous (i.v.)-related MAEs are actually being reported on their nursing units. Overall, respondents estimated that about 60% of MAEs are actually being reported. Considerable differences in estimated rates of MAE reporting were found between staff and supervisors working on the same patient care units. A simulation based on actual and perceived rates of MAE reporting is presented to estimate the range of errors not being reported. Implications regarding the reliability, validity, and completeness of MAEs actually being reported are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the documentation of ambulatory care visits and diagnoses in Medicaid paid claims and in medical records. Data were obtained from Maryland Medicaid's 1988 paid claims files for 2407 individuals who were continuously enrolled for the fiscal year, had at least one billed visit for one of six indicator conditions, and had received the majority of their care from one provider. The patients sampled were also stratified on the basis of the case-mix adjusted cost of their usual source of care. The medical records for these individuals as maintained by their usual source of care were abstracted by trained nurse reviewers to compare claims and record information. Linked claim and medical record data for sampled patients were used to calculate: (i) the percent of billed visits documented in the record, (ii) the percent of medical record visits where both the date and the diagnosis agreed with the claims data, and (iii) the ratio of medical record visits to visits from billed claims. Included in the analysis were independent variables specifying place of residence, type and costliness of usual care source, level of patient utilization, and indicator condition on which patient was sampled. Ninety percent of the visits chronicled in the paid claims were documented in the medical record with 82% agreeing on both date and diagnosis. Compared to the medical records kept by private physicians and community health centers, a significantly lower percent of hospital medical records agreed with the claims data. Total volume of visits was 2.6% higher in the medical records than in the claims. Claims data substantially understated visits in the medical record by 25% for low cost providers and by 41% for patients with low use rates (based on claims information). Conversely, medical records substantially understated billed visits by 19% for rural patients and by 10% for persons with high visit rates. Although Medicaid claims are relatively accurate and useful for examining average ambulatory use patterns, they are subject to significant biases when comparing subgroups of providers classified by case-mix adjusted cost and patients classified by utilization rates. Medicaid programs are using claims data for profiling and performance assessment need to understand the limitations of administrative data.",

Congressional funding for CON ended in 1987. However, today, 26 states use CON to regulate cardiac surgery. There has been little evidence of the impact of CON on the quality of services. Pennsylvania is in a unique position to study the impact of CON on the quality and outcomes of care because the state terminated CON in 1996 and has publicly reported quality and outcomes data on coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgeries since 1992. Using a statewide inpatient data-reporting system, the volumes and outcomes of CABG surgeries at all Pennsylvania hospitals were examined in the 3 years prior to and the 3 years after the termination of CON. In the 3 years following the elimination of CON, the number of open-heart surgery programs increased 25%, yet there was no significant increase in the number of CABG surgeries performed. Quality, as measured by mortality rate, was not impacted by the real-location of the relatively stable CABG volume in the short term; this may be due, in part, to itinerant surgeons and statewide public performance monitoring. The long-term implications of deregulation are unclear and deserve future study.",

Using logistic regression, the model was created to predict the probability of an asthma-related admission among all asthmatics who were members of a large HMO during calendar year 1994 (N = 54,573). The model used data from pharmacy, laboratory, and specialist claims, as well as encounter and demographic data available in U.S. Healthcare's administrative database. A member's prior asthma-specific utilization patterns, pharmaceutically determined severity of illness, and length of enrollment in the managed care organization had the most influence on the equation. A cross-validation of the model confirms how administrative data can be used to accurately risk-stratify those with a chronic disease. Finally, some additional research possibilities associated with the identification of high risk subscribers using only administrative data are outlined.",

The current study examined hospital-level correlations between patient satisfaction and severity-adjusted mortality for 29 hospitals in northeastern Ohio during 1993-1997. Satisfaction with 6 dimensions of care was measured using a validated survey of 42,255 randomly selected patients with medical diagnoses. Severity-adjusted mortality rates were determined for 200,562 consecutive patients with 6 high-volume medical diagnoses. Analyses found that satisfaction scores were inversely correlated with mortality rates. For the cumulative 5-year period, correlations were significant or of borderline significance for 5 of the 6 dimensions (coordination [R = -0.40; P = .03], discharge instructions [R = -0.39; P = .04], overall quality [R = -0.38; P = .04], information provided [R = -0.37; P = .05], and nursing [R = -0.35; P = .06]). The correlation was weakest for physician care (R = -0.07; P = .72). These findings indicate that hospitals with higher patient satisfaction also tended to have lower severity-adjusted mortality. Associations were strongest for dimensions of satisfaction measuring patient communication, coordination of care, and nursing care and weakest for physician care.",

However, their parsimony and apparent simplicity belie significant conceptual and methodological concerns. For many diagnoses included in hospital-wide mortality, the association between short-term mortality and quality of care is not well established. Furthermore, compared with condition-specific or procedure-specific mortality, hospital-wide mortality rates pose greater methodological challenges (ie, eligibility and exclusion criteria, risk adjustment, statistical techniques for aggregating across diagnoses, usability). Many of these result from substantial interprovider heterogeneity in diagnosis frequency, sample sizes, and patient severity. Hospital-wide mortality is problematic as a quality metric for public reporting, although hospitals may elect to use such measures for other purposes. Potential alternative approaches include multidimensional composite metrics or mortality measurement limited to selected conditions and procedures for which the link between hospital mortality and quality is clear, legitimate exclusions are uncommon, and sample sizes, end points, and risk adjustment are adequate.",

During the course of 6 months, the authors compared adverse events (mortality, unexpected intensive care unit [ICU] transfers, and cardiopulmonary arrest) and TVSA among patients who triggered an RRA, patients with TVSAs and no RRA, and all other patients. At least 1 TVSA was recorded in 31.9% of stays and 12.2% of patient-days. RRA patients were more likely (22.5%) than other TVSA patients (7.9%) and other patients (1.8%) to have an adverse event (P < .01). Incidence varied by vital sign. During the investigation, only 2.5% of TVSA opportunities triggered an RRA. As systems engage electronic workflows, automatically triggering RRAs based solely on TVSAs could place a tremendous burden on systems.",

Using data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), the authors estimated mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total cost attributable to multiple postoperative events in general and vascular surgery patients. Data were collected using standard NSQIP practices at a single academic center between 2007 and 2009.

LOS increased by 2.59, 5.18, and 10.99 days (P < .0001) for 1, 2, and 3+ postoperative events; excess costs were $6358, $12 802, and $42 790 (P < .0001), respectively. Multiple postoperative events have a synergistic effect on mortality, LOS, and the financial cost of patient care.",

This study provides and evaluates a use case for a generally applicable approach to validating quality metrics measured electronically from EHR-based data. The authors iteratively refined and validated 4 outpatient quality metrics and classified errors in measurement. Multiple iterations of validation and measurement resulted in high levels of sensitivity and agreement versus the “gold standard” of manual review. In contrast, substantial differences remained for measurement based on coded billing data. Measuring quality metrics using an EHR-based electronic process requires validation to ensure accuracy; approaches to validation such as those described in this study should be used by organizations measuring quality from EHR-based information.",

High-performing hospitals showed greater use of all 6 practices, but the strongest evidence supported a focus on board member education and development, the rigorous use of performance measures to guide quality improvement, and systematic board self-assessment processes. All hospitals, even those with the highest quality ratings, had major gaps in their use of best practices for CEO and board assessments.

Outcome measures were error types, severity of patient harm, stage of medication process, and involved medications. The authors analyzed 2837 UK error reports and 56 368 US reports. Differences were observed between UK and US errors for wrong dose (44% vs 29%), omitted dose (8.6% vs 27%), and stage of medication process (prescribing: 14% vs 49%; administration: 71% vs 42%). Moderate/severe harm or death was reported in 4.9% of UK versus 3.4% of US errors. Gentamicin was cited in 7.4% of the UK versus 0.7% of the US reports (odds ratio = 9.25). There were differences in the types of errors reported and the medications most often involved. These differences warrant further examination.",

The Triple Aim framework and 6 dimensions of quality care are overarching constructs of the CQI program. A validated, evidence-based clinical pathway that measures quality across the continuum of care was adopted. Working collaboratively, multidisciplinary experts embedded the CQI program into everyday practices in clinics across Alberta. Currently, 83% of surgeons participate in the CQI program, representing 95% of the total volume of hip and knee surgeries. Biannual reports provide feedback to improve care processes, infrastructure planning, and patient outcomes.

Debriefings of 54 003 consecutive surgical cases and subsequent analysis of 4523 defects in care by multidisciplinary teams led to rapid-cycle iterative changes in care design and processes. Four dimensions of health care value were achieved: debrief-driven improvements reduced the proportion of surgical cases with reported defects, was associated with a significant reduction in the 30-day unadjusted surgical mortality, lowered costs by substantial gains in efficiency and productivity, and led to a better workforce safety climate. Meaningful and sustained improvements required consistent broad-based teamwork over multiple years, an evidence-based data-driven approach, and senior leader and governance engagement.",

However, there is limited evidence on the effect of discharge environment on outcomes after surgery. The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of discharge disposition setting on clinical outcomes after spine surgery.Patients who underwent lumbar decompression, lumbar decompression and fusion, or posterior cervical decompression and fusion surgery were retrospectively identified. All clinical and demographic data were obtained from electronic health records. Surgical outcomes included wound complications, revision surgery, \"30-day\" readmission (0-30 d), and \"90-day\" readmission (31-90 d). Discharge disposition was stratified into home/self-care, acute inpatient rehabilitation, and subacute rehabilitation. Patient-reported outcome measures including VAS Back, VAS Leg, VAS Neck, VAS Arm, PCS-12 and MCS-12, ODI, and NDI were compared between patient discharge disposition settings using the Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson's chi-square analysis was used to assess for differences in wound complications, revision surgery, 30-day readmission, or 90-day readmission rates. Multivariate logistic regression incorporating age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and discharge disposition was used to determine independent predictors of wound complications.A total of 637 patients were included in the study. A significant difference (P = 0.03) was found in wound complication based on discharge disposition, with subacute disposition having the highest proportion of wound complications (6.1%) and home disposition having the lowest (1.5%). There were no significant differences in the rates of revision surgery, 30-day readmission, or 90-day readmission between groups. Subacute rehabilitation (odds ratio: 3.67, P = 0.047) and CCI (odds ratio 1.49, P = 0.01) were independent predictors of wound complications. Significant improvement in PROMs was seen across all postacute discharge dispositions. Baseline (P = 0.02) and postoperative (P = 0.02) ODI were significantly higher among patients discharged to an acute facility (49.4 and 32.0, respectively) compared to home (42.2 and 20.0) or subacute (47.4 and 28.4) environments.Subacute rehabilitation disposition and CCI are independent predictors of wound complications after spinal decompression surgery. Patients undergoing spine surgery have similar readmission and revision rates and experience similar clinical improvement across all postacute discharge dispositions.",

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can be used to monitor high-risk patients from their homes and open up hospital bed availability. The authors describe a pilot program to evaluate the impact of RPM in postdischarge monitoring of COVID-19 patients. High-risk patients discharging from the hospital received a wearable vital sign monitoring device to be worn for 8 consecutive days, allowing real-time data transmission to a virtual health center (VHC), which had been established prior to the pandemic, via a smart phone application. The data were monitored 24 hours a day by a VHC tech with built-in escalation protocols to a nurse and/or an attending physician if needed. Eighty patients were enrolled, 48% women with an age range of 19-83 years. Languages included Spanish (49%), English (47%), Burmese (2%), and Swahili (1%). The most common comorbidities included hypertension (48%) and diabetes mellitus (48%). Oxygen was the most common addressed need; 8% requiring new oxygen and 8% benefitting from oxygen-weaning during the RPM time period. Ten percent patients had emergency department (ED) visits and 4% were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The authors built and deployed an RPM program for postdischarge monitoring of high-risk patients. RPM can be quickly deployed to support COVID-19 patients postdischarge and assist with hospital capacity. RPM can be rapidly and successfully deployed during the COVID 19 pandemic to aid in transitions of care.",

The authors implemented an electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical pathway that could be accessed by clinicians within existing workflows when caring for patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. The objective was to examine the association between clinical pathway utilization and adherence to institutional best practice treatment recommendations for COVID-19.The authors conducted an observational analysis of all ED patients seen in a health system inclusive of seven EDs between March 18, 2020, and April 20, 2021. They implemented the pathway as an interactive flow chart that allowed clinicians to place orders while viewing the most up-to-date institutional guidance. Primary outcomes were proportion of admitted PUIs receiving dexamethasone and aspirin in the ED, and secondary outcome was time to delivering treatment.A total of 13 269 patients were admitted PUIs. The pathway was used by 40.6% of ED clinicians. When clinicians used the pathway, patients were more likely to be prescribed aspirin (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 6.2-8.26) and dexamethasone (10.4; 8.85-12.2). For secondary outcomes, clinicians using the pathway had statistically significant ( P < 0.0001) improvement in timeliness of ordering medications and admission to the hospital. Aspirin, dexamethasone, and admission order time were improved by 103.89, 94.34, and 121.94 minutes, respectively.The use of an EHR-integrated clinical pathway improved clinician adherence to changing COVID-19 treatment guidelines and timeliness to associated medication administration. As pathways continue to be implemented, their effects on improving patient outcomes and decreasing disparities in patient care should be further examined.",

First, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology adapted Kaizen to federal agency processes for the development of electronic clinical quality measures. Later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) further modified this adapted Kaizen during its Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age (ACG) initiative, which aimed to improve the broader scope of guideline development and implementation. This is a methods article to document the adapted Kaizen method for future use in similar complex processes, illustrating how to apply the adapted Kaizen through CDC's ACG initiative and showing the reach achieved by using the adapted Kaizen method. The adapted Kaizen includes pre-Kaizen planning, a Kaizen event, and post-Kaizen implementation that accommodate multidisciplinary and multi-organizational participation. ACG included 5 workgroups that each developed products to support their respective scope: Guideline Creation, Informatics Framework, Translation and Implementation, Communication and Dissemination, and Evaluation. Despite challenges gathering diverse perspectives and balancing the competing priorities of multiple organizations, the ACG participants produced interrelated standards, processes, and tools-further described in separate publications-that programs and partners have leveraged.

    "abstract": "Patient assessment surveys have established a primary role in health care quality measurement as evidence has shown that information from patients can affect quality improvement for practitioners and lead to positive marketwide changes. This article presents findings from the recently released National Healthcare Disparities Report revealing that although most clinical quality and access indicators show superior health care for non-Hispanic whites compared with blacks and Hispanics, blacks and Hispanics assess their interactions with providers more positively than non-Hispanic whites do. The article explores possible explanations for these racial/ethnic differences, including potential pitfalls in survey design that draw biased responses by race/ethnicity. The article then suggests strategies for refining future research on racial/ethnic disparities based on patient assessment of health care.",

We interviewed physicians exposed to a financial incentive program in California to identify possible barriers to the successful application of financial incentives by exploring physicians' opinions of and experiences with pay-for-performance programs. Reasons physicians cited for quality deficiencies included insurance coverage limitations and lack of patient compliance, time, and proper physician oversight. Physicians believe that they play a significant role and have a moderate to high degree of control over quality of care and that it is important to self-monitor. Physicians expressed the need for accurate and timely data, peer comparisons, and more patient time, staff support, and consultations with colleagues to successfully monitor and deliver quality care. Many support increased pay for delivering high-quality care but question measurement accuracy, bonus payment financing, and health plan involvement.",

In a nationwide survey in 1000 German households, we interviewed randomly chosen persons (age 14 and older) by phone about what they consider important when choosing a hospital. A standardized questionnaire was used. Additionally, question order was randomized prior to each interview. Demographic data included age, gender, education, and previous admissions to hospitals. Categories that might influence the choice of hospital included \"distance to hospital,\" \"friendly staff,\" \"staff-to-patient ratio,\" \"cleanliness,\" \"nosocomial infection rate,\" \"own experiences,\" \"friend's opinion,\" and \"facility's reputation in public media.\" General cleanliness, low nosocomial infection rates, and friendly staff proved to be the most important issues in our study. In contrast, the reputation of the health care facility in the public media was much less important. It seems that kindness and basic hygiene measures, both quite inexpensive factors, are key issues for patients. (Am J Med Qual 2008;23:56-59)",

We studied the effect of intensive public reporting on hospital mortality for 6 high-frequency, high-mortality medical conditions.

The effect of public reporting was estimated using a difference in differences approach. Patients treated at hospitals subjected to intensive public reporting had significantly lower odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with similar patients treated at hospitals in environments with no public reporting or only limited reporting. Overall, the 2000-2003 in-hospital mortality odds ratio for Pennsylvania patients versus non-Pennsylvania patients ranged from 0.59 to 0.79 across 6 clinical conditions (all P < .0001).

All EDBA members were invited to participate via an e-mail survey. New models could be of their own design or developed by another organization and presented with permission. In all, 25 departments provided information on intake innovations. These submissions were collated into a document that outlines some of the new models. Collaborative methodology promoted the diffusion of innovation in this organization. The results of the project are presented here as an original article that outlines some of the new and mostly unpublished work occurring to improve the intake process into the ED.",

Of 1044 patients discharged home, 518 (49.6%) patients had scheduled follow-up ≤14 days after discharge, 52 (4.9%) patients were scheduled ≥15 days after discharge, and 474 (45.4%) had no scheduled follow-up. There was no statistical difference in 30-day readmissions between patients with follow-up within 14 days and those with follow-up 15 days or longer from discharge (P = .36) or between patients with follow-up within 14 days and those without scheduled follow-up (P = .75). The timing of postdischarge follow-up did not affect readmissions.

Frequency of documentation of health history and preventive service indicator items were similar in the 2 groups of practices. Although EMRs provide the capacity for more robust record keeping, the community-based practices here do not use EMRs to their full capacity.

The analysis reveals that the Web sites most likely to be found by consumers are owned by private companies and provide information based on anecdotal patient experiences. Web sites less likely to be found have government or community-based ownership, are based on administrative data, and contain a mixture of quality, cost, and patient experience information. Searches for information on hospitals reveal more cost and quality information based on administrative data, whereas searches that focus on clinics or physicians are more likely to produce information based on patient narratives.",

Improving the quality of care delivered surrounding this procedure demands rigorous measurement of competency, and validated tools to assess performance are essential. Using the iterative, modified Delphi technique and experts in multiple disciplines across the United States, the study team created a 30-item checklist designed to assess competency in the placement of ultrasound-guided internal jugular central lines. Cronbach α was .94, indicating an excellent degree of internal consistency. Further validation of this checklist will require its implementation in simulated and clinical environments.",

Of 157 patients identified as having developed hospital-associated, potentially preventable VTE, only 92 (58.6%) patients developed radiographically confirmed VTE that were potentially preventable. This misclassification of VTE overestimates the marginal additional treatment cost by more than $860 000 and amounts to nearly $200 000 in lost reward in one year alone. ICD-9 codes alone have extremely low positive predictive value to identify true VTE events. The authors recommend linking provision of risk-appropriate prophylaxis to VTE outcomes as a better target for performance improvement.",

The authors examined qualitative data from practice staff and external facilitators participating in a large-scale QI initiative to understand the relationship between turnover and QI efforts. The examination found turnover can limit practices' ability to engage in QI activities in various ways. When a staff member leaves, remaining staff often absorb additional responsibilities, and QI momentum slows as new staff are trained or existing staff are reengaged. Turnover alters staff dynamics and can create barriers to constructive working relationships and team building. When key practice members leave, they can take with them institutional memory about QI purpose, processes, and long-term vision. Understanding how turnover affects QI may help practices, and those helping them with QI, manage the disruptive effects of turnover.",

We used linear regression to sequentially model (a) specific procedures performed, (b) preoperative patient characteristics, and (c) postoperative events to determine the relative impact of these 3 factors on resource use. We then used the resulting models to calculate adjusted mean hospital costs and LOS. These 3 factors were all significantly associated with resource use.

Despite risk adjustment for these factors, resource use differed significantly across 12 hospitals (mean cost range, $22,200 to $41,900; mean LOS range, 11 to 18 days), suggesting that some institutions may need to reduce their resource use.",

A decision analytic model was developed for patients with high expected use of blood analysis, high potential benefit from rapid turn around time of results, a large annual volume of patients, and substantial expense associated with surgery. Published literature and clinical experts provided incidence, outcome, and cost estimates associated with four clinical scenarios potentially influenced by POC testing (ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, severe postoperative bleeding, and iatrogenic anemia). We found that changes in clinical outcomes were predominantly dependent on comparative turn around time or CABG patient volume. The positive clinical impact of using POC testing was consistently associated with a positive economic impact. POC blood gas analysis may be associated with decreased incidence of adverse clinical events or earlier detection of such events, resulting in significant cost savings. This study also supports previous findings that the costs of STAT blood analysis are more personnel-related than equipment-related.",

    "abstract": "We report findings on the outpatient management of diabetes mellitus in Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in five Arizona Medicare-managed care plans. These findings are the baseline of an ongoing collaboration between the Health Services Advisory Group, Inc., Arizona's Peer Review Organization (PRO), and the five plans whose object is improved care of diabetes patients. The purpose of the study was to determine congruity between quality indicators identified by the five plans and the care actually received by diabetes patients enrolled in the five plans. The five plans agreed on a common set of quality indicators, including 10 services and 10 measures of patient status. Each plan has identified its diabetic population, 75 of whom are randomly selected each quarter by the PRO for chart review and inclusion in the study. The findings in this report cover two quarters of data. Data from chart review were examined to determine the extent to which actual practice reflected the indicators. The mean patient age was 71.8, and for most patients onset occurred between 55 and 69 years of age. About 25% had a positive family history, and we estimate the annual incidence of diabetes in this population to be about 1.1%. Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.9 +/- 2.1%; 46% were hypertensive; 42% continued to smoke cigarettes; 36% had retinopathy; 20% had proteinuria; and only 22% were on some kind of exercise program. Thirty-two percent were hospitalized during the 1-year baseline period, and the average number of outpatient visits per patient was 11.1 +/- 7.4. When care provided to diabetes patients enrolled in the plans was compared with the 10 quality standards identified by the plans themselves, only two of these standards was attained in more than 60% of patients: blood pressure, 98.7%; and foot examination, 62.7%. Two standards were achieved less than one-third of the time: urine dipstick, 10.4%, and appropriate use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 31.25%. The others were all between 40 and 55%. Of the 10 service standards, about one-third received 1-4, one-third received 5-6, and one-third received 7-10. Only 5% of patients received 9 or 10 services. Outpatient management of diabetes patients in managed-care plans is similar to that in fee-for-service. When compared with fee-for-service or another HMO, a higher proportion of Arizona-managed care patients had HbA1c, and a much lower proportion had a dipstick test for urine protein. Values for other variables were usually within 10 percentage points of each other. Regardless of payment scheme, diabetes care is characterized by inconsistencies, omissions, and a lower than desirable level of services. Although few patients received most of the indicator services, diabetes patients are nevertheless high utilizers of medical care, both in and out of the hospital. The hospitalization rate is twice that of Arizona Medicare beneficiaries as a whole, and the number of office visits is three or four times that reported in other studies. Further, it seems that many visits are required to achieve even these modest service levels. Had the average number of visits been six or less, HbA1c rates, for example, would have fallen to less than one-third in three of the five plans. We believe that these data are conservative because it is likely that some and perhaps most of these indicators are underreported. It should be emphasized that these are baseline data whose purpose is to provide a basis against which subsequent improvements many be measured.",

To determine potential reasons for this observation, we analyzed data from a national household telephone survey examining various aspects of health and health care across racial or ethnic groups. As in previous studies, Asians reported lower satisfaction with their physicians and health care services than other racial or ethnic groups, even after adjusting for demographic and health-related variables. However, Asians also reported lower satisfaction with their health insurance and with life in general and were less likely than non-Asians to have changed physicians due to dissatisfaction. We conclude that lower satisfaction ratings among Asians may be due to different response tendencies rather than to differences in quality of care. Further research is needed to explain this phenomenon and assess its potential impact on quality-of-care evaluations for clinicians and health care organizations providing care for large numbers of Asian-Americans.",

    "abstract": "As physicians and health administrators increasingly incorporate patients' perspectives into health care, patient satisfaction has become a significant health care outcome. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the patient satisfaction instruments being used by leading academic medical centers. The objective of this study was to determine the types of patient satisfaction instruments used by leading academic medical centers. We conducted a telephone survey of 16 leading academic medical centers across the United States to determine the types of patient satisfaction instruments used at each institution for outpatient and inpatient care. Among the institutions surveyed, a significantly higher proportion used internally developed surveys for satisfaction measurement among outpatients than for satisfaction measurement among inpatients. Although much attention has been focused on patient satisfaction in recent years, there is little standardization of the patient satisfaction instruments currently being used at the academic medical centers surveyed, particularly for outpatient care. This lack of standardization limits opportunities for benchmarking of patient satisfaction data among peer institutions and may limit efforts to improve care.",

This article presents a brief conceptual framework for the type of information needed for an Internet-based information system and analyzes existing federal and state NF websites, using data collected from a survey completed in 2002. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have a variety of information on NFs, similar to the information on the Medicare website. Information on characteristics and deficiencies of a facility is the most commonly available, but a few states have data on ownership, staffing indicators, quality indicators, complaints, and enforcement actions. Other types of data, such as resident characteristics, staff turnover rates, and financial indicators, are generally not available. Although many states are making progress toward providing consumers with information, there are gaps that exist, which if filled, could provide consumers with a better tool for facility selection and monitoring the quality of care.",

The sample (n = 34 151) included all veterans dually enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and the private sector in 1998 with (1) an inpatient discharge from either a VA or Medicare setting for 1 of 6 conditions/procedures and (2) inpatient and/or outpatient use in both the VA and private sector. The authors used the Diagnostic Cost Groups risk-adjustment system to obtain concurrent and prospective health status (relative risk scores) using veterans' Medicare diagnoses only, VA diagnoses only, and diagnoses from both systems. Both concurrent and prospective relative risk scores increased when diagnoses from both systems were used; the population's disease profile also was affected. The authors conclude that it is important to capture the true disease burden of the population by obtaining diagnoses from all health care systems providing care to facilitate meaningful comparisons of performance.",

Analyses employed claims data to examine relationships between IVR reminders and preventive service use 5 to 9 months postintervention among members without prior utilization. Multivariate logistic regressions controlling for age, gender (for influenza immunizations), and risk stratum confirmed hypothesized relationships between intervention and preventive services: mammograms, odds ratio (OR) = 1.263 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.104, 1.444); Pap tests, OR = 1.241 (1.107, 1.391); influenza immunizations, OR = 2.072 (1.665, 2.580). IVR reminders are associated with higher rates of mammograms, Pap tests, and influenza immunizations. Study limitations include unknown generalizability of results and possible self-selection. There is justification for more IVR interventions and research to enhance MCO members’ preventive service utilization.",

    "abstract": "Hospital pharmacists have been challenged to face the paradigm shift in their model of services in the 21st century in Taiwan. Patients are increasingly concerned about drug safety and medication errors. Because of the financial crisis of our national insurance bureau, pharmacists are required to care for more patients, use fewer resources, and work faster, better, and more efficiently than ever before while striving to enhance customer satisfaction and quality of care. Under these circumstances, patient safety needs to be a priority of pharmacists. According to a preliminary report on medication error announced by the nonofficial medication error reporting system, pharmacist dispensing error ranked second in the list of errors in Taiwan. In our drive to improve quality, reduce costs, and enhance financial performance, our department has tried the traditional quality-improvement strategy with varying degrees of success. We wanted to achieve a breakthrough result, hence we implemented Six-Sigma methodology. This program is the catalyst needed to combine quality, cost, and patient safety. This article describes our experience using Six-Sigma methodology to reduce dispensing error in our pharmacy department.",

This article describes a strategy to promote policy and standardization of innovative off-label medication use, ensure oversight of patient safety, and prospectively assess efficacy. A multidisciplinary group developed a policy and process to regulate innovative off-label medication use that standardizes formulary review, maximizes peer expertise input, and minimizes institution liability by evaluating the effectiveness of use, promoting evidence-based practices, and ensuring ethical obligations to patients and society. This strategy has been implemented through institutional staff structure. The review process balances benefits/risks for biologically plausible therapy that lacks rigorous data support. The authors' strategy illustrates collaboration that enables a priori consideration for innovative off-label medication use while providing safety surveillance and outcomes monitoring.",

The mean of the most recent test was 7.8%. The frequency of testing varied significantly by clinic from 79% to 94% and increased with the number of encounters. Poor glycemic control also varied significantly by clinic (17-48%) and was significantly better in females and older patients. Measures of glycemic control were not associated with ethnicity or insurance status in multivariate analyses. A high proportion of diabetic patients received appropriate care, and this care was not associated with ethnicity or insurance status.

Multiple factors, including shortages, costs, infectious risks, immunologic risks, and the risk/benefit ratio to the patient, have made the medical community reassess the guidelines for transfusion. Cardiac surgery presents a unique subset of patients, because intervention at multiple stages in the care of these patients is possible to decrease the need for transfusion. An algorithm for a cardiac surgery program was developed and a reassessment performed. Once it was seen that no detrimental effect on patient care occurred, the program was expanded, was enhanced, and subsequently has been offered to the rest of the health care system. This program has resulted in a decrease in cost while maintaining patient outcomes. The success of the program is believed to be a result of the multidisciplinary approach taken, with a commitment from all members of the blood reduction team being the key component of this success.",

The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of a random sample of 50 individuals aged 65 years or older from each practice. The 2003 version of the Beers criteria was used to identify PIP. Results show that some one fourth of the elderly sampled in both practices had 1 or more incidents of PIP. The most common potentially inappropriate drug classes prescribed were psychotropic agents and anti-inflammatory drugs. Demographic patient variables were not significantly associated with PIP.

Eight versions of a report were developed, varying whether data were consistent across indicators, whether data were presented in text or graphs, and whether confidence intervals were included. A report and a questionnaire were mailed to a randomly selected sample of local residents. Findings provide no evidence that consistency of indicators, data presentation, report format, or inclusion of confidence intervals significantly impacted consumers' understanding. More educated consumers reported greater understanding of the reports. Responses suggested that public reporting of comparative data on HAIs could influence hospital choice, but other factors including prior experience, reputation, physicians' recommendations, and insurance coverage are also influential. Most consumers understand information on HAIs when it is presented in a short, simple report, and most correctly select the best or worst hospital. Consumers may be influenced by such data, but other factors are likely to be as or more important.",

The results suggest that significant systemic barriers limit the ability of primary care providers, particularly those in small practices, to effectively manage diabetes in current practice. Future primary care reform should consider how to support providers, particularly those in small practices, to overcome these barriers.",

    "abstract": "The overall objective of this initiative was to develop a quality improvement (QI) curriculum using Lean methodology for internal medicine residents at Boston Medical Center, a safety net academic hospital. A total of 90 residents and 8 School of Public Health students participated in a series of four, 60- to 90-minute interactive and hands-on QI sessions. Seventeen QI project plans were created and conducted over a 4-month period. The curriculum facilitated internal medicine residents' learning about QI and development of positive attitudes toward QI (assessed using pre- and post-attitude surveys) and exposed them to an interprofessional team structure that duplicates future working relationships. This QI curriculum can be an educational model of how health care trainees can work collaboratively to improve health care quality.",

A total of 7 outcomes (primary care visits, specialist visits, laboratory tests, radiology tests, emergency department visits, admissions and readmissions) and 11 potential confounders were considered. The study sample included 213 physicians (50% of whom had achieved MU) and 127 353 patients. There were 17 fewer primary care visits and 61 fewer laboratory tests for every 100 patients whose physicians achieved MU, compared with patients whose physicians did not achieve MU (P < .05 for each). There were no differences for other outcomes. Achieving stage 1 MU was associated with fewer primary care visits and laboratory tests, suggesting that effects of MU are distinct from effects of typical EHR use.",

This perceived improvement in patient safety concerns for residents was associated with observable improvements in areas of high concern for hospital leaders.

To facilitate empirical research to reduce disruptive clinician behaviors, an assessment tool (Johns Hopkins Disruptive Clinician Behavior Survey [JH-DCBS]) with 5 discrete subscales was developed using a 2-step design. First a pool of items was generated from focus group studies and the literature, and then a psychometric evaluation of the survey was conducted with a sample of clinicians (N = 1198) practicing in a large urban academic medical center. The results indicated that the tool was reliable (Cronbach α = .79-.91), showed high content validity (Content Validity Index = .97), and had significantly high correlations with theoretically selected variables. The study team concluded that the JH-DCBS provides a valid empirical assessment of disruptive behavior.

    "abstract": "Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a rare but deadly neurological emergency. Accordingly, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines summarize current evidence into a straightforward algorithm for its management. The goal of this study is to evaluate the overall compliance with these guidelines in patients with suspected ABM. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted of adult patients who underwent lumbar puncture for suspected ABM to ascertain local adherence patterns to IDSA guidelines for bacterial meningitis. Primary outcomes included appropriate utilization of neuroimaging, blood cultures, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and lumbar puncture. In all, 160 patients were included in the study. Overall IDSA compliance was only 0.6%. Neuroimaging and blood cultures were appropriately utilized in 54.3% and 47.5% of patients, respectively. Steroids and antibiotics were appropriately administered in only 7.5% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. Adherence to IDSA guidelines is poor. Antibiotic choice is often incorrect, corticosteroids are rarely administered, and there is an overutilization of neuroimaging.",

The study population consisted of 103 ICUs; 60 ICUs (58%) used CUSP, with 6 of them later discontinuing CUSP, and 17 ICUs (16.5%) never used CUSP. The researchers could not determine CUSP use status for the remaining 26 ICUs because of missing data. The use of CUSP was associated with improved safety climate, job satisfaction, and working conditions after a 2-year period, as measured by the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. Study results on barriers and CLABSIs are inconclusive. This study demonstrated that unit-based, formalized processes targeting cultural improvements in teamwork, communication, self-identification of hazards, and hazard mitigation can improve several aspects of patient safety climate in ICUs.",

Meeting this challenge requires an understanding of the health needs of the older veteran population, including health disparities that exist across racial ethnic populations. This study examines the self-rated health and functioning of a national sample of veterans aged 65+ participating in the National Survey of Veterans. The results show that over one half of elderly veterans report difficulty in functioning and rate their health status as fair or poor. Additionally, elderly African American and Hispanic veterans report worse health than non-Hispanic white veterans across the majority of health indicators. Given the health profile of older veterans found in this study, it would seem necessary that programs serving older veterans be adept at the ongoing medical management of chronic disease and the provision of long-term care services.",

A case-control trial assessing the prescribing rates of erythropoietin by physicians is used. The participants and setting involves a total of 11,644 physician-patient encounters in 2 community oncology practices in the United States during a 21-month period. The intervention is a clinical reminder generated in real time during a physician-patient encounter by an EMR identifying cancer patients with low hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (ie, anemic), that is, patients with Hgb less then 12 g/dL. The main outcome measure is to determine the frequency of erythropoietin prescription by physicians to cancer patients with low Hgb levels. Implementation of a clinical reminder generated by way of an EMR significantly improved the likelihood of low-Hgb patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin. Low-Hgb patients in the experimental clinic during the time that the clinical reminder system was in place were almost twice as likely (ie, adjusted odds ratio = 1.92, P = .008) to have been treated with erythropoietin. The data support the effectiveness of clinical reminders as a way to influence physician prescribing behaviors and potentially improve the quality of patient care. However, we feel that there is a need to investigate the use of reminders in other aspects of cancer care that may be undertreated or when new drugs may be available but are underused.",

A controlled trial was performed in a primary care clinic of a public supported, urban, university hospital. The patients were mainly poor, minority, urban individuals visiting the clinic for their first primary care visit. The providers were attending physicians, nurse practitioners, and medical residents associated with the Department of Medicine teaching program. A self-administered history questionnaire was given to approximately half the new patients in a randomized, prospective manner. The physicians completed an assessment form on all new patients estimating the time spent, complexity of the case, and listing studies requested. If a history questionnaire was completed by the patient, the physician completed an assessment irrespective of whether it helped or hindered the evaluation of the patient. After the visit, nurses called the patient by telephone and asked questions concerning the patient's satisfaction. The patients' records were reviewed for the initial history papers. There were 127 patients receiving the history questionnaire and 114 controls. The presence of the history questionnaire in the medical record added to both the quantity and the quality of the information present. Of the provider responses, 87% (95% confidence interval: 78-93%) wanted all new patients to complete the questionnaire. Of the patients who received the questionnaire, all who were asked felt that all their issues were addressed, compared with only 83% in the control group (P = .015). No increases in physician time or in utilization of medical resources were found. The implementation of a self-administered history questionnaire in an urban primary care clinic resulted in improved chart quality and improved satisfaction of physicians and patients.",

More recently, the autopsy has fallen on hard times, with US hospital rates now below 5%. The reasons for the decline in rates are multifaceted and include a lack of direct reimbursement for the procedure, lack of defined minimum rate standards, overconfidence in diagnostic technology, and the fear of litigation. Regardless of the reasons for the declining rates, the ethical and professional reasons for increasing the number of autopsies are far more important.",

    "abstract": "The Acute Physiologic Score and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Simplified Acute Physiologic Scale (SAPS) II are two of the more commonly employed predictors of outcome and performance in the intensive care unit setting. However, controversy persists about whether the scores generated by these systems have similar predictive value. This study compared the predicted mortalities derived from APACHE II and SAPS II and contrasted them to the actual mortality in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Data for 1665 patients admitted to the SICU between July 1994 and August 1997 were entered into an SICU computerized database. From recorded demographic, hemodynamic, and laboratory data, APACHE II and SAPS II scores were obtained with corresponding predicted mortalities. Patients were stratified by age into categories of less than and greater than 65 years old. Predicted mortalities by APACHE II and SAPS II were compared for each group. An additional analysis included a comparison of survivors and nonsurvivors. There was no significant difference in predicted mortality between APACHE II and SAPS II in any of the groups. Actual mortality was 30 of 486 (6.2%) in patients less than 65 years of age and 73 of 1179 (6.2%) in patients 65 years of age or greater. The APACHE II and SAPS II predicted mortalities (mean +/- SD) for patients less than 65 years of age were 10.5% +/- 10.6% and 10.9% +/- 13.3%, respectively (P > .05). The APACHE II and SAPS II predicted mortalities in patients 65 years of age or greater were 19.1% +/- 17.8% and 18.7% +/- 21.0%, respectively (P > .05). Similarly, when patients were stratified by survival status, no significant difference was present between groups. However, in individual patients, a difference between APACHE II and SAPS II scores was often present. We conclude that although disparities between APACHE II and SAPS II predicted mortalities in individual patients may be significant, APACHE II and SAPS II have similar predictive value in a large SICU patient population. However, both APACHE II and SAPS II systems overestimate mortality in SICU patients. Based on our results, we conclude that either system can be used to measure quality of care in the SICU; however, neither system can be reliably applied to a single patient.",

They must also engage institutional leaders in fostering a culture of safety and encourage multidisciplinary collaboration to learn from mistakes and improve microsystem-level processes.

Yet the role of IT departments in maximizing the effectiveness of information systems is not well understood. This article reports a 3-round Delphi panel of Veterans Administration personnel experienced with provider order entry electronic systems. In round 1, 35 administrative, clinical, and IT personnel answered 10 open-ended questions about IT strategies and structures that best support successful transformation. In round 2, panelists rated item importance and ranked proposed strategies. In round 3, panelists received aggregate feedback and rerated the items. Four domains emerged from round 1: IT organization, IT performance monitoring, user-support activities, and core IT responsibilities (eg, computer security, training). In rounds 2 and 3, IT performance monitoring was rated the most important, closely followed by clinical support. Strategies associated with each domain are identified and discussed.",

Nine learners, 2 preventive medicine and 7 endocrinology fellows, participated in this rotation. Key concepts taught by the 4 engineering faculty include stake-holder analysis, root cause analysis, process mapping, failure mode and effects analysis, resource management, negotiation, and leadership.

One identified inpatients with potential DAs, whereas the other addressed creation and deployment of \"Alpha Teams\" (ATs). In the event of impending respiratory compromise, an AT was called in the same manner as a code blue. Health care providers were educated about these process changes, and ATs were tested using computerized patient simulators and self-paced observations. Testing assessed performance before, immediately after, and 30 days after the seminar. Changes in, and retention of, knowledge about DAs was analyzed. The goal of the R3P3 was to identify DAs and then to bring a well-trained hospital-wide AT to the bedside to decrease response time, rapidly establish a definitive airway, and improve survivability in an airway emergency.",

A team of panel practitioners then developed a strategy to reduce overuse of 5 identified behaviors. The intervention was evaluated using a pre—post comparison of the panel's use of the 5 behaviors. During the preintervention period, narcotics, muscle relaxants, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and spinal injections increased between 8% and 18% per month. Postintervention, the trends reversed. The differences were statistically significant (P < .0001) for muscle relaxant use, narcotic use, overall MRI use, and spinal injections.

Physicians were surveyed to ascertain their beliefs about behaviors that constitute intimidation and to correlate those findings with definitions of intimidation identified by several national professional organizations. Our findings suggest that a majority of physicians in perioperative services agree that behaviors identified as intimidating by national organizations actually constitute intimidation in only 4 of 9 instances and that, for even the most egregious behaviors, there is lack of complete agreement that the behavior constitutes intimidation.These findings suggest reasons why traditional means of addressing intimidating behavior may not be effective and also suggest alternative means of handling behaviors that disrupt the care environment.",

As initial evaluation of this protocol, the authors retrospectively compared potassium and blood glucose lowering in patients treated with the weight-based (0.1 units/kg) insulin order panel (n = 195) with those given insulin based on provider judgment (n = 69). Serum potassium lowering did not differ between groups and there was no relationship between dose of insulin and amount of potassium lowering. There was a difference in hypoglycemia rates between groups ( P = .049), with fewer severe hypoglycemic events in the panel (2.56%) than in the non-panel group (10.14%).

Patients receiving the full complement of TCM had 86.6% decreased odds of readmission compared with patients who did not receive TCM ( P < .001). However, the complete package of TCM services under Medicare guidelines may not be essential. A postdischarge telephone call did not reduce readmission odds, provided a TCM office visit occurred. Important for risk assessment models targeting patients for TCM, the number of previous hospital admissions, not age, predicted 30-day readmission risk.

Using an empty model, this study found that 27% of the variation in HCAHPS scores was at the level of the county in which the hospital was located. The county factors examined explained about half of this county-level variation. Among community factors most strongly associated with increased HCAHPS scores were higher numbers of primary care physicians per capita, fewer specialists per capita, and smaller percentages of African Americans and Hispanics in the county. A number of community factors beyond the hospitalization experience may influence HCAHPS scores. As HCAHPS gains importance as a measure of quality of care and is linked to higher payments over time, it will be essential to understand the possible effects of community factors.",

    "abstract": "Patient-provider communication has been recognized as a critical area of focus for improved health care quality, with a mounting body of evidence tying patient satisfaction and provider communication to important health care outcomes. Despite this, few programs have been studied in the emergency department (ED) setting. The authors designed a communication curriculum and conducted trainings for all ED clinical staff. Although only 72% of clinicians believed the course would be a valuable use of their time before taking it, 97% reported that it was a valuable use of their time after ( P < .001). Pre-course self-evaluation of knowledge, skill, and ability were high. Despite this, post-course self-efficacy improved statistically significantly. This study suggests that it is possible, in a brief training session, to deliver communication content that participants felt was relevant to their practice, improved their skills and knowledge, changed their attitude, and was perceived to be a valuable use of their time.",

One-year changes in clinicians' and staff experiences of practice climate among 5 practices implementing interdisciplinary primary care teams and 28 other practices were compared. In adjusted analyses, practices implementing care teams reported improved team structure (78.0 in 2011 vs 79.3 in 2012), team functioning (75.7 vs 77.7), readiness for change (77.6 vs 77.7), and perceptions of skills and knowledge (48.0 vs 53.6) over time. However, the improvements were not significantly different from changes experienced by other practices. Achieving improvements in practice climate through care team redesign is challenging, even with structured learning opportunities for team members. Practice climate did not deteriorate over time, indicating that implementing a complex team redesign does not harm working relationships of frontline clinicians and staff.",

Compared to the multitude of available inpatient safety measures, the number of existing adult primary care measures is low. The measures identified by this systematic review may yield further insight into the breadth of safety events causing harm in primary care, while also identifying areas of patient safety in primary care that may be understudied.",

In the hospital-level analysis, the risk-adjusted AHRQ PSI composite was not significantly associated with hospital 30-day readmission rate after controlling for hospital-level characteristics, patient case mix, and sociodemographics. Inpatient quality of care appears to have less influence on hospital readmission rates than do clinical and socioeconomic factors.

We used Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases to develop and validate a risk adjustment model to predict decline in functional status, an important outcome measure in long-term care, among patients residing in VA long-term care facilities. This model was used to compare facilities on adjusted and unadjusted rates of decline. Predictors of decline included age, time between assessments, baseline functional status, terminal illness, pressure ulcers, pulmonary disease, cancer, arthritis, congestive heart failure, substance-related disorders, and various neurologic disorders. The model performed well in the development and validation databases (c statistics, 0.70 and 0.68, respectively). Risk-adjusted rates and rankings of facilities differed from unadjusted ratings. We conclude that judgments of facility performance depend on whether risk-adjusted or unadjusted decline rates are used. Valid risk adjustment models are therefore necessary when comparing facilities on outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Florida legislation implemented in the fall of 1992, unique in the nation, mandated that practice guidelines regarding cesarean section deliveries be disseminated to obstetric physicians. The law also required that peer review boards at hospitals be established to review cesarean deliveries and that the exact dates of implementation of the guidelines be reported to a state agency. To determine the impact of the legislation, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 366,246 total live births occurring in Florida hospitals during 1992 and 1993, before and after formal hospital certification of the implementation of the guidelines. Changes in primary and repeat cesarean rates were analyzed for 108 independent groups of births, controlling for the mother's age, race, payment source, and the timing of the implementation of the guidelines at hospitals. The guideline certification program did not accelerate the consistent but gradual downward trend in cesarean births which had already been evident in the three prior years. The data do suggest that the guideline program may have affected repeat cesareans more than primary cesareans, especially in the first quarter of 1993, immediately after the hospital certification period. Reductions in repeat cesareans involved both Medicaid and commercially insured births, whereas reductions in primary cesareans were found almost exclusively within commercially insured mothers, where the existing rates are highest. Although births with a prior cesarean represent only 12.5% of all births, significant decreases in repeat cesareans were found in groups representing 72.6% of this population. By comparison, significant decreases in primary cesareans were found in groups representing only 36.5% of the births without a prior cesarean. The date of guideline implementation reported by hospitals was not related to any systematic change in observed cesarean section rates. We concluded that the mere dissemination of practice guidelines by a state agency may not achieve either the magnitude or the specificity of the results desired without an explicit and thorough guideline implementation program. Blunt legislative mandates may be ineffective when multiple initiatives are already achieving desired outcomes.",

We employed regression analysis to compare mortality rate trends for Cleveland versus the rest of Ohio using Ohio Hospital Association inpatient mortality data. We found that the rate of decline in mortality in Cleveland (-.218% per 6 months; 95% confidence limits, -.278% to -.159% per 6 months) was statistically indistinguishable from that in the rest of the state (-.188% per 6 months; 95% confidence limits, -.234% to -.143% per 6 months) (P = .35).

The efficiency groups are based on LOS and functional gain cut point values in the statistical distribution that are above, below, or within the national interquartile range for each of 53 FRGs. Data from 32,494 patients discharged in 1990 from 123 rehabilitation facilities were used.

    "abstract": "Because trauma admission and hospitalization patterns have profound effects on the organization and utilization of urban trauma-care systems, the objective of this study was to identify and analyze these patterns. As an example, admissions to an urban Level I trauma center were reviewed. Retrospective review of all 2029 trauma admissions to a Level I trauma center was conducted from 1993 to 1996. The result was that most trauma patients were young (40% <30 years of age) and male (74%). Mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accident (36%), fall (27%), gunshot (17%), stab (7%), assault (6%), and swimming or diving accident (3%). Half of the patients were directly admitted from the scene. Injury Severity Score, length of stay, and mortality were 14.1 ± 0.3, 10.5 ± 0.3 days, and 5.1%, respectively. Admissions tended to occur more frequently between 4:00 PM and midnight (46%), between Friday and Sunday (52%), and between July and October (41%). The following patterns were identified: admissions per year decreased (-21%) because of reduced penetrating trauma (-43%, P < .01); pediatric patients (<15 years) had similar incidence of penetrating trauma as adults (ages 15-45). Length of stay for all mechanisms of injury was not statistically different; most mortalities occurred within the first day (33%, P < .01) or after 6 days (36%, P < .01); early mortality was mainly due to penetrating injury (74%, P < .01), whereas late mortality was related to blunt trauma (92%, P < .01). The conclusion was that admission and demographic patterns were identified, which may be useful in the utilization, modification, and future design of trauma systems.",

Predischarge satisfaction declined with greater medical events (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.97, P < .05) and with concomitant anxiety (AOR= 0.92, CI= 0.89, 0.95, P< .001); reduced satisfaction at 1 month was associated with high anxiety (AOR = 0.97, CI = 0.95, 0.98) and depression (AOR = 0.96, CI = 0.93, 0.99) at that time.

As validation of this method, investigators abstracted 123 medical charts of patients identified through AHRQ methodology as having hospital-acquired decubitus ulcers. Abstraction of these cases produced a change in rate from 23.3 decubitus ulcers per 1000 patients, derived through administrative data, to a true rate of 7.9 decubitus ulcers per 1000 patients, a 66% reduction. Investigators found 2 additional flaws (1 internal and 1 methodological) that further decreased the decubitus ulcer rate to 6.14 per 1000, a 74% variance.

One hundred of Iowa's hospitals (86%) completed a survey. The highest progress ratings were for items involving hand washing, unit-dose medication dispensing, influenza vaccinations, implementing protocols to prevent wrong-site procedures, and standardized methods for labeling and storing medications. The lowest progress ratings were for intensive care units staffed by intensivists and implementing a computerized provider order entry system. Overall, safe practices that have been recommended for some time had higher priority and progress ratings. Most safe practices were equally endorsed by large and small hospitals, suggesting that the NQF goal of identifying safe hospital practices may be attainable for most of the safe practices.",

Over 6 months, time to death and first all-cause readmission data were collected. Data were adjusted for differences in comorbidities, medications, and demographics in a multivariate model.There was no difference in 6-month mortality between the 2 groups. Adjusted time to death or all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.97; P = .03) and all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P = .03) were shorter for the study group compared with control, whereas there was no difference in time to death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.66-1.11; P = .24).Adherence to a composite of HFPM appears to be related to a reduction in all-cause readmissions for patients with HF but not short-term mortality.",

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most frequent admitting diagnosis and is associated with increased hospital length of stay. This performance improvement initiative used Six Sigma methodology to reduce CHF length of stay at a community hospital. Daily rounding, prioritization of CHF patients for left-ventricular (LV) assessments, and standardization of orders accounted for improvements in delivery of care. Turnaround time for LV assessments was reduced from a mean of 2.2 days to a mean of 0.78 days. Use of standardized CHF order sets by physicians rose from 25% to 72.6%, and length of stay was reduced from 7 days to 4 days (P = .00). Physician leadership, interdisciplinary team dynamics, and standardization of practice play crucial roles in reducing length of stay.",

Unwarranted variations were a concern for 90% of survey respondents, with no differences by state (P = .7) or hospital size (P = .2). Of these, 75% had a strategy in place to reduce variation. The likelihood of a multipronged approach was significantly higher in larger hospitals (P = .0009).

After initiating the huddle, patient length of stay decreased by 1.4 days (25%), patient flow into continuum partners increased by 10%, and the number of patients going without services after their hospital stay decreased by more than 12%. Huddle members reported that the technology was helpful, heavily utilized, and made their work more efficient.

In a retrospective analysis of Medicare claims data, the relationship between outpatient visits within 14 days after hospital discharge and readmission was examined for beneficiaries with AF or other chronic conditions. About half of those beneficiaries with a hospitalization had an outpatient visit within 14 days of discharge. Readmission rates were 11% to 24% lower for beneficiaries with an outpatient visit than for those without one (P < .01).

Many leaders gave examples of existing innovative practices to meeting their diverse patient needs, such as patient-centered approaches. Participants expressed challenges to adapting quickly, but a desire to partner together. Safety net systems have already begun implementing innovative practices supporting their key priority areas.

This study evaluated the impact of a central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) initiative on costs, reimbursements, and margins for 1 Hawaii hospital and its payers. Intensive care unit patients (January 2009-December 2011) who developed a CLABSI were compared to matched controls. Mean hospital cost, reimbursement, and margin was $222 692 versus $80 144 (P = .01), $259 433 versus $72 543 (P < .01), and $54 906 versus $6506 (P < .01), respectively. Although hospitals and payers reduce costs by preventing CLABSIs, hospitals also would decrease their margins, which creates a perverse incentive to have more line infections. An optimal reimbursement system must reward hospitals and payers for preventing harm rather than treating illness. This study highlights the critical role that health care payers have as patient safety advocates, financial sponsors, and facilitators.",

    "abstract": "Paracentesis is an invasive procedure known to result in complications. Procedure skills should be taught and evaluated more effectively to improve health care quality. Validated checklists are central to teaching and assessing procedural skills. The results of the first step of the validation of a paracentesis checklist are described. A comprehensive literature review of articles published on paracentesis did not yield a validated checklist. A modified Delphi technique, involving a panel of 8 interdisciplinary, interinstitutional experts, was used to develop a paracentesis checklist. The internal consistency coefficient using Cronbach’s α was .92. Developing the 24-item paracentesis checklist for teaching and assessing paracentesis is the first step in the validation process. For this checklist to become further validated, it should be implemented and studied in the simulation and clinical environments.",

The authors’ goal was to identify such practices and the factors associated with their development. First, a national VHA diabetes registry with 2008 data identified clinical performance based on the percentage of patients with an A1c &gt;9%. Facilities (n = 140) and community-based outpatient clinics (n = 582) were included and stratified into high, mid, and low performers. Semistructured telephone interviews (31) and site visits (5) were conducted. Low performers cited lack of teamwork between physicians and nurses and inadequate time to prepare. Better performing sites reported supportive clinical teams sharing work, time for non-face-to-face care, and innovative practices to address local needs. A knowledge management model informed our process. Notable differences between performance levels exist. “Best practices” will be disseminated across the VHA as the VHA Patient-Centered Medical Home model is implemented.",

We report our experience using this framework, noting both how the framework helped anticipate needs and what challenges we encountered that were not anticipated based on the spread plan. Using our framework, we were able to spread the changes across more than 79 distinct hospital services, improving use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis to more than 95%.

Developing performance indicators that are relevant, valid, feasible, and easy to measure has proven difficult. To monitor progress, patient safety should be measured objectively. Although conceptual frameworks and error taxonomies have been proposed, a practical scorecard for measuring patient safety over time in EM has been lacking. This article proposes a framework that measures safety through 4 major domains: (1) how often patients are harmed, (2) how often appropriate interventions are delivered, (3) how well errors in the system are identified and corrected, and (4) emergency department (ED) safety culture. Examples of specific measures for each of these domains are provided, but the EM community should reach consensus on what measures are important for the ED environment and patients.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Society of Hospital Medicine were surveyed about geographic cohorting (GCh); 369 responses were analyzed, two thirds of which were from GCh participants. Improved collaboration with the bedside nurse, increased nonclinical interactions, decreased paging interruptions, and improved efficiency were perceived by &gt;50%. Narrowed clinical expertise, increased fragmentation, increased face-to-face interruptions, and an adverse impact on camaraderie within the hospitalist group were reported by 25% to 50%. Academic practices were associated with positive perceptions while higher patient loads were associated with negative perceptions. Comments on GCh benefits invoked improvements in (1) interprofessional collaboration, (2) efficiency, (3) patient-centeredness, (4) nursing satisfaction, and (5) GCh mediated facilitation of other interventions. GCh downsides included (1) professional and personal dissatisfaction, (2) concerns about providing suboptimal care, and (3) implementation barriers. GCh is receiving attention. Although it facilitates important benefits, it is perceived to mediate unintended consequences, which should be addressed in redesign efforts.",

Using national Medicare claims for 2009 to 2013, the authors studied the association between board certification and completion of Maintenance of Certification (MOC) requirements and surgeon rates of complications for 8 elective procedures. Exemplar surgeons were defined as those in the lowest decile of complication rates, and outlier surgeons were those in the highest decile. The analysis included 1.9 million procedures performed by 14 598 surgeons (64% orthopedics, 17% general surgery, 11% urology, 7% neurosurgery). Board-certified surgeons were less likely to be outliers (odds ratio 0.79 [0.66-0.94]). However, completion of MOC was not associated with differences in complication rates in orthopedic surgery or urology. Incorporating additional assessment methods into MOC, such as video evaluation of technical skills, retraining on state-of-the-art care, and peer review, may facilitate further improvements in surgical quality.",

    "abstract": "Patient records serve many purposes, one of which includes monitoring the quality of care provided that they can be analyzed through coding and documentation. Z-codes can provide additional information beyond a specific clinical disorder that may still warrant treatment. Social Determinants of Health have specific Z-codes that may help clinicians address social factors that may contribute to patients' health care outcomes. However, there are Z-codes that specify patient noncompliance which has a pejorative connotation that may stigmatize patients and prevent clinicians from examining nonadherence from a social determinant of health perspective. A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to examine the associations of patient and encounter characteristics with the coding of patient noncompliance. Included in the study were all patients >18 years of age who were admitted to hospitals participating in the Vizient Clinical Data Base (CDB) between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Almost 9 million US inpatients were included in the study. Of those, 6.3% had a noncompliance Z-code. Use of noncompliance Z-codes was associated with the following odds estimate ratio in decreasing order: the presence of a social determinant of health (odds ratio [OR], 4.817), African American race (OR, 2.010), Medicaid insurance (OR, 1.707), >3 chronic medical conditions (OR, 1.546), living in an economically distressed community (OR, 1.320), male gender (OR, 1.313), nonelective admission status (OR, 1.245), age <65 years (OR, 1.234). More than 1 in 15 patient hospitalizations had a noncompliance code. Factors associated with these codes are difficult, if not impossible, for patients to modify. Disproportionate representation of Africa-Americans among hospitalizations with noncompliance coding is concerning and urgently deserves further exploration to determine the degree to which it may be a product of clinician bias, especially if the term noncompliance prevents health care providers from looking into socioeconomic factors that may contribute to patient nonadherence.",

To determine if desires and expectations for selected elements of medical care and specialty referral differ between VA outpatients and non-VA outpatients, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients at a VA medical center site and 2 primary care sites of its university affiliate. Of 390 eligible patients at the VA medical center site, 270 (69Wo) consented to participate and returned completed self-administered questionnaires. At its university affiliate sites, 119 (73%) of the 162 eligible patients completed questionnaires. Overall, patient desire and expectation for elements of medical care and specialty referral were similar and high at all study sites. Desire ranged from 33% for a blood test to check for anemia to 80% for heart auscultation. Desire for specialty referral for hypothetical scenarios averaged 71% and 61% among VA Medical Center patients and university affiliate patients, respectively. Patient demographics and socioeconomic status were poor predictors of desire for care. These results suggest (a) that VA medical center outpatients' desires and expectations for preventive medical care are not significantly different from those of non-VA outpatients, (b) that desire is often high for both highly recommended care and care that is not generally recommended or is controversial, and (c) that high levels of desire are not limited to patients of higher levels of socioeconomic status. In an effort to improve satisfaction, it is important to examine ways in which to address patients' desires and expectations for medical care, even while faced with competing health care spending priorities.",

    "abstract": "Although approximately one of five people in the United States die in nursing homes (NHs), little has been written about their quality of dying, including the quality of terminal medical care. The purpose of this study is to review actual medical practices in NHs to suggest factors important for delivering good quality terminal care. Four NHs were surveyed for management of residents who died in 1992. A convenience sample of charts of newly admitted and longer term residents were abstracted for demographic variables, death, diagnostic categories, and various laboratory and other parameters. Charts of those residents who died were further reviewed using indicators of quality medical care, such as presence of advance directives, control of pain, and control of dyspnea, based upon recent published clinical practice guidelines for terminal care in NHs. Three hundred and seventy-one charts were abstracted. Forty-one charts documented the resident's death. We found that NHs without regulatory difficulties usually had expected deaths that were managed appropriately as measured by terminal medical care quality indicators. NHs with a history of regulatory difficulties had a higher prevalence of residents who died suddenly and unexpectedly, often with problems in the quality of care as measured by the same indicators. There was a correspondence between physician certification, antemortem diagnosis of terminal illness, and appropriate terminal care. We conclude that physicians are able to recognize impending death and redirect the medical care of dying NH residents toward goals of terminal care management. This is more likely to occur in a NH environment that places greater emphasis upon total quality management. We suggest that another indicator in providing good NH terminal care is the physician's performance in predicting a short life expectancy.",

As hospitalization insurance has moved from coverage that applied equally to all licensed hospitals to arrange ments which selected a certain preferred hospital or hospitals and rejected others, the need to determine the quality of different hospitals (as well as what they would cost the insurer or buyer) has become apparent. The product of this project was the development and demonstration of a set of rating methods that build on the strengths available in large hospital discharge data bases, such as (but by no means limited to) that of the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4). These measures, or others developed using these methods, deal with uncertainty in the data—its diagnosis and treatment—in a conceptually valid and practically useful way, illustrate a process that might be used in the general development of quality measures, and provide a useful critique of some other measures.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the patient perspective of surgical success through the measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), in order to identify the patient characteristics and process issues associated with postoperative changes in health status. Patients completed the RAND 36-item Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36) prior to surgery and at 6 months following surgery. Baseline patient demographic and clinical information were collected from the medical record and were used to develop models of change in HRQOL for 68 patients. While many patients improved, a number experienced no change or even a decline in HRQOL in the postoperative period. Factors associated with change in HRQOL are presented. The findings suggest that factors associated with change in health status can be systematically assessed, which may lead to the development of interventions aimed at those patient characteristics or process issues that impact on HRQOL.",

    "abstract": "Cost containment and quality of care represent the most important objectives of all health care professionals. Because of its progressive growth over the past decade, ambulatory surgery has become an area where these 2 issues need to be addressed. The goal of this paper is to discuss the economic and quality of care challenges faced by hospitals as they strive to become competitive in the 21st century. The quality of care in ambulatory surgery has been improving because of multidisciplinary activities. Hospitals tend to hire the staff on the basis of their expertise in certain areas, and those personnel do not have to cover other hospital roles. Moreover, the hospital staff is able to seek information at any time from coworkers in other areas of specialty. Ambulatory surgery in a hospital offers advantages, such as multiple operating rooms, multiple skilled health care providers, and the ability to stay overnight if needed. The consolidation of supplies makes it easier to contract for a better price. Aggressive contract negotiations and implementation of cost-effective and cost-efficient strategies are the keys to success in the future. Quality improvement (QI) initiatives and quality of care (QC) indicators need to be developed to address various problems in the ambulatory surgery setting such as unnecessary admissions, inadequate staffing, efficient operating room (OR) utilization, quality of care, and assessment outcome. These initiatives should be addressed at regular meetings where opportunities to improve the ambulatory services are discussed. The number of ambulatory surgery procedures performed each year will continue to increase, although perhaps not at the rate we experienced in the past. Procedures that once were performed in an inpatient setting can now be accomplished on an outpatient basis or even in the physician's office. We will continue to see this shift of volume as technologic advancements and anesthetic agents allow more complex procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the variations among individual physicians in prescribing antipsychotics for schizophrenia. This study examined clinical practice variations in the route and dosage of antipsychotic medication prescribed for inpatients with schizophrenia by 11 different psychiatrists. The sample consisted of 130 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia who had received inpatient care at a state hospital or Veterans Affairs medical center in the southeastern United States in 1992-1993. Mixed-effects regression models were developed to explore the influence of individual physicians and hospitals on route of antipsychotic administration (oral or depot) and daily antipsychotic dose, controlling for patient casemix variables (age, race, sex, duration of illness, symptom severity, and substance-abuse diagnosis). The average daily antipsychotic dose was 1092 ± 892 chlorpromazine mg equivalents. Almost half of the patients (48%) were prescribed doses above or below the range recommended by current practice guidelines. The proportion of patients prescribed depot antipsychotics was significantly different at the 2 hospitals, as was the antipsychotic dose prescribed at discharge. Individual physicians and patient characteristics were not significantly associated with prescribing practices. These data, which were obtained before clinical practice guidelines were widely disseminated, provide a benchmark against which to examine more current practice variations in antipsychotic prescribing. The results raise several questions about deviations from practice guidelines in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. To adequately assess quality and inform and possibly further develop clinical practice guideline recommendations for schizophrenia, well-designed research studies conducted in routine clinical settings are needed.",

However, unforeseen consequences of this new technology may put patients at greater risk of harm, not less. The authors present a clinical scenario that demonstrates system vulnerabilities in the interface between humans and such technology. Furthermore, the authors suggest that managers could anticipate these vulnerabilities by using techniques such as cause-and-effect analysis or failure mode and effect analysis, both before the installation of electronic medical records and as ongoing surveillance mechanisms. The case study demonstrates that adoption of technology is not a quick fix to the patient safety issue; proactive and ongoing efforts to address the human factors issues raised by the introduction of new technology will be required to prevent patient harm.",

Barriers to STD service delivery included competing priorities, lack of time or supporting organizational structures, and differing mandates of health departments and MCOs. Facilitators included collaboration between health departments and MCOs, regulatory and performance incentives, buy-in from key stakeholders, availability of infrastructure to support data collection, and inclusion of chlamydia screening in the Health Employer Data and Information Set to monitor plan performance. Because of the shift of STD service delivery from the public to private sector, incentives need to maximize interest and cooperation of patients, clinicians, and MCOs in STD prevention.",

In addition, they assessed completeness of vaccine assessment forms, evaluated reasons for nonvaccination, and conducted interviews with hospital staff. Vaccination increased at 3 of 4 hospitals after implementation of vaccination policies, yet rates remained low (<10% overall; range, 3.4%-12.4%). Vaccine assessment forms were found in most of the charts in 2003, but almost a third were incomplete. Challenges to implementing inpatient vaccination included support and training of hospital staff, interpretation of vaccination recommendations, lack of systematic prompts for vaccinations, and cost reimbursement. These findings underscore the need for continuous quality improvement and process monitoring to determine strategies for overcoming challenges to inpatient vaccination.",

Most physicians reported low knowledge of insurance coverage for screening, and self-reported screening rates among physicians themselves were not optimal. Evidence-based interventions to increase physician recommendations for screening, such as reminder and tracking systems, may be of value.

As the number of areas in the hospital experiencing high volume increased, the likelihood of patients sustaining serious harm because of health care error also increased.

    "abstract": "An elective course exposing medical students to nonphysician hospital providers and staff was conceived and implemented. Goals and objectives identified were to (1) increase students' understanding of the roles of nonphysician professionals in hospital care, (2) demonstrate how the services offered by these professionals complement those offered by physicians, (3) improve students' skill in communicating with nonphysician professionals, (4) develop students' comfort approaching these professionals about patient care issues, (5) show students \"what it is like\" to be each of these providers, and (6) demonstrate the common challenges they face. A 2-week elective rotation paired students with experienced preceptors in several nonphysician hospital care disciplines. Quantitative and qualitative data indicate that this experience empowered students to collaborate more actively with the nonphysician colleagues, whom they would encounter in their careers, to provide coordinated patient care.",

Results from the 2-stages least squares regression approach suggested that receiving treatment in high-volume hospitals decreased the probability of in-hospital mortality by 0.02 points, compared with 0.01 points using the ordinary least squares regression approach.

Even in high-risk settings where similar procedures are performed daily, such as hospital intensive care units (ICUs), these measures largely do not exist. Yet we cannot compare safety or quality across institutions or regions, nor can we track whether safety is improving over time. To a large extent, ICU outcome measures deemed valid, important, and preventable by clinicians are unavailable, and abstracting clinical data from the medical record is excessively burdensome. Even if a set of outcomes garnered consensus, ensuring adequate risk adjustment to facilitate fair comparisons across institutions presents another challenge. This study reports on a consensus process to build 5 outcome measures for broad use to evaluate the quality of ICU care and inform quality improvement efforts.",

Press Ganey's psychometrically sound inpatient satisfaction survey consists of 38 items (10 sections) rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Findings suggest that facilities with hospitalists may have an advantage regarding satisfaction with nursing and personal issues (eg, privacy, emotional needs, response to complaints), both of which may be related to broader communication issues. Moreover, teaching (overall satisfaction) and large facilities (satisfaction with admissions, nursing, and tests/treatments) might especially benefit from the presence of hospitalists. Exploring how specific hospitalist functions influence patient satisfaction may reap rewards.",

Procedures chosen were those commonly performed by medicine residents at the bedside. Of the 368 IM programs, 226 (61%) completed the survey. Programs reported the predominant method of training as 171 (74%) apprenticeship and 106 (46%) as module based. The majority of programs used direct observation to attest to competence, with 55% to 62% relying on credentialed residents. Most programs also relied on a minimum number of procedures to determine competence (64%-88%), 72% of which reported 5 procedures (a lapsed historical standard).

    "abstract": "Opioid prescriptions in the surgical setting have been implicated as contributors to the opioid epidemic. The authors hypothesized that a multidisciplinary approach to perioperative pain management for patients on chronic opioid therapy could decrease postoperative opioid requirements while reducing postoperative pain scores and improving functional outcomes. Therefore, a Perioperative Pain Program (PPP) for chronic opioid users was implemented. This study presents outcomes from the first 9 months of the PPP. Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was calculated and physical and health status of patients was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Short Form-12. Preliminary results showed significant reduction in MME, improved pain scores, and improved function for surgical patients on chronic opioids. PPP effectively reduced opioid usage without negatively influencing patient-reported outcomes, such as physical pain score assessment and health-related quality of life.",

A comprehensive educational needs assessment was developed focusing on clinicians within the Stroke Belt. The mixed qualitative-quantitative approach included regional surveys and one-on-one clinician interviews. Identified contributors to disparities included implicit racial biases, lack of awareness of racial disparities in AF stroke risk, and lack of effective multicultural awareness and training. Additional barriers affecting disparities included patient medical mistrust and clinician-patient communication challenges. General barriers included lack of consistency in assessing stroke and anticoagulant-related bleeding risk, underuse of standardized risk assessment tools, discomfort with novel anticoagulants, and patient education deficiencies. Effective cultural competency training is one strategy to reduce disparities in AF-related stroke and mortality by improving implicit clinician bias, addressing medical mistrust, and improving clinician-patient communication.",

Data were then analyzed utilizing a multistep coding scheme that identified key barriers to and facilitators of the interprofessional-interdepartmental intervention. Analysis also showed, however, that variances in departmental culture play a significant role in the willingness and ability of providers to practice interdepartmental team-based care. It is argued that anticipating and acknowledging these differences and designing systems to address them prior to launch will be essential to the development and implementation of effective interdepartmental quality improvement interventions.",

This study takes a systematic approach to review the main features of 9 existing hospital rating systems, each of which is described using 9 areas of evaluation. The hospital rating systems included in this study vary widely in scope, methodology, transparency, and presentation of their results. Their results often present conflicting conclusions regarding the performance of the same hospital.

Logistic regression was performed to assess the association of provider type, clinic site, and training attendance with documentation of PHQ-9 after positive PHQ-2s, and with repeat PHQ-9s after positive PHQ-9s. In logistic regression analysis, training attendance was positively associated with documentation of PHQ-9 after a positive PHQ-2 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4 [confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-4.3]) and repeated documentation of a PHQ-9 after a positive PHQ-9 (OR = 2.5 [CI = 1.1-5.3]). This study describes the successful implementation of a stepped-care approach to depression care. The positive association of training with compliance with protocol procedures indicates the importance of training in the implementation of practice change.",

Gap analysis identified 3 areas amenable to specific interventions: contacting patients, commitment to the procedure, and complexity and variation in instructions. Rates of inadequate cleanliness decreased to 4% at the end of the last intervention, but began rising for new reasons. Standardizing instructions and the use of navigators improved preparation quality. Bowel cleanliness is the end result of a multistep process with areas for improvement at many levels.

Among 2711 ED visits, 56% were related to health care service delivery issues (ie, access to care, primary care provider [PCP] availability), 2% were associated with population behavior issues, and 42% were unavoidable. For those ED visits related to PCP unavailability, 72% occurred during off-hours or weekends and 28% were because of no timely PCP appointments.

    "abstract": "As many health systems have been working to become high-reliability organizations (HROs), health equity has been largely absent from discussions and applications of HRO principles. This is a serious oversight. Disparities in health and health care represent systematic failures to achieve reliable outcomes for certain groups. Acceptance of disparities is antithetical to the essential HRO goal of \"zero harm.\" We propose adding Equity to HROs in the most literal sense by designating it as a key component and achieving High Equity Reliability Organizations. We describe how equity should be a crucial element of all 5 HRO core concepts: sensitivity to operations, preoccupation with failure, deference to expertise, resilience, and reluctance to simplify.",

Emergency department staff, laboratory phlebotomists, and nursing staff on acute-critical care floors were trained on ISDD (Steripath Gen2, Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA) operating procedure and utilized the device for blood culture sample collection with adult patients from September 2020 through April 2021. Of 5642 blood culture sets collected hospital-wide, 4631 were collected with the ISDD, whereas the remaining sets were collected via the conventional method. The ISDD BCC rate of 0.78% differed from the conventional method BCC rate of 4.06% observed during the intervention period (chi-squared test P < 0.00001). The ISDD group attained a sub-1% BCC rate to satisfy the intervention objective.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study aimed to describe the characteristics of cancer patients undergoing depression and distress screening at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center and to assess factors associated with their screening results. Data were retrieved from electronic medical records of adult Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center patients with at least one oncology encounter between January 2021 and June 2022, who underwent both depression and distress screening using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2/9 for depression and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer for distress during the encounter. Demographics, clinical factors, and screening results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. A total of 1954 cancer patients were screened for psychological needs. Of these, 110 (5.6%) screened positive for depression and 830 (42.5%) screened positive for distress. About 69.1% of patients who screened positive for depression also screened positive for distress. Conversely, 9.2% of patients who screened positive for distress also screened positive for depression. Cancer patients &gt;65 years old were found significantly less likely to screen positive for both distress and depression, while males were found significantly less likely to screen positive for distress. African American patients were found to be significantly more likely than White patients to screen positive for both distress and depression (odds ratio: 2.58; confidence interval: 1:53–4.34). In this study, a higher proportion of cancer patients were found to be distressed than depressed, suggesting that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer may be a more useful tool in identifying psychosocial concerns in this population. Differences in depression and distress scores were significantly associated with age, sex, and race. These findings highlight the need for the implementation of effective screening strategies to better address the psychosocial needs of cancer patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and assess the impact of distress screening on patient outcomes across various oncology settings.",

Thirteen countermeasures were implemented.

    "abstract": "Human factors significantly influence medical quality, especially in complex environments like orthopedic surgery, where latent failures can compromise patient safety. A total of 3168 intraoperative events were observed across 40 orthopedic procedures and classified using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Three trained coders independently applied HFACS across 4 tiers and 19 causal categories. Interrater reliability was measured through percent agreement and Fleiss’ Kappa using unanimous, majority, and reconciled coding conditions. Nearly all observed disruptions (98.97%) were classified as preconditions to unsafe acts, most (68.75%) stemmed from crew resource management failures, distractions from personal electronic devices, poor communication, and sales representative presence. A total of 19.47% of disruptions were due to personal readiness, due to the sales representation supporting role in ensuring technologies. An additional 5.87% were due to physical environment issues like equipment noise. Conclusions: The HFACS framework demonstrated strong reliability in identifying systemic weaknesses within orthopedic surgical workflows. These findings emphasize the urgent need for structured interventions that reduce distractions, improve team communication, and regulate vendor interactions in the operating room, all essential steps toward advancing safety and enhancing overall patient care quality.",

As a result, the increase that has already been observed in the number of elderly patients requiring major medical attention can only be expected to grow. This study reviews the admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) over the last 5 years by age to analyze whether the ICU admissions are higher for the patients older than 60 years of age. We considered all the admissions to the surgical (SICU) and medical (MICU) intensive care units at Morristown Memorial Hospital from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 1996. Patients were divided into age brackets (0-9 years, 10-19 years, 20-29 years,... > 90 years) and by gender. Medical and surgical admissions were analyzed including the average length of stay in the ICU. Daily charge for bed occupancy was reviewed based on the hospital data reported in 1995. The death rate was also considered. Fisher-corrected chi 2 and a Student t test were used for statistical analysis. A total of 6243 patients (2926 female and 3317 male) were admitted to the ICU over the 5-year period. The ICU admissions rate was higher in patients above 60 years of age compared with those below 60 (60% versus 30%, respectively). The age group with the highest admissions rate was between 70 and 79 years, followed by the 60-69-year group. These two groups had significantly more admission than all other groups (P < 0.001). Medical patients' length of stay was shorter than the surgical group, and they had a lower rate of admission to the ICU. The death rate was higher in the group older than 60 years. They also spent a longer time in ICU compared with the younger group (22 +/- 7 days versus 12 +/- 8 days). The charge per day per bed was $2100 in the ICU, $1600 in a telemetry floor, and $950 in a regular floor. The charge per bed in the group above 60 years old was double compared with the one for the younger group. Older patients were admitted to the ICU with a significantly higher frequency than was the younger group. There were more surgical than medical patients admitted to the ICU. The mortality rate and the daily cost, based on daily bed charge, was significantly higher in the older group. Based on our experience, older people had a more difficult recovery in ICU than did the younger people. In our opinion we should treat acute critical illness but not terminal pathology. A problem exists in educating physicians about which patients will derive no benefit from the ICU. This will determine if we can decrease or avoid the use of the ICU and its accompanying expense, in situations where it does not significantly increase survival and the quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to explore reasons why vaccines are not provided to adult patients receiving primary health care. The study setting was a primary health care clinic in a urban hospital staffed primarily by residents and teaching faculty. The patients were identified as all continuity care patients with a scheduled visit to the clinic during the 4-week study period in April 1995. The providers were all primary care providers for the patients during the study period. The providers were given two surveys before the study: one to assess their knowledge of published preventive health care guidelines and one to assess their perspective of the guidelines. During the study period, the charts of the patients were reviewed for the services they had received. An assessment was placed in each patient's chart for the provider's completion during the visit. The assessment enabled the provider to explain why services had not been provided. The results showed that influenza, pneumococcal, and diphtheria-tetanus vaccines were provided at varying rates. Each vaccine had a different profile as to noncompliance with guidelines. Lack of provider knowledge of the guideline was most apparent with pneumococcal vaccine. Providers' ambivalence regarding the scientific basis and/or clinical importance was most apparent with influenza vaccine. Patient refusal was a prominent cause with influenza vaccine in the elderly. Patient appointment behavior (opportunity for care and compliance) also seemed to play an important role. We conclude that explanations for nondelivery of vaccines to adults seem to be multiple. Lack of physician knowledge and physician perception of the guidelines provide some explanations. Patient-related factors including refusal, decreased opportunity for care, and noncompliance also play important roles in why vaccinations are not provided. Improvement in the rates at which immunizations to adults are provided will require interventions in multiple areas.",

The experimental intervention group received a presentation led by a cardiologist and a quality improvement specialist. We assessed the proportion of patients receiving appropriate AMI care before and after the intervention. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no effect of the intervention in increasing the proportion of patients who received reperfusion, aspirin, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme in- hibitors. On-site feedback presentations were not associated with a larger improvement in AMI care compared to the mailed feedback.

    "abstract": "The Institute of Medicine recommends the use of key quality indicators (resident outcomes that suggest the presence of good or bad care) as tools for inter- facility comparison of the quality of care provided in nursing homes. In the spirit of this recommendation, the Health Care Financing Administration released selected results from its Medicare and Medicaid An nual Certification Survey to guide consumers in pur chasing nursing home services. However, because this information is published without adjustment for res ident characteristics that can influence the outcomes of nursing home care, its utility for policy-makers or consumers interested in variation in nursing home quality is limited. This research study utilizes federal and state survey data to evaluate variations in mor tality, pressure ulcers, urethral catheterization, and physical restraint use in 438 Medicare-certified skilled nursing care facilities in Pennsylvania. A standardization function adjusting for resident char acteristics known to influence outcomes is developed and estimated by ordinary least squares regression. Results suggest considerable variation in rates for these indicators across Pennsylvania nursing home facilities. Alternative uses for risk-adjusted key qual ity indicators as tools for improving nursing home quality and assisting potential consumers of nursing home care in making better informed choices are considered.",

Admission severity of illness was measured using a commercial methodology that was developed in a nation-wide database of 850,000 patients from 111 private-sector hospitals. The method uses data abstracted from patients' medical records to predict the risk of death in individual patients, based on the normative database. Analyses compared actual and predicted mortality rates in VA patients. VA patients had higher (P < .05) severity of illness than private-sector patients. The observed mortality rate in VA patients was 4.0% and was similar (P = .09) to the predicted risk of death (4.4%; 95% confidence interval 4.0-4.9%). In subgroup analyses, actual and predicted mortality rates were similar in medical and surgical patients and in groups stratified according to severity of illness, except in the highest severity stratum, in which actual mortality was lower than predicted mortality (57% vs 73%; P < .001). We found that in-hospital mortality in 1 VA hospital and a nationwide sample of private-sector hospitals were similar, after adjusting for severity of illness. Although not directly generalizable to other VA hospitals, our findings nonetheless suggest that the quality of VA and private-sector care may be similar with respect to one important and widely used measure.",

Results demonstrate that African Americans were at a significantly increased risk for either mortality or unexpected hospitalization in 4 of the 5 procedures examined, even after controlling for confounders. For women, unexpected hospital admission or mortality was less likely to occur after almost all procedures examined. Thus, many of the racial and gender disparities in the inpatient surgical literature are also observed in the ambulatory setting. More research is needed to determine the source of these disparities.

Public reporting was seen as unlikely to affect hospital choice; other factors were considered more influential. Interviewees recommended that reports be brief and include information on prevention as well as performance data. Additional recommendations on format and content were identified. For public reporting of HAIs to be successful, attention to report content and format are necessary.

Quality indicators in the United States are collected through the federally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS). Bias in MDS data collection or coding can thus have a negative impact on policy applications. To understand whether bias was present in coding, the authors studied 5174 pairs of MDS assessments that were independently collected by nursing home staff and study nurses from 206 nursing homes. The authors developed multivariate multilevel models to identify nursing home and resident characteristics that were significantly associated with the data quality of multiple MDS measures of nursing home quality. The outcomes were coding differences between nursing home staff and study nurses. Resident characteristics explained little of the variation in coding differences among facilities, while facilities characteristics explained 4% to 20% of the variation and state location further explained 13% to 34% of the variation. A generalized effect of nursing home state location tended to be consistent across measures. States that overidentified problems also tended to have worse quality indicators and vice versa. Comparisons of MDS-based quality indicators reflect differences in assessment practices at least as much as true quality differences. Efforts to standardize assessment practices across states are needed.",

A value-based approach to assessing and purchasing new technology depends on a shift toward comparative effectiveness analysis, transparency in pricing and potential conflicts of interest, and an alignment of incentives and goals among purchasers, consumers, and payers. How to assess the effectiveness of new technology in patient care is an unresolved issue for any cost-effectiveness analysis, as models traditionally used to assess medical therapies (ie, quality-adjusted life years) may not be directly applicable to analysis of surgical intervention. Spine surgeons must be involved in multidisciplinary collaborative efforts to develop models of efficacy analysis and to direct outcomes-based research to appropriately evaluate the benefits of surgical interventions and new technologies.",

The authors describe results of a cross-sectional board study, identifying the measures used to monitor quality. The measures varied widely and many were of uncertain validity, generally identifying hazards rather than measuring rates. This article identifies some important policy implications regarding boards' oversight of quality and acknowledges existing limits to how we can measure quality and safety progress on the national or hospital level.

    "abstract": "The use of Lean tools for quality improvement and process refinement is gaining acceptance in many health care institutions. Traditionally, these tools are used to apply incremental changes to established processes in order to reduce waste and improve quality. In this article, the authors describe a novel Lean methodology, the Rapid Improvement Event (RIE), used in a unique way to develop a new treatment protocol for a specific medical condition: alcohol withdrawal. The RIE allowed for the collaboration of a multidisciplinary group of providers invested in the success of a new protocol for alcohol withdrawal that spans areas from the emergency department to the inpatient ward at an inner-city safety net hospital. It also allowed for the definition of measures for its success once it is implemented.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates quality performance of hospitals participating in Medicare Shared Savings and Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) programs relative to nonparticipating hospitals. Overall, 198 ACO participating and 1210 propensity score matched, nonparticipating hospitals were examined in a difference-in-difference analysis, using data from 17 states in the years 2010-2013. The authors studied preventable hospitalizations for conditions sensitive to high-quality ambulatory care—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, chronic heart failure (CHF), complications of diabetes—and 30-day all-cause readmissions potentially influenced by hospital care. A decrease was found in preventable hospitalizations for COPD and asthma and for diabetes complications for ACO participating hospitals, but no significant differences for preventable CHF hospitalizations and 30-day readmissions. Mixed results may be attributable to insufficient incentives for ACO participating hospitals to decrease 30-day readmissions, whereas disease-focused initiatives may have a beneficial effect on preventable hospitalizations for COPD and asthma and complications of diabetes.",

PPRNet is a primary care practice–based research network among users of a common electronic health record (EHR). The intervention was associated with significant improvements in avoidance of potentially inappropriate therapy, potential drug-disease interactions, and monitoring of potential adverse events over 2 years. Avoidance of potentially inappropriate dosages and drug-drug interactions did not change over time. Practices implemented a variety of medication safety strategies that may be relevant to other primary care audiences, including use of EHR-based audit and feedback reports, medication reconciliation, decision-support tools, and refill protocols.",

High readiness practices trended toward greater improvements between years (8% to 26% vs 2% to 10% mean improvement). High readiness practice clinicians described more open communication, active group change process, and supportive underlying group cohesion. Low readiness practice clinicians functioned more independently and were influenced more by external forces but were developing group cohesion through the initiative. System-wide interventions should be appropriately tailored to different levels of readiness to change, specifically addressing group dynamics and their differing foci of influence.",

CLABSIs and SSIs showed a downward trend over 2 years, then the rates returned to levels similar to baseline in the third year. VAP rate changes were difficult to interpret because of the VAP definition change. Patient safety culture domain “hospital management support” showed significant improvement, but feedback and communication about errors and staffing declined.

    "abstract": "The objective is to identify practice patterns and attitudes of and barriers faced by US physicians assessing thromboembolism/stroke risk and managing anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) to determine educational needs. Case-based surveys were used to assess practice patterns, guideline use, barriers, and attitudes; 51 cardiologists and 50 primary care physicians (PCPs) were surveyed. Most cardiologists use validated risk scoring systems to assess thromboembolism/stroke risk, and more than half of PCPs use clinical experience. Assessment of bleeding risk varied; more than half of respondents rely on clinical judgment or patient bleeding history. The most commonly used prophylactic agents are warfarin/another vitamin K antagonist (PCPs) or antiplatelet agents (cardiologists). Newer anticoagulants are used less frequently. Bleeding risk, need for frequent monitoring (vitamin K antagonists), and medication costs were the most significant barriers. Cardiologists and PCPs could benefit from education on validated scoring systems to assess risk of thromboembolism/stroke and bleeding in AF, on newly released AF guidelines, and on newer anticoagulants.",

The course included monthly 1.5-hour sessions: 20-minute presentations covering key QI concepts, then small group activities to facilitate project work. Faculty were required to identify, construct, and implement an independent QI project. They met individually with mentors twice during the course, with additional guidance offered virtually via phone or e-mail, and completed pretests and posttests of QI knowledge (maximum score = 15) and self-assessed confidence. A statistically significant difference in knowledge (pre-course mean = 7.75, standard deviation [SD] = 3.06; post-course mean = 11.75, SD = 3.28; P = .02) and self-assessed confidence (pre mean = 3.08, SD = 0.65; post mean = 4.5, SD = 0.68; P < .0001) was found. Of 8 faculty, 5 were able to conduct small tests of change; 3 studied the current processes and planned to run tests of change. Positive responses to this course helped obtain buy-in from leadership to develop a leadership program in QI.",

    "abstract": "Organizations use lean principles to increase quality and decrease costs. Lean projects require an understanding of systems-wide processes and utilize interdisciplinary teams. Most lean tools are straightforward, and the biggest barrier to successful implementation is often development of the team aspect of the lean approach. The purpose of this article is to share challenges experienced by a lean team charged with improving a hospital discharge process. Reflection on the experience provides an opportunity to highlight lessons from The Team Handbook by Peter Scholtes and colleagues. To improve the likelihood that process improvement initiatives, including lean projects, will be successful, organizations should consider providing training in organizational change principles and team building. The authors' lean team learned these lessons the hard way. Despite the challenges, the team successfully implemented changes throughout the organization that have had a positive impact. Training to understand the psychology of change might have decreased the resistance faced in implementing these changes.",

A national patient satisfaction research vendor conducted weekly telephone surveys of 840 patients served by that practice: 280 patients served in 2009, and 560 served during 2010 and 2011. After the framework was implemented, the proportion of \"excellent\" ratings of provider service (the highest rating on a 5-point scale) increased by 5% to 9%, most notably thoroughness (P = .04), listening (P = .04), and explaining (P = .04). Other improvements included prompt test result notification and telephone staff courtesy (each by 10%, P = .02), as well as teamwork (by 8%, P = .04). Overall quality increased by 10% (P = .01), moving the practice from the 68th to the 91st percentile of medical practices in the research vendor's database. Improvements in patient satisfaction suggest that this framework may be useful in value-based payment models.",

Reduced utilization of high-cost medications was found when comparing pre to post. Ipratropium hydrofluoroalkane and fluticasone hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler utilization were reduced by 29% and 62%, respectively ( P < .001 for both). A 71% decrease in intravenous chlorothiazide was observed ( P < .001); however, its effect was unable to be separated from implementation of a heart failure diuretic protocol during the study period.

Many use sets of individual quality measures to calculate a global rating. The utility of a global rating for consumer choice hinges on the relationships among included measures and the extent to which they jointly reflect an underlying dimension of quality. Publicly reported data on 4 quality domains-complication, mortality, readmission, and patient safety-from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare website were used to examine correlations among individual measures within each measure group (within-group correlations) and correlations between pairs of measures across different measure groups (between-group correlations). Modest within-group correlations were found in only 2 domains (mortality and readmission), and there were no meaningful between-group associations. These findings raise questions about whether consumers can reliably depend on global quality ratings to make informed decisions.",

This study investigated possible bias in the HAC-RP by simulating hospitals' likelihood of being in the worst-performing quartile for 8 patient safety measures, assuming identical expected complication rates across hospitals. Simulated likelihood of being a poor performer varied with hospital size. This relationship depended on the measure's complication rate. For 3 of 8 measures examined, the equal-quality simulation identified poor performers similarly to empirical data (c-statistic approximately 0.7 or higher) and explained most of the variation in empirical performance by size (Efron's R2 > 0.85). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services could address potential bias in the HAC-RP by stratifying by hospital size or using a broader \"all-harm\" measure.",

A 2-year quality improvement project codesigned and tested a checklist for quicker evaluation of suspected stroke cases in 2 emergency departments (EDs). Utility, feasibility, and implementation barriers were assessed through semistructured interviews. The impact on stroke quality metrics was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate regression models with data from the American Heart Association’s Get With the Guidelines registry. Implementing the checklist was significantly associated with higher odds of receiving intravenous thrombolytics within 60 minutes of ED arrival (odds ratio: 6.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1–68.7, P = 0.03). Users felt the checklist improved the standardization of stroke care and promoted teamwork, especially in a time of higher staff turnover. An ED-based stroke checklist resulted in timelier stroke care for acute ischemic stroke patients, meriting further testing in larger, more diverse settings.",

    "abstract": "Research on dashboard adoption has focused on technical and design requirements. Evidence on social mechanisms for successful dashboard adoption is scarce. This study examined 2 quality dashboards in a similar organizational context with different outcomes. The research question was: How do social mechanisms influence the adoption of dashboards in practice? This embedded case study within one Dutch hospital in 2 phases: (1) interviews and observations to identify social mechanisms in the end-user’s team and (2) expert focus groups to validate identified mechanisms. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically, resulting in the identification of 3 social mechanisms within the team of end-users influencing dashboard adoption: cultivating a supportive team climate, trust, and leadership behavior in end-users’ teams. These mechanisms stimulate a learning environment for discussing and improving care quality. They require action from individuals and teams, so dashboards can be used for collective understanding, learning, and improving. Without these social mechanisms, dashboards remain an unadopted “materiality.”",

    "abstract": "Ambulatory procedures performed electively in hospital outpatient departments are of increasing complexity and constitute a growing share of total procedure volume. Despite their importance, little is known of the prevalence of complications from routine procedures once patients are discharged. This study utilizes a 100% Medicare Fee-for-Service claims data file for the years 2019–2022 to assess the relative frequency of hospital-based ambulatory procedures and 30-day patient postprocedure emergency room and hospitalization complication rates utilizing the Ambulatory Potentially Preventable Complication (AM-PPC) classification method. AM-PPC is a claims-based method designed to calculate comparative provider rates of complication exclusively for elective ambulatory procedures excluding procedures performed in hospital emergency departments. The authors calculated the mean rate of ambulatory complications by procedure across hospitals and then compared them for variation in hospital-specific procedure complication rates to the mean rate. About 2.1% of patients receiving a procedure performed in a hospital outpatient department had an emergency room or inpatient hospitalization visit within 30 days. Complication event rates varied widely across hospital outpatient departments and within specific procedures. Hip arthroplasty complication rates varied from 0.0% to 7.6% while those for upper genitourinary procedures varied from 1.7% to 14.2%. In conclusion, the complication rate for ambulatory procedures is seen to vary substantially across hospital outpatient departments for well-established, routine procedures. This study provides a baseline of complication rates for ambulatory procedures, which will be essential for future efforts to improve patient safety.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The hospitalist is a well-known professional in American hospital care, providing good clinical care with better continuity of care, less fragmentation, and at a lower cost.1 They are an indispensable link in hospital care. In analogy to this profession, a training program for hospitalist doctors was introduced in the Netherlands in 2012, through The Association of Hospitalists (Vereniging voor ZiekenhuisGeneeskunde [VvZG]), which was established in 2012. With the agreement of all medical scientific associations, the specialty of hospitalist doctors was officially recognized by the College of Medical Specialties (College Geneeskundig Specialisten) in 2014. Since then, about 70 hospitalist doctors have been trained, based in 9 hospitals throughout the Netherlands. The hospitalist training program has a duration of 3 years after medical school. It includes intensive training in several clinical specialties: internal medicine, surgery, geriatrics, anesthesia, neurology, and a so-called transmural, primary care internship. During these years, there has been special attention for multimorbidity. The training program also includes 2 intensive, multiple-day courses in clinical governance and quality improvement (QI). The first course is about clinical governance and includes accountability for patient care, clinical audit, implementing evidence-based practice, the patient experience, patient safety, risk management, and root cause analysis of serious incidents. The second course is about QI and is focused on the step-by-step completion of a QI project, following a model used in the United Kingdom, the so-called A-TEAM methodology.2,3 Hospitalists are required to complete a QI project by the end of their training. Both the 5-day clinical governance and QI courses are now taught by experienced hospitalists; the courses were developed and are supported by materials supplied by Healthcare Quality Quest, a UK provider of these training courses.2 Over the past 12 years, hospitalist trainees have taken on a wide range of subjects for QI and made substantial contributions to improving patient care in the hospitals in which they work. This article will give an overall impression on the scope of the QI projects carried out by hospitalist trainees. Method The approach to QI used by the hospitalists is generic and based on a model that consists of the following stages:2,3 (A) agreeing on what to improve, (T) testing commitment to the project by the involved stakeholders, (E) establishing a baseline of current practice, (A) analyzing current practice to identify problems and their causes, and acting to improve practice through various interventions, and (M) measuring again to see if the change interventions have been successful. There are large differences in tools and techniques used in all different stages. For example, for agreement on the subject, the techniques such as the nominal group technique (ranking ideas), the Delphi technique (prioritizing), quality impact analysis (what matters), and multivoting are used. For testing commitment, the force field analysis is the most popular to use, but stakeholder analysis and also Delphi technique are used in this stage. At the stage of establishing the baseline, different techniques used depended on the subject of the QI project. Process mapping is frequently used for analyzing how things work at the start of the project. But also run charts, surveys, and clinical audits are used a lot. At this stage, literature searches for appraising evidence about the subject and benchmarking are used. Also, basic measurements or counts can be used (eg, how many patients at department x have thrombosis prophylaxis as described in the Padua guidelines). In the analytic phase where the hospitalists really dive into \"the why?\" behind the problem, they use pattern analysis, fishbone analysis, and the \"5 times why-tool.\" After these analytic stages, there will be phases of formulating one or more interventions to implement in trying to improve quality on the concerning subject, implementing itself, and afterward measuring the difference. The database of the QI projects carried out by hospitalist trainees was accessed to learn about the subjects covered and the extent to which they influence clinical practice in the hospitals where the hospitalists work. The database is maintained by the Association of Hospitalists. All projects were performed according to the A-TEAM methodology as described above. The subjects of the QI projects were grouped into themes including medication safety, anticoagulation, allergies, pain management, frail elderly patients, the perioperative process, patient flow, overall clinical care, communication and information transfer, and others. In order to provide more insight into the methodology, 3 projects of different themes are highlighted. The projects were chosen that the authors have full access to. A conscious choice was made to pick 3 projects of the earlier years (2017, 2019, and 2020) to find out if the improvements have been maintained, failed, or even have been extended. In order to give an actual status update the authors contacted Dutch hospitalists and asked about the sustainability of their project. It was not possible to track this down for every project because sometimes the hospitalists leave their training hospital when they complete their training to take full-time employment as a hospitalist in other clinics or sometimes overseas. Results A total of 75 QI projects were completed by the hospitalist trainees over 12 years. The subjects of the projects by theme are in Table 1. Two of the QI projects have been published.4,5 Three of the older projects are highlighted in the following sections.

Short Summary of QI Project 1: Improving Medication Safety at Discharge From the Hospital for Elderly People Agree on the Subject and Test Commitment A brainstorm and in second phase a nominal group process were used. The goal was to improve medication safety at discharge for people 70 years of age and older from the internal medicine department. Establish the Baseline The hospitalist in training started with a literature research to find out a \"best practice.\" After that, there was a preliminary measurement in the form of a clinical audit and a process chart was also made. With a focus group, a root cause analysis was made. In addition, a local general practitioner (GP) was peer reviewed to ask what they missed in the transfer of care and information after hospital admission. Also, a patient satisfaction survey was done. Analyze Current Practices and Implement Improvement Results The clinical audit (n = 72) showed that medication safety at discharge did comply with best practices in less than 50% of cases. One of the most important things of the root cause analysis was that there was a local protocol for the nurses for discharge, but not for the doctors. The peer review with a local GP said that discharge letters often are later than the national agreement prescribes (<24 hours after discharge). If medication is changed or stopped during admission most of the time the reasons why are not explained in the letter. Nor is it clear to the GP whether they should follow up on anything. The patient satisfaction survey had a response rate of 20% (n = 55). About 30.7% of patients think communication during admission was insufficient. And 43.9% of patients think communication at discharge was insufficient. Improvement Plan A short, easy-to-use protocol was made for the doctors, which formulated a couple of steps to take at discharge. The key elements of that protocol are: There has to be a discharge conversation between the doctor and the patient. This discharge conversation needs to be noted in the patient's file. If medication is changed or stopped, there has to be an explanation in the discharge letter. Discharge letters need to be sent <24 hours after discharge. Measure Again After the implementation of the protocol, a clinical audit was repeated. It showed that compliance with best practices is now reached in 80% of cases. There also was an analysis of the different steps in the protocol to see how to improve even more in the future. Actual State of the Project (Done in 2017) The project is further developed and implemented hospital wide. With nowadays support from the pharmacy assistants. Short Summary of QI Project 2: Improving Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in the Internal Medicine and Geriatric Departments Agree on the Subject and Test Commitment A brainstorm was used to agree on the subject. The goal was to improve adequate use of thromboembolism prophylaxis to prevent avoidable damage to patients at the internal medicine and geriatrics department. Establish the Baseline The hospitalist in training started with a literature research to find out the \"best practice.\" After that, there was a preliminary measurement in the form of a clinical audit. A survey to all doctors (in training) at these 2 departments was used to make a root cause analysis. Analyze Current Practices and Implement Improvement Results A literature research was done. It shows that the Dutch national guideline was up to date with the most recent literature. From there on, the hospitalist in training used the Dutch national guideline as best practice. The core of this protocol is the Padua Prediction Score. A clinical audit showed a difference between policy regarding thromboembolic prophylaxis upon admission and policy during admission. At the internal medicine department, thromboembolic prophylaxis upon admission did comply with best practice in 88% of cases. However, evaluation during admission complied with best practice in only 37% of cases. At the geriatrics department, thromboembolic prophylaxis upon admission did comply with best practice in 77% of cases. However, evaluation during admission complied with best practices in 85% of cases. The survey to all doctors in training showed us that no one really knew the national guidelines. It also showed us that at the internal medicine department, the Padua Prediction Score was used upon admission, but there was no structural attention to evaluate this in the daily rounds. At the geriatric department, nobody even heard of the Padua Prediction Score, but there was structural attention to thromboembolic prophylaxis in the daily rounds. Improvement Plan A short local protocol was made, derived from the national guideline. Training about this theme and the protocol was provided to all doctors in training. Measure Again After the implementation of the protocol, a clinical audit was repeated. It showed that both departments improved. At the internal medicine department, thromboembolic prophylaxis upon admission had risen to 93% compliance with best practice. At the geriatrics department, compliance was 96%. Evaluation during admission reached a markable 100% in the geriatrics department. However, at the internal medicine department, compliance was 44%. Actual State of the Project (Done in 2020) The anticoagulant committee evaluates this subject on a structural basis, hospital wide. Short Summary of QI Project 3: Implementation of Work Process Agreement \"Paracetamol 1 Hour Preoperatively\" Agree on the Subject and Test Commitment In 2017, a local work agreement was changed about the use of paracetamol perioperatively. At first, paracetamol was given intravenously at induction of anesthesia. They changed to oral paracetamol 1 hour before, with the calculated significant cost savings. The hospitalist in training noticed during her internship that this working agreement was not always followed. With the medical specialists of the department anesthesiology and surgery and executives, she agreed to investigate this. Establish the Baseline The hospitalist in training did a preliminary measurement through a clinical audit. Analyze Current Practice and Implement Improvement Results The clinical audit showed that only 41% of patients were treated with oral paracetamol, as the new work agreements intended. With a focus group of nurses and doctors from the involved departments, a root cause analysis was made. The 5 times why the method was also used to further specify the causes of the problem. In the same group, improvement measures were explored through the Commercial Aviation Safety Team model. This is helpful to prioritize the measures and decide what to focus on. Improvement Plan The hospitalist worked in a short-cycled improvement method. In this method, small changes and evaluation alternate. A protocol was written for the surgical admission department. Different ways of communication were used: newsletters, shift handovers, and email. The key element was to decide who was responsible for prescribing the recipe. Measure Again In the short-cycled improvement method, you frequently measure again after different small steps of change. In this case, different strategies for prescribing the recipe were tested. Even as different ways of communication about the protocol. With every step, the percentage of compliance increased. In the end, in 94.2% of cases, paracetamol was given orally 1 hour before the operation as the working agreement intended. Actual State of the Project (Done in 2019) This working progress is completely embedded. It has been expanded across other departments besides general surgery, such as urology, gynecology, and neurosurgery. As shown in the examples earlier, the A-TEAM methodology is just a framework in which different techniques can be used. In the short summaries, it seems clear enough that in the first 2 steps, you focus on the team commitment. It is also notable that more than one intervention is often used in the projects, for example, a protocol together with an educational program. Finally, these 3 projects were all maintained or even extended. In all 3 projects, follow-up was ensured, for example, in QI project 2, by handing it over to the anticoagulant committee. Discussion As the subjects in the table and the highlighted projects illustrate, all the QI projects carried out by hospitalists in training are directly relevant to many patients routinely treated in a major hospital. The projects resulted in measurable improvements to patient care and were well worth the time spent on the projects as trainee hospitalists. Few of the projects have been submitted for publication, however, for several reasons: hospitalist trainees have seen their work as \"routine\" and have not thought their projects were \"big enough\" to publish. In some hospitals in which the hospitalists work, the funding support for hospitalists is not secured and the hospitalists perceive that hospitals may not value their contributions. There may be local resistance to publishing about a routine aspect of care that was not going well in a hospital before the QI project was carried out. By working through locally based clinical teams involved in each project, the hospitalists spread their knowledge and skills about QI with their clinical colleagues and became agents of changes in clinical practice in the departments in which they worked. Conclusion Systematic reviews and meta-analyses and individual studies have demonstrated that hospitalists provide tangible benefits to health care organizations and patient care.6–10 The biggest part of literature comes from America. Noticeable is that in the United States of America, the profession arose in 1996. Now there are about 1.1 million active doctors in the United States, from which more than 60 000 are hospitalists. This in comparison with The Netherlands, where the profession arose in 2012, they have about 80 000 active doctors of which only 70 are hospitalists. The profiles of the Dutch and American hospitalists are quite similar11; however, the health care system is structurally different. The QI projects carried out by Dutch hospitalist trainees encompass recurring issues in health care logistics and patient safety. The hospitalists use their learned skills of carrying out a QI project with a team, and thus, they become change agents in the hospitals where they work, and they continue to improve the quality of patient care. In addition to continuity and high-quality generalist care at the bedside, Dutch hospitalists provide added value to the departments where they work through their specific training in QI.

    "abstract": "A novel volunteer program was implemented in the adult emergency department waiting room to combat declining patient satisfaction, a crucial quality metric impacting everything from hospital reimbursement to clinical outcomes. Net Promotor Scores (NPS) were tracked in a retrospective cohort design, with patients interacting with volunteers serving as the intervention cohort and those who did not serving as control. Analysis using monthly NPS means was conducted from 2022 to 2023. The absolute difference in NPS between the 2 groups was 17.43. Using monthly means, an unpaired t-test was conducted. NPS in the intervention group was 51.86 with a standard deviation of 7.01. NPS in the control was 34.43 with a standard deviation of 5.32. Data is significant, with P = 0.0002. This emergency department waiting room volunteer program led to increases in patient satisfaction. Study authors think similar effects are achievable at other institutions, and future trials would be beneficial in confirming this suspected causal relationship.",

    "abstract": "This nationwide cross-sectional study explored the relationship between ambulatory care fragmentation and medication use in older US adults, examining variations by chronic conditions and race. Utilizing data from the 2003-2016 REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort study linked with fee-for-service Medicare claims, the authors analyzed care fragmentation (measured by the reversed Bice-Boxerman Index) and medication counts through a 2-week in-person prescription inventory. They employed negative binomial regression, adjusting for potential confounders, and conducted subgroup analyses based on chronic conditions and race. Of the 4524 participants, 40.7% experienced high care fragmentation and 59.8% used 5 or more medications. High fragmentation was associated with a 4% overall increase in medication count (P = 0.03), a 7% increase for those with 4+ chronic conditions (P = 0.01), and a 9% increase for Black participants (P = 0.01). In conclusion, fragmented care is independently associated with greater polypharmacy, particularly among Black older adults and those with multiple chronic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chest pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to emergency departments in the United States, and management centers on identifying myocardial infarction or other forms of rare but problematic cardiac diagnoses. The high-sensitivity troponin assay can detect abnormal troponin elevations at 10- to 100-fold lower levels compared with traditional troponin assays and thus can allow faster time to disposition and diagnosis, yet adoption has not been universal. Implementing a high-sensitivity troponin protocol with a risk prediction algorithm can decrease the numbers of patients admitted, reduce unnecessary testing, and shorten patient stays in the emergency department. This quality improvement project was undertaken in a community-academic health system lacking a system-wide protocol to workup patients presenting with chest pain to the emergency department. Key stakeholders evaluated multiple barriers and identified measures, planned implementation of the new assay and its associated algorithm, led postimplementation data monitoring and analysis, and delivered progress reports to organizational leaders. Chest pain admissions were managed by hospitalists in the absence of a cardiology inpatient service. The most important barriers were found to be individual provider strategy, electronic medical record design, and the lack of capacity for cardiology evaluations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Stakeholder buy-in, monthly data reports, team meetings, and widespread education were used to support the changes in ordering patterns and evaluation. Postimplementation, 3293 patients were assessed over a 12-month period. Baseline mean length of stay for chest pain in the emergency department decreased from 297 minutes (SD, 53) to 274 minutes (SD, 33; P = 0.03). Hospital chest pain observation admissions decreased from 23% to 14% of patients presenting with chest pain ( P &lt;0.001). Stress tests ordered for observation patients decreased from 12 per month to 3 ( P &lt;0.001). Similarly, in observation patients, echocardiograms decreased from 61 to 46 per month ( P &lt;0.001), cardiology consultation decreased from 125 per month to 81 ( P &lt;0.001), and cardiac catheterization decreased from 41 per month to 32 following the intervention ( P = 0.003). Developing a standardized management protocol and selecting physician leaders to maintain and revise protocols were high-impact, low to moderate-effort interventions resulting in significant changes in practice. This study demonstrated that a high-sensitivity troponin assay, combined with a chest pain clinical management protocol based on the Heart, EKG, Age, Risk factor, Troponin score, was able to achieve a reduction in emergency department length of stay, a decrease in hospital observation admissions, and reduced cardiac testing in this patient population.",

To address this gap, we developed and pilot-tested the 15-item Patient Engagement in Pain Management survey. A systematic review of 77 survey instruments identified 6 key constructs of patient engagement, and semi-structured interviews with 36 patients and 3 providers from the Johns Hopkins Personalized Pain Program informed its development. The initial 33-item survey was refined to 15 items, and usability and test-retest reliability were evaluated with 60 Personalized Pain Program patients. The median completion time was 3.5 minutes, with minimal missing data (&lt;0.5%). Most respondents (96–100%) found the questions relevant, with higher average scores for patient-provider communication (3.6–4.5 on a 5-point scale) and lower scores for adherence challenges. Although the Patient Engagement in Pain Management survey demonstrated good usability and applicability, further studies are needed to enhance its test-retest reliability and psychometric validation.",

Critically ill patients are at high risk. A case of EK in our intensive care unit led us to investigate the incidence of EK in our critical care units and understand the interventions needed to reduce its impact. We found 44 cases of EK over 3 years. 95% received mechanical ventilation and 32% received paralytic agents. Average time to diagnosis was 15.8 days from intensive care unit admission. More than a quarter (27%) of patients had severe EK at diagnosis, and 52% of patients had received prior eye care. EK occurred frequently in our critical care units. Many subjects did not receive prophylaxis and disease was diagnosed at a late stage. To address this, we plan a 3-pronged approach focusing on prevention, early recognition, and timely initiation of treatment.",

Fifty-six of 11,621 studies met the inclusion criteria. More than 40% of studies utilized more than 1 intervention and over 60% of studies included an educational intervention. Revenue-related outcomes were commonly reported among included studies (n = 30, 54%), followed by accuracy or error rates (n = 22, 43%), and billing completion rates (n = 14, 25%).

Interviews were conducted with 23 CQI faculty and 7 department leaders. Of the department’s 20 divisions, 15 included at least one CQI with a median of 5 per division. Findings demonstrated how the academic track aligned with, and legitimized, CQIs’ interests, and allowed for a wide range of “quality and innovation” activities (eg, improving healthcare processes, developing models of care, clinical informatics). Contextual factors such as synergies with hospital-based initiatives for healthcare improvement and changes to academic promotion criteria were instrumental in CQI’s performance of the academic role. Despite promotion successes, CQIs described some tensions between academic and clinical role expectations.",

    "abstract": "Health system executives continually aim to understand how organizational structures impact performance, especially in quality departments. This article, built on over 2 decades of Vizient research, identifies key characteristics of top-performing healthcare organizations. The researchers employed a modified Delphi methodology, involving a multiphase process that integrated literature reviews, content analyses, and expert consensus from top-performing organizations. Key findings reveal that top-performing organizations employ centralized goal setting with decentralized responsibility for implementation, fostering shared accountability at all levels. Horizontal integration underscores the multidisciplinary nature of top-performing quality departments, integrating diverse functions such as patient safety, infection control, and data analytics. Adaptability is an essential factor, with organizations incorporating evolving functions like ambulatory care and analytics, reflecting the dynamic needs of health care systems. By embracing adaptable, integrative, and balanced frameworks, organizations can position themselves to respond effectively to emerging challenges, maintain operational efficiency, and uphold high standards of care delivery.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular programs are often high-cost, high-volume service lines plagued by fragmentation and inconsistent governance. This article presents a structured framework for developing a cardiovascular center of excellence (CVCOE) to enhance care quality and strategic integration. A CVCOE is a purpose-built program defined by three interdependent layers-foundational infrastructure, clinical pillars, and governance-unified through a physician-led clinical model that drives the business and operating models. Drawing on implementation experience across diverse hospital settings, the framework provides a roadmap for aligning structural investments with evidence-based care delivery and organizational capacity. It introduces a two-stage lifecycle: an initial implementation stage to achieve clinical and financial viability, followed by a maintenance stage focused on iterative quality improvement and potential scope expansion. By embedding leadership and quality systems at the structural level, this model offers hospitals and health systems a replicable approach to optimizing cardiovascular services and creating the conditions needed for better outcomes.",

The authors showed a 24.9% reduction in time to medication for agitation (from 3.0 to 2.2 hours). ED boarding time for admitted patients decreased 10.9% (981–874 minutes), while ED length of stay for discharged patients increased 9.9% (403–443 minutes). Physical restraint use in the ED dropped 7.1% (112–104 events), with total restraint time decreasing 27.7% (4.7–3.4 hours). Results remain variably sustained at 2 years. This initiative demonstrated that structured, team-based interventions can significantly improve psychiatric emergency care.",

The training was delivered to over 100 physicians between 2021 and 2024, and this group was then surveyed about the effects on their professional roles. The survey aimed to capture overall experience, subsequent participation in quality improvement efforts, dissemination of learnings, and enhancement of educational, clinical, and administrative responsibilities.

General patterns of agreement were found across all respondent groups that the 3 most important categories of quality were as follows: quality of care, quality of life, and residents' rights. The 3 most important quality-of-care survey items were as follows: general quality of care, maintenance of activities of daily living, and appropriate treatment for impairment in activities of daily living. The 3 most important quality-of-life items were as follows: dignity, self-determination and participation, and accommodation of resident needs. Important residents' rights items were as follows: to be able to exercise general rights, to be informed of one's condition, and to be free of reprisal when making complaints. Quality assurance should focus greater attention on the areas considered to be the most important by the various stakeholders in nursing home care.",

Structural care mea sures include: licensed and unlicensed staffing, licensed therapists, and case mix-adjusted direct care expendi tures. In addition, seven (four process and three out come) facility-level, risk-adjusted process, and outcome quality scales are developed from 39 resident-level qual ity indicators. A causal model of NF quality arranged according to the structure, process and outcome para digm is specified and estimated using path analysis. Or ganizational data derive from the 1991 Medicaid Cost Report; process and outcome quality measures were de veloped from the Minimum Data Set Plus Resident As sessment Instrument. Using the percentage of Medicaid and private pay residents as covariates, there was a significant overall multivariate effect due to ownership mode on the SC measures. Although there were several significant direct effects, the overall path model was disconfirmed. The multivariate results suggest that some organizational characteristics of structure quality may be more appropriately considered exogenous to causal quality models and therefore have indirect (ver sus direct) effects on process or outcome quality indica tors. The path analysis implies that the structure-pro cess-outcome paradigm may not accurately capture the way NF health care is delivered. Research which consid ers alternate NF quality paradigms needs to be done with samples that are more representative of national proportions of each ownership mode.",

We evaluated risk-adjusted rates of pressure ulcer development in VA nursing homes and related these rates to facility size, staffing patterns, teaching nursing home status, and rural versus urban locale. Higher rates of pressure ulcer development were seen among urban teaching nursing homes and among nursing homes associated with both larger and smaller VA hospitals. Staffing patterns had a complex association with pressure ulcer development, and smaller nursing home staffs were not clearly associated with higher rates. For multivariate modeling, only hospital size and staffing remained significant independent predictors of pressure ulcer development. These results emphasize that while structural characteristics of VA nursing homes can provide insights about care, improving the quality of care in this setting will require a much greater understanding of how nursing homes are organized to meet patient needs.",

Among 1065 respondents (60% of those surveyed), 79% reported familiarity with guidelines. The proportion of staff at a facility reporting adoption was generally less than 50%. Those nursing homes in which a high percentage of the staff reported adoption of one guideline were more likely to have adopted other guidelines. However, staff were not more likely to report adoption of a specific guideline when the nurse manager stated that it was adopted.

More specifically, patient satisfaction is principally the function of an underlying network of interrelated satisfaction constructs-satisfaction with the primary provider, waiting for the provider, and satisfaction with the provider's assistantss. Hierarchically linked to patient-centered expectations of provider value, the Theory specifies that primary providers offer the greatest clinical utility to patients. The Theory is operationalized by patient-centered measures exclusively, where only patients judge the quality of service and all other judgments are immaterial. Bearing in mind the Institute of Medicine's recent recommendations to clinicians regarding the implementation of a new level of patient-centered care, the Primary Provider Theory offers an alternative paradigm for the measurement and realization of patient satisfaction. It can inform patient-centered physician practice, medical education, quality improvement, outcome measurement, and satisfaction survey construction.",

To make this determination, we used a before-and-after retrospective cohort series for a 550-bed teaching and tertiary referral hospital that was not a level 1 trauma center. We included all patients who presented to the Emergency Department and who were admitted to St. Paul's Hospital because of trauma during 2 baseline months (May and November 1987; n = 111) and 2 follow-up months (May and November 1990; n = 142). In 1988, a formal trauma team was developed to coordinate the care of trauma patients who were seen in the Emergency Department. Indications for calling the trauma team were based on the criteria of the American College of Surgeons for triage to a trauma center. We calculated elapsed time from assessment in the Emergency Department to arrival of the trauma surgeon, discharge from the Emergency Department, and arrival of the patient in the operating room (for urgent or emergent surgery). We also determined the Revised Trauma Score, the Injury Severity Score (1985 version), the crude mortality ratio, and the Z statistic (population outcome comparison). After implementation of the trauma team, median elapsed time from initial nursing assessment in the Emergency Department to arrival in the operating Room for blunt trauma patients decreased from 11.33 to 4.82 hours (P = .05), but there were no significant differences in any other measures of timeliness, crude mortality, or adjusted mortality. We conclude that implementation of a trauma team in a teaching hospital is associated with a minimal effect on timeliness of care for admitted trauma patients.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to demonstrate how a clinical practice database can be used to illustrate the variations in adjunctive chemotherapy for breast cancer, to describe a measure of dose intensity (DI) to monitor that variation, and to design interventions to maximize a full-planned dose. An arbitrary sample of oncology practices across the United States was selected, each providing data on 10-20 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Data on 17,566 patients from 1438 sites were collected, consisting of patient characteristics including age, number of positive nodes, planned and delivered chemotherapy agents, and a sample of absolute neutrophil or white blood cell counts by cycle. Mean age of the patient cohort was 48.5 years, and 54% of patients were below the age of 49. Treatment for the disease has changed during the 2 periods studied, 1983-1994 and 1995-1999. Use of Adriamycin/Cytoxan (AC) increased, whereas use of Cytoxan/Adriamycin/Fluorouracil (CAF) and full-dose Cytoxan/Methotrexate/Fluorouracil (CMF1) decreased. However, the less intense Cytoxan/Methotrexate/Fluorouracil combination (CMF2) has seen an actual increase in use during the 2 periods. Within the context of oncology care, including chemotherapy, full-dose intensive therapy and cure has always been the ultimate goal. In this study only 10% of the patients given AC received less than 85% of the full referenced dose, whereas about 20% of those receiving the other combinations fell into this category. Also, the summation dose intensity (SDI), a measure tying level of dose to survival, was highest in the AC group and lowest in the CMF2 group. Dose delays and dose reductions appear to account for the decrease in DI in the CMF1, CMF2, and CAF groups. DI, particularly SDI of adjuvant chemotherapy, which ties level of dose to survival in breast cancer patients, appears to be a reliable measure with which to assess the quality of care in community oncology practices. The 2 measures presented in this paper may be useful to managed care organizations for monitoring quality outcomes in this serious disease. Because one of the major reasons for reduction in chemotherapy dose appears to be neutropenia and its complications, these organizations can establish programs using DI as a basis for developing guidelines to optimize the clinical benefits of growth factors.",

Using standard quality improvement methodology, the diagnosis of and care of hyperglycemia and type II diabetes mellitus was analyzed and changes in ordering practice recommended. Standardized sliding-scale orders were implemented with widespread staff acceptance as demonstrated by 80% use after 6 months, and over 500 undiagnosed hyperglycemic patients will be counseled in 2001. The costs for the program were more than covered by the estimated annualized savings of 687 bed days and $134,832. This project demonstrates that standardizing care for inpatients with type II diabetes mellitus is possible. The cost savings (not including the value of good will and perceived increase in quality by the patients) justifies the time and effort to make these changes.",

The federal government has recently launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative, in which Quality Improvement Organizations assist nursing homes in quality improvement (QI) activities. In addressing how well nursing homes are prepared for QI, this article examines the sort of QI activities that nursing homes are currently undertaking and the preparation of Administrators and Directors of Nursing to lead QI efforts. Drawing on data from surveys of 2 random samples of Kansas nursing homes, the article concludes that questions about QI activities in nursing homes tend to elicit socially acceptable answers unless the questions are carefully structured; that few nursing homes appear to have functioning QI programs; and that high leadership turnover and limited leadership training make it difficult for nursing homes to sustain effective QI programs.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to evaluate whether physician feedback accompanied by an action checklist improved diabetes care process measures. Eighty-three physicians in an academic general medicine clinic were provided a single feedback report on the most recent date and result of diabetes care measures (glycosylated hemoglobin [A1c], urine microalbumin, serum creatinine, lipid levels, retinal examination) as well as recent diabetes medication refills with calculated dosing and adherence on 789 patients. An educational session regarding the feedback and adherence information was provided. The physicians were asked to complete a checklist accompanying the feedback on each of their patients, indicating requested actions with respect to follow-up, testing, and counseling. The physicians completed 82% of patient checklists, requesting actions consistent with patient needs on the basis of the feedback. Of the physicians, 93% felt the patient information and intervention format to be useful. The odds of urine microalbumin testing, serum creatinine, lipid profile, A1c, and retinal examination increased in the 6 months after the feedback. The increase was sustained at 1 year only for microalbumin and retinal exams. There was no significant change in refill adherence for the group overall after the feedback, although adherence did improve among patients of physicians attending the educational session. No significant change was noted in lipid or A1c levels during the study period. In conclusion, a simple physician feedback tool with action checklist can be both helpful and popular for improving rates of diabetes care guideline adherence. More complex interventions are likely required to improve diabetes outcomes.",

Cataract surgery was expressed as procedures per 10 000 veteran beneficiaries per fiscal year. The annual incidence of cataract surgery increased marginally over the study period with an average annual incidence of 105.8 surgeries per 10 000 beneficiaries. Institutional rates of VHA surgery differ substantially from those of Medicare beneficiaries, which are approximately 5.5-fold greater. Although direct comparison must be interpreted cautiously, the difference is too great to be explained by demographic factors or secular trends in surgery. Additional research is required to elucidate factors that influence the rate of cataract surgery in the VHA.",

However, little is known about organizational best practices or specific needs during implementation. This study identified and described the barriers and facilitators to QI implementation in hospice. Using semistructured interviews with a national sample of key informants (n = 52) concerning facilitators and barriers to QI in hospice, 4 major themes emerged from the data regarding participants' experiences and perceptions: (1) external factors constrain QI implementation; (2) internal factors limit capacity for QI; (3) research on best practices is limited; and (4) traditional QI may not be a good fit for hospice. Though challenging, participants provided recommendations that they believed would facilitate QI in hospice. Categorizing barriers and facilitators as within or outside an organization's control may help organizations assess their capabilities and locate resources to address areas for improvement.",

Practices that do not vaccinate generally recommend vaccination and refer patients to public health clinics, primary care, and pharmacies. Administrative and patient-related barriers affected most practices, but practices that vaccinate were able to overcome these barriers.

Study subjects were 14 033 adult diabetics and their 133 PCPs. Logistic regression was used to predict the odds that a patient would have uncontrolled diabetes (defined as HbA1c ≥8%) based on patient-level characteristics alone. A second model predicted diabetes control from physician-level identity and characteristics alone. A third model combined the patient- and physician-level models using hierarchical logistic regression. Physician performance is calculated from the difference between the expected and observed proportions of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. After adjusting for important patient characteristics, PCPs were identified who performed better or worse than expected in managing diabetes. This strategy can be used to characterize physician performance in other chronic conditions. This approach may lead to new insights regarding effective and ineffective treatment strategies.",

The setting was a 16-physician pediatric hospitalist group within a tertiary pediatric hospital. Discharge summaries were selected randomly for documentation of communication with PCPs. At baseline, 57% of charts had documented communication with PCPs, increasing to 84% during the audit and feedback period. Following the addition of a financial incentive, documentation of communication with PCPs increased to 93% and was sustained during the combined intervention period. The number of physicians meeting the study's performance goal increased from 1 to 14 by the end of the study period. A financial incentive coupled with an audit and feedback tool was effective at modifying physician behavior, achieving focused, measurable quality improvement gains.",

However, many hospitals do not yet use electronic documentation. Paper charting, including writing daily progress notes, is time-consuming and error prone. To improve the quality of documentation at their hospital, the authors introduced a highly formatted paper note template (hybrid note) that is prepopulated with data from the EMR. Inclusion of vital signs and active medications improved from 75.5% and 60% to 100% (P < .001), respectively. The use of unapproved abbreviations in the medication list decreased from 13.3% to 0% (P < .001). Prepopulating data enhances provider efficiency. Interviews of key clinician leaders also suggest that the initiative is well accepted and that documentation quality is enhanced. The hybrid progress note improves documentation and provider efficiency, promotes quality care, and initiates the development of the forthcoming electronic progress note.",

This study assessed the 1-year mortality of acute ischemic stroke patients treated by hospitals participating in the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry. Using 10 nationally approved performance measures, quality of care was defined both as an all-or-none measure (defect-free care) and as a composite index. A generalized estimating equation was applied to assess the effect of quality of care on 1-year mortality. Defect-free care did not serve the purpose; however, the composite measure showed that patients who received the lowest and intermediate quality care, respectively, had a 3.94 (95% confidence interval: 3.27, 4.75; P < .0001) and a 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.62; P = .002) times higher odds of dying in 1 year compared to those who got the best-quality stroke care.

Focus groups included residents who rotated at 3 hospitals and represented 4 training programs. Focus groups were audio recorded and analyzed using qualitative methods. A total of 64 residents participated in 8 focus groups. Reporting behavior varied by hospital culture. Residents worried about damage to their professional relationships and lacked insight into the benefits of multiple reports of the same event or how human factors engineering can prevent errors. Residents did not understand how reporting affects litigation. Residents at other academic institutions likely experience similar barriers. This study illustrates that resident reporting is modifiable by changing hospital culture, but hospitals have only a few opportunities to mishandle reporting before resident reporting attitudes solidify.",

Extreme variation was found in the reporting of ICU utilization among admissions for congestive heart failure, ranging from 25% in the lowest admission hospital quartile to 95% in the highest. The across-hospital variation in reported ICU utilization was found to be unrelated to patient severity. Given that such extreme variation appears in a designation of ICU versus non-ICU utilization, the NHSN risk-adjustment models’ dependence on nursing unit designation should be a cause for concern.",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary training has improved maternity outcomes when the training has been well attended, regular, in house, used high-fidelity simulators, and integrated teamwork training. If these principles were used in other settings, better clinical care may result. This before-after study sought to establish whether a short multidisciplinary training intervention can improve recognition of the deteriorating patient using an aggregated physiological parameter scoring system (Early Warning Score [EWS]). Nursing, medical, and allied nursing staff participated in an hour-long training session, using real-life scenarios with simple tools and structured debriefing. After training, staff were more likely to calculate EWS scores correctly (68.02% vs 55.12%; risk ratio [RR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.44), and observations were more likely to be performed at the correct frequency (78.57% vs 68.09%; RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09-1.32). Multidisciplinary training, according to core principles, can lead to more accurate identification of deteriorating patients, with implications for subsequent care and outcome.",

Three interventions were implemented: verbal scripted handoff, Spök text messaging, and Engage text messaging. Percentages of CDI communications were analyzed using statistical process control. Following implementation of Engage, the communication of all CDI, except for indication, was ≥95%; communication of indication occurred 93% of the time. Control limits for most CDI were narrower with Engage, indicating greater reliability of communication compared to the verbal handoff and Spök. Delayed resuscitation team arrival, a countermeasure, was not higher with text messaging compared to verbal handoff ( P = 1.00). Text messaging improved communication during high-risk deliveries, and it may represent an effective tool for other delivery centers.",

The impacts of adding selected acute conditions like pneumonia, sepsis, and electrolyte disorders (“augmented”) to their current risk models (“base”) for 4 specialties—cardiology, neurology, oncology, and pulmonology—on estimates of hospital performance are reported here. In the augmented models, many acute conditions were associated with substantial risks of mortality. Compared to the base models, the discrimination and calibration of the augmented models for all specialties were improved. While estimated hospital performance was highly correlated between the 2 models, the inclusion of acute conditions in risk-adjustment models meaningfully improved the predictive ability of those models and had noticeable effects on hospital performance estimates. Measures or conditions that address disease severity should always be included when risk-adjusting hospitalization outcomes, especially if the goal is provider profiling.",

The team used ordered regressions to model whether respondents agreed with (ie, \"Strongly agreed\" or \"Agreed\" on a 5-point Likert scale) each of the 9 statements. The statements were mapped to domains based on the theory of planned behavior: attitudes (5 statements), perceived behavioral control (2), and norms (2). Favorable responses to 9 statements ranged from 32% to 85%; 5/9 items had more than 50% favorable responses. The following example odds ratios (ORs) are for \"agree\" versus \"neutral\" or \"disagree\" to change their behavior to obtain the incentive. Clinical staff with prior experience with incentives were more likely to agree with 8/9 positive statements about incentives (eg, OR = 1.32 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.12-1.57]). Family medicine clinics were more likely than pediatric clinics to agree with 5/9 statements (eg, OR = 1.42 [95% CI: 1.18-1.70]).

    "abstract": "While the structure, process, and outcome taxonomy has long been used in the field of health care quality measurement and evaluation, it has not been used in a true causal model which assesses facility level quality. Total quality management and continuous quality improvement call for routinely assessing facility and resident level quality in a causal framework. This paper presents a causal modeling methodology as a more appropriate method for assessing and understanding the inter-relatedness among each of the quality dimensions of Nursing Facility care, and presents how such a causal model directly relates to the notion of continuous quality improvement. The methodology consists of five steps: (1) sample definition and data collection, (2) data reduction through factor analysis, (3) development and testing of a causal model through path analysis, (4) identification of patterns of care through cluster analysis, and (5) integration of the model to both continuous quality improvement and to complex relationships involving quality and organizational variables. The methodology is fully illustrated by using a sample of 104 nursing facilities in Wisconsin in which quality dimensions have been captured through the Quality Assessment Index. The analysis demonstrates that nursing facilities may be substantially benefited by having access to causal linkages which materially affect outcome quality. Management would then have first-hand knowledge of the structural characteristics and the process activities that they may pursue in order to improve outcome quality.",

The study was a retrospective cohort study. The study group consisted of patients with induced abortions (n = 41,039) performed in hospitals or community clinics recorded in the 1995 Ontario Health Insurance Plan claims (OHIP) database. An age-matched cohort of 39,220 women who did not undergo induced abortions was selected from the same data source to serve as controls. The main outcome measures were health services utilization indicators constructed from OHIP data within 3 months postabortion from office consultations, emergency room consultations, and hospital admissions. Hospitalization indicators were constructed from Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital discharge data within 3 months postabortion and included data on hospitalizations for infection, certain surgical events, or psychiatric problems. Postabortion health services utilization and hospitalization were higher in the patient population, regardless of service location, than in the age-matched cohort. Within the abortion patient population, hospital day-surgery patients had higher rates of postabortion utilization and hospitalization than did community clinic patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that hospital day surgery patients had a higher risk of subsequent post-abortion hospitalizations for infections (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.28), surgical events (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.30-3.24) and psychiatric problems (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.77-3.98) than community clinic patients. The rates of postabortion health services utilization and risk of hospitalization were lower in community clinic abortion patients than in hospital day-surgery patients.

In January of 1992 USHC implemented its current, third-generation incentive model and significantly altered its Quality Care Compensation System.

The relationship between the type of health insurance of the patient at the time of admission and the time to placement of patients has not previously been addressed. We prospectively studied all patients on the adult neurosurgical service at our hospital to determine whether the type of health insurance carried by patients is related to the time necessary to arrange acceptance into inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Ninety-one patients (51 men, 40 women; mean age, 56 years) admitted to the neurosurgery service during a 6-month period required inpatient rehabilitation placement after discharge. The time in days between the request for placement into a rehabilitation facility and the acceptance of the patient was examined. The mean time for placement of patients with and without health insurance at the time of admission was 0.8 days and 2.1 days, respectively (overall mean, 1.1 days) (P < .002). No statistically significant associations were found between age, sex, or race of the patient and the time to placement. In addition, there was no difference in the time to placement between those patients admitted as a result of trauma and those patients admitted for reasons other than trauma. These results indicate that among patients on a neurosurgical service, patients with private health insurance are accepted into inpatient rehabilitation approximately 1 day sooner than patients without private health insurance. Patients without private health insurance are delayed in their transfer to inpatient rehabilitation facilities and more aggressive inpatient rehabilitation. How this finding translates into an increase in cost of care or a decrease in patient outcomes is unknown.",

Results indicated that, while hospitalists cared for patients of substantially lower socioeconomic status, they delivered care more economically for patients with asthma, with no significant differences in rates of return to the emergency room or rehospitalizations. Children in both services demonstrated equivalent levels of returning to their PCP for follow-up visits and were in equally good health 1 month after discharge. Additionally, no negative impact was evident on patient satisfaction at discharge; in fact, the hospitalists' patients were more satisfied with aspects of their care.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of organizational, provider, and guideline factors on provider knowledge of a congestive heart failure (CHF) clinical practice guideline (CPG) in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health care system. We developed a survey to investigate institution-level factors influencing the effectiveness of guideline implementation, including characteristics of the guideline, providers, hospital culture and structure, and regional network. Survey participants were quality managers, primary care administrators, and other individuals involved in primary care CPG implementation at 143 VHA hospitals with ambulatory care clinics. Potential explanatory variables were grouped into 11 factors. Multivariate regression models assessed the association between these factors and reported levels of provider knowledge regarding the CHF guideline at the hospital level. Two hundred forty surveys from 126 of 143 (88%) VHA hospitals were returned. Provider knowledge of the CHF guideline was estimated as \"great\" or \"very great\" by 58% of respondents. Three predictor factors (dissemination approaches, use of technology in guideline implementation, and hospital culture) were independently associated (P < or = .05) with provider knowledge. Specific variables within these categories that were related to greater knowledge included physician belief that guidelines were applicable to their practice, distribution of guideline summaries, use of guideline storyboards in clinic areas, the use of technology (eg, electronic patient records) in CPG implementation, and establishment of implementation checkpoints and deadlines. Provider knowledge of guidelines is affected by factors at various organizational levels: dissemination approaches, use of technology, and hospital culture. Guideline implementation efforts that target multiple organizational levels may increase provider knowledge.",

Unfortunately, the systems of services for these children and youth have never been able to address adequately their mental health needs. Thus, the revolutionary changes now taking place within these service systems, in particular the marked increase in the direct provision of services by Indian tribes and organizations, provides a unique opportunity to address these historical shortcomings. In this paper, we describe our existing knowledge concerning the quality of ADM services for American Indian children and adolescents and their critical sociodemographic, sociocultural, and epidemiologic contexts. We then consider the implications of these studies for improving the quality of care as well as its measurement and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The information contained in pathology reports of breast cancer specimens is of critical importance to treating physicians for selection of local regional treatment, adjuvant therapy, evaluation of therapy, estimation of prognosis, and analysis of outcomes. This information is also of great importance to patients and their families. In 2000, a Breast Cancer Pathology Advisory Group was formed to advise on the design of a project to assess the quality of pathology reports on unilateral extended simple mastectomy (ICD-9-CM procedure code 85.43) specimens from Medicare patients in New York State. This group comprised clinical pathologists, breast surgeons, medical oncologists, clinical breast cancer specialists, and a radiation oncologist. The group suggested that the reports be examined for several elements (quality indicators) that are relevant to patient care and prognosis. Baseline random sample data assessing these elements were established from a random sample of all cases for the calendar year 1999. A random sample of 748 cases (43.5%) of unilateral extended simple mastectomy was chosen from among 1718 cases for the calendar year 1999. Of these, 555 (74.2%) were suitable for review. The remaining 193 (25.8%) cases did not satisfy the inclusion criteria. Aggregate performance on 7 quality indicators (presence of carcinoma, laterality of specimen, number of lymph nodes present, number of positive nodes, documentation of lymph nodes, histologic type, and largest dimension of the tumor) was 83.7% or better, whereas performance was 69.4% or less on 10 others (resection margin status, verification of tumor size, gross observation of the lesion, histologic grade, angiolymphatic invasion, nuclear grade, location of the tumor, mitotic rate, extent of tubule formation, and perineural invasion). The last, perineural invasion, was used as a control element and was not considered an evaluative quality indicator. Performance levels for New York State were significantly lower for histologic grade, resection margin status, and angiolymphatic invasion than in similar studies elsewhere. In addition, there were significant interhospital disparities in the performance levels for these quality indicators. Whereas some hospitals always recorded certain indicators, others never did. This in part reflects differing degrees of adoption of recommended specialty society protocols. The second phase of the project consisted of an educational feedback program involving the directors of pathology laboratories in New York State. The aggregate findings of the baseline study were shared with all the pathologists. In addition, each hospital that performed unilateral extended simple mastectomies during the study period received its own specific data so that it could compare its performance with the aggregate performance. The results of the baseline study also were shared with the New York Pathological Society and the New York State Society of Pathologists. The latter described the results in its newsletter. A postintervention review ofthe medical charts of a sample of 297 Medicare patients discharged from New York State acute care hospitals with an ICD-9-CM procedure code of 85.43 (unilateral extended simple mastectomy) was conducted for the 6-month period from December 1, 2001, through May 31, 2002. The 8 quality indicators, performance for which was below 84% in the baseline, were chosen for this remeasurement. Statistically significant improvements (P < .0001) occurred in all the 8 quality indicators, ranging from 12.6% to 19.9%. The results of this study indicate that the issues identified by breast cancer pathology reports are amenable to improvement. Such improvement can serve both the patients and the treating physicians better in making adjuvant treatment decisions, estimating prognosis, and evaluating outcomes. It also will be of help to patients and their families in making other life decisions.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes care among medically underserved patients is suboptimal. Few studies, however, have described successful strategies to improve diabetes care in these patient populations. To address this issue, 4 Montana community health centers and 1 urban Indian health center implemented quality improvement efforts along with an office-based electronic system for monitoring diabetes care. After a median of 17 months follow-up, preventive services and clinical outcomes were assessed for all patients at baseline (N = 332) and follow-up (N = 590), and for a cohort (N = 164) who had 1 or more visits 6 months after baseline. In cross-sectional analyses, there were increases from baseline to follow-up in the percent of patients who had received an annual foot examination (50% to 68%), microalbuminuria testing (34% to 62%), annual retinal examination (14% to 30%), pneumococcal immunization (30% to 61%), and smoking assessment (77% to 91%). But neither HbAlc testing in the previous 6 months (64% to 55%) nor annual LDL-C testing (59% to 61%) showed any improvement. There were no significant changes from baseline to follow-up in the median hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LOL-C), or in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Similar improvements in preventive care were seen in the cohort of patients with diabetes. But overall outcomes were not improved. Our findings suggest that office-based monitoring systems can support systems' changes to improve the delivery of preventive services to patients with diabetes in primary care facilities for the underserved, but outcomes are more difficult to enhance over a short period of followup. Also, our findings suggest that over a relatively short-term period, cross-sectional and cohort analyses of quality improvement measures do yield similar measures of diabetes care in such settings.",

The main outcome measures were mortality rate, length of stay, and readmissions. The mortality rates of events identified by a secondary diagnosis only and by the PSI were not significantly different. The number of POHH events increased by 9.3% when readmissions were captured. The PSI definition of POHH may need modification to capture events with no secondary procedure. The PSI misses events identified on readmission, but the consequences of these events are not as severe as those currently captured. A variety of patient and hospital characteristics are predictive of a higher risk of POHH.",

We conducted a prospective cohort study of all adult inpatient discharges from a 200-bed rural acute care hospital in West Virginia during a 6-month period. We performed 3572 chart audits, of which 1011 included rescue drug administration. Our outcome measure was the proportion of adverse drug events in the rescue drug surveillance that were found in the occurrence reporting tool. We found that less than 4% of all adverse drug events involving use of rescue drugs were reported. We concluded that underreporting of preventable adverse drug events in this hospital is comparable to published rates and that surveillance of adverse drug events to detect underreporting is feasible.",

Gastroenteritis is a short, self-limiting, but common illness of childhood associated with significant costs to the community. The authors assessed the impact of a clinical pathway on investigation ordering in children with gastroenteritis. A retrospective analysis of 2 cohorts of children was performed before (n=1498) and after (n=1252) the introduction of a clinical pathway. Children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis were assessed as to the type of pathology tests ordered. Further outcomes measured were rates of admission, emergency department presentations, average length of stay, and direct costs. Subset analysis was undertaken on the initial cohort of patients who had a full blood count as part of their initial assessment. Full blood count was more likely to be performed prior to the introduction of the pathway(77.1%) than after pathway introduction (66.8%; P<.004). Urine microscopy and culture also was significantly decreased from 56.3% to 40.4% (P<.0005). Median patient costs were reduced from $1228 to $752 following pathway introduction (P<.0001); however, rates of admission were increased from 18.6% to 28.8% (P<.0001). Length of stay decreased but was not statistically significant. Full blood count results in the subset analysis revealed that the measurement of a full blood count had no impact on management. Thus, a clinical pathway contributed to more rational ordering of pathology tests and lowered the costs to a hospital of caring for patients with this common illness.",

In pooled hospital data, agreement with CDSS recommendations improved to a statistically significant level. However, inspection of data at the individual hospital level demonstrated that almost all improvement occurred in a single hospital. Failure in the other hospitals appeared to be primarily a consequence of organizational and cultural barriers.

    "abstract": "A valid measure of practice systems for improving chronic disease care is needed as a guide for both improvement and public accountability. We tested whether a new survey measure of the presence of practice systems (the PPC-R) is associated with performance measure rates for depression among 40 medical groups in Minnesota. These PPC-R scores were compared with standardized medical group measures of antidepressant persistence. Only 54% of potentially important systems were present, and there was high variability. However, there was a positive correlation between systems and quality on the 90-day measure of antidepressant persistence, both overall (r = .33, P = .04) and for the Chronic Care Model domains of decision support (r = .38, P = .02) and delivery system redesign (r = .31, P = .05). Thus, practice systems overall and several domains of the Chronic Care Model appear to be associated with higher quality care for depression. This questionnaire may help practices identify particular systems to improve. (Am J Med Qual 2008;23:420-426)",

Integration of care and services overall was comparable between VAMC clinics and CBOCs. The service mix differed. Integrated CBOCs more often offered group therapy, medication management, and smoking cessation. Integrated VAMC clinics more frequently used written suicide protocols and depression screening. Distance to offsite specialty care and wait times for referrals were shorter for patients at VAMCs than at CBOCs. The provision of mental health care at CBOCs is comparable to that at VAMC clinics, although differences in patient access to offsite care indicate that full equity was not achieved at the time of the survey.

In a model of the mortality gap (observed - expected from the baseline model), DNR explains 8% to 24% of the gap variation. PC provides additional explanatory power to some disease groupings, especially heart and digestive diseases. One caveat is that DNR information, especially if associated with the later stages of hospital care, may mask opportunities to improve care for certain types of patients. But that is not a danger for PC, which is unequivocally valuable in accounting for patient risk, especially for certain subpopulations and disease groupings.",

Using Cox proportional hazards regressions, they estimate both survival and AMI-free survival rates by compliance quartile. Both survival and AMI-free survival rates diverge rapidly and are robust to adjustments for demographics, DxCG risk score, and other baseline risk factors.

Yet health care organizations that do well on both accounts are extraordinarily rare.

    "abstract": "Educational outreach is a common intervention used to translate research findings into practice; however, the intervention has a mixed effect on changing clinician behavior and improving patient outcomes. Based on a published set of characteristics aimed at standardizing the approach to educational outreach, the authors undertook a careful review of the literature to determine the consistency and completeness of documentation. Using a 25-item abstraction tool, the authors reviewed 68 published studies of a recent Cochrane meta-analysis to determine the extent to which educational outreach studies provide recommended documentation of important characteristics. The results indicate that studies are generally inconsistent (documentation range of 0% to 100% across characteristics) and incomplete (documentation average of 43.1% across studies) in their descriptions. Documentation shortcomings of educational outreach studies make understanding the intervention and interpreting its findings particularly challenging. The authors recommend the creation of a guideline to help improve documentation of educational outreach efforts.",

Hospitals were ranked by the racial disparity in PSI7 and segmented into 4 groups. The analysis identified both black- and white-specific risk factors associated with PSI7. Age showed race-specific reverse association, with younger blacks and older whites more likely to have a PSI7 event.

Ten venous thromboembolism (VTE) articles were identified: 7 trauma related, 3 postoperative, and 1 central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) article. Nine VTE articles found positive associations between deep vein thrombosis imaging and VTE diagnoses. Because imaging also may be symptom driven, most studies performed additional analyses to corroborate findings. Six trauma-related and 2 postoperative VTE studies concluded that surveillance bias was present, the latter based on circumstantial evidence. The non-VTE study found a significant positive correlation between surveillance aggressiveness and intensive care unit CLABSI rates. Even considering VTE, relatively little is known about the impact of surveillance bias on inpatient complication measures.

    "abstract": "Despite clear recommendations for identifying and intervening with smokers, clinical preventive practice is inconsistent in primary care. Use of electronic health records could facilitate improvement. Community health centers treating low-income and Medicaid recipients with greater smoking prevalence than the general population were recruited for a pilot program. Key design elements used to engage centers' participation include designating a project champion at each organization, confirming ability to transmit data for reporting and participation, and offering money to facilitate initial engagement; however, financial incentives did not motivate all organizations. Other methods to elicit participation and to motivate practice change included building on centers' previous experiences with similar programs, utilizing existing relationships with state cessation centers, and harnessing the \"competitive\" spirit-sharing both good news and areas for improvement to stimulate action. These experiences and observations may assist others in designing programs to improve clinical interventions with smokers.",

Optimizing throughput efficiency while balancing patient safety and quality of care is of utmost importance during times of high ICU utilization. Continuous improvement methodology was used to develop a multidisciplinary workflow to improve throughput in the ICU while maintaining a high quality of care and minimizing adverse outcomes. The research team was able to decrease ICU occupancy and therefore ICU length of stay by implementing this process without increasing mortality or readmissions to the ICU. By improving throughput efficiency, more patients were able to be provided with care in the ICU.",

Root causes of failures included lack of assigned responsibility, lack of defined daily update, and lack of a daily communication standard. Process changes were implemented, resulting in an increased mean documented communication rate from 13% pre intervention to 65% post intervention that was sustained for more than 2 years (P < .001). Including a family advisor as an equal member of an improvement team provides family empowerment and a greater chance of success in complex areas.",

Data included interviews (N = 101), focus groups (N = 65), and observations of safety processes (N = 79) collected from 10 patient-centered medical homes. Key safety issues included the lack of interoperability among health information systems, clinician-patient communication failures, and challenges with medication reconciliation. Commonly cited safety strategies leveraged health information systems or involved dedicated resources (eg, providing access to social workers). Patients also identified strategies not mentioned by clinicians, emphasizing the need for their involvement in developing safety solutions. This work provides insight into safety issues of greatest concern to clinicians, staff, and patients and strategies to improve safety in the ambulatory setting.",

We looked for an objective way to compare primary care quality in the Veterans Affairs (VA) with that of private sector. We analyzed performance measures of the Health Plan and Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) used in ambulatory care for hypertension and diabetes and compared a sample data from a network of VA hospitals with those from National Committee for Quality Assurance's The State of Health Care Quality 2002 Report. The VA data were comparable to the national data. Performance on the hypertension control measure was slightly below the HEDIS national average but better than the regional commercial average. VA's performance on all diabetes measures was higher. Although the VA network had a large influx in patient base recently, the quality of outpatient care in hypertension and diabetes as measured by standardized performance indicators in the network compared favorably with commercial Health Maintenance Organizations in the private sector.",

A survey of 123 VA quality managers assessed the approaches used to implement the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and major depressive disorder guidelines. Approaches were categorized based on their effectiveness, and the total number of approaches used was calculated. Commonly used approaches were clinical meetings, summaries, and revised forms. Consistently and minimally effective approaches were used most frequently. Most hospitals used 4P7 approaches. Odds ratios demonstrated that consistently effective approaches were paired with minimally and variably effective approaches. The frequent use of consistently effective approaches and multiple approaches benefits VA adherence. However, VA hospitals should consider selective combinations of approaches to ensure the use of the most effective implementation methods.",

The current study proposes an alternative definition of readmission and compares the new definition to the traditional one. The comparison shows that the new method is more conceptually correct because it takes into account the waning effect of the index admission. It can identify readmissions regardless of when they occur. It increases a readmission sample size and thus statistical power.",

The tension between the production of quantity and quality is demonstrated. Specifically, the model shows that increasing the costs of a quality improvement program reduces program effectiveness, sanctions for low quality will not improve the performance of high-quality providers, noncompliance with regulation can be a rational decision, and some pay-for-performance programs will not improve quality for low-quality providers. The model suggests incentive structures to improve quality for all providers. This model has application to a variety of social regulatory programs of importance in public health and health care, including health care quality (ie, regulation of nursing homes or medical laboratories) and environmental and food safety regulation.",

Marginal effects were calculated in multinomial logistic modeling of Medicare beneficiaries who recovered/stabilized, died, or were hospitalized. Linear regression models on length of stay (LOS) were constructed. Higher RN staffing was related to fewer hospitalizations whereas greater PT staffing was associated with more recovered/stabilized outcomes and fewer deaths. RN and PT staffing may play different, though complementary, clinical roles affecting outcomes. Higher RN and PT staffing levels also reduced LOS of recovered/stabilized outcomes. The staffing increases involved in reducing LOS and hospitalizations appear substantial.

    "abstract": "Strengthening primary care may improve health outcomes and restrain spending. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model is endorsed as a tool to achieve this. Early evaluations in large group practices demonstrate improvements in some health outcomes. Evidence is lacking from small medical practices that deliver the majority of primary health care. This was a national survey of 200 physicians that explored perceptions of PCMH. There was considerable interest in adoption of the model; however, providing PCMH care was seen as an extension of traditional roles that requires additional reimbursement. No differentiation was made among a variety of payment models to do this. All joint principle components of the model were identified as important: extending access and information technology were the most contentious. There was consensus that PCMH might improve the quality of primary care; however, tension between wider societal benefits and rising costs for individual practices was a challenge to implementation.",

After adjustment for established prognostic factors, the relative risk (RR) for mortality in patients eligible for treatment was as follows: 0.49 (P < .001) for discharge prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS-Is), 0.59 (P = .015) for β-blockers, 0.44 (P < .001) for combination therapy (ie, a β-blocker and a RAS-I), 0.87 (P nonsignificant) for aldosterone antagonists, and 0.49 (P nonsignificant) for planned cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. After adjustment for propensity scores, the RR was 0.49 (P < .001) for RAS-Is, 0.67 (P = .04) for β-blockers, and 0.57 (P < .001) for combination therapy.

During the postintervention phase, instruction was given, and then improvement was recognized publicly. Data on physician compliance were collected monthly. The authors performed a secondary analysis of the audit database, which contained 1733 patient charts. The data were divided into preintervention and postintervention phases for comparison. A 4-fold increase in compliance was found.

The majority (546/718) reported having some form of education on handoffs during medical school, with 48% indicating this was 1 hour or less. Most respondents (98%) reported that they believe patients experience adverse events because of inadequate handoffs, and more than one third had witnessed a patient safety issue. Results show that medical school graduates are not receiving adequate handoff training. Yet graduates are expected to conduct safe patient handoffs at the start of residency. Given that ineffective handoffs pose a significant patient safety risk, medical school graduates should have a baseline competency in handoff skills. This will require medical schools to develop, implement, and study handoff education.",

A positive screening score on the AUDIT-10 or DAST-10 instrument at intake was associated with higher risk of readmission to the general medicine wards within 30 days; this relationship appears complex and subject to mediation.

    "abstract": "Unnecessary hospital readmissions increase patient burden, decrease health care quality and efficiency, and raise overall costs. This retrospective cohort study sought to identify high-risk patients who may serve as targets for interventions aiming at reducing hospital readmissions. The authors compared geospatial, social demographic, and clinical characteristics of patients with or without a 90-day readmission. Electronic health records of 42 330 adult patients admitted to 2 Midwestern hospitals during 2013 to 2016 were used, and logistic regression was performed to determine risk factors for readmission. The 90-day readmission percentage was 14.9%. Two main groups of patients with significantly higher odds of a 90-day readmission included those with severe conditions, particularly those with a short length of stay at incident admission, and patients with Medicare but younger than age 65. These findings expand knowledge of potential risk factors related to readmissions. Future interventions to reduce hospital readmissions may focus on the aforementioned high-risk patient groups.",

After reflection, physicians scheduled earlier follow-up appointments while nurse practitioners and physician assistants improved discharge instructions. Readmissions decreased during the review period, and the decrease sustained for one year after the review period. Hospitalists reflected on and identified local practice factors that contributed to their own patients' 30-day readmissions.

Despite this, 27% of patients were statin-free prior to LDCT and 21.2% remained statin-free after LDCT showing moderate CAC. Illustratively, while a substantial proportion of LCS patients are statin-eligible, many lack a statin prescription, even after findings of CAC burden.

Chronic conditions, multiple prob lems, and more limited resources make them more vul nerable, whereas multiple payer sources make them more complicated to cover. This synthesis of managed care de livered in Medicare and Medicaid demonstration projects serving elderly beneficiaries shows that managed care plans either select or attract enrollees who suffer fewer frailties than those served in fee-for-service settings, ex hibit reluctance to enter rural markets, provide a broad range of elderly-specific services, offer more compre hensive coverage and services, and result in greater per ceived access problems, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. Plans operate more cheaply by using fewer resources, even after adjusting for case mix differences. Managed care enrollees tend to be more satisfied with financial and coverage aspects, whereas fee-for-service enrollees report higher satisfaction on other dimensions. In acute care settings, process of care findings were mixed, whereas clinical and self-reported outcome indi cators were no better and in some instances worse in managed care. Long-term care enrollees, in the few stud ies reported, consistently faired worse in both the processes and outcomes of care. These findings suggest that further research on the effects of managed care in its rapidly changing incarnations is needed, particularly with respect to how to improve the quality of acute and long-term care delivered to elderly people and the proper role of government and other key actors in the health care system.",

It is a multiple year, retrospective study in which early hospital discharges were followed using Medicaid claims data to determine the rate of readmissions for newborns during 1989-1992, the years in which this policy became widespread in Maryland. Analysis compares early discharges, using chi 2 tests, and calculates odds ratios to estimate the risk of readmissions. Our results found significant increases in early discharges for Medicaid newborns over time among sick newborns. The odds of readmissions for normal babies discharged early were about the same as for those kept longer, but for sick babies discharged early they were significantly greater, especially during the early study years. Findings from this natural experiment indicate that early discharge of Medicaid newborns with physical problems increases their likelihood of readmissions.

The study included telephone interviews and medical record reviews. The setting was a general medicine practice of an urban teaching hospital in Boston, Mass. Women ages 50-65 visiting an academic teaching practice over a 3-month period were selected randomly. Of the 198 potential subjects, 118 (60%) agreed to participate in the survey. We examined discussions of HRT by women who had faced the decision to initiate HRT within the previous year. Women who were not on HRT or had been on therapy for less than 1 year were asked if they had discussed HRT with their physician in the past year. Socioeconomic factors and comorbidities were elicited during the survey and abstracted by chart review. The mean age of the 118 participants was 57; 36% were black, 54% were white, 10% were other race, 17% had less than a high school education, 14% had diabetes, 31% had had a hysterectomy, and 7% had a history of breast cancer. Of the 80 women who did not use HRT or had used it for less than 1 year, 49 (61%) reported a discussion of HRT. In bivariable analysis, patients of white race were more likely to report a discussion than black patients (72% versus 43%, odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3- 9.7). After adjustment for history of osteoporosis and age, white patients were more likely to report a discussion (adjusted OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.8). Further adjustment for the presence of 2 or more cardiac risk factors did not change the result. Neither level of education nor family income were significantly associated with HRT discussion. Compared with white women, the African-American women we studied were less likely to discuss HRT with their physicians. Further study is needed to determine whether the failure to discuss HRT is due to failure to initiate a discussion on the part of patients, physicians, or both.",

On-site interviews were conducted with QI directors at all 32 Connecticut nonfederal hospitals that participated in the Health Care Financing Administration's Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) in 1992-93 and 1995. The interviews sought information about the makeup of QI departments, specific approaches used to improve the care of patients with AMI, and the perceived value of the CCP to each individual hospital. Results showed that the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and FTEs per beds employed in QI departments ranged from 1 to 30 and from 0.4 to 7.9, respectively, with a registered nurse most often serving as the department head (27/32). Over half of the departments (17/32) had additional responsibilities. The majority (25/32) used some combination of physician champions, multidisciplinary QI teams, standing orders, or critical pathways to effect change in AMI care. Finally, 26 of the 32 hospitals believed the CCP was valuable because it provided credible benchmark data, a catalyst for change, or a specific focus on processes of care needing improvement in AML Despite great variability in institutional resources, all 32 hospitals used a similar combination of QI approaches to effect change in AMI care. However, there is variable scientific evidence supporting these approaches. Externally sponsored projects such as the CCP appear to play a useful role for individual hospitals.

    "abstract": "The information contained in pathology reports of radical prostatectomy specimens is critically important to treating physicians for selecting adjuvant therapy, evaluating therapy, estimating prognosis, and analyzing outcomes. This information is also of importance to patients and their families. In recent years, the Cancer Committee of the College of American Pathologists and the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology developed suggested protocols for reporting the findings on radical prostatectomy specimens. The objectives of this study were to assess radical prostatectomy-specimen reports by using quality indicators derived from existing suggested protocols and to thereby assist pathologists in improving the quality of their reports on such specimens. A retrospective chart review of 554 cases for the second 6-month period of 1996 focused on 10 quality indicators: submission of a frozen section; location of the adenocarcinoma; proportion of the specimen involved by adenocarcinoma; perineural involvement; vascular involvement; seminal vesicle involvement; periprostatic fat status; number of nodes submitted; status of nodes; and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The findings of this study were shared with the pathology departments in all hospitals in New York State. In addition, the 113 hospitals from which the 554 cases were drawn were given their institution-specific data. Teleconferences were held with the 37 hospitals that accounted for 72.4% of all cases. These conferences included directors of pathology and laboratories and focused on the aggregate statewide findings. The presence of quality indicators in reports varied from a mean of 14.8% (periprostatic fat) to a mean of 85.9% (seminal vesicle involvement). For all hospitals, 4 indicators (proportion of the specimen involved by adenocarcinoma, vascular involvement, periprostatic fat status, and PIN) were included in fewer than 50% of cases. These 4 quality indicators and an additional 3 others (submission of a frozen section, perineural involvement, and the number of nodes submitted) were included in fewer than 70% of cases. Only 3 indicators (location of the adenocarcinoma, seminal vesicle involvement, and the status of nodes) were found in more than 70% of cases. Although the mean level of quality indicator inclusion ranged from 14.8% to 85.9% for all cases examined, the absolute range for any individual indicator was 0% to 100%. Thus, some hospitals included a given indicator 100% of the time; others never included it. This pattern held true for all 10 indicators. High-volume hospitals (10 or more cases) performed significantly better than low-volume hospitals (1-4 cases) on 5 indicators (P < .05), and better, but not significantly so, for an additional 2 indicators. Overall, the mean inclusion levels for all 10 indicators were 10% higher for high-volume hospitals compared with low-volume and medium-volume hospitals (5-9 cases). This study demonstrated wide variations in the inclusion of quality indicators by pathologists in their radical prostatectomy-pathology reports. Whereas some hospitals always include given indicators, others never mentioned them. These marked disparities point to the need for standardized reporting for radical prostatectomy specimens.",

Point-of-care electronic reminders were attached to the medication record of the EMR for each patient, and providers were asked to consider using the available combination medication. Of the patients who had electronic reminders attached to their charts and were seen at the clinic during the study period, 47 of 175 were switched to a combination medication. A cost-savings analysis showed a total annual savings of dollars 6,159.30. Point-of-care reminders are a simple and effective tool for quality-improvement interventions.

With the QIO contract cycle that began in the fall of 1999, CMS adopted a broad national improvement agenda emphasizing 24 quality measures from 6 clinical topic areas. The Utah QIO developed a human factors and organizational safety management-based intervention strategy for the inpatient clinical topic areas, borrowing approaches and principles previously applied in hospital-based medication systems safety improvement efforts. Evaluation used measures and methods established by CMS to assess the adequacy of QIO performance nationwide. Comparison of statewide inpatient quality indicator performance rates in 1998 and 2000 showed absolute improvement on 15 of the 16 measures used. The average reduction in the failure rate for these clinical topic areas in Utah was 27.3%; this was the highest rate of improvement for any state in the nation. Utah's overall ranking on the combined inpatient clinical topic areas went from 16th at baseline to first at follow-up. The evaluation demonstrates exceptional levels of performance improvement in Utah hospitals when compared with national trends. It is, however, neither possible to uniquely isolate the effects of the QIO intervention from larger trends operating statewide, nor can the contributions of the various facets of the QIO intervention be disaggregated. The application of human factors and organizational safety management principles represents a promising strategy for accelerating the pace of improvement in health care.",

Factors independently associated with care include maternal race, insurance status, and maternal age. Screening for infections with well-established recommendations (hepatitis B virus, rubella, syphilis) occurred more often than for group B streptococcus, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and varicella.

Our survey of NPDB users demonstrates that although the NPDB has generated substantial controversy and its information is nominally available from other sources, it still plays an important role in the credentialing process. Most institutions make timely NPDB inquiries that facilitate widespread use of the information in credentialing activities (4-5 individuals or committees). However, in 3% to 7% of cases, a decision was reached before the institution had the NPDB report. Between 5% and 30% of privileging and licensure applications involving an NPDB report were not granted \"as requested,\" suggesting the NPDB data are important to the process. Unfortunately, underreporting was also evident: 60% to 75% of reportable actions were not reported, limiting the information to which health care entities have access.",

This study evaluates spirometry use at the Community Medical Center-Sierra in hospitalized patients with COPD.

The effects are analyzed of age, sex, race/ethnicity, diagnosis, insurance status, disposition, and admitting service on spirometry use by physicians are analyzed. A questionnaire is used to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of residents toward spirometry ordering. Baseline characteristics are similar between study groups. Only 3% of 1476 study patients have spirometry performed within the recommended time frame, and only 12.2% have at least 1 spirometry performed. Patients having a primary diagnosis of COPD have a greater likelihood of having spirometry performed (20.3% vs 11.1%, P < .001), as do patients who are discharged to home (13.4% vs 5.9%, P = .001). No significant effects are noted for sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, or admitting service. The house staff surveys reveal that most do not know the indications for (72.0%) or how to order (46.0%) spirometry. Spirometry is underused among physicians who treat hospitalized patients with COPD. Future educational efforts aimed at improving physicians' ordering and use of spirometry are needed to address this disparity.",

    "abstract": "Recent health care improvement initiatives have linked financial payments to compliance with predetermined performance measures. This article reports the effect of a unique prophylactic antibiotic use program on compliance rates and costs. The Departments of Surgery, Infection Control, and Anesthesiology collaborated on a prophylactic preoperative antibiotic protocol, whereby Anesthesiology assumed responsibility for timely antibiotic prophylaxis (TAP) before surgical incision. Data from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008, were compared (z test) with the 12-month period before this change. χ(2) Analysis identified factors associated with TAP. Return on investment (ROI) was calculated. TAP compliance rates increased from 75.1% to 89.3% (P < .001) following program implementation. Factors associated with TAP failure included >60 minutes from anesthesia induction to surgical incision (P < .001), surgical procedure (P < .001), specific antibiotic administered (P < .001), and individual anesthesia provider (P < .001). The ROI was 2.2. TAP compliance rates increased after Anesthesiology assumed responsibility, with anesthesia providers being a significant factor.",

Centralized management of critical care resource allocation within an institution may improve use while simultaneously ensuring quality of patient care. The authors' institution has implemented a Central Intensivist Physician (CIP) program to oversee resource allocation within the adult surgical intensive care units (ICUs). The result has been an improvement in patient flow throughout the surgical ICUs manifested by steady case cancellation rates despite increasing acuity and length of stay. Additionally, triage duties have been shifted from the individual unit physician to the CIP, resulting in improved provider satisfaction from improved continuity of rounds. The authors conclude that the CIP program may improve overall critical care resource use while maintaining unit specialization within a large tertiary care hospital setting.",

A written survey was distributed to clinicians and staff at 15 primary care practices to determine whether they perceived that personnel in their practices performed a series of 4 steps associated with screening colonoscopy and 7 steps associated with stool blood test screening. For each discrete step, the percentage of respondents from each practice who indicated that a given step is performed in that practice was calculated along with the mean of practice percentages. Survey results indicate wide variation in the degree to which these screening steps are performed across the 15 practices. Variation was greater for steps that involved contacting nonresponders (reminders), scheduling, and rescheduling. Survey responses suggest substantial variation and much room for improvement in practice performance of evidence-based steps in the CRC screening process.",

Fulfilling this mission is challenged by threats to patient and provider safety. The EMS setting is a high-risk one because care is delivered rapidly in the out-of-hospital setting where resources of benefit to patients are limited. There is growing evidence that safety culture varies widely across EMS agencies. A poor safety culture may manifest as error in medication, back injuries, and other poor outcomes for patient and provider. Recently, federal and national leaders of EMS (ie, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) have made improving EMS safety culture a national priority. Unfortunately, few initiatives can help local EMS leaders achieve that priority. The authors describe the successful EMS Champs Fellowship program, supported by the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, designed to train EMS leaders to improve safety for patients and providers.",

The prioritization matrix, a quality improvement tool, was used to prioritize triage algorithms at Ask Mayo Clinic, a national triage call center. Key elements used in the priority matrix were the frequency of algorithm use, potential safety impact of the algorithm, algorithm length, overall agreement between software recommendation and triage nurse, and asymmetry of nurse overrides of the software recommendation. This methodology also bridges the language gap between software developers and management and gives management the ability to customize how software maintenance and development cycles are prioritized.",

Hospitalists received enhanced presentations about SEBMOs and their value in VTE prevention; specialists did not. Data were analyzed for 2 cohorts of 249 at-risk patients: one cohort was admitted with SEBMOs and the other with handwritten orders. VTE prophylaxis was ordered for 70% (173 of 249) of the SEBMO cohort compared with 22% (55 of 249) of patients whose physicians handwrote orders (relative risk ratio = 2.97; 95% confidence interval = 2.33-3.79; P < .0001). Specialists, who did not receive the enhanced education, were more likely to use handwritten orders and less likely to comply with prophylaxis standards. Standardized orders promote VTE prophylaxis more than handwritten orders. More rigorous education is required to promote compliance with evidence-based standards of medical practice.",

Intensive care units (ICUs) are an important clinical area in hospitals, given that they generate high costs and present high risks to patients. Yet, currently, few valid and clinically significant ICU-specific outcome measures are reported nationally. This study reports on the creation and evaluation of new abstraction tools that evaluate ICU patients for the following clinically important outcomes: central line–associated bloodstream infection, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gastrointestinal bleed, and pressure ulcer. To allow ICUs and institutions to compare their outcomes, the tools include risk-adjustment variables that can be abstracted from the chart.",

Poor adherence to recommended prophylaxis may be a potential cause of ongoing events. This study aims to identify institutional adherence rates and barriers to optimal VTE prophylaxis. The authors performed patient and nurse interviews and a concurrent review of clinical documentation, utilizing a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant tool, on a convenience sample of hospitalized patients. Adherence and agreement between different assessment modalities were calculated. Seventy-six patients consented for participation. Nurse documented adherence was 66% (29/44), 44% (27/61), and 89% (50/56) for mechanical, ambulatory, and chemoprophylactic prophylaxis, respectively. Patient report and nurse documentation showed moderate agreement for mechanical and no agreement for ambulatory adherence (κ = 0.51 and 0.07, respectively). Concurrent review using a cloud-based tool can provide robust, timely, and relevant information on adherence to recommended VTE prophylaxis. Iterative concurrent reviews can guide efforts to improve adherence and reduce rates of hospital-acquired VTE.",

    "abstract": "Novel approaches for assessing patients with chest pain and related symptoms may improve outpatient care. The REGISTRY I study measured the impact of a personalized gene expression score (GES) on subsequent cardiac referral decisions by primary care providers. Of the 342 stable, nonacute patients evaluated, the mean age was 55 years, 53% were female, and mean (SD) GES was 16 (±10) (range = 1-40). Low GES (≤15), indicating a low current likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), was observed in 49% of patients. After clinical covariate adjustment, each 10-point GES decrease was associated with a 14-fold decreased odds of cardiac referral (P < .0001). Low GES patients had 94% reduced odds of referral relative to elevated GES patients (P < .0001), with follow-up supporting a favorable safety profile. This genomic-based test demonstrated clinical utility by guiding decision making during assessment of symptomatic patients with suspected obstructive CAD.",

A systematic review of the literature was used to construct a fault tree to evaluate 3 postoperative BSI reporting programs: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and The Joint Commission (JC). The literature review revealed 699 eligible publications, 90 of which were used to create the fault tree containing 105 faults. A total of 14 identified faults are currently mandated for reporting to NSQIP, 5 to CMS, and 3 to JC; 2 or more programs require 4 identified faults. The fault tree identifies numerous contributing faults to postoperative BSI and reveals substantial variation in the requirements and ability of national quality data reporting programs to capture these potential faults. Efforts to prevent postoperative BSI require more comprehensive data collection to identify the root causes and develop high-reliability improvement strategies.",

Risk-adjustment models for the prediction of PD-90 and RA-90 were designed for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous cardiac intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and congestive heart failure. Models were derived from hospital claims data and were then enhanced with admission laboratory predictive results. Case-level discrimination, goodness of fit, and calibration were used to compare administrative models (ADM) and laboratory predictive models (LAB). LAB models for the prediction of PD-90 were modestly enhanced over ADM, but negligible benefit was seen for RA-90.

Because of the rapid proliferation of quality metrics in health care, BJC HealthCare found it increasingly difficult to select the most impactful scorecard metrics while still monitoring metrics for regulatory purposes. A 7-step measure selection process was implemented incorporating Kepner-Tregoe Decision Analysis, which is a systematic process that considers key criteria that must be satisfied in order to make the best decision. The decision analysis process evaluates what metrics will most appropriately fulfill these criteria, as well as identifies potential risks associated with a particular metric in order to identify threats to its implementation. Using this process, a list of 750 potential metrics was narrowed to 25 that were selected for scorecard inclusion. This decision analysis process created a more transparent, reproducible approach for selecting quality metrics for clinical quality scorecards.",

Hospitals with a high rate of severe HAPUs have a payment penalty imposed, creating a financial disincentive to report severe HAPUs, possibly contributing to the magnitude of the reported decline. Despite the financial disincentive to report, the number of severe HAPUs found in claims data over the corresponding 4-year period did not decline but instead remained unchanged. The results from claims data, combined with some flaws in estimating HAPUs, call into question the validity of the decline in HAPUs reported by PfP and AHRQ.",

Patients who were younger and had an attending physician who was an oncologist or hematologist were more likely to receive GCSF whether they met the guideline criteria or not. Our findings suggest that older patients may be treated less aggressively than others and that physicians who are the most knowledgeable about guidelines may feel the most qualified to override the guidelines when they believe they do not apply. Our findings also demonstrate that it is easier to encourage physicians to do more for patients rather than less.",

    "abstract": "Ideally antibiotics should be administered preoperatively within 2 hours of skin incision to ensure adequate tissue concentrations, especially when a vascular prosthesis is used. The quality of patient outcomes may be adversely affected when key processes, by degrees, fail to meet patient care objectives. This study was designed to incorporate the concepts of total quality management to determine how effectively this goal was achieved, and, after review of those measured results, what process improvements could be instituted to meet the established requirements for the administration of antibiotics. The study was then repeated on a yearly basis to determine what effect these improvement measures had on antibiotic administration. Three time periods were established for determining when antibiotics were administered. The \"early\" period was more than 2 hr preoperatively. \"Preoperative\" was from 2 hr before surgery until the time of incision and \"perioperative\" was after the time of incision. Group 1 consisted of the first 100 patients undergoing vascular procedures in 1992. After the data were collected, a multidisciplinary team of nurses, pharmacists, and surgeons was assembled to determine the step by step desired process flow from order received to actual medication administration. The team then reviewed each step of the process to identify variations relative to data obtained. An action plan was developed to implement the agreed upon improvement plan. After improvements were implemented, groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 consisted of the first 100 vascular procedures of 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996. Group 1 had only 26% of antibiotics administered during the preoperative period and 74% during the perioperative period. Problems identified were: surgeons ordered the antibiotics when the patient was in the operating room, cefamandole and vancomycin required at least 1 hr to infuse, nurses were not aware of the need for preoperative infusion, and the pharmacy did not supply the antibiotics in a timely fashion. Educational inservices were held for all parties involved, and cefazolin was used in place of cefamandole because it could be given as a bolus. Results were: group 1, early, 0%; preoperative, 26%; perioperative, 74%; P = N/A; group 2, early, 0%, preoperative, 90%; perioperative, 10%; group 3, early, 7%; preoperative, 93%; perioperative, 0%; group 4, early 0%; preoperative, 100%; perioperative, 0%; and group 5, early, 0%; preoperative, 100%; perioperative, 0%; P = 0.0001 for groups 2-5 (versus group 1). It was surprising how often antibiotics were administered incorrectly in a busy vascular practice. By focusing on the process of care delivery, a continuous quality improvement team implemented simple changes that resulted in significant improvements. We are now conducting a study to determine what effect these process improvements had on our infection rate.",

The length of the first hospitalization, the total length of stay during the study period, the number of rehospitalizations of the patients, and mortality were examined. Patients treated at the GACS were less likely to die, had shorter lengths of stay, less rehospitalization, and longer times between hospitalizations than both of the control groups.

The sequence of steps needed to assure a quality improvement role is discussed. Use of key personnel in less regulatory and more clinical data applications is critical. Illustrating this approach, we found disproportionate numbers of children receiving psychotropic drugs who were young boys and larger numbers of white children receiving psychotropic prescriptions relative to their Medicaid enrollment than either African-American or Hispanic children.

We enrolled a total of 1045 African-American and white patients with CAD at 5 Veterans Administration hospitals between 1999 and 2001. Data were obtained by chart review. Among current smokers, African-American and white patients were equally likely to receive smoking cessation interventions (55.8% versus 56.1%; P = .97). Similarly, among ideal candidates for aspirin therapy, there was no difference in overall treatment rates between the 2 groups (74.1% versus 73.4%; P = .85). However, in the subsets of ideal candidates with hypercholesterolemia and previous stroke, African-Americans were less likely than whites to receive aspirin (P < .05). In contrast, African-Americans with hypertension were more likely than whites to receive aspirin (P = .05). Our findings highlight the need for improvement in use of smoking cessation interventions and aspirin among all patients with CAD and indicate an area where future quality improvement efforts may be warranted.",

We examined whether treatment is more aggressive in a setting with accessible mental health resources, the Veterans Health Administration (VA). VA and non-VA primary care physicians and medical specialists viewed a videotape vignette portraying a patient meeting criteria for major depression and then answered interviewer-administered questions about management. We found that 24% of VA versus 15% of non-VA physicians would initiate guideline-recommended treatment (antidepressants or mental health referral, or both) (P = .09). Among those who identified depression as likely, 42% of VA versus 19% of non-VA physicians would treat (P = .002): 23% versus 3% recommended mental health referral (P < .001) and 21% versus 17% an antidepressant (P = .67). Although many patients with major depression may not receive guideline-recommended management, VA physicians do initiate mental health referral more often than do non-VA physicians. Access to mental health services may prove valuable in the campaign to increase physician adherence to depression clinical guidelines.",

Hospital interest has been driven historically by the desire for the physician's clinical business, the need to combat managed care, and now the threats posed by single specialty hospitals, medical device vendors, and consumerism. Physician interest has been driven by fears of managed care and desires for new sources of revenue. The dyadic relationships between hospitals and physicians are thus motivated and influenced by the role of third parties. This article analyzes the history of HPRs and the succession of third parties. The analysis illustrates that the role of third parties has shifted from a unifying one to one that divides hospitals and physicians. This shift presents both opportunities and problems.",

Plan case mix is measured with the percentage of a plan's enrollees who have type 1 diabetes with and without comorbidities and the percentage of a plan's enrollees who have type 2 diabetes with and without comorbidities. Plans with a higher percentage of enrollees with type 1 diabetes with comorbidity and plans with a higher percentage of enrollees with type 2 diabetes without comorbidity have lower performance, on average.

    "abstract": "Reducing disparities in care requires that health care providers identify populations at risk for suboptimal quality of care. Stratified analyses are often used to examine disparities (eg, by race or sex). However, stratified analyses can be misleading if the variables are confounded. The authors examined disparities in quality within a large ambulatory care practice using both unadjusted and adjusted methods for 18 measures. In unadjusted analyses, differences in quality were identified for 9 measures by race. However, in analyses adjusted simultaneously for race, sex, age, socioeconomic status, and chronic medical conditions, racial differences were apparent for only 4 measures. Women received lower quality care for 4 measures in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. The pattern of observed disparities can differ significantly based on whether unadjusted or adjusted methods are applied. Health care organizations should consider the routine use of adjusted methods to measure disparities in order to better inform disparity reduction initiatives.",

    "abstract": "A recent report from a survey of 15 primary care practices revealed considerable variability and much room for improvement in aspects of primary care practice that are associated with increased colorectal cancer screening rates. There was low utilization of patient reminders, tracking of test completion, rescheduling of missed appointments, and inconsistent follow-up of positive stool blood tests. Qualitative data collected in the same study provide insights into how the practices operated. Focus group discussions with the clinicians and staff of the practices and key informant interviews with office managers support the survey findings by shedding light on a lack of office policies and systems. Many practices lacked a systematic way to identify patients who were not up to date on screening while they were visiting the practice, thereby passing up the best opportunity to reach them. These findings are not consistent with the patient-centered medical home model.",

A comprehensive literature review of articles published on femoral venous catheterization did not yield a checklist validated by the Delphi method. A modified Delphi technique, involving a panel of 8 interdisciplinary, interinstitutional experts, was used to develop a femoral venous catheterization checklist. The internal consistency coefficient using Cronbach α was .99. Developing a 29-item checklist for teaching and assessing femoral venous catheterization is the first step in the validation process. For this checklist to become further validated, it should be implemented and studied in the simulation and clinical environments.",

This retrospective observational study included consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve, or combined CABG/valve surgery between February 2015 and May 2016 (N = 313). Throughout the intervention period, a briefing was distributed on postoperative day 1 to the anesthesiology providers responsible for operative care of the patient detailing success or failure of FTE and perioperative characteristics. The preintervention FTE success rate of 55.6% significantly improved to 72.8% in the intervention group ( P = .022). When combined with a continuous interdepartmental review process, provider debriefing improved FTE success. Perioperative provider debriefing requires minimal resources for implementation and can easily be replicated in other cardiac surgery centers.",

Two hundred six subjects were randomized to receive either BA or ST between 2009 and 2013. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BA versus ST. Total costs for BA and ST per participant were $259.02 and $216.12, respectively. At the 6-month follow-up, 87.91% of BA subjects received a DFE compared to 34.48% of ST subjects. The ICER for BA versus ST was $80.29/percent increase in DFE rate. In terms of improving DFE rates, BA was found to be more cost-effective than ST.",

One driver is overprescription for acute pain, with the size of initial prescription associated with subsequent long-term use. However, little work has been done to elicit clinician feedback about interventions to reduce opioid prescribing. To address this knowledge gap, qualitative analyses were conducted with clinicians who participated in a randomized controlled trial in which clinicians received monthly emailed feedback notifications about their opioid prescribing behaviors. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted (N = 12) with urgent care (N = 7) and emergency department (N = 5) clinicians who participated in the trial between November 2020 and April 2021. Clinicians appreciated feedback about their prescribing behavior and found comparative data with peer clinicians to be most useful. Sharing opioid prescribing feedback data with clinicians can be an acceptable way to address opioid prescribing among emergency and urgent care clinicians.",

A prospective nonrandomized case-control protocol was used at a multiple-site community-based medical and surgical office practices of members of Project Solo/Physicians Information Exchange. The study subjects were convenience samples of new and return patients seen between July 1996 and July 1997. One group of physicians (control group) surveyed patient satisfaction with office visits on two separate occasions with no intervention between the two occasions, except for seeing their own results after the first survey. A second group of physicians (intervention group) also surveyed patient satisfaction with office visits on two separate occasions, but were provided with a quality improvement poster between surveys. Changes in patient satisfaction between the two surveys were measured. The visit rating questionnaire, a nine-item patient-based questionnaire, was used to measure patient satisfaction; percentage excellent responses in the summary categories of patient access, physician attributes, and overall visit were used. Overall, 6088 patients from 59 physicians' offices participated; 3815 patients from 29 physicians in the control group, and 2273 patients from 30 physicians in the intervention group. The control group demonstrated small and nonsignificant changes in patient satisfaction between the two survey periods (0.6-1.4% increase, P = NS), and the intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction between the two survey periods (4.2-5.7% increase, P = 0.05-0.001). In addition, the two groups were compared directly using a stratified chi 2 analysis, and the differences were also statistically significant (chi 2 = 3.7-8.3, P = 0.05-0.004). We conclude that the use of a quality improvement-based intervention had a significant positive effect on patient satisfaction with office visits, when compared to a group of physicians who did not use any intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study uses a new paradigm to calculate the min imum and the optimum number of involuntary psychi atric beds at a state hospital in Maine with 5538 admissions over a 7-year period. The method measures quality of care (Q) based upon the accuracy of predic tion of length-of-stay for the hospital, and of commu nity length-of-stay for the community, each corrected for the severity of illness of the average patient. When Q in the hospital equals Q in the community, there is no net movement of patients from one phase of care to the other, analogous to a zero electromotive force, and the census at that point is the minimum number of beds (22 beds/100,000 population). When patients in the commu nity were least ill, relative to the hospital then hospital bed census is at its optimum (31 beds/100,000) given cur rent resources and technology. In studying specific di agnosis groups with the same methodology the authors found that patients with schizophrenia having the ben efit of clozapine for most of the study period had a Q av eraged over 7 years that was nearly equal in both hospital and community settings. This explains the perception that tertiary psychiatric hospitals comprised mostly of patients with schizophrenia can downsize significantly. However, affective disorders and \"borderline\" person ality disorders clearly benefit from structured hospital care with specialized experienced staff. We make argu ments for the role of the state hospital as a homeostat for the mental health care delivery system.",

Several studies before protease inhibitors became available have reported inconsistent associations between depression and disease severity.

The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence and correlates of depression among a contemporary group of HIV-infected patients. The setting and design for the study was a chart abstraction for HIV-infected patients in a primary care practice in Boston, Mass, in June 1997. Among 275 HIV-infected patients, depression was documented in 147 patient charts (53%), half of whom (n = 73, 27%) also received antidepressant medications. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for depression among patients with both a chart diagnosis of depression and current antidepressant medication use. We observed increased risk of depression among patients with a history of substance use (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.5-4.7), recent medical hospitalization (2.6, 1.4-5.0), and homosexual risk behavior (2.1, 1.1-4.2). Depression remains a common problem for HIV-infected patients, particularly among those with history of substance abuse, medical hospitalization, or homosexual risk behavior. Routine screening for depression in this population with special attention to those at higher risk may offer opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "We have made great strides in understanding the pathophysiology and medical management of hypertension, yet barriers to effective blood pressure control remain. The process of identifying the barriers within the health care system may be as important as the barriers themselves. Our primary purpose was to apply the widely accepted tool, Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI), to identify barriers to the management of hypertension. We wanted to identify the most important factors and (or) persons in effective blood pressure control and to compare costs, satisfaction, and blood pressure control among subgroups of patients to identify those most likely to benefit from interventions. We recruited patients with essential hypertension who came to a university-based clinic staffed by family physicians and residents; 181 patients with hypertension were identified and asked at the time of their visit to complete a questionnaire relating to the management of their blood pressure. Twenty-five physicians and 8 medical assistants were also asked to complete a similar questionnaire regarding their perceptions of barriers to blood pressure management. All other information came from the patients' medical records. Blood pressure control was based on a reading taken on the date the questionnaire was completed. Student's t test was used to determine if statistically significant differences existed in blood pressure control, patient satisfaction, and total costs for certain subgroups; regression analysis was used to determine correlations. We had completed questionnaires from 91 patients, 89 physicians, and 79 staff. The physicians and staff were of course involved; however, we found that the patients' gestalt was extremely important in blood pressure control. Our patients perceived that lifestyle modifications such as exercise and weight loss were the greatest barrier to better blood pressure control. The cost of certain antihypertensive drugs was an obstacle for some patients. African Americans had poorer blood pressure control, and their satisfaction of care was significantly lower than that of other races. Our patients taught us that the 2 major barriers to blood pressure control were changes in lifestyle and reducing the cost of medications. We also found that our African American patients showed the poorest blood pressure control and the greatest dissatisfaction with their care. We surmise that the greatest benefit of any intervention would be expected in this population. We demonstrated that CQI can be used to identify barriers to hypertension management and subgroups of patients likely to benefit from interventions.",

The intervention, based on the Put Prevention Into Practice program and standard QI techniques, consisted of patient self-administered Health Risk Profiles (HRPs) and a monthly educational curriculum for patients, staff, and providers. Documentation of preventive services in patient charts was measured using a repeated cross-sectional sampling design before and after the 1-year intervention period. Documentation of 8 of 19 preventive services under examination increased significantly (P < .05). Measurements of the intervention, including use of the HRPs and the educational curriculum, revealed little association with the observed improvements. Although the intervention was associated with improved documentation of clinical preventive services, specific elements of the intervention were underused. The authors postulate that the QI process fostered a culture change in the clinic that affected prevention activities. Whether the increased documentation of services reflected an increase in the actual provision of services and whether this increase is clinically significant require further study.",

Logistic regression models indicated substantially less difference between MCOs when analysis was based on data from the 2 sources combined than when based on either data source alone. Study results did not support the use of Medicaid encounter data as a sole data source for evaluating quality of adolescent sexual health care, despite the cost savings this would represent. However, encounter data, used as an adjunct to medical record review, may increase the reliability of quality evaluations.",

    "abstract": "The authors surveyed the pattern of care (POC) of lung cancer (LC) using data on 4565 patients from the cancer registry of their university-affiliated hospital institution for the period of 1991 to 2002. New clinical evidence was retrieved from the citations used in the level 1 recommendations in guidelines and textbooks. Using this evidence, indexes (1-6) were chosen, including stage I to II non-small-cell LC (NSCLC): no adjuvant radiotherapy (ART; I); stage III NSCLC: equivocal ART (II), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (C/T; III), and chemoradiotherapy (CRT; IV); stage 4 NSCLC: C/T (V) and limited-stage small-cell LC: CRT (VI). Odds ratios of these index events in the postevidence period versus preevidence period were calculated to show trends in the POC. Trends in the POC were consistent with new clinical evidence with statistical significance. The age and gender adjustment odds ratio was 2.22 to 7.06 for beneficial indexes (3-6) and 0.12 to 0.4 for detrimental indexes (1-2).",

Tool use was distinct in the 2 sites and depended on the site champion's involvement, the extent of process reconfiguration demanded by a tool, and its perceived value. Baseline conformance varied across guideline recommendations (averaged 54%). Posttrial conformance increased in all clinical areas (averaged 59%). Valuable features of the toolkit in real-world settings were its ability to: facilitate tool selection, direct implementation efforts in response to a baseline performance audit, and allow selection of tool versions and customizing them.

QIO staff frequently encountered difficulty in accessing physicians and administrative staff and reported many barriers to QI. Despite these challenges, outreach visits were associated with adoption of QI tools, and certain physician characteristics were associated with greater numbers of outreach visits and tools adopted. QIOs and other external parties who seek to improve quality of care in private practice primary care physician offices face challenges in gaining access to physicians and administrative personnel.

Themes emerged elucidating promoters and concerns. Promoters included a desire to protect self, family, and patients; perception of vaccination as part of professional responsibility; and free vaccination as a benefit from the organization. Concerns included negative feelings surrounding the forced nature and substantial anxiety about the physical injection. Participants expressed a strong desire for a private, compassionate, unhurried environment for the injection. Managing personal anxiety and a desire for privacy emerged as strong concerns among health care workers getting vaccinated at work. This information enabled future improvements in the mandatory vaccination campaign.",

Patients under the 2 models were comparable with respect to demographics, comorbidities, procedure types, and Society for Thoracic Surgery predicted risk of mortality score; however, patients in the earlier cohort were slightly older and more likely to have chronic kidney disease ( P = .003). Integrated intensivist involvement was associated with reduced postoperative ventilator time, length of stay (LOS), stroke, encephalopathy, and reoperations for bleeding (all P &lt; .01) but was not associated with mortality.

This article presents a framework for developing a multilevel evaluation infrastructure using examples from the evaluation of the national Department of Veterans Affairs Chief Resident in Quality and Safety program, a 1-year, post-accreditation program to develop leadership and teaching skills in QI and PS. It illustrates how to apply the framework to establish evaluation priorities and methods, and shares sample results and how they are used to guide program improvements and track important outcomes at multiple levels. The framework is particularly relevant to other nonaccredited advanced QI/PS programs, yet offers useful considerations for evaluating any advanced medical education program.",

One year later, residents were surveyed regarding QI self-efficacy and planned QI involvement. Baseline verbal RN-MD communication at discharge was rare. During DTO implementation, rates of structured communication averaged 56% (341/608) with several months >70%. During the monitoring phase, this fell to 45% and did not recover (833/1852). Participating residents reported increased QI self-efficacy (P < .05) and increased likelihood of participating in future QI (P < .05). The DTO increased RN-MD communication but was not sustained.

Sustainability of adherence following initial implementation, particularly in academic settings with trainee involvement, is underexplored. This study measures and describes ERAS adherence for 163 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal resection in an academic colorectal surgery department with a well-established ERAS pathway. Providers, including residents and nursing staff, were surveyed regarding pathway knowledge and obstacles to adherence. Adherence was higher preoperatively (80%) and intraoperatively (93%) than postoperatively (61%). Opioid-sparing analgesia and bowel motility agents were underdosed on up to 63% of hospital days, without clinical rationale in ≥50% of cases. Providers cited peer teaching (71%) as the primary source of pathway knowledge and identified individual surgeon preferences as an obstacle to adherence. Formalized ERAS pathway education, communication, and coordination among attending physicians are needed to reduce provider-driven deviation in an academic setting.",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic at a given point in time does not impact all hospitals equally-even within a single healthcare system, one hospital may be caring for patients in the hallways, while another has available inpatient beds. Here, we demonstrate a program to level-load COVID-19 patients between 2 academic medical centers in a healthcare system by transferring patients at the time of admission from the emergency department of one institution directly to an inpatient bed of the other institution. Over 42 days, 50 patients were transferred which saved 432 bed-days at the home academic medical center without any adverse events during transfer or upgrades to the ICU within the first 24 hours of admission. Programs like this can expand a healthcare system's ability to allocate personnel and resources efficiently for patients and maximize the quality of care delivered even during a pandemic.",

Intervention fidelity was monitored with a priori defined success as >50% VL-assisted coaching or >80% AO use for 3 consecutive months. Eighty percent of intensive care units with VL-assisted coaching and 20% with AO met this criteria during the study period. Common facilitator themes were adequate device accessibility, having a QI culture, and strong leadership. Common barrier themes included poor device accessibility and perception of delay in care. A consistently identified theme in the successful sites was strong QI leadership, while unsuccessful sites consistently identified insufficient education.

The ACE rounded with medicine and surgery teams and provided individual and team-level education and feedback targeting 4 domains: professionalism, infection control, interpreter use, and pain assessment. In a pilot, the ACE observed 2862 physician-patient interactions and 178 physicians. Self-reported compliance often was greater than the behaviors observed. Following ACE implementation, observed professionalism behaviors trended toward improvement; infection control also improved. Physicians were highly satisfied with the program.

A modified Delphi technique, involving a panel of 9 interdisciplinary, interinstitutional experts, was used to develop an NG tube insertion checklist. The internal consistency coefficient using Cronbach’s α was .80. Developing a 19-item checklist for teaching and assessing NG tube insertion is the first step in the validation process.

The Data Envelopment Analysis Technique was used to identify best-practice hospitals in terms of less use of 5 classes of antibacterials and fewer CDIs. Of 58 hospitals, 17 (29%) were identified as best-practice hospitals. Antibacterial classes requiring the greatest percentage reduction in use in non-best-practice hospitals versus best-practice hospitals were clindamycin (31%), β-lactam/β-lactamase combinations (30%), and carbapenems (29%).

Clinical improvements were affected by combining national guidelines and advancements with local clinical data and interactions with physicians within interdisciplinary as well as specialty conferences. Case-based, multidisciplinary conferences lent themselves to this process to a greater extent than didactic conferences. The latter also could lead to QI when the topics were focused on specific quality initiatives that often are part of a national QI initiative.

Baseline compliance with Surgical Care Improvement Inf-9, removal of urinary catheter by the end of surgical postoperative day 2, was determined. Comparison of baseline data to postintervention results showed clinically important reductions in the duration of indwelling bladder catheters as well as marked reduction in practice variation. Following the intervention, Surgical Care Improvement Inf-9 guidelines were met in 97% of patients. Although clinical quality improvement was notable, the process to accomplish this-identification of patients suitable for standardized pathways, protocol application, and electronic systems to support the standardized practice model-has potentially greater relevance than the specific clinical results.",

To examine possible causes, a retrospective analysis of 962 black and white patients treated continuously between 2008 and 2010 was performed. At baseline, 55.0% of whites and 49.8% of blacks were controlled (5.2% disparity). The disparity increased, with 61.8% of whites and 44.6% of blacks having control in 2010 (17.2% disparity). Among patients uncontrolled at baseline, blacks were less likely to become controlled. Among patients controlled at baseline, blacks were less likely to remain controlled; accounting for patient characteristics and changes in lipid-lowering drug prescription regimens did not attenuate these relationships. Physician-facing, general QI interventions may be insufficient to produce equity in LDL cholesterol control. Helping patients maintain prior success controlling cholesterol appears as important in addressing this disparity as is helping uncontrolled patients achieve control.",

Control charts of monthly SSI rates for 100 hospitals were analyzed for indicators of a performance change in 2009 (vs 2008) using standard rules. Hospitals also were classified as having better, worse, or no change in outlier status for risk-adjusted SSI rates in 2009 (vs 2008). There was moderate agreement between these methods (weighted κ = 0.401). Control charts predicted nonworsening performance well (specificity = 92.9%) and identified changes in SSI performance sooner; however, they failed to identify 31.2% of hospitals with worsened outlier status.

This is especially true for health care, as the controversy rages on how the existing American system should be restructured. Health care reform aimed at reducing costs and ensuring access to all Americans can not be allowed to jeopardize the quality of care. As such, total quality management (TQM) has become a vital ingredient to strategic planning within the health care domain. At the heart of any such quality improvement effort is the issue of measurement. TQM cannot be ef fectively utilized as a competitive weapon unless quality can be accurately defined, measured, evaluated, and monitored over time. Through such analysis a hospital can elect how to expend its limited resources toward those quality improvement projects which will impact customer perceptions of service quality the most. Thus, the purpose of this report is to establish a framework by which to approach the issue of quality measurement, delineate the various components of quality that exist in health care, and explore how these elements affect one another. We propose that the issue of quality mea surement in health care be approached as an integration of service quality attributes common to other service organizations and technical quality attributes unique to health care. We hope that this research will serve as a first step toward the synthesis of the various quality attributes inherent in the health care domain and en courage other researchers to address the interactions of the various quality attributes.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted of all radical prostatectomies performed on hospitalized male Medicare beneficiaries in New York State for the period 1991-1993. Basic trend data were also analyzed for 1990. Pattern analysis was conducted on the 4,154 procedures performed between 1990-1993.In depth hospital chart review was conducted of the 220 cases of radical prostatectomy performed in pa tients 75 years of age and over between 1991 and 1993 and of a random sample of 263 of 1,266 patients 70-74 years of age. A total of 452 hospital charts were exam ined for a broad range of information, including family history and therapeutic preferences, preoperative work-up, staging, intraoperative and postoperative transfusions, postoperative complications, and mortality.The rate of radical prostatectomy dramatically rose among New York State male Medicare beneficiaries be tween 1990 and 1992 and remained at a high plateau in 1993. Pattern analysis revealed a tripling of the proce dure rate among those 70-74 years of age and a doubling of the rate in those 75 years of age and older. It was also found that a high proportion of radical prostatecto mies in men 70 years of age and older were performed by relatively few hospitals.Although rates of radical prostatectomy rose in New York State during the period under study, these rates were lower than those reported several years earlier in other parts of the country. This may reflect an overall conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer, especially among older men, on the part of New York's urologic community.The overall postoperative complication rate was 18.5% and the mortality rate 1.3%. These rates are simi lar to those found in other series. Prostate cancer in older men usually has a protracted course. Radical pros tatectomy in such men is associated with operative risks, and significant immediate and long-term compli cations. In addition, the procedure provides only mar ginal benefit of 10 years because of competing mortality in older men.The results of this study show a need for provider and patient focused educational efforts to reduce the numbers of radical prostatectomies in older men where the benefits are marginal compared to operative risks and significant immediate and long term complications.",

A convergence was found in recommended action steps reported across sites to facilitate introduction and implementation of new RAI/MDS software. An example of how benchmarking results were used to develop an implementation plan is provided. Benchmarking provided a useful methodology for identifying best practices to guide implementation planing for adoption of a new computerized RAI/MDS system in the current trial. The benchmarking steps described are replicable and can be used to guide implementation of other new systems in the nursing home setting.",

A total of 2828 patient who underwent bypass surgery at 3 hospitals (2 teaching and 1 nonteaching) were analyzed. The preoperative correlates of direct variable cost (marginal cost) were determined by ordinary least squares regression. Age, urgent/emergent surgical priority, previous CABG, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significant contributors (P < .05) to cost in all hospitals, but overall, there were many differences. The major contributor to cost was non-white race (31.3%) at teaching hospital A, previous CABG (30.5%) at teaching hospital B, and preop insertion of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (35.9%) at the nonteaching hospital. The number of significant risk factors also differed. Preoperative characteristics that contribute to cost can be quite different among hospitals and therefore results from one hospital cannot be broadly generalized to others.",

None of the practices used computerized tracking systems, 29% used diabetes flowsheets, and 33% allocated specific diabetes care responsibilities to nonphysician personnel. Neither use of flowsheets nor use of nonphysician personnel was associated with improvements in diabetes care. Although practices varied widely in their care of patients with diabetes, as currently implemented, office system tools have not led to consistently better performance.",

The authors discussed the similarities and differences among clinical practice, QIPs, and clinical research, pointing out issues to consider when identifying the most appropriate method for QIP oversight and accountability. They note that potential solutions must address ethical issues (eg, patient safety, privacy, and self-determination) and weigh the effect of the underlying QIP goal (administrative versus clinical improvement) on an individual patient and patient populations. They conclude that because QIPs are an extension of clinical practice and have elements of clinical research, it too should have an oversight system. Institutional or regional quality improvement boards, operating parallel to current IRBs, are suggested as 1 means of ensuring that QIP participants are offered the same protections as those who take part in clinical research.",

Thirteen Quality Improvement Organizations collected data on hospital quality improvement interventions from each hospital in this study. Medicare discharges between January 1997 and January 2002 define the study period. Most hospitals implemented multiple interventions to improve pneumonia care. Only 3 individual interventions were found to be effective in increasing time to antibiotic administration. Data feedback and benchmarking and medical records checklists had a positive effect on time to antibiotic administration. Administrative support by itself had a negative effect on the quality indicator. Although several combinations of interventions were also found effective, generalizations about the use of multiple interventions in quality improvement are difficult to make from retrospective studies.",

One strategy to address this gap is to focus on trainees during graduate medical education, specifically those residents aspiring to careers as physician leaders in quality. The authors designed a leadership curriculum for self-selected residents who are pursuing a certificate in health care leadership in quality. Residents were surveyed and focus groups were conducted with health system executives who participated in the curriculum as part of an evaluation designed to inform improvements in the program and to provide guidance to others who direct physician leadership training programs.

Tracking the intervention required a system to facilitate process data collection that was also user-friendly and flexible. Coupled with protocols and training, a strategically planned and customizable customer relationship management system (CRMS) was implemented to support the quality improvement intervention with 257 small independent practices. Features of the CRMS and implementation protocols were customized to optimize program management, practice facilitation tracking and supervision, and data collection for performance feedback to practices and research. The CRMS was a valuable tool for tracking and managing the intervention systematically. Successful implementation of the HHNYC protocol also required an articulated implementation plan and adoption process.",

A total of 359 residents (60%) completed the survey; 50% of those surveyed agreed that adverse events (AEs) can be prevented. A greater percentage of responses attributed more responsibility to patients (54.4%) than to physician errors (28.7%). A total of 72% of respondents had observed AEs over the past 2 months, and 37% would be willing to take part in a work group to improve patient safety.

The authors studied an interprofessional quality improvement (QI) curriculum implemented in 2013 integrating internal medicine residents (n = 90) and Master of Public Health (MPH) students (n = 33) at an urban safety net academic medical center. Pre and post curriculum surveys assessed attitudes toward QI and interprofessional education and team performance. Resident attitudes toward learning and engaging in QI work improved at the end of the curriculum. Overall, MPH students demonstrated significantly more positive attitudes about interprofessional learning and work than residents. They also agreed more strongly than residents that patients would benefit if residents and public health students worked together. As health care organizations evolve to become more integrated, it is crucial that interprofessional educational opportunities be developed and evaluated to help encourage a culture of collaboration among health care providers.",

Compliance with the core measure improved from 91.0% at baseline to 93.6% with the Pharmacy Care (P-Care) Rule and to 96.4% with the Centricity-Blaze (CE-Blaze) Rule. At the same time, prescriptions for ACEIs/ARBs documented in the hospital discharge summary decreased from 83.2% at baseline to 75.8% with the P-Care rule and to 64.1% with the CE-Blaze Rule. The inpatient mortality rate and the 30-day readmission rate did not change significantly. Better documentation of contraindications in the electronic medical record seems to account for the core measure improvement, even as ACEI/ARB therapy has unexpectedly declined.",

Multivariate regression was used to test the hypothesis that organizational climate predicts medical home implementation. This analysis of 191 PCPs found that higher scores in 2 domains of organizational climate (communication and cooperation, and orientation to quality improvement) were associated with a statistically significantly higher percentage (from 7 to 10 percentage points) of PCPs implementing structural changes to support the medical home model. In addition, some aspects of a better organizational climate were associated with improved organizational processes of care, including a higher percentage of patients contacted within 2 days of hospital discharge (by 2 to 3 percentage points) and appointments made within 3 days of a patient request (by 2 percentage points).",

Approximately 50% of the women included in the study had undergone a screening mammography during the study period. An increasing number of physician visits was positively associated with having a screening mammography. Women making at least 1 visit to a gynecologist were more likely to be screened compared with women who saw only a primary care physician and/or a medical specialist.

Hospital PSI rates with and without PSI-qualifying 30-day readmissions were highly correlated for point estimates and within-hospital longitudinal change. Most hospitals remained in the same relative performance decile.

A descriptive analysis of same-day mortality by demographics, surgical specialties, and age was performed. Of 835 880 elective pediatric surgical cases identified, 174 patients died on the day of surgery-that is, 2.1 deaths/10 000 cases. Surgical specialty mortality rates ranged from 0.06 (otolaryngology) to 17.4 (cardiothoracic surgery) deaths per 10 000 cases. Death on the day of elective pediatric surgery is rare, limiting its utility to compare performance in pediatric surgery.

Within the Veterans Administration (VA), most safety reporting occurs within organizational silos, with little involvement by the frontline users of these measures. To provide a more integrated picture of patient safety, the study team partnered with multiple VA stakeholders and engaged potential frontline users at 2 hospitals to develop a Guiding Patient Safety (GPS) tool. The GPS is currently in its fourth generation; once approval is obtained from senior leadership, implementation will begin. Stakeholders were enthusiastic about the GPS's user-friendly format, comprehensive content, and potential utility for improving safety. These findings suggest that stakeholder engagement is a critical first step in the development of tools that will more likely be used by frontline users. Policy makers and researchers may consider adopting this innovative partnered-research model in developing future national initiatives to deliver meaningful programs to frontline users.",

One factor limiting application is the limited workforce resulting from a lack of specific education and professional development in health systems engineering (HSE). The authors describe the development of an HSE fellowship within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VA). This fellowship includes a novel curriculum based on specifically established competencies for HSE. A 1-year HSE curriculum was developed and delivered to fellows at several VA engineering resource centers over several years. On graduation, a majority of the fellows accepted positions in the health care field. Challenges faced in developing the fellowship are discussed. Advanced educational opportunities in applied HSE have the potential to develop the workforce capacity needed to improve the quality of health care.",

The authors hypothesized that particular patient characteristics might influence the frequency of inappropriate echocardiogram ordering. Demographics and appropriateness were examined in a consecutive series of 535 inpatients receiving echocardiograms at a metropolitan hospital; inappropriate tests were ordered in 9% of cases. Disabled patients received a significantly higher proportion of inappropriate echocardiograms compared to both retired and employed patients. Among patients receiving repeat echocardiograms, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to receive inappropriately ordered echocardiograms than patients with either Medicare or private insurance. In conclusion, certain socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are associated with a higher incidence of inappropriate test ordering. Further research into the causal factors behind this association may be useful to reduce inappropriate test ordering.",

The objective of this quality improvement study was to rapidly develop and implement an equity-focused community outreach intervention that facilitated COVID-19 vaccine appointments. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, this multipronged, primary care-based outreach intervention developed call/recall systems that addressed vaccine hesitancy and facilitated real-time vaccine scheduling. Through 5058 calls to 2794 patients, 1519 patients were successfully reached. Of the 750 patients eligible for vaccine scheduling, 129 (17.2%) had a vaccine appointment scheduled by the caller and 72 (9.6%) indicated a plan to self-schedule. Low confidence in the vaccine was the most cited reason for declining assistance with a vaccine appointment. Primary care practices may wish to consider introducing similar outreach interventions in the future to address ethnoracial inequities in vaccination distribution.",

    "abstract": "The development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 has offered game-changing protection from severe disease and death from COVID-19. Despite efforts to vaccinate individuals in the ambulatory setting, a sizable minority of the US population remains unvaccinated for COVID-19. For unvaccinated patients, hospitalization for non-COVID-19 illness offers another opportunity for vaccination. In the summer of 2021, the authors noted that COVID-19 vaccination rate for medicine inpatients at their hospital had fallen to 5.3 vaccine doses administered per 4-week block. In response, they created Vax the Max, a gamification program of COVID-19 vaccination tasks where internal medicine resident teams were awarded points for completing these tasks. Residents were anonymously surveyed after participation. The hospital demonstrated higher rates of administering the initial COVID-19 vaccine dose and completing the vaccine series in the inpatient setting per 4-week plan-do-study-act cycle after implementation of Vax the Max (5.3 versus 8.8 doses per plan-do-study-act cycle). Among residents, 76.8% reported that Vax the Max spurred their COVID-19 task engagement, and 66% reported that a similar gamification model could be utilized for a different clinical task in the future. An increase was observed in the COVID-19 vaccination rate for medicine inpatients after launching the Vax the Max competition. This occurred in the setting of resident turnover every 4 weeks, which normally makes practice sustainment more challenging. Despite this, a high degree of engagement was produced by itinerant residents. There is potential to explore similar gamification approaches involving resident physicians in areas of quality improvement and patient safety.",

Using a hospital-based walk-in center, this study identified pa tients who were referred for follow-up care and exam ined factors related to compliance with these referrals. The participants were 696 adults seen in a hospital- based walk-in unit between June 1, 1992, and December 1, 1992. Patients completed a self-administered ques tionnaire including questions about sociodemographic characteristics, prior use of health services, and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-Item Health Survey. Medical findings, follow-up recommendations, insur ance status, and compliance with follow-up referrals were ascertained using chart review, the hospital's com puting system, and clinic records. Fifty percent of the patients were referred for follow-up medical care; 55% of these complied with follow-up referrals. Factors asso ciated with referral for follow-up care included older age, inability to afford a physician, longer duration of chief complaint, the patient's belief that follow-up care would be needed, and worse MOS pain score. The most important factor associated with compliance with fol low-up referral was scheduling appointments while pa tients were still in the walk-in unit. Patients with such scheduled appointments were almost 10 times more likely than others to receive follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = 9.6, 95% confidence interval = 4.4-21.2). The most important step a provider can take to improve compliance with follow-up referral is to schedule ap pointments before patients are sent home. This should presumably improve quality of ambulatory care.",

Thirty-two (32) percent of the residents received inappropriate care in at least one care area and 7% received inappropriate care in two or more areas. Residents who received the most inappropriate care were more dependent in their activities of daily living, uncommunicative, incontinent, likely to have had a stroke, and less disruptive. Residents who received the most inappropriate care are among the most vulnerable residents, and stronger regulation and outside advocacy may be needed to protect them from inappropriate care.",

The paper proposes that mental illness is fractal in nature (self-similar at all scales) and conforms to power laws like the Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) law, whereby there is a log-log relationship between frequency of episodes (ie, admissions) and the severity of those episodes. The paper also hypothesizes that 28% is the average uncertainty (residual or excess entropy) in the treatment of mental illness. The authors use the G-R paradigm to calculate the severity of admission and, subsequently, the minimum number of beds for different behavioral health care facilities and propose the optimal partition of beds between community and state services, thereby \"balancing\" the delivery system. The data presented support the notion that mental illness manifests complexity and \"self-organized criticality.\" The authors hypothesize that correcting deviations from the theoretical G-R curve for each level of care will allow optimum resource distribution, improve quality of care, and reduce costs.",

We also examined the importance of risk adjustment in explaining variation in resource utilization. Episodes were constructed using private insurance claims from 1992 to 1993. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine differences between managed care and indemnity plans on episode severity, resource utilization, and outcome measures (asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits). Managed care plans showed higher resource utilization in terms of services and payments per episode compared with fee-for-service plans. Financial incentives to both providers and patients may have contributed to the higher utilization among managed care patients. An episodes of care methodology has potential to serve as a cost-effective \"tool\" in analyzing trends in medical care utilization within a health care plan. Validation of this methodology is necessary, however, before it can be used to compare trends in utilization across health plans.",

    "abstract": "Substance abuse is known to be our nation's number one public health problem. Physicians and other health providers can develop chemical dependency problems that create significant quality assurance and risk man agement dilemmas. Not all of society understands drug dependence to be a treatable medical disease and behav ioral problem. Sometimes impaired providers are ignored or punished rather than treated and rehabili tated. This results in an enormous waste of human and monetary resources. In the last 10 years, impaired physi cian programs have developed focus and credibility. But certain difficulties exist in these programs: namely, that such programs are affected by tensions between medical societies and state licensing boards; that substance-de pendent providers escape detection by moving to other states; that existing impaired provider programs have limited practical application within the federal health care system; and that liability risks are incurred if insti tutions rely on impaired provider policies that do not include all members of the medical staff. Hence, we ar gue that existing impaired provider policies might be worth rethinking. To promote that dialogue, we offer a sample policy for consideration and review. It includes specific actions and procedures for the identification, referral, and reentry of impaired providers and allows for National Practitioner Data Bank reporting in that process. The Data Bank has been in place for only a few years and offers society and the health community a new opportunity to better control chemically depen dent, licensed medical staff without dismantling ex isting impaired provider programs. The policies for managing chemically dependent health professionals are changing from a focus on stigma and prosecution to one of early identification, rehabilitation, and reentry. We hope to advance that process.",

    "abstract": "This report addresses diabetes care in the managed care setting and improvement in care brought about by collaboration between 6 Medicare managed care plans (MCPs) and a Peer Review Organization (PRO). The objective was to improve the quality of care of outpatient diabetes patients provided by primary care physicians through the mutual collaboration of 6 Medicare managed care plans and a Medicare Peer Review Organization. The design involved pre-post intervention trial based on 2 random samples, a baseline sample drawn in 1995 and a remeasurement sample drawn in 1996. Medical records of patients in both samples were reviewed by the PRO to determine provision of 14 quality indicator services over a 1-year period. The setting was 6 Arizona Medicare managed care plans comprising approximately 40% of the Arizona Medicare population. Two random samples were drawn from type 2 diabetes patients continuously enrolled in the same managed care plan for at least 1 year. The intervention was comparative feedback of baseline data by the PRO, enabling each plan to compare itself to any other plan on any or all indicators. Each plan developed and implemented its own intervention in response to the 1995 baseline results. The main outcome measures were mean HbA1c, the proportion of HbA1c values below 8%, and positive change in provision of 14 quality indicator services. At postintervention remeasurement, mean HbA1c values fell from 8.9 +/- 2.2 to 7.9% +/- 2.1, and the proportion of patients with HbA1c values below 8.0% rose from 40% to 61.6%. The proportion of the 14 indicator services provided to patients rose from 35% to 55%. The mean number of physician office visits fell 13% and the number of services provided per visit doubled. We conclude that improving the process of care improves glycemic control. Better outpatient diabetes management in competing, capitated managed care plans is an attainable goal when mediated through a neutral third party such as a PRO.",

For MDD, experts rated the following measures as very meaningful and valid: (a) the results of depression screening, (b) the occurrence and results of diagnostic assessment for MDD, (c) the provision of antidepressant medication or psychotherapy, and (d) whether antidepressant medications were prescribed within the therapeutic dose range recommended by practice guidelines. For schizophrenia, expert reviewers rated therapeutic doses of antipsychotic medication and assessment for antipsychotic medication side effects as being very meaningful and valid. Performance measures that evaluate clinically significant aspects of care using specific, valid data elements are the most meaningful.

Distinct differences between the various practitioners and disciplines can serve as both opportunities for synergy and barriers to collaboration. There must be a clear and compelling reason that motivates different practitioners and disciplines to do the hard work needed to overcome barriers to collaboration. Patient-centered care is the compelling reason, the defining characteristic that must underlie all collaborative medicine efforts. The practical application of this principle is illustrated by the experience of a large health care system (Catholic Health Initiatives). From a complexity theory standpoint, patient-centered care and collaboration can be thought of as simple rules that guide desirable behaviors in a complex system. The application of these two simple rules is as relevant in the microcosm of collaborative medicine as it is in the larger macrocosm of health care.",

The rates of Iowa's risk factors for the most serious types of trauma—third/fourth-degree lacerations—were compared with national rates. The comparisons suggest that episiotomy, artificial rupture of membranes, obstructed labor, and late pregnancies are the most salient risk factors for third/fourth-degree lacerations within Iowa.

Small fellowship programs may find it particularly difficult, limited by a lack of well-trained faculty. We report on the feasibility and effectiveness of a consolidated curriculum for subspecialty fellowship programs.Two QI experts were identified to design a curriculum. Interactive didactic sessions were created to guide development and implementation of fellow QI projects. All projects culminated in abstract/poster presentation.Seven of 10 eligible fellowships participated. Twenty-four projects were completed with 70% reaching improvement in process measures. Trainees improved confidence in 11 of 12 QI domains. Program directors stated enhancement in QI education with 100% recommending program continuation.Consolidating teaching efforts with existing QI experts can lead to an effective QI curriculum for fellowship programs. This model can be expanded to other graduate medical education trainees as a means to increase QI proficiency.",

Linked electronic data correctly identified 40/40 pneumonia and 65/65 chest pain patients. The median difference in time to antibiotics calculated from linked electronic data versus chart data was 6 minutes (standard deviation [SD] = 14.0); for time to ECG it was 0 minutes (SD = 70). The percentage of ED patients meeting target time to antibiotics was 47% with electronic data versus 44% with charts; for time to ECG, 8% met target time with electronic data versus 11% with charts.

By implementing a highly collaborative practice, rigorous outcomes review, evidence-based standardized care pathways, consistent attending surgeon oversight for care delivery, careful case selection, and a mechanism for support from highly experienced outside cardiac surgeons, the cardiac surgery program at the authors’ institution delivers care on par with its higher volume counterparts. A review of these practices and available supporting evidence may provide a model for other programs seeking success in this setting.",

Online searches of the National Quality Forum’s Quality Positioning System and the National Clearinghouse for Quality Measures databases were conducted using the keywords smoking, tobacco, alcohol, depression, and obesity. The types and focuses of each measure were classified, and differences between the metrics and evidence-based practice were identified. Most measures indicate whether BSI components are delivered, not how well. Clinicians can perform well on most metrics without delivering evidence-based services. More rigorous quality measures are needed. A new kind of measure is proposed, whereby separate terms representing the reach and effectiveness of key BSI components are multiplied to produce a single indicator of population-level impact for each behavioral topic.",

The authors conducted a retrospective review of all peer review cases from January 2008 to December 2011 in an academic medical center and determined the quantity and type of resident errors that occurred compared to attending faculty. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's core competencies served as a framework to categorize quality of care errors. The addition of Code R to the peer review process can be readily adopted by other institutions to help improve resident education, facilitate faculty supervision, and potentially improve patient safety.",

Among patients discharged between June 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, there were no significant differences in intensive care unit transfer, inpatient mortality, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, or length of stay. However, discharge from the new hospital building was associated with a higher percentage of top box scores on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems overall hospital rating item (60% vs 76%, P = 0.02). Further studies are needed to identify specific hospital design features that influence patient experience and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic error remains understudied and underaddressed despite causing significant morbidity and mortality. One barrier to addressing this issue remains provider discomfort. Survey studies have shown significantly more discomfort among providers in discussing diagnostic error compared with other forms of error. Whether the comfort in discussing diagnostic error differs depending on practice setting has not been previously studied. The objective of this study was to assess differences in provider willingness to discuss diagnostic error in the inpatient versus outpatient setting. A multicenter survey was sent out to 3881 providers between May and June 2018. This survey was designed to assess comfort level of discussing diagnostic error and looking at barriers to discussing diagnostic error. Forty-three percent versus 22% of inpatient versus outpatient providers (P = 0.004) were comfortable discussing short-term diagnostic error publicly. Similarly, 76% versus 60% of inpatient versus outpatient providers (P = 0.010) were comfortable discussing short-term diagnostic error privately. A higher percentage of inpatient (64%) compared with outpatient providers (46%) (P = 0.043) were comfortable discussing long-term diagnostic error privately. Forty percent versus 24% of inpatient versus outpatient providers (P = 0.018) were comfortable discussing long-term error publicly. No difference in barriers cited depending on practice setting. Inpatient providers are more comfortable discussing diagnostic error than their outpatient counterparts. More study is needed to determine the etiology of this discrepancy and to develop strategies to increase outpatient provider comfort.",

    "abstract": "Alignment between graduate medical education (GME) and health system priorities is foundational to meaningful engagement of residents and fellows in systems improvement work within the clinical learning environment. The Residents and Fellows Leading Interprofessional Continuous Improvement Teams program at the University of California San Francisco was designed over a decade ago to address barriers to trainee participation in health system-based improvement work. The program provides structure and support for health system-aligned trainee-led improvement projects in the clinic learning environment. Project champions (residents/fellows) from GME programs attend workshops where they learn improvement methodologies and develop proposals for health system-based improvement projects for their training programs. Proposals are supported by local faculty mentors and are reviewed and approved by GME and health systems’ leaders. During the academic year, teams share their progress using visual management boards and interactive leader rounds. The health system provides a modest financial incentive for successful projects. Since the program’s inception, thousands of trainees from 58 residency and fellowship programs have participated either as champions or participants in the program at least once, and in total over 300 projects have been implemented. Approximately three-quarters of the specific improvement goals were met, all projects meaningfully engaged residents and fellows, and many projects continued after the learners graduated. This active partnership between GME and a health system created a symbiotic relationship; trainees received education and support to complete improvement projects, while the health system reaped additional benefits from the alignment and impact of the projects. This partnership continues to grow with steady increases in participating programs, spread to partner health systems, and scholarship for trainees and faculty.",

A random sample of discharged summaries coded for sepsis were obtained from five different hospitals. One hundred forty-one summaries involving 128 patients from 1989 were evaluated. Twenty-seven (18.7%) of the summaries were judged to be improperly coded. Of the remaining 114 summaries, 61 (53.5%) contained information supporting sepsis as an admission condition. Comparison of other clinical attributes of these summaries indicates that patients with sepsis on admission have some characteristics that are different from those of patients who acquire sepsis during care. These attributes include a history of chemotherapy, an overall shorter length of stay, and a lower death rate. Sepsis, as a discharge diagnosis, cannot be assumed to represent an iatrogenic condition or to be the result of poor care since more than half of the cases reviewed indicated that the condition was present at admission.",

    "abstract": "Gender-based differences in hospital use may result from biological differences or may suggest problems of access to health services and quality of care. We hypoth esized that there should be no difference in hospital care between men and women, given the same diagnosis. Hospitalizations were characterized by severity of ill ness, as this may indicate the timeliness of hospital care. Hospitalizations may be too late (with higher severity of illness) resulting in long stays and high costs, or too early (with lower severity of illness) resulting in care that could be given in alternative treatment settings. Three abdominal conditions were examined which could be misdiagnosed or confused with other diseases involv ing the female reproductive system: appendicitis, diver ticulitis, and cholecystitis. The National Hospital Dis charge Survey (NHDS) was used for analysis. Disease staging was used to assign a severity of illness indicator, ranging from stage 1 (conditions with no complications) to stage 3 (multiple site involvement, poor prognosis). For each disease, the percentage of discharges and the age-adjusted discharge rate per 1000 population was examined by stage of illness and gender. For appendec tomy, there was a significantly greater percentage of men at stage 1 (lower severity) compared to women (73% versus 67%). For diverticular disease, women had higher proportions of stage 2/3 discharges than men for both medical and surgical hospitalizations. For chole cystitis, women had a greater percentage of hospitaliza tions at stage 1 than men, notably for surgical treatment (63% compared with 38%), although more men were admitted at stage 2 for both medical and surgical treat ment. Gender differences in the proportions of hospital ization by severity of illness suggest that there are prob lems in the timely recognition and treatment of appendicitis and diverticulitis in women. However, for cholecystitis, it appears that men, rather than women, have a problem of timely recognition and treatment. Future research may seek to identify additional patient characteristics, physician attitudes, and treatment pro tocols.",

Clearly, medical culture in other Western democracies is different, yielding better overall health care at a lower cost.

This study compares severity of illness and length of hospital stay for patients admitted for diabetes mellitus, cholecystitis, or appendicitis at three teaching hospitals in Italy, Japan, and the United States. Physicians caring for patients with these diseases were surveyed to assess their opinions of the adequacy of resources available at their hospital, perceived administrative pressures concerning resource use, and interactions with patients and their families that relate to admission and discharge decisions. The severity of the patient mix was consistently higher in the U.S. hospital than in the Italian or Japanese hospitals. Controlling for diagnosis, severity of illness, surgery, age, and presence of co-morbid conditions, the U.S. hospital consistently had the shortest stays and the Japanese hospital the longest. Japanese physicians were more likely than U.S. or Italian physicians to report insufficient resources, such as nurses, to provide quality care, but less likely to report administrative pressures interfering with patient care. Differences in hospital utilization may reflect variation in clinical practices, availability of resources, barriers to access to care, organizational differences at the national and hospital level, and patient and family preferences.",

This is especially true for publicly funded hospitals whose medical and social mission is often broader than that of private sector facilities for which insurance-based claim review is most relevant. To further address this issue, we used sequential sets (1994 and 1995) of InterQual Intensity, Severity, and Discharge criteria to assess a cohort of patients referred to our Veterans Affairs facility as acute care admissions between December 1, 1994, and February 28, 1995. We found that the appropriateness rate for the subset of medical admissions dropped from 88% when using the 1994 criteria set to 49% when using the more stringent 1995 criteria set (P < 0.001). We conclude that substantive changes to previously validated criteria sets require revalidation. Furthermore, consideration should be given to the role that insurance-based utilization review should play in publicly funded hospital systems.",

This study analyzed 66,107 and 1291 records of payments made for 50,396 physicians and 1218 nurses, respectively, from 1994 through 1998, to describe characteristics, trends, and risk factors of malpractice payment for physicians and nurses. The median payments, more often settlements paid by insurance companies than judgments in courts of law, were higher for physicians than for nurses. Mean payments were higher for residents than for nonresident physicians; median payments for residents were slightly lower than other physicians when adjusted for number of providers included in the payment. On the state level, correlation analyses suggested a significant positive association between the nurse rate of malpractice payments that were made and median per capita income, number of physicians per 1000 residents, and number of attorneys per 1000 residents; analysis revealed a significant negative association between this rate and the percentage of residents residing in rural areas and the number of nurses per 1000 residents. Although findings suggested that payment trends remained stable, there was great regional variation in the risk of malpractice payment for both physicians and nurses. The physician risk ranged from a low of 0.73% per physician per year in Alabama to a high of 3.7% in Wyoming, and the nurse risk ranged from a low of 0% per nurse per year in Vermont to a high of 0.075% in the District of Columbia. If the quality of health care provided by physicians and nurses does not vary geographically in the United States, then such a great discrepancy seems to challenge the notion that the risk of malpractice litigation consistently promotes the quality of health care.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients may be exposed to unique safety threats as a result of the complexity of interhospital and intrahospital transitions involving the emergency department (ED). Real-time surveys were administered to clinicians in the ED and neuroscience intensive care unit of a tertiary health care system to assess perceptions of handoff safety and quality in transitions involving critically ill neurologic patients. In all, 115 clinical surveys were conducted among 26 patient transfers. Among all clinician types, 1 in 5 respondents felt the handoff process was inadequate. Risks to patient safety during the transfer process were reported by 1 in 3 of respondents. Perceived risks were reported more frequently by nurses (44%) than physicians/advanced practice providers (28%). Real-time survey methodology appears to be a feasible and valuable, albeit resource intensive, tool to identify safety risks, expose barriers to communication, and reveal challenges not captured by traditional approaches to inform multidisciplinary quality improvement efforts.",

Using in-context interviews with HSLs and parents, the authors investigated what new decisions and actions benchmarking using data mined from the EHR may enable and how benchmarking information should be presented to be most informative. Results demonstrate that although parents may have little experience using data on health care quality for decision making, they affirmed its potential value. HSLs expressed the need for high-confidence, validated metrics. They also perceived barriers to achieving meaningful metrics but recognized that mining data directly from the EHR could overcome those barriers.

Hierarchical mixed models were used to analyze data from 276 316 patients attributed to 4373 clinicians in 31 primary care clinics from 2015 to 2017. Reliability was lower for all metrics at the clinician level (range 6%-64%) than at the clinic level (84%-99%), with little variation related to patient or clinician characteristics. Few clinicians, but the majority of clinics, contributed sufficient volumes of patient encounters to meet a 70% reliability threshold.

The authors analyzed career outcomes from 6 years of the Health Innovations Scholars Program (HISP) to better understand how the program affected the 46 graduates’ future involvement in health system transformation and leadership. Eighty-eight percent of the graduates remained involved in quality improvement, 70% held leadership positions, 31% participated in health innovation, and 15% participated in patient safety initiatives. Project involvement of the graduates represented both primary and secondary catalysts for health system change, leading to 28 unique catalyst events. HISP is a model for directing trainees’ career trajectory toward engagement in health system leadership and redesign.",

    "abstract": "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, the ever-evolving landscape of health care braces for another shift in the reimbursement paradigm. As health care costs continue to rise, providers are pressed to deliver efficient, high-quality care at flat to minimally increasing rates. Inherent systemwide inefficiencies between payers and providers at various clinical settings pose a daunting task for enhancing collaboration and care coordination. A change from Medicare's fee-for-service reimbursement model to bundled payments offers one avenue for resolution. Pilots using such payment models have realized varying degrees of success, leading to the development and upcoming implementation of a bundled payment initiative led by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Delivery integration is critical to ensure high-quality care at affordable costs across the system. Providers and payers able to adapt to the newly proposed models of payment will benefit from achieving cost reductions and improved patient outcomes and realize a competitive advantage.",

    "abstract": "Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) are all too common and often fatal events. To estimate the number of preventable CLABSIs, the authors analyzed SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) and the number of CLABSI data from Hospital Compare. Several studies have suggested that an SIR of 0.35 may be achievable. If all institutions were able to perform at this level, then almost 50% of CLABSI would be prevented. Introduction: Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections are all too common and often fatal events. Unfortunately using the latest available data, it can be argued that the medical industry has not done nearly enough to implement effective safety protocols and checklists designed to prevent these infections. A National Benchmark was set using CLABSI data gathered between 2006 and 2008 before prevention protocols were implemented in the vast majority of institutions. Using this data, the average performance was used to calculate Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) and a National Benchmark was set which reflected average performance as a SIR of 1.0. Umscheild, et al. estimated in 2011 that as many as 65 to 70% of CLABSIs are preventable, which would define obtainable performance of facilities to have an SIR of between 0.30 to 0.35. Similar reductions were observed in the Keystone project. In a separate analysis, Saman, et al. used more recent CLABSI data and found the peak of the SIR distribution curve at 0.35 and advocated that this more accurately reflects the Obtainable SIR. Arguably, the current National Benchmark is an example of using old standards to define current performance. Methods: To estimate the number of preventable cases, a dataset was downloaded from Hospital Compare which was comprised of CLABSIs that occurred in Hospital ICUs during a data collection period of 7/1/2011 to 6/30/2012. To be included in the analysis a hospital had to have at least one predicted CLABSIs using the National Benchmark of 1.0. 1899 facilities were included in the analysis, 1135 had an SIR of greater than 0.35. The total number of Preventable Cases (PC) was then calculated from the number of Observed Cases (OC) in all facilities whose SIR was above that of the Obtainable SIR, using the following equation: PC = OC – [(Obtainable SIR/Facility’s SIR) * OC ] Three estimations of the obtainable SIR were used *Health Watch USA, Eastern Kentucky University, Essentia Institute of Rural Health, Corresponding Author: Kevin T Kavanagh, MD, MS Email: healthwatchusa@gmail.com Table 1: Estimation of the Number of Preventable Cases in Hospital ICUs out of the 10799 CLABSIs observed in ICUs between 7/1/2011 to 6/30/2012 Source of SIR SIR Preventable Cases National Benchmark Data – (2006 to 2008) 1.000 990 (9.2%) Average SIR 2011 Data (7/1/11 to 6/30/2012) 0.594 1128 (10.4%) Peak of the Curve SIR Data (1/1/11 to 12/1/2011) 0.350 5240 (48.5%) in this study. The first was the National Benchmark (SIR = 1.0), the average SIR of the Dataset (0.594) and the Obtainable SIR of 0.35. Results: The results shown in Table 1 revealed that almost 50% of the CLABSI could be prevented if facilities performed at the Obtainable SIR of 0.35. This represents 5240 patients and at a fatality rate up to 25%, or 1310 potential lives lost. Discussion: Wise, et al., estimated that in 2010 there were 15,000 CLABSIs in hospital ICUs, mainly at medium and large teaching hospitals. A targeted approach was suggested to achieve further reductions in central line infections. Our analysis also indicates that substantial improvement is still needed to prevent CLABSIs. In the 12 month period ending on June 30, 2012, there were 10799 CLABSIs in hospital ICUs that were reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network. It can be argued that almost half of these infections were preventable. Some in the healthcare industry have argued that this large variation is due to differences in reporting and definitions. However, this factor should be mitigated, since CLABSIs are now reported through the National Healthcare Safety Network, which has rigorous definitions and standards for how adverse events are reported. In addition, Saman, et al.(7) have shown that high SIRs for CLABSIs in Intensive Care Units are correlated with facility wide patient safety measures found on CMS’s Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey, which may indicate problems in the culture of safety at the institution. In addition, over the last decade institutions have been treating and billing for these events, if there are existing problems with event diagnosis this would represent a significant failure of our healthcare system. The question which must be asked is can we do better and further improve our current results?",

After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in provider attitudes about or participation in quality improvement activities between safety-net and non–safety-net physicians. However, safety-net providers were almost twice as likely to look for racial/ethnic disparities in care within their practices and are as likely to be involved in quality improvement activities as non–safety-net providers; their attitudes are consistent with providing equitable and universal care. Increasing access by expanding Medicaid eligibility will require continued investment in the number and training of safety-net PCPs.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that predictive accuracy of acuity models flattens when more than 10 variables are used. The authors hypothesized that the exclusion of laboratory data would produce a reliable predictive model. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set from 2005 to 2008 was reviewed. Logistic regression was used to develop models from 86 preoperative variables to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality. Models were compared by measuring area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values that then were analyzed with unpaired t test. As the number of variables decreased, the change in the AUROC for mortality and morbidity were not statistically significant for 10- and 5-variable models. Although the AUROC for acuity models decreased slightly for morbidity and mortality when laboratory values were excluded, these changes were not statistically significant. This study shows that models developed to predict surgical outcomes can achieve similar predictive accuracy without laboratory data.",

Director, Missouri Department of Health, the first \"right do die\" case to be decided by the United States Supreme Court, constitutionalizes the principle of patient self-determination. The case encourages competent patients to reflect thoughtfully about the possibility that one day they may be inca pacitated just as Nancy Beth Cruzan was and to pre pare for that possibility by completing an advance directive. Furthermore, the recently enacted Patient Self-Determination Act requires hospitals to ask adult patients upon admission whether they have ad vance directives. However, a number of practical concerns arise for physicians about operationalizing these patient self-determination principles within their states and their scopes of practice. Will physi cians be prosecuted for \"assisting suicides\" if they withdraw feeding tubes or forgo other life-sustaining treatments? Will physicians be liable in medical mal practice for \"undertreatment\" or \"overtreatment\" in such cases? Will physicians be asked to violate their own moral codes in treating patients? Will others intrude into the traditional physician-patient rela tionship and decision-making process? Will physi cians be caught in the middle of troublesome family, staff, and institutional disputes? How will phy sicians learn of patients' advance directives? Will physicians be asked to continue care in futile cases? Will Cruzan's self-determination doctrine be improperly ex tended ? Successful implementation of patient self- determination principles will require consideration and discussion of these practical physician concerns.",

Data are presented for mothers undergoing 7322 deliveries from 1997-1998 at a large academic medical center with a cesarean birth rate of 15.9%. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of cesarean delivery controlled for maternal age, 10 risk factors identified through ICD-9 coding, and 3 additional clinical variables (nulliparity, birth weight, and gestational age) derived from a perinatal (birth certificate) database. All risk factors were significant predictors of cesarean birth, producing an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.86 and a 60-fold increase in cesarean delivery from highest to lowest deciles of predicted risk.

The results suggested that immunizations present an opportunity cost during well-child visits.

Patients, health care providers, and industry sponsors were provided with incentives to participate. The participants included the practitioners and patients in medical and surgical practices who used Project Quality Card (patent pending) and the Practice Improvement Program. The study subjects were convenience samples of new and established patients seen between September 1999 and December 2000. There were 3 different pilot projects: QC1, QC2, and QC3. Patients were provided with a 20-minute prepaid phone card as an incentive for completing an interactive voice response call. Patients answered the 9-item visit rating questionnaire used to measure patient satisfaction. Patients responded on a 5-point scale, with 5 being excellent, and responses were totaled in the categories of patient access and physician attributes and in an overall score for the visit. A total of 998 patients from 77 physician offices participated. The activation responses, or percentage of patients using the Quality Cards, ranged from 12.8% in group 2 (QC2) to 26.6% in group 1 (QC1) to 34.8% in group 3 (QC3). This study demonstrates that incentivized digital outcomes collection can be successfully implemented in multisite community-based medical and surgical offices. The use of Project Quality Card (interactive voice response technology) and the Practice Improvement Program provides opportunities for user-friendly, benchmarked, real-time data collection. The percentage of patient activations is linked to provider participation in quality improvement programs. Patient participation is improved as the frequency of contact with a peer-directed database increases.",

Approximately 27% (n = 408), 41% (n = 643), and 26% (n = 515) of the study patients had poor glycemic, renal function, and lipid control, respectively. Significant differences (P < .05) in poor HbA1c and creatinine clearance rates between the clinics were observed after adjusting for patient case-mix. No differences between the clinics in cholesterol levels were observed after adjusting for patient case-mix. Overall, these clinics performed well in process of care measures, except for foot screening. After adjusting for patient case-mix, significant disparities between the clinics were observed with respect to glycemic control and renal function measures, whereas differences were nullified with respect to cardiovascular outcome measure.",

The Truman Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) undertook an initiative implementing HRO principles and assessed for impact on burnout metrics. This became known as the Transformative HRO Initiative Via Employee Engagement (THRIVE 2 ) model. THRIVE 2 consisted of Just Culture training, Clinical Team Training, and continuous process improvement through Lean. Truman VAMC was compared with other Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) facilities regarding burnout and employee satisfaction metrics. Truman VAMC saw significant changes in multiple HRO metrics ( P &lt; 0.001) as well as improvements in work group psychological safety and employee exhaustion ( P &lt; 0.001). High burnout rates decreased by 52% (6.2%–2.95%; P &lt; 0.001). Truman VAMC went from 75th to the No. 1 ranked VHA facility regarding Best Places to Work. These findings have significant national policy implications given the effects of burnout.",

More than 116,000 transfer request calls were processed. Of these, about 65% (75,000) were accepted for ED evaluation or direct admission. Of the 75,000 patients, >50% were accepted as direct admits. Among patients accepted for direct admission, a trend toward reduced utilization of ED reevaluation at the receiving facility was noted from 2016 to 2018. A temporal trend of overall reduced ED utilization reflects the adeptness of the transfer center. An effective transfer center promotes value-based care, optimizes the workflow in a hospital, and augments hospital administrative decisions to allocate resources.",

A cross-sectional analysis of 11 866 SNFs in the United States compared 30-day rehospitalization rates of SNFs that consistently provided more rehabilitation therapy to other SNFs using linear regression models. High-billing SNFs were defined as the 10% of SNFs with the highest proportions of Medicare fee-for-service claims that just surpassed the therapy minute threshold for the highest payment category. After controlling for patient and facility characteristics, high-billing SNFs had higher 30-day rehospitalization rates as well as longer median length of stay and greater mean cost per stay. Small reductions in the amount of therapy provided are unlikely to increase 30-day rehospitalization rates in SNFs. This has important consequences for the recently implemented patient-driven payment model, which incentivizes SNFs to provide less rehabilitation therapy.",

Proposals must address 2 central issues: How to apportion stakeholder accountability and how to measure increased value (returns for resources spent). This article argues that incentives can be created for increasing coordination by specifying accountability for the 4 basic types of health care encounter defined in this article. Payment design can be used to identify units of service that are sufficiently narrow to give a transparent understanding of the type of care rendered but with the capacity for aggregation to describe the process as a whole. Transparency is defined as the use of categorical or rules-based models such as Diagnosis Related Groups. Payment systems can use a building block approach for each of the 4 types of health care encounter so as to encourage improved coordination of health care services.",

In 2013, California safety net hospitals participating in the waiver set a voluntary performance target (the 90th percentile for Medicare preferred provider organization plans) for mammography screening and cholesterol control in diabetes. They did not reach the target, and the difference-in-differences analysis suggested that there was no difference for mammography (P = .39) and low-density lipoprotein control (P = .11) performance compared to measures for which no statewide quality improvement initiative existed. California’s Medicaid waiver was associated with improved performance on a number of metrics, but this performance was not attributable to target setting on specific health conditions. Performance may have improved because of secular trends or systems improvements related to waiver funding. Relying on condition-specific targets to measure performance may underestimate improvements and disadvantage certain health systems. Achieving ambitious targets likely requires sustained fiscal, management, and workforce investments.",

Clinical pathways are a subtype of clinical decision support tool which aim to link evidence to practice and which require evaluation of benefits and barriers to use to inform user-centered design. The objective was to describe the use and perceived benefits and barriers to evidence-based, disease-specific electronic health record pathways for clinical decision support. Primary care providers at a large integrated health system were surveyed about their use of clinical pathways using an online questionnaire distributed via email in November 2021. Descriptive statistics were estimated and differences in the characteristics and responses by pathway use were assessed using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. The survey response rate was 26% (153/593). There were differences in the response rates between providers by practice type (42% academic versus 54% community; P < 0.001). No difference was found in the demographics of those that used the pathways versus those that did not according to role, age, or length of time in practice. Providers in the academic practice were more likely than those in community practices to have used the pathways. Among providers who used the pathways, 98% agree they have evidence-based information, 98% agree they allow them to take better care of patients, 88% agree they guide clinical-decisions, and 85% agree they save time. The main barrier for those who had used pathways was that they forget about them. Among those who had not used pathways, 35% were unaware that pathways existed. This analysis demonstrates that primary care providers who adopt clinical pathways perceive benefits in several domains. The largest barriers to adoption were that users forgot about pathways or were unaware of them. Future work should focus on dissemination and education, improving tool accessibility, and content optimization to balance complexity with efficiency.",

Care episodes limited to lumbar fusions were retrospectively reviewed on the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) reimbursement database at a single academic institution. Total episode of care cost was also collected. A multivariable linear regression model was developed to identify independent risk factors for increased total episode of care cost, and logistic models for surgical complications and readmission. A total of 500 Medicare patients were included. Risk factors associated with increased total episode of care cost included transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) and anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) (β = $5,399, P < 0.001) and ALIF+PLF (AP) fusions (β = $24,488, P < 0.001), levels fused (β = $3,989, P < 0.001), congestive heart failure (β = $6,161, P = 0.022), hypertension with end-organ damage (β = $10,138, P < 0.001), liver disease (β = $16,682, P < 0.001), inpatient complications (β = $4,548, P = 0.001), 90-day complications (β = $10,012, P = 0.001), and 90-day readmissions (β = $15,677, P < 0.001).

Ten examples are listed, illustrating key questions regarding misdiagnosis. A system for tracking admitting diagnosis revision is presented as a primitive diagnosis tracking prototype. An automated system is required to generalize this system to a longitudinal outpatient setting. The perils in the implementation of diagnosis tracking include the potential for fear-inducing punitive application, tampering with appropriate diagnostic strategies due to failure to distinguish common from special cause variation, and the affixing of \"price tags\" to diagnoses. The latter is an especially worrisome side effect of market-driven health reform, and threatens the success of the project.",

    "abstract": "Elements of meaningful health care reform must include the ability of patients, providers, and payers to select services offering quality care at an afforda ble price. To achieve this goal, an appropriate defi nition of quality needs to be articulated and adopted; data capturing the definition needs to be collected; and appropriate measures need to be selected to ana lyze that data. Results need to be publically available to assist in making informed choices. The health professions need to fulfill their social contract. And, government needs to ensure that public safety and accountability are maintained and preserved. While the goals and strategies of the different players in the health care arena may be different, there is one thing in common—the needs of citizens must be met through the provision of available, accessible, qual ity, equitable, and cost-effective health care. These values need to be incorporated into a reform plan. Currently, our ability to comprehensively, consist ently, and uniformly perform these tasks is severely limited. While many diverse factors, such as the lim itation of financial support and the lack of uniform information systems, contribute to this situation, we believe it is possible through the implementation of a series of recommendations to achieve these goals. This paper outlines the current situation, reviews insights derived from the literature and past and current experiences. Recommendations are made that apply equally to health reform efforts at the state and/or federal levels.",

    "abstract": "Effective discharge planning should serve to reduce length of stay (LOS) and lower readmission rates. A com bined prospective/retrospective study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of anticipated discharge order forms in decreasing LOS for staff pediatric patients. Resident physicians provided advance notice of the planned discharge date to nursing staff and patient fam ily members. Patient selection was random, and the data were collected prospectively. These subjects were matched with patients for whom the order form was not used, and the data was collected retrospectively. Matching variables included: diagnosis, age, gender, race, and method of payment. There were 103 matched pairs. LOS was collapsed into low and high categories. There was a significant difference when comparing subject groups (χ2 = 8.5; P = 0.005). Whereas only 14% of experimental patients were categorized as high LOS, 32% of control patients were classified as such. Physician prediction of discharge date helped decrease patient LOS.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to mea sure the quality of care (Q) at two admission units in a state psychiatric hospital, each unit having two treat ment teams, one led by a permanent (PM) staff physi cian, and one led by various locum tenens (LT) physicians. An LT physician's tour of duty (TOD) averaged approx imately 30 days. Over nearly a 2½-year period the four treatment teams received 744 admissions. Our previous research has reported measuring Q using percent accu rate prediction of hospital length-of-stay (LOS), divided by a measure of severity of patient illness. We calculated Q for each treatment team's test set of patients using a trained ANN for each team. All the teams' test sets were run through each of the trained ANNs resulting in a set of four Q values for each ANN. We defined the standard deviation of Qs resulting from a single team's test set run through it own as well as the other three teams' ANNs as representative of the \"diversity\" of the patients in that test set. We defined the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the Qs resulting from each of the teams' test sets run through a single team's ANN as that team's \"ro bustness.\" The product of \"robustness\" times \"diver sity\" was defined as the value (V) of the treatment team. The V of the PM physician-led teams was 1.9 times that of the LT physician-led teams. We normalized V for pa tient entropy (uncertainty) with a metric called the \"risk ratio\" (RR), derived from Boltzmann's law. This resulted in the V/RR of one PM physician-led team as superior, de spite treating patients with the highest risk. The LT physi cian-led teams, despite having fewer patients afflicted with the more problematic diagnosis of schizophrenia, were handicapped by not having preexisting therapeu tic relationships with their patients, giving both LT teams low robustness. There was no statistically significant dif ference in patient LOS between the teams. Because the greatest change in team composition was due to LT physi cians, we assumed that the differences in V/RR were due to the short (30-day) TOD and not to any skill deficits in the LT physicians. This article explores a new para digm which compares the value of patient care in sepa rate delivery systems despite differences in severity of illness, case-mix, and uncertainty associated with an im perfect therapeutic environment.",

While each of these strategies has measurable benefits, each comes along with additional costs. As more and more technology becomes available and more labor resources are devoted to these efforts, it becomes crucial to be able to assess the costs and benefits of these programs. A return-on-investment methodology is used to assess the financial impact of service-related operating expenses compared to revenue gains from service delivery. However, unlike traditional return-on-investment models, in health care, benefits are frequently gained from cost avoidance rather than from revenue enhancement activities.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of risk adjustment in improving mortality as a performance measure for hospitals remains uncertain. New techniques of risk adjustment should be empirically tested, and health care professionals, using the data derived from such measures, should be queried before final acceptance of these technologies of measurement is warranted. The Risk Adjusted Clinical Outcomes Methodology-Quality Measures (RACOM-QM), a relatively new risk-adjustment methodology developed by the QuadraMed Corporation, was used by Maryland hospitals for risk adjustment for the first time in 1997. A research study was undertaken by the Maryland Hospital Association to determine the impact of RACOM-QM on mortality rates, its empirical validity, and its acceptance in the field. The relationship between RACOM-QM mean risk scores and mortality rates was examined using inpatient hospital mortality data for Maryland in 1996. Using these same data, the empirical relationship between risk-adjusted and unadjusted mortality by diagnosis-related group (DRG) was also investigated. Case studies were undertaken to glean information about the use and acceptability of this new methodology in 2 hospital settings in Maryland. There was a strong relationship between mean mortality risk scores and mortality rates. The analysis of the empirical relationship between risk-adjusted and unadjusted mortality by DRG yielded support for the impact of RACOM-QM in adjusting inpatient mortality rates. The case studies supported the utility of this method of risk adjustment in increasing the interpretation of mortality data and in helping to identify areas in which to investigate quality in more depth in 2 hospital settings. This study provides overall support for the usefulness of risk adjustment and, specifically, the RACOM-QM, in increasing the interpretation of inpatient mortality rates in Maryland's acute care hospitals. This study also suggests that use of the RACOM-QM improved comparative analysis of inpatient mortality rates among Maryland hospitals. Finally, the results of the case study analysis suggest that improved internal review of mortality rates and increased clinician acceptance of these rates as indicators of performance were enhanced by the use of a risk adjustment methodology.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates a new method of measuring quality of care. Taking place at a tertiary psychiatric hospital with 5,128 admissions from January 1989 through December 1995, this study uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict hospital length-of-stay (LOS) and uses the standard deviation of LOS in a formula to measure quality of care, Q. ANNs are trained with data using unique patient identifiers and are compared with identical ANNs trained without these identifiers. These two types of ANNs make a LOS prediction, P, with a slightly different accuracies, and this fact is exploited in measuring Q. The authors defined U as the standard deviation of the difference between the actual and the predicted LOS of the ANNs with unique patient identifiers, and defined G as the standard deviation of the difference between the actual and the predicted LOS of the ANNs without using these unique identifiers. Dividing U, the variation of individual LOS patterns intertwined with systemic LOS patterns, by G, the variation of predominately systemic LOS patterns, yields the ratio U/G, in which systemic effects are factored out leaving a measure of the average severity of patient illness. Ratios that exceed unity are seen in the patients who are more severely ill. The formula for quality of care, Q, divides the best LOS prediction accuracy, P, which is inversely proportional to overall variation in the delivery system, by U/G, which is inversely proportional to quality of care, written as: Q = P/(U/G). Q reflects the patients' perspective because LOS is concrete and tangible to patients. The study took place during hospital downsizing (political change), a consent decree (policy change), new administrative and medical personnel (staffing change), and the introduction of clozapine and risperidone for schizophrenia (therapeutic change). These events had a predominantly positive impact on Q. The value of Q correlated well with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) triennial evaluations. Some conclusions that emerged from this study: 1) System variation, reflected in the standard deviation of LOS, increased with frequent changes in top management. 2) There was a clear-cut beneficial effect of clozapine, and to a lesser extent of risperidone in schizophrenia, allowing more community placement. 3) With a dedicated professional staff quality of care can prevail despite increasing variation in LOS (systemic problems). 4) The number of hospital employees per Q unit halved when the overall hospital Q ranged from low to high values as a result of policy and staffing improvements, suggesting an increased efficiency of operation. 5) Q can be an objective outcome measure of quality care from the patients' perspective.",

The survey focused on GHb testing methods, analytes measured, reference ranges, awareness of and adherence to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) standards, and recent changes in methods. We contacted 30 (81%) of 37 laboratories known to conduct GHb testing. Among the 25 laboratories using 1 or more test methods in-house, 5 (20%) reported only total GHb levels rather than HbA1C. There was considerable variability in test methods used and in reported high and low reference ranges within and across methods. Eight (30%) of 27 individual methods used by the laboratories were not certified by the NGSP. From January 1997 through August 1998, 11 of 25 laboratories (44%) made changes in testing methods. Despite national efforts to decrease variability in GHb testing methods, substantial variability remained in Washington state in 1997. In addition to hindering management of individual patients, this variability poses challenges for clinical performance measurement systems such as the Health Plan and Employer Data Information Set that attempt to compare the adequacy of glycemic control among health systems. However, the high frequency of recent changes in testing methods may indicate an improving trend in test methods.",

This essay presents a number of \"pearls\" gleaned from successful senior clinician managers who have learned to relate to senior management and advance in their careers. This commentary was developed from research and a presentation of the same title delivered at the American College of Medical Quality Annual Meeting held in Las Vegas in October, 2001. It is important that medical directors who work with financial managers convert quality concepts into \"business value\" concepts. Talking in the language of business, rather than the language of doctors, makes it much easier to communicate with management (although some translation is often in order). As a clinician presenting to financial managers, you should become familiar with financial terms and how they are used. Indeed, the development of a financial model representing clinical activity results in the highest level of success. There are a number of methods for estimating impact that have been found within general business and health services research areas that are acceptable. Successful presenters of information approach their task effectively. Reports are in a more readable format and convey information for action by the corporation rather than as a scholarly treatise. Approaching senior management, one must consider the psychology of individuals in senior positions. Senior medical executives who are successful report similar approaches to their tasks, and offer helpful insight into career advancement.",

Overall, hospital scores showed low implementation of a structure that supports improvement efforts. All survey domains showed acceptable psychometric results.

    "abstract": "There now appears to be considerable interest in providing health administration education to physicians. Although we agree with this new interest, it may be useful to explore the reasons why this education would be helpful to clinicians. To date, there have been limited actual initiatives in this area. Certainly, the offering of seminars and workshops to physicians locally and nationally is not new. However, with increasing governmental interest in health system reform and new systemwide interest in quality of care, it is vital for physicians to understand management and policy. Of course, an important barrier to successfully providing this information to clinicians is the current workload of physicians, both those in employment and those in private practice. There is barely time during the week to complete required patient care duties. We might think, then, that the place to start is in academic medical centers where physicians receive their primary training before entering clinical service as practitioners. For many years, there have been proposals to integrate health administration and policy into the medical school curriculum. Most often, however, these proposals have not been successful because of the competition for curriculum time. Given choices, medical school faculty have elected to emphasize the science of medicine. Although this is certainly an appropriate choice, there is increasing interest in introducing management and policy information to physicians in training, and now there are some interesting experiments in finding ways to achieve these goals. Why would we stretch our scarce curricular resource— time—to do this? There are at least 5 reasons. Leadership and management. We increasingly recognize that there is a need for clinical professionals to move to the forefront of institutional leadership. Just as in the science of medicine, we now recognize that the information involved in management and policy is greater than can be absorbed in a weekend of preparation for a leadership position. At many academic medical centers and in many community hospitals, health care executives recognize that tomorrow’s leaders should have some formal training in health care management and policy formulation. Design involvement. Physicians have frequently talked about their exclusion from strategic and organizational design discussions. When they are included, they are most often represented in a token way by a limited number of colleagues. But to successfully design the health care delivery system of the future, physicians will need to be fully educated about organization behavior, strategy, and outcomes management. The system of the future will require improvements in access, quality of care, and cost control. Meaningful involvement in this continuing redesign process means that physicians must have an understanding of organization theory, policymaking processes, economics and finance, and information systems at the least. In order for their design involvement to be productive and rewarding, clinicians must be educated appropriately. Negotiation. Physicians frequently complain that they have come out poorly in negotiations with health plans, hospitals, and insurers. Negotiation is a skill that is part of the management and policy package.",

The team applied this method to 2 areas that were identified as opportunities for improvement. The projects included increasing compliance with deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in a hospital unit, and the administration of pneumococcal vaccinations on another unit. Compliance was 100% by the end of the initial measurement period. Improvements made to protocols and processes during the course of the projects have been extended successfully throughout the hospital. In response to the positive feedback and results, MMC created a similar system for teaching and implementing rapid-cycle QI and has applied it to additional projects with success.",

Prior research acknowledges the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) as a tool for performance and outcomes improvement. However, these studies lack empirical evidence of performance trends across medical homes. A retrospective observational study was conducted to describe national trends in National Committee for Quality Assurance PCMH recognition for more than 23 000 primary care practices across the United States from 2008 to 2017. More than half of recognized practices scored 100% pass rates for activities related to appointment availability, patient care planning, and data for population management. The most common underperforming PCMH activities were for practice team, referral tracking and follow-up, and quality improvement implementation. Study findings indicate that patient-centered care collaboration between clinical and nonclinical team members, primary care provider coordination with specialty care providers, and practice implementation of clinical quality improvement methodologies are particularly challenging activities.",

Factors that contribute to greater use include providing data that participants view as actionable, some type of accountability for performance, robust learning support, participants having resources to work with the data, and soliciting ongoing feedback about the data and related learning needs. Factors that discourage data uptake include time lag, lack of aggregated multi-payer data, exclusion of data for sensitive diagnoses, and small sample sizes.

ACCP safety depends on making appropriate triage decisions from patients' reports during phone calls about whether paramedics could care for patients' urgent needs or whether they require emergency department (ED) services. Furthermore, after ACCP paramedics are on scene, patients may nonetheless need ED care if their urgent health problems are not adequately treated by the paramedic's interventions. To train clinical staff participating in all aspects of ACCP, including these triage decisions, ACCP clinical leaders developed brief vignettes: 27 represented initial ACCP triage decisions and 10 the subsequent decision to send patients to EDs. This report describes findings from an online survey completed by 24 clinical staff involved with ACCP triage. Clinical vignettes could be useful for staff training and quality control in such paramedic initiatives.",

This improvement initiative focused on creating cultural change through goal alignment, visual management, and empowering frontline employees. Data included 113 133 encounters. Cochran-Armitage tests and X-bar charting compared wait times during the CI initiative. Odds of waiting <15 minutes increased in both phase 2 (odds ratio = 3.57, 95% confidence interval = [3.43-3.71]) and phase 3 (odds ratio = 5.39, 95% confidence interval = [5.07, 5.74]). At 3 years follow-up, 95% of wait times were <15 minutes. Productivity increased from 519 to 644 patients/full-time equivalent/month; 33/42 Press Ganey employee engagement components significantly improved. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a culture of CI approach to sustain wait time improvement in outpatient laboratory services, and should be considered for application in other areas of health care quality.",

Quantitative studies often found that different decisions would be reached depending on the clinical recommendation followed.

Urethral catheters were associated with sepsis for medical patients but not for surgical patients.

It would be advantageous for Alabama physicians to become more knowledgeable about ACOs in the case that they become a more predominant form of care delivery in the future.",

    "abstract": "Academic departments of medicine (ADOM) can provide an important vehicle to drive the sharing and dissemination of best practices in clinical care delivery. With the increased focus on improving the patient experience, particularly in the ambulatory setting, ADOM also should lead efforts to cultivate improvements in this arena. To address this need, the study ADOM established a Patient Experience Working Group (PEWG) that brought together physician and nonphysician leaders, set improvement goals, and created a structure for sharing and learning. Since initiation, the PEWG has implemented more than 20 performance improvement initiatives, which have resulted in measured positive changes at both the local practice settings and department-wide. Striking the right balance between top-down governance, bottom-up innovation and ownership, and shared goal setting was a key to success. This model is one that could easily be adopted by other ADOM in their own efforts to improve the patient experience.",

    "abstract": "Risk-adjusted institutional transfusion rates are not currently available on a national level. A surrogate means of benchmarking transfusion practices to use for internal quality improvement was studied. Blood utilization was prospectively studied among all colorectal surgery patients at the study institution (July 2010-November 2012), and these data were benchmarked with transfusion data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database by hospital type and size. Using NSQIP, the study institution's colorectal surgery transfusion rate was 16.3% (150/920 cases), which was slightly higher than the 14.3% national mean transfusion rate (12 191/85 507 cases; P = .08). When broken down by hospital type and size, the study hospital had a similar rate of blood transfusion compared with academic hospitals (P = .35) but a significantly higher rate than community hospitals, regardless of patient volume (P = .03). Benchmarking blood utilization compared with similar-type hospitals using NSQIP may be a surrogate method to assess adherence to evidence-based transfusion guidelines and identify areas for structured quality improvement initiatives.",

Reasoning that a rounding program with nonclinicians could enhance (1) understanding of the organization's clinical mission, (2) appreciation of caregivers' roles, and (3) engagement, the authors created such a program. From 2010 to 2013, 51 nonclinicians within the Cleveland Clinic Education Institute participated; 14 submitted written reflections, and 27 responded to a survey about their experience. Overall, 12 themes emerged that suggest an enhanced familiarity with the institution and increased engagement and alignment with its mission. Notably, the results align with a long-standing focus on organizational engagement and an observed increase in mean engagement scores since the program was implemented.",

Prevention of in-hospital VTE, thus, has become a major quality improvement initiative within hospitals.

The authors of this study retrospectively evaluated VTE prophylaxis on transfer from medical inpatient settings to long-term care facilities. Analysis indicated that on transfer to other facilities, VTE prophylaxis recommendations were not routinely documented. Interfacility communication is crucial to ensure that appropriate prophylaxis recommendations are addressed during transitions of care. New processes evaluating VTE prophylaxis recommendations at the time of care transfer warrant further study.",

This system informally promoted \"lean\" principles of waste identification and continuous improvement. In all, 154 issues were submitted between March 30, 2011, and June 30, 2012, and categorized as closely as possible into lean categories of operational waste; 131 issues were completely addressed with the requested outcome partially or fully implemented or with successful clarification of existing policies. A real-time, voluntary reporting system can effectively capture trainee observations of waste in health care and training processes, give trainees a voice in a hierarchical system, and lead to meaningful operations improvement.",

To paraphrase their question, what if there was a connection between the job satisfaction of the members of a primary care team and the quality of care they provided? And if there were such a connection, what kinds of policy and/or managerial interventions might be developed to increase team members’ satisfaction in service of helping improve quality? Might we, for example, be able to improve quality by changing certain attributes of the environment in which the teams work or certain things about the ways in which teams are composed—things that may influence job satisfaction? At a time when the search for ways to improve quality is a high priority in Washington and when experiments with paying for performance are becoming increasingly widespread, the question the authors raise has, perhaps, more potential relevance than they fully appreciate. That said, there are 3 issues that must be addressed before we get too excited about the potential:",

Interventions included statewide education on quality improvement strategies and community-specific technical assistance on collaboration approaches, data collection and analysis, and selection and implementation of interventions. Fifteen communities, comprising 16 acute care hospitals, 119 nursing homes, 70 home health agencies, and 32 other health care or social service providers, actively participated over a 4.5-year period. Challenges included problems with end-of-life discussions (80.0%), physician engagement (70.0%), staffing (70.0%), and communication between settings (60.0%). Thirty-day all-cause readmission rates in fee-for-service Medicare patients decreased in most hospital service areas across the state (22/24), and the aggregate statewide readmission rate dropped from 15.2/1000 to 12.1/1000, a relative decrease of 20.3% ( P < .001). Despite these positive findings, the specific impact of this collaboration could not be determined because of multiple confounding interventions.",

The PCA framework showed acceptable expert-assessed content validity, with content validity index scores ranging from 0.74 (community engagement) to 0.97 (leadership). The PCA instrument comprised several scales grouped into 7 domains with Cronbach α scores from 0.83 (leadership) to 0.95 (patient and family engagement). The PCA framework provides a valid construct to help ambulatory practices understand contextual issues that might influence QI projects.

Never before has the need been so great to improve quality while at the same time constraining, or reducing, costs. An increasing number of health care organizations can document their experiences that as quality goes up, costs can come down. The contribution of these new approaches is in some sense the wedding of many long established methodologies--the scientific method, statistical quality control, planning, joint problem solving, participative management, and empowerment of the work force. While this recognition could lend support to those who label this new model a fad, that perception denies the linkage of TQM/CQI to the greater stream of innovations pushing us toward ever-greater organizational excellence. Can we not take the philosophy and methods that are potentially useful and try them experimentally? Let our empirical tests tell us of their contribution. We believe the concepts and procedures of TQM/CQI will help us to be better in years to come, even though we highly respect our starting point.",

    "abstract": "Total quality management (TQM) or continuous quality improvement (CQI) are terms no longer being used exclusively within the manufacturing industry sector. Health care facilities, such as hospitals and nursing homes, are beginning to actively compete with each other for patients as well as face new regulations from the government. Hence, it is imperative that these facilities reevaluate their services and correct any production problems in order to be cost-effective and efficient in providing quality. Therefore, the objective of this article is to describe a model developed for improvement of hospital-wide services provided by the Baptist Health Systems' Montclair facility, a private, community hospital located in Birmingham, Alabama. The TeamWorks for Quality model, used to charter over 40 teams, illustrates how managers and employees can build a multifaceted process that delivers services in excess of customer expectations.",

    "abstract": "This article advocates revisiting the notion of primary care to include these dimensions: the physician-patient relationship, the notion of principal care, and the pa tient as validating the primary care relationship. The quality of primary care rests squarely on these three characteristics. From a systems perspective, the quality of primary care encompasses more than the right assort ment of clinical competencies; quality has to be grounded in and realized at the individual level where physician and patient meet and interact over time. The discussion thus rests on the assumption that primary care is a process of care rather than a collection of skills. This study was stimulated by two factors: the claim of subspecialists to at times provide primary care and L. H. Aiken et al.'s article on the contribution of specialists to primary care. The author of the present article surveyed 467 internists and subspecialists and asked if they equated principal care with general inter nal medicine (IM) care-a primary care competency. The percentage of IM in their practice was also surveyed. The 160 responses revealed that the percentage of sub- specialist care to primary care was similar to that de scribed in Aiken et al.'s article. The notion of principal care thus appears to better reflect the realities of clini cal practice.",

At the very least, however, it is important to recognize the evidence that at least some patients suffering from chronic conditions may be choosing collaborative therapies for different reasons than for those for which they seek conventional medical care. For these patients, at least, it is important that the quality of the collaborative care they receive be judged on outcomes capable of reflecting these alternative objectives. Finally, whether we are in the midst of a paradigmatic shift in medicine or not, it is essential that we all, as providers of clinical care or as investigators of clinical efficacy, adopt a collaborative role to ensure the provision of both good medicine and good science.",

Significance is defined as P < .05. The average duration of catheter life was 14.4 +/- 17.1 months. Three reasons were identified for catheter removal: completion of therapy (44%), catheter malfunction (28%), and infection (28%). Our total infection rate was 0.65/1000 catheter days, which decreased to 0.19/1000 for catheters in place between 1 and 24 months. Catheters left in place for more than 24 months were noted to have an increased infection rate. SICs are a safe and effective mode of intravenous access. Our data indicate that infectious complications are low when proper technique is employed and catheters are removed before 24 months.",

    "abstract": "When we think of patient safety, we usually do not immediately think of child maltreatment prevention. Yet the incidence and prevalence of child maltreatment is a significant public health issue in the United States. As we begin to overhaul our health care system, it is a good time to think about child maltreatment prevention. Including child maltreatment prevention as a core component of pediatric care may be less complicated than understanding what child maltreatment is and how it affects children. Anonymous telephone surveys suggest that as many as 10% to 15% of children experience physical and emotional abuse. The abuse is most often long term, acting more like a chronic malady than an acute trauma. Children younger than 3 years of age experience the greatest risks for morbidity and mortality resulting from child abuse and neglect. Although we know that physical abuse is underrecognized and underreported, emotional abuse is even more difficult to identify. Research, such as the Adverse Childhood Experiences study, has shown that there is a direct association between the abuse and neglect suffered during childhood and use of drugs and alcohol, involvement in violence, depression and anxiety, and physical health in adulthood. This study of Kaiser adult enrollees shows dramatic increases in adult mental health and physical illness that are directly related to the number of adverse childhood experiences these enrollees suffered. These data are not new and yet there has been little momentum in health care to focus on prevention of childhood maltreatment. The actual prevention techniques are progressing through clinical trials and are still too early to be definitive, but a number of early studies show promise. Pediatricians see the majority of children younger than 3 years of age numerous times each year. Physicians have recognized that issues related to the child’s psychosocial health are a primary parental concern. This makes sense given that children’s physical health has improved beyond acute issues such as infectious diseases. The “new morbidities” of mental health and developmental issues have become of paramount importance to the pediatric visit. Although parents want pediatricians to help them with these topics, pediatricians often do not feel well equipped to answer questions related to psychosocial health, nor do they know what to do when they recognize family dysfunction. Several psychosocial topics related to maternal health, infancy, and toddlerhood are currently under study by researchers: maternal depression, infant crying, discipline, and toilet training (eg, Practicing Safety). Pediatric identification of and response to these issues can enhance parenting skills and behaviors and ultimately help raise a happy, healthier child and, thus, a healthier adult. Additionally, through its Bright Futures initiative, the American Academy of Pediatrics has assessment instruments and tools for pediatricians to use to identify other psychosocial issues related to the infant, child, and family. Lastly, it is essential that primary care provider sites provide medical homes for infants at risk for maltreatment or developmental delays. Interventions such as Practicing Safety, and perhaps Bright Futures, offer building blocks to primary care pediatrics to use in the development of medical homes for their infant and child patient populations. Incorporating such features into primary care requires a culture of change—a change in long-standing practice patterns. Quality improvement strategies, such as office-based coaching, learning collaboratives, and use of data to track changes, are critical to acceptance and sustainability. Rigorous studies to test child maltreatment prevention interventions are under way. The integration of risk identification, linkages and referral to community resources, and monitoring and follow-up to enhance parenting skills and behavior must undergo rigorous research to determine the treatment effect produced by such focused, proactive office-based approaches. Universal developmental screening has been suggested by the Commonwealth Fund and the American Academy of",

The B-SAFE campaign was conducted in 2009 to educate patients located in a Michigan hospital's service area about the risk of serious adverse drug events associated with warfarin. The rate of warfarin-related drug interactions among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients admitted to the exposed hospital with hemorrhagic complications was compared with the rate of warfarin-related drug interactions among a similar cohort admitted to a control hospital before and after the campaign. The χ(2) test and logistic regression were used to analyze differences. The authors observed a marginally significant decline in the rate of warfarin-related drug interactions (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-1.29) among FFS Medicare patients admitted for bleeding complications to the hospital targeted by the B-SAFE campaign. The same association was not observed in the control hospital (OR = 1.15; CI = 0.42-3.14). These findings suggest that patient exposure to the B-SAFE campaign may have resulted in a decrease in the rate of clinically significant warfarin-related drug interactions.",

UCDS is a computer ized system of data collection and case finding developed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to standardize the Peer Review Organization screening process for potential utilization and quality problems. Input on the cerebrovascular disease algo rithms was provided through the American Medical As sociation UCDS Advisory Panel and the American Acad emy of Neurology Task Force on Hospital Utilization for Stroke. Physician organizations were successful in identifying problematic areas, improving the original al gorithms, suggesting new issues for development, and deleting inappropriate or misdirected algorithms. Since HCFA modified the cerebrovascular disease algorithms in response to feedback, physician organizations have had an important impact on algorithm development. Un fortunately, the process for algorithm review was often complicated, inefficient, and slow. This process is re viewed, problems and constraints are discussed, and specific recommendations are given for improving the process.",

Questions analyzed preferences in evaluating quality of care, measuring discrepancies between clinical guidelines and actual practice patterns, and the development of quality indicators. All of our participants (100%) reported that the compliance with established and widely accepted clinical guidelines is an important quality indicator. Health professionals indicated 1.8 (+/- 1.1) overall preference of our developed quality indicators for the management of depression. Although most currently used quality indicators focus either on the process or on the outcome of care, health professionals strongly prefer indicators that measure both. Our measurable quality indicators were found to have wide acceptance without major differences among primary care physicians, medical directors, and health benefit managers.",

Often, surgeons, anesthesiolo gists, hospital administrators, and even patients ex pect that there will be some \"labs\" on the chart prior to any operative procedure. Many have questioned the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of such a policy. There is little evidence to support the need for routine preoperative testing and much evidence against it. Preoperative testing should be based on appropriate indications. This makes the assessment of the preop erative laboratory evaluation difficult for a medical quality assurance program. The question that arises is, how much routine preoperative laboratory testing is enough?The answer to this question depends on (a) the purpose of this testing and (b) the limitations and potential misinterpretations of laboratory testing. This article will discuss the reasons for the potential misinterpretation of laboratory tests and then the data supporting selective preoperative laboratory testing.",

    "abstract": "One important question for a utilization management program is whether the utilization review instrument is consistent or stable when used on many occasions by the same abstractor (intrarater reliability) or by several abstractors (inter-rater reliability). As part of a nationwide study of inappropriate utilization of inpatient services by the Department of Veterans Affairs, we conducted a thorough investigation of the inter-rater reliability of a widely used utilization review instrument by 27 nurse abstractors. All abstractors were extensively trained, both by the developers of the instrument and by use of practice medical records. A standard protocol for resolving questions was implemented, with immediate communication of decisions to abstractors. The results of three reliability assessments, conducted immediately after formal training, after several weeks of reviewing practice records, and midway through review of the study records, demonstrated good to excellent reliability, both when comparing the nurse abstractors with a physician gold standard and among themselves. Therefore, with appropriate training and monitoring, utilization management programs in large hospitals, multihospital systems, and other health care organizations needing to examine inpatient utilization should feel confident that they can achieve reviews that would be in close agreement with physician and other nurse abstractors. Such confidence should increase the acceptability of utilization management programs.",

We prospectively compared SOS ratings with ratings of treating cardiologists and surgeons for 203 coronary angiographies and 100 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties. We also retrospectively assessed indications of 103 coronary artery bypass grafts. SOS ratings of appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate indications for coronary angiography were 85.5%, 10%, and 4.5%, respectively, and 99.5%, 0.5%, and 0%, respectively, for revascularization. Corresponding clinicians' ratings were 95%, 4%, and 1% and 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. SOS ratings of necessary, uncertain, and unnecessary indications for angiography were 82.4%, 17.6%, and 0%, respectively, and 97%, 3%, and 0%, respectively, for revascularization. Corresponding clinicians' values were 88.2%, 10.6%, and 1.2% and 98%, 2%, and 0%, respectively. Significant statistical differences for coronary angiography were found for patients with acute myocardial infarction and for patients within 12 weeks of myocardial infarction. A high accordance between estimated SOS and clinically estimated appropriateness of procedures was found, which might suggest that the guidelines are valid. Regular validation and updating of the guidelines is highlighted. Possible overuse of angiography in patients within 12 weeks of myocardial infarction may need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis A is a self-limited, virally mediated infection of the liver. The usual mode of transmission is by the fecal-oral route. Employees of food-service establishments who are infected with the hepititus A virus can transmit the disease when handling food products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the hepatitis A vaccine among dietary workers who may be at risk for contracting and spreading the disease. Because hepatitis A infection can often be a subclinical disease, the incidence of cases reported is not indicative of its true prevalence. The objective of this study was to document the seroprevalence of hepatitis A among hospital dietary workers. Dietary workers at a suburban hospital were interviewed to determine if they had been exposed to hepatitis A and if they had a history of hepatitis A infection. Serum was obtained from each subject and tested for the presence of hepatitis A antibodies. The Abbott HAVAB EIA kit was used for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM hepatitis A antibodies. Of 119 subjects, 56 (47%) were women, and 63 (53%) were men; the subjects had a mean age of 42 years (range, 20-66). Fifty-one subjects (43%) were born in the United States, and 68 subjects (57%) were born outside of the United States. Of the 119 subjects, only 2 (2%) had a known history of hepatitis A infection, yet 67 (56%) had hepatitis A titers; 52 (44%) were susceptible to the disease. One subject had received the hepatitis A vaccine. Fifty-five of 68 foreign-born subjects (81%; 95% confidence interval, 71-91%) had hepatitis A antibodies versus 12 of 51 US-born subjects (24%; 95% confidence interval, 12-36%). The foreign-born subjects had a mean age of 28 years at the time of their arrival in the United States. In conclusion, a large number of foreign-born hospital dietary workers have hepatitis A antibodies without a history of disease. Immunization of this group of dietary workers may not have any beneficial effects, nor is it cost-effective.",

Patient perceptions were measured by a validated survey that was mailed to patients after discharge. For 8 of the 9 dimensions assessed by the survey, VA patients were more likely (P < .001) than private sector patients to note a problem with care (eg, Coordination, 48% versus 40%; Patient Education and Communication, 50% versus 40%; Respect for Patient Preferences, 49% versus 41%). In comparisons limited to major teaching hospitals, VA patients were more likely to note a problem for 5 dimensions. The findings indicate that patient perceptions of care may be lower in VA than in private sector hospitals. Future studies should examine whether the VA's recent focus on improving patient satisfaction has narrowed these differences.",

Identification of aspects of care that influence patient satisfaction may be used to design changes in health delivery systems, thus improving quality of care. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the patient's assessment of quality of health care and the size of primary care clinics (PCCs) (measured as number of monthly patient visits) as well as the physician workload (measured as number of visits per physician per month). This study was a cross-sectional study using PCCs' characteristics and patient satisfaction surveys. One hundred one PCCs were evaluated. There was a negative correlation between all satisfaction indices and the number of primary care physicians in the clinic and the number of monthly visits to the clinic. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the actual workload per physician. In general linear models, clinic size correlated significantly and negatively with patient satisfaction even after correction for other factors. The study concluded that patient satisfaction in the medical settings of the Israel Defense Forces is adversely affected by large clinic size but is not affected by physician work-load.",

Members of the Steering Committee of the Group Practice Council of the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC), representing the leadership of 88 FPPs, were asked to respond to a 38-item Web-based questionnaire during February and March 2003. The survey elicited information on the organizational characteristics of FPPs, their current degree of engagement in outpatient QI activities, and factors driving interest and barriers impeding efforts to conduct outpatient QI initiatives. Descriptive statistics for all variables of interest were performed. Responses were received from 33 participants believed to represent at least 28 of the total 88 FPP members of the UHC. Nearly all respondents indicated that some types of outpatient QI initiatives were currently taking place in their FPP. However, only 12% of respondents met 4 or more of the 6 criteria deemed to be essential to having a robust outpatient QI program. Among key QI indicators, one third of respondents reported that their FPP had a separate and distinct outpatient quality committee, and some one fifth had a budget for outpatient QI or financial incentives for outpatient clinics to engage in QI (or both). The majority of respondents stated that at least some departments in their FPP were collecting quality data. Most respondents reported that patient safety and external demand for outpatient QI were the \"more important\" factors driving QI efforts, whereas lack of human resources and other resources were the \"more significant\" barriers hindering QI initiatives. The results of the study suggest that, although FPPs showed a strong interest in outpatient QI initiatives, FPPs' efforts are still in an infancy phase and lag far behind inpatient performance measurement activities. Without appropriate resources, it appears unlikely that FPPs will be able to move the agenda forward to develop a quality culture and robust program of self-assessment and improvement in the outpatient setting.",

The authors followed A3 methodology to determine the root cause of this increase and developed a 3-prong intervention centered on physician engagement, given that physicians have the ability to order a patient’s level of care. This intervention consisted of: (1) identifying physician champions to promote appropriate IICU use, (2) visual changes to essential electronic medical record tools, and (3) data-driven feedback to physician champions. In the year following intervention deployment, average IICU length of stay decreased from 1.08 to 0.62 days and average IICU use decreased from 21.4% to 12.3%, corresponding to ~$5.7M cost savings with no significant change in balancing measures observed. Together, these results demonstrate that a multicomponent intervention aimed at engaging physicians reduced inappropriate IICU use with no increase in adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Structured quality improvement and patient safety (QI/PS) education has increased at every level of medical education; however, great variability exists in the content taught. Here, the authors present a longitudinal model for medical student QI/PS education that is currently implemented at the University of Florida College of Medicine. The curriculum is taught with a variety of teaching methods incorporated into each year with increasing levels of clinical implementation. This curriculum is multimodal and introduces students to QI/PS concepts, presents mock scenarios, and eventually encourages clinical application to situations students experience during their own clinical practice. Additionally, a specialized track for students to have further immersion into this field of medicine is described, which involves specialized training, expanded educational opportunities, and a capstone project. Both the curriculum and specialized track contain explicit clinical integration to ensure students are prepared to enter the medical profession to engage in QI/PS endeavors.",

    "abstract": "2020 Virtual Summit Snapshot Total registered attendees 6206 Member registered attendees: 3856 Power Huddles: 84 Poster Presentations:61 Member overall meeting score (Continuing Education): 9.25/10.00 Vizient® members, suppliers, and others came together virtually at the 2020 Vizient Connections Education Summit to share and discuss innovative and creative solutions to meeting marketplace demands for cost reduction, better access to care, higher quality, and performance improvement. The first Vizient virtual summit drew record interest, with over 6200 attendees, more than doubling attendance at the 2019 in-person event. Attendees participated from across the country, including representatives from academic medical centers, large systems, community hospitals, children's hospitals, nonacute and ambulatory care providers, and supplier organizations. They had the opportunity to hear from—and in many cases share ideas and interact with—presenters and panelists in live plenary sessions and Power Huddles, and to access a multitude of prerecorded Power Huddles, poster sessions, and member stories. While the live telecast was held September 15–17, 2020, the virtual format provided a unique opportunity for the summit to live on long after those dates, providing members and suppliers with the opportunity to view summit materials and earn continuing education credits at their convenience. Access to the opening plenary and other educational content continues via vizientinc.com. The material represented the best of the best from Vizient members, who submitted a record-breaking 724 abstracts. This overwhelming response clearly demonstrates a heightened level of passion and dedication to sharing stories and helping others through the many challenges facing health care. A rigorous scoring and selection process, including careful review by multiple subject matter experts, helped identify the summit's member-driven educational content. Chosen before the pandemic, this year's theme, \"Future in Focus: One Clear Vision,\" could not have been more appropriate for framing the sessions and discussions. As Byron Jobe, president and chief executive officer of Vizient, noted in his opening remarks, health care leaders and frontline workers are among the smartest, most innovative, and most collaborative people in the world. Amid this once-in-a-century crisis, they have come together in unprecedented ways to focus on the future. Recognizing health care workers as true heroes Jobe recognized and thanked member health systems and frontline workers for their extraordinary efforts, calling them \"real heroes who have made enormous sacrifices and overcome monumental challenges to help others in need.\" Like firemen running into the flames, these workers risk everything on behalf of others, ignoring the potential consequences to themselves and their loved ones. They do so because of their unrelenting dedication and commitment to caring for patients. The nation understands their sacrifice, as evidenced by countless examples of people honoring frontline workers, such as the well-publicized story of a man standing outside an emergency room holding up a sign thanking staff for saving his wife. Sekou Andrews, CEO and founder of SekouWorld, Inc., put it best in his eloquent and moving final presentation. Talking about frontline health care workers, he noted: \"The results are in and you test positive for a level of quiet courage that most of us could not bear…you are afflicted with a heroic, stubborn, almost delusional level of commitment to improving the world's health, wellness, and vitality.\" Supporting these heroes As frontline staff work heroically, the leaders of their organizations labor tirelessly to support them. For example, as part of the opening plenary panel, Janice Nevin, MD, MPH, president and CEO of ChristianaCare (a community-based system serving Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey), highlighted the critical importance of \"taking care of our people.\" Early in the pandemic, ChristianaCare treated over 1000 COVID patients. The physical and mental toll on staff became evident, including notable increases in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and general burnout. Five years earlier, the health system had created its Center for WorkLife Wellbeing, a program dedicated to helping caregivers flourish and thrive. As Nevin noted, \"when we care for ourselves, we are better able to care for others.\" The center promotes a culture of well-being, including physical and psychological safety, connection and camaraderie, meaning and purpose, and choice and autonomy. During the pandemic, ChristianaCare quickly ramped up its services and capacity to meet the unique needs of staff during this pandemic. For example, leaders installed a sanctuary room for caregivers dealing with difficult challenges and directed peer supporters to seek out colleagues daily to provide support. Health system leaders are not the only ones stepping up to support frontline heroes. Many vendors, suppliers, and consultants are doing so as well. Since the pandemic outbreak, Vizient began partnering with multiple suppliers to dramatically expand the supply of personal protective equipment, vital drugs, and other supplies. Vizient has sourced staff from around the country to augment the workforce in areas facing surges in infections, including staff for newly constructed field hospitals in pandemic hot spots. Vizient has made clinical and operational resources available to deal with the pandemic, including disseminating emerging best practices for patient care (eg, testing, visitation), supply chain management, and demand forecasting (eg, intensive care beds, ventilators). Vizient also accelerated its advocacy efforts in Washington, DC, making recommendations on how to avoid drug and supply shortages and promote telemedicine and digital health. Vizient, with the analytic expertise of its company Sg2®, is taking the lead in supporting members in their strategic recovery and stabilizing operational, clinical, and financial performance, with publications such as \"Guidance for Resumption of Electively Scheduled Surgery and Procedures in the COVID-19 Era\" and tools such as the Sg2 Surge Demand Calculator and the Sg2 Financial Recovery Calculator. Focusing clearly on the future Health care has changed forever because of the coronavirus. As devastating as the pandemic has been, health care will emerge stronger and better because of it. Technologies such as virtual health that might normally take years to implement have achieved broad scale in a matter of months, thanks in part to federal and state governments taking actions to remove barriers to telehealth services during the pandemic. Virtual health, however, is just one example of what needs to be done to improve health and health care. As Nevin noted, the goal must be to provide \"the right care, at the right time, in the right place, with the right people, so that people are healthier and care becomes affordable.\" Care must address not just the biological and medical issues faced by patients, but also mental health issues and underlying social determinants of health. Addressing social determinants of health will not be possible without efforts to enhance health equity, as too many racial and ethnic minorities lack access not only to care, but also to adequate housing, food, education, and recreational opportunities. To succeed, health systems need to invest in robust virtual and physical care platforms that reach underserved populations, along with data platforms that generate actionable insights for improving care. The result, according to Nevin, will be revolutionary, not evolutionary, creating a whole new world for health care. Success will not be easy. As Jobe commented, changing the world requires great minds and passionate hearts working together. The Secret Sauce of Achieving and Sustaining Top-Notch Performance Julie Cerese, PhD, RN, MSN Group Senior Vice President, Performance Management and National Networks, Vizient David Levine, MD, FACEP Group Senior Vice President, Advanced Analytics and Product Management, Vizient Supporting members in achieving and sustaining strong performance for the past 15 years, Vizient has developed a robust understanding of what it takes to succeed, including the specific organizational characteristics required. The University of Utah Health, for example, is an excellent case study in what an organization must do to produce sustainable top-notch performance in reducing preventable mortality. System leaders put in place a safety learning system around mortality that incorporates the following: a deep dive into every death to understand if and how it could have been prevented; a rapid response team tailored to the patient and unit that intervenes quickly with decompensating patients; an inpatient program that provides hospice care to patients without the need to change beds (ie, the bed is switched from inpatient to hospice care); and an intense focus on preventing hospital-acquired conditions, such as acute respiratory failure and catheter-related bloodstream infections. These activities make the University of Utah Health a high-reliability organization with a culture focused on performance and safety. Characteristics of high-performing organizations The University of Utah Health has much in common with other top performers. In fact, in its work, Vizient has identified 5 characteristics that generally exist within high-achieving organizations: Shared sense of purpose: From the board and CEO to frontline workers and support staff, everyone understands and can articulate the goals of the organization, knows how the organization is performing on those goals, and understands their role in achieving them. Cooperative leadership style and atmosphere: Leaders model desired behaviors and values and demonstrate the importance of cooperation and collaboration. Leaders are seen regularly on the floors, conducting rounds during which they talk to and engage with patients and staff to understand the issues and problems they face. Leaders also regularly celebrate successes (even small ones). They do this not only on the day shift, but also on the evening and overnight shifts to make sure these employees understand how important they are to the organization. Results-driven, striving for top performance: The top performers set high aspirational goals, such as zero harm to both patients and employees. They seldom remain content with average performance. Centralized and decentralized accountability structures: At the organizational level, the human resources department puts in place strict hiring standards to make sure that everyone fits into the culture. Similarly, the C-suite develops compensation systems that create incentives for employees at every level tied to the achievement of goals. Every employee has skin in the game. Leaders, middle managers, and frontline staff in every unit and department understand their roles and responsibilities and are held accountable for achieving top performance. Culture of collaboration and respect, with deference to expertise: Top-performing organizations recognize that everyone can and should contribute. Leaders and managers know that employees at lower levels of the organization, particularly those on the front lines, often have the best ideas. These ideas get implemented, regardless of who comes up with them.1 Organizations that exhibit these characteristics have the structures and mechanisms in place to identify problems, find sustainable solutions, and evaluate and adjust as necessary. Collectively, these characteristics represent the secret sauce of achieving top-notch performance. Sustaining performance over time Vizient recently initiated a study focused on how to sustain performance over time. The research is assessing organizations that have achieved top performance for multiple years, with the goal of determining if there is something different or special about them. While still preliminary, initial findings suggest that the key to sustained success seems to lie in large part with staff empowerment. Consistently providing a top-notch patient experience requires staff who understand what that experience looks like and who are empowered to deliver it. Empowering staff, in turn, depends on maintaining consistency in setting goals and reliability in evaluating performance. While specific measures may change, the structure and framework around setting quality, financial, and patient experience goals do not. This consistency gives frontline staff confidence in delivering on the mission and values, even as the nuances of specific metrics change. Further insights into what it takes to sustain performance can be gleaned by evaluating whether the unprecedented challenges created by COVID-19 have knocked high performers off their game. This year's Vizient Quality & Accountability (Q&A) study was divided into 2 parts: pre-COVID, with performance evaluated from July 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020, and post-COVID, with performance having thus far been evaluated from March 1 2020, to June 30, 2020 (Q&A Awards for 2020 are based only on the pre-COVID period). A preliminary comparison between the 2 periods shows that the top performers before the pandemic generally continued their success afterwards, while middle performers also tended to stay where they were in the rankings. This early finding suggests that organizations that have the secret sauce discussed earlier (ie, the right processes, systems, and culture) not only succeed over time, but also during the most turbulent and challenging of times. Like all organizations, these top performers have had to make quick changes and pivots in response to the pandemic, but their culture and structure has helped them remain on top. This year's Q&A results also highlight the importance of \"systemness\" in achieving and sustaining top performance. The results show that several health systems have had multiple hospitals achieve top performance, a strong indication that success stems from being part of a larger organization. More information can be found in the article on p. S6 by David Levine, MD, FACEP, and Steve Meurer, PhD, MBA, MHS, entitled \"Centralized Data and Analytics Support Locally Driven Change, Systemwide Improvement\"). Acting like a system appears to pay dividends during a pandemic as well, enabling flexibility such as the shifting of resources and staff in response to demands. For example, some systems have designated 1 hospital to handle COVID patients, thus minimizing disruptions to other hospitals in the organization. Going forward, pandemic-related challenges will likely accelerate the need to act as a single system rather than a collection of individual silos. Looking ahead Over the past year, health systems have responded rapidly to unprecedented challenges, faster than most leaders of those organizations ever thought possible. The industry deserves tremendous credit for turning on a dime; for example, those who once felt that it would take years to pivot to virtual care orchestrated the transition in a matter of weeks. Similar successes have been achieved in ramping up intensive care unit capacity and staffing, securing scarce personal protective equipment, and countless other areas. Armed with these experiences, leaders should not underestimate what they can achieve going forward. They should commit to leveraging this momentum and not going back to old, familiar ways of doing things. The hurdles may seem insurmountable, but recent experience makes it clear that they are not. Incredible things can happen when people put their minds to it. 1.Keroack MA, Youngberg BJ, Cerese JL, et al.

Real-Time Learning and Sharing During a Pandemic Cindy Abel, RN, MSN, CEN Vice President, Performance Improvement Collaboratives, Vizient Joan Moss, , RN, MSN Managing Principal, Sg2 Intelligence The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed enormous energy, innovation, and agility among Vizient members. Faced with unprecedented challenges, including surges in patients, shortages of staffing and supplies, and the overnight loss of major revenue sources, these organizations sprung to action to revolutionize care. These changes have the potential to be a turning point in the industry, marking the dawn of a new era of health care in this country. The challenge is to keep the momentum going and not drift back to outdated practices. Real-time learning on the front lines of care Vizient members quickly learned about and adapted to a new disease. Countless examples exist of changes, big and small, ranging from the rapid acceleration of virtual health to creative ways to address personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and peaks and valleys in COVID-19 patients. A great example of this learning and adaptation came from the summit, where Cleveland Clinic chronicled its journey in dealing with an early surge of COVID-19 patients in a video featuring member stories. As patient numbers grew, Cleveland Clinic began isolating infected patients on specific units, both to reduce the risk of spread and to preserve scarce PPE. Even with cohorted patients, PPE shortages quickly became an issue. Innovative frontline staff quickly decided that one way to reduce PPE use was to use extra tubing for intravenous (IV) drips, thus allowing the equipment to be put in the hallway. As a result, staff did not have to enter the room to change the IV, and hence did not need to don and doff PPE. As innovative as this change proved to be, it created another problem—IV tubing now lay across the floor, creating infection control issues. Within days, Jane Hartman, MS, RN, NP-C, a critical care nurse, came up with a solution—use of a little plastic clip device to keep the tubing off the floor, either by mounting it to the ceiling or a wall (the device was adapted from one previously used to walk with pediatric patients with IV tubing). Cleveland Clinic is working to make various versions of the device, known as High-Line, available to other organizations. The Cleveland Clinic story is one of countless examples of how frontline staff have risen to the occasion to address the unprecedented challenges created by the pandemic. Another comes from Nebraska Health, which faced an acute shortage of N95 masks. Staff figured out a way to sterilize them with ultraviolet light so they could be reused. This stopgap measure proved critical to the organization until mask shortages could be alleviated. Other examples show the true cooperative spirit of the health care industry. Once it became clear that not every region of the country was going to be hit by the first wave of coronavirus at the same time, organizations began sharing scarce equipment. For example, Seattle area hospitals sent ventilators to New York City. Similarly, nurses and other staff in less-affected areas began traveling to hot spots to serve on a per-diem basis. Real-time connections and knowledge transfer Recognizing early on the severity of the pandemic, Vizient sprang into action to understand what was happening at the front lines, bring people together in real time, and disseminate information and resources to help members rise to the challenge. Seeing articles about the coronavirus in January, Vizient leaders began reaching out through existing networks to better understand its implications. In mid-January, an Emory University epidemiologist was enlisted to speak about the virus to participants in the Vizient Hospital Innovation Improvement Network. Despite there being no cases in the United States, this epidemiologist made it clear that COVID-19 had the potential to be a major disruptive event. Vizient subsequently hosted a webinar for all members, featuring the same epidemiologist, along with supply chain experts. This event made clear the need for more regular networking. To that end, Vizient created an advisory council consisting of roughly a dozen clinical, supply chain, and pharmacy leaders, which in turn launched a weekly webinar series. Sessions featured integrated learning, helping members tackle issues from various perspectives. The first was held as the state of Washington experienced its initial surge of patients in March. It featured Christopher Kim, MD, MBA, SFHM, of the University of Washington, who, despite being in the midst of a surge, volunteered to describe how University of Washington set up an incident command center. He also shared clinical protocols and practices so that others did not have to recreate them. The weekly webinars drew almost 1000 individuals in the first few months. As the virus receded in the summer, the schedule switched to monthly, but by fall the surge in cases created interest in a return to weekly sessions. Hundreds still attend each event, while many others watch and listen asynchronously to recordings. The power of these networking events can be seen in one relatively early webinar that featured 2 physicians discussing the development of care practices for COVID-19 patients. Thomas Spiegel, MD, from University of Chicago Medicine, emphasized the use of high-flow oxygen and the relatively new practice of turning COVID-19 patients onto their stomachs (a practice known as proning) to allow oxygen to get to the lungs more easily. This approach is now considered a best practice, along with ventilator use only when necessary. This well-attended webinar allowed many people to hear about and implement this practice early, potentially saving a significant number of lives, including patients and staff (ventilating patients can aerosolize the virus, putting staff at risk). Beyond networking, Vizient has developed other resources to facilitate knowledge-sharing and the spread of innovations. For example, in September 2020, Vizient released \"Covid-19 Pandemic Compendium: A Collection of Emerging Practices and Guide for Resiliency.\" This publication describes a variety of promising practices on various issues, including managing supplies, clinical care, testing, surge capacity planning, visitation policies, and the impact of COVID-19 on staff. Vizient employs a team of people who continuously scour list servers, databases, and other resources to identify important information to be shared. Staff members also field daily calls from members looking for help with specific issues; early on, one member called to find a recipe for making hand sanitizer, which was in short supply at the time. Vizient quickly found a recipe on the Food and Drug Administration website. Through the Communities platform and other activities, Vizient regularly facilitates real-time connections, allowing individuals to post questions and make requests of each other. These connections have accelerated the movement of people and supplies across the country, including ventilators and nurses moving from Seattle to New York City after virus outbreaks shifted from the west to the east coast. Through contracts, Vizient has helped members alleviate drug and supply shortages, and has put its own money behind sales guarantees to secure scarce PPE for members. The company continues to pay significant attention to staff-related issues, including how to help staff members maintain their mental health and resilience. Workbooks, speakers, and other resources have been dedicated to this important topic. Publicly available resources Critical pandemic-related information and resources are available for members free of charge at COVID-19 resources and updates | Vizient (vizientinc.com). Continued support through the post-COVID era and beyond The 2020 Vizient Connections Education Summit represented continued ongoing efforts to support members and the nation during and after the pandemic. These efforts will continue for as long as necessary. For example, Vizient created a dashboard that pairs the surge calculator with models that predict caseloads in specific states and regions, thus allowing organizations to better prepare for inevitable ebbs and flows in the number of cases. Weekly webinars continue to evolve, with recent shifts including a greater emphasis on clinical care and more attention to the care of children. During a once-in-a-lifetime crisis like COVID-19, one should never underestimate the willingness of people and organizations (even competitors) to come together and share successes and lessons learned. Centralized Data and Analytics Support Locally Driven Change, Systemwide Improvement David Levine, MD, FACEP Group Senior Vice President, Advanced Analytics and Product Management, Vizient Steve Meurer, PhD, MBA, MHS Executive Principal, Data Science and Member Insights, Vizient The 2020 Vizient Connections Education Summit highlighted an emerging interest related to a health system's structure in analytics and improvement, giving credence to Avedis Donabedian's structure-process-outcome model that points to the importance of having a sensible structure for achieving improved outcomes. For the past few decades, health systems have seen the number of metrics and associated dashboards grow exponentially, which has led to multiple siloes managing multiple data sources. Because this decentralized approach to analytics has not resulted in better overall outcomes, health systems are now considering a more harmonized, simplified structure. They are shifting responsibility for improvement away from siloed departments, units, and facilities to a more systemwide approach. The effort begins with creation of a single, centralized, streamlined leadership dashboard with fewer metrics; this dashboard links to facility-, service line-, and unit-specific dashboards that provide comparisons to appropriate peers and the ability to drill down to ever-greater levels of detail to facilitate the identification and addressing of opportunities for improvement. Without a robust ability to drill down, health systems run the risk of clinicians becoming uncomfortable with and disengaged from the process, including the measures, comparison groups, and risk-adjustment methodologies being used. Vizient has assisted members with this transition through its Quality and Accountability (Q&A) Study and the transparent drill-down capabilities available in the Vizient Clinical Data Base. Created in 2005, the Q&A Study is used as a \"north star\" leadership dashboard to guide improvement, allowing members to generate insights from a balanced, timely, ready-made scorecard. Multiple summit success stories The summit featured stories of several organizations moving to a centralized improvement structure and using the Q&A top hospitals as their target. Perhaps the best example came from a Power Huddle from Intermountain Healthcare, a 23-hospital system headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, that has facilities ranging from a large quaternary medical center to small, rural hospitals. Intermountain had historically been organized as a federation of regions, an approach that worked well for many years. CEO Marc Harrison, MD, and his leadership team decided to revisit this structure in 2017, not because anything was explicitly broken, but rather because they wanted to make sure that it would serve the organization well in the future. After in-depth discussions with physicians, nurses, and other clinical leaders, the team decided to move to a more centralized and streamlined approach. Intermountain created an Office of Patient Experience, which brought together previously siloed functions, including safety, clinical risk management, advocacy, physician advisory services/coding, regulatory affairs, external reporting, antibiotic stewardship, and clinical data management. Having these functions under one roof, they believe, has ensured an aligned, common agenda. In 2018, Intermountain became part of the Q&A Study. The Office of Patient Experience created an enterprisewide roll-up of the Q&A scorecard, which provides comparison cohorts for each of the 23 hospitals. This flexible system meets the needs of different Intermountain audiences. For example, the system board can view aggregate systemwide measures, while clinical leaders and frontline workers at individual hospitals and units receive monthly drill downs at a very granular level to gauge performance on specific measures and identify opportunities for improvement. The data are kept current through the release of quarterly updates. This approach has clearly worked. Intermountain has seen significant improvements, moving from the 66th to 82nd percentile on overall Q&A Study rankings, from the 37th to 50th percentile in the mortality domain, from the 56th to 76th percentile in patient centeredness, and from the 66th to 80th percentile in safety (driven primarily by a reduction in hospital-acquired infections). Intermountain is not the only summit participant to pursue this centralization strategy. BJC HealthCare in St. Louis, Missouri, told a similar story. BJC began its journey in 2003 with a 10-metric scorecard. By 2018, that same scorecard had grown to 117 measures, with different parts of the system using completely different measures and methodologies. BJC leaders similarly decided to move to a standardized, streamlined scorecard that focuses on only a few goals, and chose the Q&A Study as their benchmarking \"north star.\" Armed with this new data infrastructure and reporting platform, BJC has seen meaningful improvements in mortality, clinical documentation, safety, and patient experience. Representatives from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, and from Memorial Hermann in Houston, Texas, shared similar stories during summit Power Huddles. The Memorial Hermann story is particularly interesting—the organization created a drill-down tool that eliminates the need to comb through",

A multimodal approach including wellness events, emotional support rounds, fast-tracked connections with therapeutic support, and coalition building was used to reach 80% of staff from May through August, 2020. The multidisciplinary team planned events and interventions to appeal to the myriad ways people cope and build resilience, and by utilizing existing resources, it proved extremely cost-effective. In a survey of the program's participants, 94% of respondents \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that their participation helped alleviate stress.",

Attainment rates for each indicator were calculated by clinic. The effect of risk adjustment and the significance of clinic performance variation were determined with multivariate logistic models. Analysis of the 10 quality measures revealed lower attainment and greater clinic-level variation for the less familiar indicators. Statistically significant performance variations were detected among clinics, with several being of a clinically important magnitude. Risk adjustment did not substantially change performance. The addition of clinically relevant quality measures and simple statistics appeared to enhance the characterization of performance by this profiling program.",

The effect of neurological consultations on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients who have suffered a postoperative transient ischemic attack (TIA) has not yet been determined. The authors evaluated whether neurology consultations improved outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted of CABG patients from a high-volume tertiary care center. Primary end points included 30-day mortality, discharge disposition, length of stay, and 1-year incidence of stroke. Post-CABG TIA patients receiving a neurological consult (N = 127) were compared with propensity-matched controls. Thirty-day mortality was identical (3.1%), with nonsignificant difference in long-term incidence of stroke. There were no differences in home discharges or length of stay. Including a neurologist in the treating team for patients suffering TIAs after CABG appears not to reduce post-operative incidence of morbidity and mortality, reduce length of stay, or improve patient disposition at discharge.",

This article describes a practical model at The Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Medicine and details its structure and operation within a large academic health system. It is based on a fractal model that integrates multiple smaller units similar in structure (composition of faculty/staff), process (use of similar tools), and approach (using a common framework to address issues). This organization stresses local, multidisciplinary leadership, facilitates horizontal connections for peer learning, and maintains vertical connections for broader accountability.",

To date, no health care organizations has organized its efforts to achieve highly reliable results despite several decades of improvement science. Laboratorians were early adopters of quality initiatives and process improvements. In the late 1990s, the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center embarked on a major effort to improve quality and patient safety and to reduce waste. This article describes the institution’s journey toward approaching high reliability with the intent to share not only the tools and best practices, but also the ongoing reassessment of the problems detected on the journey.

Value was defined as quality (morbidity or mortality) divided by costs for surgeons performing general surgery and vascular procedures. Forty-four surgeons performed 11 965 surgeries. Risk-adjusted costs trended down over time. For all surgeries, mortality value increased by 3.27 per year (95% confidence interval = 2.54-4.01; P &lt; .001) on a 100-point scale, while morbidity value did not change. Of 21 surgeons with data for 5 years or longer, mortality value increased for all surgeons except one. Continuous increase in complication rates from 2008 contributed to decreased morbidity value. Value may assist surgeons in exploring performance opportunities better than morbidity or mortality alone.",

    "abstract": "Project Solo, a grassroots organization of independent physicians, has developed a unique method of confidential self-assessment of quality. Participating physicians can use the data to improve their own practices and to have a strong, credible voice for retaining and promoting the strengths of independent practices in providing medical care. In a pilot project, 56 independent physicians in Project Solo were given bar-coded, postage-paid survey forms of patient satisfaction to distribute to 100 patients. The population for this pilot study was the 35 physicians with patients returning at least one survey. A total of 1858 surveys (53% of surveys given to physicians) were returned, representing a variety of rural and urban practices in 19 states. The mean percentage of responses rated \"excellent\" to survey items from Project Solo physicians is similar to the percentages reported for this survey in other studies. We conclude that Project Solo serves as an effective and efficient model for gathering patient satisfaction data and can be further developed as a tool for gathering clinical outcome and other quality measurement data in the solo and small group practice setting.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to design and evaluate an instrument to assess the performance of a clinic in the delivery of preventive health services to a general medical clinic population. The patients were identified prospectively; data were obtained retrospectively with review of the charts. The study was conducted in a primary care clinic staffed primarily by internal medicine residents in an urban academic medical center. Patients who were receiving continuity care in the clinic and who were scheduled for an appointment during the 4-week study period were eligible for inclusion. Patients were identified by the appointment schedule. Charts were reviewed for the delivery of preventive health services. Data were abstracted utilizing a standard instrument. We found that the rate at which services were provided varied considerably by service and over time. The techniques used provided some insight into methods for the evaluation of the delivery of preventive services. It should be possible to assess a clinic's performance over a range of services over its entire population over time. An understanding of this more global performance may provide a better tool for managers and researchers addressing these issues. There may be legitimate reasons for services not being provided. These issues are complex and require sensitive, detailed investigation.",

The study addressed the utilization of type-and-screening and cross-matching in the acute care hospital setting-comparing the more common and expensive cross-match procedure to the less expensive and less utilized type-and-screen. The methodology involved two phases: (a) data collection, evaluation, and feedback to the hospitals and (b) post-monitoring. Although the study did not control for all possible variables, the post-monitoring results demonstrated an increase in the ratio from 0.569 (1992 data) to 0.577. For 1994, the total statewide transfusion cost was estimated at $5,909,700 as compared to $6,423,900 (1992 data)--a savings of more than $500,000 per year. By implementing minimal changes in the way blood is ordered and tested, hospitals can improve quality by maintaining a readily available blood supply, eliminating waste and saving money.",

Ten teams, made up primarily of clinicians, were charged with devising strategies for altering specific clinical behaviors to reduce costs without detriment to quality of care. Half the teams followed the center's total quality management approach. Team success was assessed by how well three key tasks were completed: problem definition, design of plan of action, and plan implementation. Two teams achieved outright success es, three had outright failures, and five were in between. Adherence to a total quality management approach was not found to be associated with team suc cess. A much better predictor of success was the level of involvement and support by clinicians and managers; because that factor is largely controlled by institution al incentives, those incentives may need to be realigned before the effectiveness of a total quality management approach can be properly evaluated.",

A conceptual framework involving the identification of three high level core processes to reengineer can provide clarity and focus for clinicians to begin directing reengineering efforts. Those core processes are: clinical management of the patient's medical needs, patient operational processes to support the clinical processes, and administrative decision-making processes to support the implementation of the clinical and operational processes. Improvement in any one of these areas has the potential to increase value, but the concurrent targeting of these core processes for reengineering has provided a synergy that has accelerated the achievement of the desired outcomes in the area of surgical services.",

Board initiatives were identified and summarized by staff through interviews with the chairpersons and representatives of the boards and review of records. Forty-nine projects from the three pilot units were identified. Each project was classified according to outcome--positive, negative, mixed, and unknown. Sixty percent of initiatives had positive outcomes, and only three initiatives (6%) were negative. Case characteristics were summarized according to board identification, problem, outcome indicators, data baseline, proposed and selected solutions, implementation strategy, monitoring plan, results, change issues, and lessons learned. The study concludes that the board initiatives embody the HORIZONS Projects approach to improving patient care and improving quality of working life for staff and doing so in a budget-neutral manner. The HORIZONS boards process has moved the organization toward more open, collaborative forms of decision making than hitherto practiced.",

This JCAHO initiative represents a significant new development that will include more than 100 different performance measurement systems, most of which are available through commercial firms and outside organizations. However, we see some potential problems with this new initiative. This is because some indicators recommended by JCAHO may be questionable due to the fact they are based on flawed methodologies that could result in biased and confounded data. To illustrate some of the potential adverse effects that could result from using such data to compare health care providers and facilities, we discuss some common problems associated with several widely available performance measurement systems. We then suggest an alternative approach that could potentially avoid many of these problems in the future.",

The method was a retrospective study of patients referred to an urban community hospital who had multiple radiologic tests ordered simultaneously before the referring physician reviewed any of the results. Utilization Findings Codes, beta versions II and III, of the American College of Radiology were applied. In- and outpatient charts were reviewed for initial indication, subsequent diagnosis, and treatment. Ninety-three patients had 214 radiologic ex aminations (2.3 per patient). Of the 214 total, 129 (60%) were retrospectively coded as inappropriate (beta II ver sion). For 98 reports, the initial interpreting radiolo gist's coded 16% as inappropriate versus 55% when retrospectively coded by the authors (P < 0.0001). After applying the beta III version, 18% were coded as posi tive (and related to symptoms), 79% negative, and 3% equivocal. There were 161 (74%) examinations ordered by primary care physicians and 53 tests ordered by spe cialists. Using the beta III version, the negative rate for primary care physicians was 81 and 75% for specialists (P = 0.447). It was concluded that ordering multiple ra diologic tests simultaneously on the same patient resulted in a high number of inappropriate procedures and negative results.",

We studied 31 351 patients with AMI in Pennsylvania during the year 2000, including 10 170 who received PCI. Univariate comparisons between groups were made using chi2 tests for categorical outcomes and Student's t tests for continuous outcomes. A logit model for proportions was used to model the relationship between mortality and the proportion of AMI patients who received PCI. The mortality rate for patients undergoing PCI was significantly lower than for those being treated medically (1.4% vs 15.8%, P<.0001). Furthermore, significant survival benefits associated with PCI persisted when patients were stratified by age, sex, type of infarction, and severity at admission. At the hospital level, higher rates of PCI were associated with a significantly lower overall mortality rate among patients with AMI (P<.0001).",

The authors found that both hospitals followed evidence-based practices reported as successful in the literature. Both hospitals have implemented interventions for inpatient settings, and the timing of interventions was very similar. Major implementation differences observed for post-discharge interventions focused on collaboration. It also was found that HM was more likely than MDACC to use medication reconciliation in outpatient ( P = .018) and discharge planning for community/home patients ( P = .032). Results will provide hospital professionals with insights for implementing the most effective interventions to reduce readmissions.",

Practices were provided with coaching and live and multimedia education regarding practice transformation and quality improvement. Coaches supported practices in multipronged approaches to quality improvement. Practice champions and clinical staff were trained on appropriate documentation of blood pressure (BP) and diabetes measures, and new workflows to optimize care delivery. Quality improvement staff were trained in extracting data from electronic health records, providing feedback to practice clinicians, and reporting to Practice Transformation Network staff. Final measurement of BP control was 66%, and final measurement of blood glucose control was 28%. Quality improvement activities in a practice transformation network led to the delivery of high-quality care and quality improvement.",

Faculty completed an online survey. Questions assessed demographic and academic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and self-efficacy. Knowledge was measured using the Quality Improvement Knowledge Assessment Tool–Revised (QIKAT-R). Participants provided free-text responses to questions about clinical scenarios. Almost half of participants (n = 236) self-reported that they were moderately or extremely comfortable with QIPS skills. Few were very (20%) or most (15%) comfortable teaching QIPS. Ninety-one participants attempted the QIKAT-R, and 78 participants completed it. The mean score was 16.6 (SD = 5.6). Despite positive attitudes and beliefs about their own QIPS skills, study results demonstrate a general lack of knowledge among surveyed faculty members. Faculty development efforts are needed to improve proficiency in participating, leading, and teaching QIPS projects.",

This includes guidance on various COVID-19 management topics: clinical assessment algorithms, guidance on patient tracking, and the importance of engaging in partnerships with other provider types. Sharing these experiences in the clinical management of COVID-19 may benefit other ambulatory providers in earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Among 1596 community-acquired pneumonia patients hospitalized from 1998 to 2012 identified using an evidence-based algorithm, the authors measured the association of principal diagnosis (PD) with 30-day readmission, stratified by Pneumonia Severity Index risk class. The 152 readmitted patients were more ill (Pneumonia Severity Index class V 38.8% versus 25.8%) and less likely to have a pneumonia PD (52.6% versus 69.9%). Among patients with PDs of pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and aspiration, mortality/readmission rates were 3.9/8.5%, 28.8/14.0%, 24.7/19.6%, and 9.0/15.0%, respectively. The nonpneumonia PDs were associated with a greater risk of adjusted 30-day readmission: respiratory failure odds ratio (OR) 1.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.15), sepsis OR 2.54 (95% CI, 1.52-4.26), and possibly aspiration OR 1.73 (95% CI, 0.88-3.41). With increasing use of alternative PDs among pneumonia patients, quality reporting must account for variations in condition coding practices. Rigorous risk adjustment does not eliminate the need for accurate, consistent case definition in producing valid quality measures.",

The authors describe a process for developing and implementing standardized communication and a teamwork structure for rapid response events (RREs) at a large academic hospital. The multidisciplinary team developed a project charter and key driver diagram, developed a “communication bundle,” used quality improvement methodology, monitored adherence to the changes, and reported these data to key stakeholders on a weekly basis. By project end, the team met the goal of having 70% or more of adult RREs include the use of the “communication bundle.” The balancing measure demonstrated that the introduction of a formalized communication framework did not significantly increase the duration of RREs.",

This study's goal is to establish the prevalence of the types of research conducted in articles published in journals dedicated to quality improvement. A cross-sectional analysis was performed of 145 research articles published in 11 quality improvement journals in 2011. The majority of study designs were considered pre-experimental (95%), with a small percentage of quasi-experimental and experimental designs. Of the studies that reported the results of an intervention (n = 60), the most common research designs were pre-post studies (33%) and case studies (25%). There were few randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental study designs (12% of intervention studies). These results suggest that there are opportunities for increased use of quasi-experimental study designs.",

The objective of this study was to assess the current awareness, utilization, and impact of pharmacy history data available in the EHR on primary care provider (PCP) decision making. A 14-question survey was distributed to all PCPs in a large medical practice. Of the 55/72 responding PCPs, 47 (85.5%) were aware of the EHR medication history function, and 36 (65.5%) had used it previously. Respondents indicated the medication history could be most useful when considering prescribing a narcotic (33/36, 92%) and when addressing nonadherence concerns (28/35, 80%). Barriers included delays in data loading and the time pressures of clinical practice. Access to aggregate multipayer pharmacy history data has the potential to affect medication reconciliation, yet future implementation should focus on making these data complete and easily available in routine practice.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between fellowship training of thoracic surgeons and their patient outcomes following a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. The study used data obtained from hospital discharges from Florida hospitals from 2006 to 2010 and linked them with the quality of the hospital wherein the physician completed his or her fellowship. Quality rankings were based on the hospital’s national ranking among cardiovascular hospitals at the time when the fellowship was completed. A risk-adjusted analysis showed that completing a fellowship in a nationally ranked cardiovascular hospital and a longer time since fellowship and residency completion were associated with lower complication rates for CABG surgeries. This is the first study to incorporate hospital discharge data, external hospital quality rankings, and physician training characteristics to evaluate patient outcomes. Such knowledge could help shape the future direction of health care training and provide an objective, outcomes-based evaluation method for physician training programs.",

    "abstract": "Peer comparison feedback is a promising strategy for reducing opioid prescribing and opioid-related harms. Such comparisons may be particularly impactful among underestimating clinicians who do not perceive themselves as high prescribers relative to their peers. But peer comparisons could also unintentionally increase prescribing among overestimating clinicians who do not perceive themselves as lower prescribers than peers. The objective of this study was to assess if the impact of peer comparisons varied by clinicians' preexisting opioid prescribing self-perceptions. Subgroup analysis of a randomized trial of peer comparison interventions among emergency department and urgent care clinicians was used. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to assess whether the impact of peer comparisons, alone or combined with individual feedback, varied by underestimating or overestimating prescriber status. Underestimating and overestimating prescribers were defined as those who self-reported relative prescribing amounts that were lower and higher, respectively, than actual relative baseline amounts. The primary outcome was pills per opioid prescription. Among 438 clinicians, 54% (n = 236) provided baseline prescribing self-perceptions and were included in this analysis. Overall, 17% (n = 40) were underestimating prescribers whereas 5% (n = 11) were overestimating prescribers. Underestimating prescribers exhibited a differentially greater decrease in pills per prescription compared to nonunderestimating clinicians when receiving peer comparison feedback (1.7 pills, 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.2 pills) or combined peer and individual feedback (2.8 pills, 95% CI, -4.8 to -0.8 pills). In contrast, there were no differential changes in pills per prescription for overestimating versus nonoverestimating prescribers after receiving peer comparison (1.5 pills, 95% CI, -0.9 to 3.9 pills) or combined peer and individual feedback (3.0 pills, 95% CI, -0.3 to 6.2 pills). Peer comparisons were more impactful among clinicians who underestimated their prescribing compared to peers. By correcting inaccurate self-perceptions, peer comparison feedback can be an effective strategy for influencing opioid prescribing.",

Fifty visits preimplementation and 67 visits postimplementation were audited from June 2021 to January 2022. Both leadership and frontline stakeholders were engaged to identify current workflows and potential interventions targeting outpatient elective procedures. Process mapping outlined current TH scheduling workflows. Outcomes related to TH completion, cost, and TH scheduling were collected after implementation. Preimplementation TH scheduling rate was 32%. The intervention required TH postoperative appointments to be scheduled in clinic at the time of surgery scheduling with TH being the default postsurgical appointment for a standardized list of eligible procedures. Following implementation, 95% of patients undergoing eligible procedures had TH follow-up. This provided improved access to surgical follow-up care, by reducing travel needs to the Veterans Affairs facility. Secondarily, this intervention increased clinic appointment availability and resulted in possible increased revenue for billable visits. Standardizing TH scheduling based on the procedure improves the utilization of TH resulting in improved clinic efficiency and increased revenue, without increasing adverse events.",

Quality control protocols have been proposed for arthroplasty registries, but these are not directly applicable to the spine setting. This study aims to develop a new quality control protocol for spine registries. Based on the available protocols for arthroplasty registries, a new protocol for spine registries was developed. The items included in the protocol were completeness (yearly enrollment rate and rate of assessment completion), consistency, and internal validity (coherence between registry data and medical records for blood loss, body mass index, and treated levels). All aspects were then applied to the spine registry of the Institution to verify its quality for each of the 5 years in which the registry has been used (2016-2020). Regarding completeness, the yearly enrollment rate ranged from 78 to 86%; the completion of preoperative assessment from 79% to 100%. The yearly consistency rate varied from 83% to 86%. Considering internal validity, the interclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 for blood loss and from 0.3 to 0.9 for body mass index. The coherency for treated levels ranged from 25% to 82%. Overall, all 3 items showed an improvement over time. All 3 analyzed domains showed good to excellent results.

    "abstract": "On behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), I would like to commend the many people who contributed to the work reflected in this special supplement, which is an important step toward modernizing guideline development and implementation for public health action. Science must be translated into clinical and public health practice more rapidly. Clinicians need the latest guidelines quickly at hand to achieve the best health outcomes. While the evidence-to-practice time gap has somewhat improved in the past 20 years,1 computable clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can accelerate this trend by increasing adoption of guidelines by health care providers.2 This supplement presents new processes and standards to rapidly develop actionable CPGs that are effective at improving practice, based on insights gained through CDC's Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age (ACG) initiative and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. ACG brought together public and private sector experts from multiple disciplines and contexts to streamline the development of computable guidelines and related products for implementation in patient care workflows and health information systems. This supplement includes an overview of the ACG initiative, the integrated process model for enabling close collaboration among disciplines to effectively develop and implement computable guidelines, an evaluation framework to assess the integrated process, and a description of the methods used within the ACG initiative to re-envision the guideline development and implementation process. The articles in this supplement give readers road maps to reengineer, accelerate, and evaluate their guideline development and implementation processes and to use health IT standards to deliver better and faster health care. Applying these concepts may help organizations better respond to health risks, diseases, and disparities. The ACG initiative brought together a multidisciplinary group of experts to envision a process for developing computable guidelines that integrates best practices related to general guideline development, informatics, communication, evaluation, and implementation in patient care. The goal of this integration is to co-develop written and computable guidelines in an ecosystem where the latter can be quickly implemented into health care practice with minimal additional effort. To assist in adopting this integrated process, from development to evaluation, tools and templates are included for each phase and its respective activities. Common standards for expressing guidelines in computable form are essential to the efficient development and implementation of computable guidelines. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®), developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7®), provides general standards that enable interoperable electronic health data exchange.3 The US regulations released by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT now require use of FHIR® in certified health information technology to foster its widespread adoption.4 These general standards are supplemented by specific standards for the development of computable guidelines, known as the FHIR® Clinical Guidelines Implementation Guide, or CPG-on-FHIR®.5 CPG-on-FHIR® originated through the ACG initiative and has now become a global collaborative effort in partnership with HL7®. As more guideline development organizations start using FHIR® standards and processes, providers and patients will benefit from having the most recent guidance and data available for making informed decisions about patients' health care. Effective collaboration in guidelines development and implementation requires that we overcome the limitations of siloed disciplinary approaches. Collaborative efforts to develop computable CPGs are already being implemented to improve patient care and health outcomes, with more under development by CDC6 and its global partners, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).7 Industry partners have also begun adopting an integrated approach to computable guideline development.8 CDC is committed to advance computable guideline development and health IT standards to accelerate the application of evidence-based guidelines in patient care and improve public health. This will allow us to respond more effectively to emerging public health threats, such as COVID-19, as well as chronic diseases and health inequities. We look forward to hearing how readers of this special supplement apply this work and use it to advance our collective vision of ensuring that everyone can live healthy and productive lives.",

The authors report a pre-post quasi-experimental evaluation of a commercially available EWS on patient outcomes at a 700-bed academic medical center. The EWS risk scores were visible in the electronic medical record by bedside clinicians. The EWS risk scores were also monitored remotely 24/7 by critical care trained nurses who actively contacted bedside nurses when a patient’s risk levels increased. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were rapid response team calls and activation of cardiopulmonary arrest (code-4) response teams. The study team conducted a regression discontinuity analysis adjusting for age, gender, insurance, severity of illness, risk of mortality, and hospital occupancy at admission. The analysis included 53,229 hospitalizations. Adjusted analysis showed no significant change in inpatient mortality, rapid response team call, or code-4 activations after implementing the EWS. This study confirms the continued uncertainty in the effectiveness of EWSs and the need for further rigorous examinations of EWSs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Healthcare spending continues to be an area of improvement across all forms of medicine. Overtreatment or low-value care, including overutilization of laboratory testing, has an estimated annual cost of waste of $75.7–$101.2 billion annually. Providing performance feedback to hospitalists has been shown to be an effective way to encourage the practice of quality-improvement-focused medicine. There remains limited data regarding the implementation of performance feedback and direct results on hospital laboratory testing spending in the short term. Objective: The objective of this project was to identify whether performance-based feedback on laboratory utilization between both hospitalists and resident teams results in more conservative utilization of laboratory testing. Design, Setting, Participants: This quality improvement project was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center, including both direct-care and house-staff teams. Intervention or Exposure: A weekly performance feedback report was generated and distributed to providers detailing laboratory test utilization by all hospitalists in a ranked system, normalized by the census of patients, for 3 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome measure was cumulative laboratory utilization during the intervention period compared to baseline utilization during the corresponding 3 months in the year prior and the weekly trend in laboratory utilization over 52 weeks. The aggregate laboratory utilization rate during intervention and control time periods was defined as the total number of laboratory tests ordered divided by the total number of patient encounters. Additionally, the cost difference was averaged per quarter and reported. The week-by-week trend in laboratory utilization was evaluated using a statistical process control (SPC) chart. Results: We found that following intervention during January–March 2020, the cumulative complete blood count utilization rate decreased from 5.54 to 4.83 per patient encounter and the basic metabolic panels/CMP utilization rate decreased from 6.65 to 6.11 per patient encounter compared with January–March 2019. This equated to cost savings of ~$42,700 in total for the quarter. Nonrandom variation was seen on SPC charts in weekly laboratory utilization rates for common laboratory tests during the intervention period. Conclusions: We found that our intervention did result in a decrease in laboratory test utilization rates across direct-care and house-staff teams. This study lays promising groundwork for one tool that can be used to eliminate a source of hospital waste and improve the quality and efficiency of patient care.",

A retrospective analysis of all unplanned 7-day readmissions within Hospital Medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center from September 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, was performed. Readmissions were independently analyzed by 2 randomly selected individuals to determine preventability. Discordant reviews were resolved by a third reviewer to reach a consensus. Statistical analysis included 138 unplanned readmissions. The estimated PPR rate was 15.94%. The median age was 62.50 years; 52.90% were female. The most common type of cancer was noncolon GI malignancy (34.06%). Most patients had stage 4 cancer (69.57%) and were discharged home (64.93%). Premature discharge followed by missed opportunities for goals of care discussions were the most cited reasons for potential preventability. These findings highlight areas where care delivery can be improved to mitigate the risk of readmission within the medical oncology population.",

We conducted a prospective study of emergency department HCWs and video-recorded PPE donning and doffing 5 times in simulated patient encounters. Trained coders recorded HCW behaviors according to an evidence-based guide. All 28 participants deviated from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sanctioned donning and doffing protocol order, and most were documented to have (92.85%) self-contaminated at least once during each simulated clinical encounter. Behaviors that compounded self-contamination due to PPE reuse were also observed. Wide variation in PPE donning and doffing behaviors was found among front-line, experienced HCWs. Future work is needed to determine which deviations put HCWs at increased risk for accidental self-contamination and what changes are needed to the CDC protocol for protecting HCW from infections.",

Billing data for all cholecystectomies (ICD9-CM 51.22, 51.23) performed on an inpatient basis in those states on Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older during fiscal year 1992 were examined. The incidence of LC in each state ranged from 2.1 to 3.2/1,000, whereas the incidence of OC ranged from 2.2 to 3.5/1,000. Eleven and one-half percent of LC patients suffered at least one perioperative complications, as did 21.5% of OC patients. There was considerable interstate variation in complication rates. In-hospital mortality was about five times greater of OC (4.5%) than for LC (0.9%). Patients who underwent OC were more likely (9.2%) to be readmitted within 30 days than were LC patients (7.0%). LC seems to be at least as safe as OC in the elderly population. Analyzing Medicare claims data can be useful in uncovering geographic variations in cholecystectomy practice.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary approaches to quality management in mental health utilize methods derived from traditional quality assurance and industrial quality improvement. Quality assurance involves the use of measurable indicators to monitor and evaluate care. Sentinel event indicators refer to high risk events that require review each time they occur. Rate indicators refer to events that are reviewed in the context of trends and patterns. The process of choosing and developing indicators should involve identification of the indicator topic, the monitoring objectives, data collection mechanisms, and responsible staff. As well, indicator data must be evaluated, actions taken, and communication of results must occur. Positive results, like positive diagnostic findings, point to a probability of the presence of a quality related issue. Quality improvement methods have led to a further evolution of efforts to promote quality care. A major goal of quality management is to utilize data to improve clinical decisions. Reaching this important goal is difficult in mental health due to the uncertain relationship between interventions and outcomes of care. In the effort described,, interventions were initiated to improve decisions relating to clinical risk management and resource utilization. Administrative restructuring enabled real-time review procedures and retrospective data analysis focused on decisions related to clinical instability and on permissive and restrictive clinical decisions. Permissive decisions were defined as decisions to allow off-ward privileges for patients whose level of functioning scores suggested the need for greater restriction. Restrictive decisions involved extending hospitalization of low risk patients. Inappropriate permissive or restrictive decisions are undesirable from both risk management and quality-of-care perspectives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Days without acute hospital level of care that occurred while patients were awaiting placement in a rehabilitation or in a chronic care facility were adjusted out of the calculation. Analysis was undertaken to assess the impact of physician age, location of training, Board Certification, practice location, participation in medical training programs, years of experience, and participation in various types of managed-care programs on the level of unnecessary hospital days. Characteristics of the patients and their illnesses were included in the analysis.A large number of unnecessary hospital days occurred although there was no useful segregation of good from poor physician utilizers. Board certification and suburban practice location were associated with a significantly lower percentage of adjusted unnecessary days. Physician members of a closed-panel health maintenance organization had a lower percentage of adjusted unnecessary hospital days (14% vs. 41%, P < .001) when compared with the other primary care internists. Explanations for the difference are discussed.1) The patients of primary care internists are still responsible for a large number of unnecessary hospital days; 2) Utilization review efforts need to become more sophisticated and focused; and 3) A change in physician incentives coupled with appropriate staff and systems possibly would be the simplest, large-scale remedy.",

In a cross-sectional study, we use linear regression to measure associations between provider group characteristics and performance on the 1997 Scorecard. Provider group performance trends (1996-1997) revealed improvement on 6 Scorecard indicators. Regional differences in performance were also shown. Multivariate results indicate that group location in northern California (P = .01), IPA (independent practice association) status (P = .02), older group age (P = .02), and higher mean patient age (P < .01) were independently associated with higher 1997 Scorecard total scores.

The studies were primarily designed to monitor trends in diagnosis, therapy, and outcome of specific oncologic diseases in hospitals and cancer centers. As they reflect the current standards of patient care, patient care evaluation studies have become valid tools of quality management in medicine. In an international pilot project that began in 1996, this approach was redefined to evaluate the impact of current clinical practice guidelines in oncology. Close cooperation between medical societies in the United States and Germany under the coordination of the Commission on Cancer and the Institute of Medical Informatics at the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen was established. This infrastructure for data collection, data management, analysis, and interpretation of results allows for the recognition of international differences in patient care. Our results indicate discrepancies between current state-of-the-art patient care represented by clinical practice guidelines and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the clinical routine. Patient care evaluation studies are designed as exploratory, not confirmatory, trials. In contrast with confirmatory trials, their aims may not always lead to predefined hypotheses. They reflect routine practice and are not the basis of the formal proof of efficacy, although they may contribute to the total body of relevant evidence. Without this comprehensive approach to evaluation, the potential of clinical practice guidelines to improve patient care remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the measurement of outcomes of care and the comparison of outcomes over time within health care providers and risk-adjusted comparisons among providers are important parts of improving quality and cost-effectiveness of care. However, few studies have assessed the costs of measuring outcomes of care. We sought to evaluate the personnel and financial resources spent for a prospective assessment of outcomes of acute hospital care by health professionals in internal medicine. The study included 15 primary care hospitals participating in a longitudinal outcomes measurement program and 2005 patients over an assessment period with an average duration of 6 months. Each hospital project manager participated in a previously-tested structured 30-minute telephone interview. Outcome measures include time spent by the individual job titles in implementing and running the outcomes measurement program. Job-title-specific times were used to calculate costs from the hospitals' perspective. One-time costs (2132 +/- 1352 Euros) and administrative costs (95 +/- 97 Euros per week) varied substantially. Costs per patient were fairly stable at around 20 Euros. We estimated that the total cost for each hospital to assess outcomes of care for accreditation (10 tracer diagnoses over 6 months) would be 9700 Euros and that continuous monitoring of outcomes (5 tracer diagnoses) would cost 12,400 Euros per year. This study suggests that outcomes of acute hospital care can be assessed with limited resources and that standardized training programs would reduce variability in overall costs. This study should help hospital decision makers to estimate the necessary funding for outcomes measurement initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Steadily increasing numbers of private, not-for-profit, and public agencies are releasing quality of care and financial information to enhance the market power of those purchasing America's health services. These sources range widely from the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A growing interest in publicly disclosing performance information that concerns providers, as recently recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on patient safety, until now has only achieved a modest impact. A major exception is in those metropolitan areas where acute-care facilities experience intense competition for patient admissions. Although the comparative quality and cost information currently available is for the most part in the public interest, it is concluded that, in the foreseeable future, these report cards as now structured will not result in any significant enhancement in access, improvement in quality, or reduction in cost. Options to encourage more public disclosure explored in this paper are Congress potentially passing legislation (a) to establish a Center for Patient Safety within the US Department of Health and Human Services as recommended by the recent Institute of IOM study, or (b) empowering the SEC beyond its current mandate to collect and disseminate all pertinent quality of care and cost information on every provider in the United States. The latter alternative would include user-friendly, comparative analyses to be provided on the Internet and elsewhere and would make readily available information from HEDIS, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery studies, cost comparisons based on Medicare cost reports and SEC filings, and other similar sources.",

Methodological aspects of the study were that (1) AE monitoring was to become an everyday activity of ward physicians; (2) the physicians were to express their opinions concerning the causality of each AE, which was to allow the systematic detection of adverse drug reactions and unexplained AEs; (3) the surveillance diary was to include all AEs and all prescriptions, thus allowing prescription-event monitoring; (4) the time trends of unexplained AEs were to be monitored using control cards. The experiences were discontinued because the necessary investments were attributed to other competing priorities. It follows that it is essential to develop an awareness that AE surveillance requires continuous involvement insofar as it is an essential element of quality of care.",

The degree to which we are successful in using these systems is limited only by our ability to ask the right questions. In this study, computerized patient records were used to evaluate the uniformity in the prescribing patterns for oral corticosteroids among house staff and attending physicians as a measure of the adequacy of resident supervision in the outpatient setting. Retrospective analysis of the records of 771 outpatients receiving prescriptions for oral corticosteroid preparations over 1 year in a large tertiary-care university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center indicated different prescribing patterns for attending physicians and house staff. Additionally, it was noted that house staff tended to manage more complex patients than did attending physicians. We further evaluated the clinical outcomes of these patients to assess the quality, appropriateness, and comparability of care within cohorts of patients and to determine the degree to which resident supervision may have affected outcomes. The study results suggest that there is an opportunity to improve the management of patients treated with oral corticosteroid therapy by increasing staff physician involvement either through direct care of the most complex cases or through enhanced resident supervision.",

The authors conducted a prospective study of different sampling strategies for evaluating head of bed (HOB) elevation and oral care. There was no significant difference between morning and evening shift HOB elevation compliance rates (P = .47). If oral care was performed at least once during a 12-hour shift, there was an 87% probability that it also was performed at least twice. If oral care was performed at least twice during a 12-hour shift, then there was a 93% probability that chlorhexidine oral care was performed at least once. The results of this study suggest that sampling HOB elevation twice as compared with once daily is unlikely to change the estimate of performance, oral care need not be frequently sampled, and high oral care compliance may predict chlorhexidine oral care compliance.",

The Hip Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score, adapted from the widely used Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, were collected preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. From these data, the health system determined that patients were experiencing significant improvement in 4 of 5 scales.

Measure selection was based on review of the research literature, clinical guidelines, and consultation with key stakeholders. Development and validation used the data from 261 hospitals in a split-sample design. Measures were risk adjusted using Premier’s CareScience methodologies or mean peer value based on Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group assignment. High variability was found in resource utilization across facilities. Validation of the measures using item-to-total correlations (range = 0.27-0.78), Cronbach α (.88), and Spearman rank correlation (0.92) showed high reliability and discriminatory power. Because of the level of variability observed among hospitals, this study suggests that there is opportunity for facilities to design successful waste reduction programs targeting cardiac-device procedures.",

Based on ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% and absence of a defibrillator, the physicians were prompted for an action: electrophysiology consultation, EF evaluation, or \"not indicated.\" Although the number of patients screened remained stable at nearly 6000 per month, consultations and echocardiograms peaked early but returned to a low steady state by 10 months. The number of actual device implants did not increase appreciably as a result of this program. Implementation of a real-time EHR screening algorithm in a busy clinical practice is feasible and generally unobtrusive, without an effect on productivity. Its impact on adherence to guideline-based recommendation is not notable in this case. The number of resulting actionable items declines dramatically and plateaus by 10 months, affording an opportunity to cycle, rather than add, other screening protocols.",

The study was conducted in a 60 000-visit emergency department (ED) of an urban tertiary referral hospital. The authors' airway registry database was used to identify patients requiring airway management; 433 patients met study criteria, 281 (65%) were intubated in the ED, and 152 (35%) were intubated prior to arrival. ET confirmation was documented for 270 (96%) patients intubated in the ED and 52 (34%) patients intubated before arrival (P < .0001).The rate was higher for patients intubated by emergency medical services (40/64 [63%]) than for interhospital transfers (12/88 [14%]) (P < .0001). Documentation of ET placement has implications for patient care and safety. This study indicates that educational interventions are warranted to improve physicians' awareness of the importance of documenting correct tube placement.",

    "abstract": "We wished to determine if a claims-based method for severity adjustment would predict mortality or survival in pneumonia based on age, gender, and secondary diagnoses. We used a discriminant analysis model of severity of illness developed from Medicare Part A claims data. Our data base was taken from a hospitalized population age 65 years or older coded as DRG 89 (pneumonia with complications/comorbidities). There were 35,677 cases with a mortality = 11.2% in the derivation cohort from 1989 to 1990, and 19,915 cases with a mortality = 9.8% in the validation cohort from 1991. In the derivation cohort, 98% of patients predicted to live, lived, whereas 18% of patients predicted to die, died. Of the three variables, secondary diagnoses had greatest explanatory power. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the model performed best at 40% survival. Results were confirmed with the 1991 validation cohort. The model could be applied to hospitals with as few as 172 discharges. This simple, claims-based method can predict survival in pneumonia. It may be useful in selecting medical records for intensified review of medical quality.",

Severity of illness models were developed pre dicting adverse events following cholecystectomy in pa tients with and without bile duct exploration. Outcome measures included 17 nonfatal adverse events and death within 30 days of admission. Adverse event rates were 23.2% for cases with bile duct exploration and 14.4% for cases without bile duct exploration.

These \"voluntary\" alliances that are now being forged as an amalgam of health providers and insurance underwriters, often foreshadow the pow erful, geographically linked regional health networks that are evolving into oligopolies throughout the United States. As the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are unable to appropriately analyze the efficacy of most prospective mergers, the American health field increasingly can expect monopo listic environments. In this process, the public eventu ally may demand the formation of state health services commissions. Within this framework, the German decentralized, multipayer, multitier approach, which historically is self-governing and allows for negotiating reimbursement rates between insurers and providers, offers a preferred option to the traditional American public utility model.",

Although all QI initiatives included some type of physician-directed component and patient-directed components, only half included allied health professionals and one quarter included pharmacy-directed components. Interactive physician continuing medical education was associated with plans whose members were concentrated in only 1 or 2 counties. The authors noted wide variation in content, format, inclusion of incentives, inclusion of other health professionals, and outcome goals. The variation in QI approaches by each of the managed care organizations suggests that there is a dearth of information on appropriate and cost-effective methods to improve pediatric asthma quality at the plan level.",

    "abstract": "“The office is closed at this time and will reopen at 9 am tomorrow morning. If this is an emergency, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.” There has been an important evolution in the practice of medicine in the past decade. An article included in this issue, “Exploring New Intake Models for the Emergency Department,” clearly highlights the emergence of the emergency department (ED) as a primary portal of entry for many patients. Within the context of the issues raised by the authors we must answer the following questions: “Why does the percentage of nonurgent ED visits as a percentage of overall visits continue to rise (ie, 10% in 2002 and 13.9% in 2005)?” “Who uses the ED for nonurgent care?” “Where are the opportunities to reduce ED overuse?” The National Quality Forum’s National Priorities Partnership (NPP) has identified eliminating overuse while ensuring the delivery of appropriate care as one of 6 national priority areas. The NPP envisions health care that promotes better health and more affordable care by continually and safely reducing the burden of unscientific, inappropriate, and excessive care including tests, drugs, procedures, office and hospital visits, and hospital stays. Making overuse a national concern will reduce harm, disparities, disease burden, and waste. Assuring access to appropriate care on a timely basis will also reduce more serious chronic disease consequences downstream. Examples include hypertension, congestive heart failure, and early detection of malignant disease. Potentially preventable ED visits is one of the 9 areas targeted by the overuse committee of the NPP. The Commonwealth Fund 2008 National Scorecard on US performance noted that 26% of adults went to the ED in the previous 2 years for conditions that could have been treated by their regular doctor, if available. The United States fared the worst in a comparison with 6 other countries (Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada). Nationally, 60 million, or half of the 120 million annual ED visits, are potentially avoidable. In 2006, there were 119.2 million visits to hospital EDs, 15.9 million of which were considered emergent or urgent. Emergency services are often the only alternative for the uninsured or underinsured as their access to primary care services is limited. However, the New England Healthcare Institute notes that lack of timely appointments and after-hours care also drives patients to the ED. Primary care practices often instruct patients to seek care in the ED. Patients can receive care in the ED anytime—regardless of the severity of their condition—and in view of the wide array of services available in the ED, patients can receive immediate feedback about their condition. These factors contribute to the fact that all payer groups and age groups contribute to the issue of nonurgent care in the ED. This trend applies to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in particular. Insured patients with a primary care alternative also inappropriately use the ED; one third of ED visits are made during regular business hours when primary care offices are open. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, the estimated nonurgent, preventable/avoidable ED visits in Massachusetts in 2006 were made by 22 000 patients with private insurance, 15 000 with Medicaid, 10 000 uninsured, and 9000 Medicare patients. The average cost of an ED visit is $540 more than the cost of an office visit. If we can reduce ED overuse (ie, if all 60 million avoidable ED visits were redirected to a less costly setting), there is an opportunity to improve care and a potential savings of $32 billion. Overuse of nonurgent ED services results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions in 5.5% of cases as well as higher volumes of more expensive testing. The unintended consequences of harm inherent from inappropriate testing, procedures, and hospitalizations have been well documented and affect quality and patient safety. The frequent lack of follow-up on recommendations given to the patient in the ED and poor communication with the primary care physician (if indeed there is one) add to the concerns of poor coordination of care—particularly in the elderly and patients with chronic illnesses—and ED revisits. To ensure quality, safety, and patient satisfaction when the patient arrives in the ED, the recommendations inherent in the Welch and Davidson article in this journal should be carefully reviewed. Timely access to primary care services must be a focus of quality improvement efforts if we",

Although the data collection is useful, it does not lend itself to corrective actions on a concurrent basis. Carney Hospital has developed a data base that monitors patient status daily in order to identify when a length of stay problem is developing and when corrective actions are succeeding. The Patient Tracking System is an interactive computer report utilized by Continuing Care staff, Utilization Review staff, and clinical managers on the patient care units. It is a caseload register that operates from the admission transfer discharge (A/T/D) system of the hospital and sorts inpatients by discharge planning status, length of stay, discharge planning worker, and nursing unit. It is the basis for a weekly management review that identifies numbers of patients and average length of stay to date of key groups of patients proven to impact the overall length of stay in the hospital. Carney Hospital has successfully utilized this system to alert managers to any length of stay \"creep,\" to identify the sources of the length-of-stay problem, and to mobilize key personnel to take corrective actions. The system is easy to use and is an effective length-of-stay management tool.",

    "abstract": "Objective: A quality assurance effort to evaluate the use of pulmonary function tests by primary care physicians. Specifically, to examine the patient's un derstanding of the test, the types of tests physicians order, and the appropriateness of the ordered tests for answering questions posed by physicians. Design: Concurrent chart review, clinical interviews, and pa tient interviews. Setting: Community teaching hos pital. Patients: 101 consecutive inpatients and out patients, referred to the Pulmonary Function Labo ratory over a consecutive 5-month period. Measurements: Interview of the patient by a pulmo nary technician. Interview of the primary care phy sician by a pulmonary physician. Interview, where applicable, with the house staff. Final assessment by a pulmonary physician. Main Results: 64% of the patients understood the purpose of the test and 49% of the patients felt there was some potential benefit to be derived from participating in the testing. Sixty five percent of the physicians ordered specific tests on their patients. Seventy-two percent of physicians planned on using the data obtained from testing to formulate treatment decisions. Fifty percent of the interviewed physicians said they were using the re sults for decisions regarding further diagnostic eval uation and/or treatment. The reviewing pulmonary physician considered that 31 % of the pulmonary func tion tests ordered were appropriate for the goals de fined by the requesting physician. Sixty-eight percent of the ordered tests could have had some aspects of ordering improved, and 1 % of the testing was unnec essary. Conclusions: 1) There is a need to increase patient understanding of the indications and potential benefits of participating in pulmonary function test ing. 2) When physicians-in-training are involved in the process of requesting pulmonary function tests, greater staff-level supervision and involvement should be present. 3) There is a need to increase physician knowledge regarding the appropriate pul monary function tests that should be requested for specific clinical questions and situations. 4) The re questing form for pulmonary function testing may serve to remind and educate the physician, while documenting the indications for the testing and the physician's efforts. 5. Quality assurance/utilization review efforts can be combined with educational ef forts that could result in a diminution of the deficien cies.",

According to this descriptive survey, Medicaid inpatient utilization review programs vary widely in authority, approach and focus, reflecting state payment system incentives, health and hospital system characteristics, and provider practice norms. More than half of the states with Medicaid diagnosis-related group systems contract with a Medicare Peer Review Organization. State programs are developing complementary clinical and data analytic approaches, advised by multidisciplinary utilization review committees, and are moving from random review to strategies that focus on specific types of admissions/procedures, and shift as provider practices and utilization patterns change. Utilization review strategies also support payment incentives and system features, e.g., by targeting outliers, readmissions and transfers, and short stays. Overall, programs are becoming more flexible, targeted, and interactive. Trends and suggestions for refining utilization review programs for diagnosis-related group systems are presented.",

    "abstract": "The value and necessity of performing right heart catheterizations for coronary artery disease have been increasingly questioned. Preliminary analyses of the procedure among Medicare and Medicaid patients in New York State revealed significant inter-hospital variations in the frequencies with which such catheterizations were performed. These data suggested that right heart catheterizations (RHC) were being performed routinely. Medicare and Medicaid claims data for bilateral catheterizations were analyzed before and after an educational intervention program involving the state's 53 catheterization laboratories. The educational intervention was multifaceted and consisted of disseminating suggested guidelines established with the assistance of the New York State Chapter of the American College of Cardiology, the Committee on Cardiovascular Disease of the Medical Society of the State of New York, and the Cardiac Advisory Council of the New York State Department of Health. Posteducational intervention assessments were made over a 4-year period. The baseline data for 1992 demonstrated that 10 (18.4%) laboratories had performed RHC routinely (70-100%) on Medicare and Medicaid patients undergoing catheterization. In contrast, 34 (64.2%) laboratories performed RHC in less than 20% of their Medicare cases, whereas 39 (73.5%) did so among Medicaid cases. Eighteen (34%) laboratories performed RIHC in less than 10% of Medicare cases. These data indicated that there was significant inter-hospital variation in the frequency with which RHC was performed. Beginning in 1993, ongoing educational meetings and conferences were held with all laboratories, but especially with the 10 that were at the high end of the RHC performance level. As a result of this ongoing intervention, the rate of RHC among Medicare patients fell from 89/100,000 in 1992 to 65/100,000 beneficiaries in 1996. From another perspective, the percentage of catheterized Medicare patients undergoing RHC fell from 30.5% in 1992 to 17.4% in 1996. The decline among the 10 laboratories was even more dramatic; the percentage of catheterized Medicare patients undergoing RHC fell from 89.1% in 1992 to 31.6% in 1996. The parallel drop for Medicaid patients over the same time period was from 92.8 to 32.7%. The results of the study indicate that many previously performed RHC in patients with coronary artery disease were routine and not medically indicated. The dramatic decreases in RHC documented in this study over a 4-year period demonstrate the success of quality improvement efforts jointly undertaken by providers and a peer review organization.",

We performed a cross-sectional study in 3 medical centers. Three hundred three patients undergoing surgical repair of traumatic femoral neck fracture were included. Trained nurses gathered data by patient and proxy interview and by chart abstraction. Multivariate analysis was performed to obtain an explanatory model for each outcome. Then, the additional contribution of each of the centers to the explanatory power of the model was examined. The outcomes were mortality, functional capacity, post-operative complications, and length of stay. Explanatory variables included were sociodemographic details, comorbidity indices, preoperative functional capacity, depression, and cognition. The results demonstrated that center A was a \"good\" outlier for mortality rate but, in contrast, was a \"bad\" outlier for complication rate and length of stay. Center B was a \"bad\" outlier for functional capacity but a \"good\" outlier for length of stay. We conclude that outcome studies for quality assurance programs should include all relevant outcomes, as the assumption that one major outcome may be representative for quality of care assessment may be misleading.",

The goal of obtaining the information was to use it in development of a formal Outcomes Assessment Program for the service. The design was a semi-structured interview format, with entry into a computer database and qualitative analysis of responses obtained. Participants included all providers (n = 26) and a purposive sample of external contacts (n = 10) of an academic Department of Psychiatry. Results indicated differences among categories of external contacts regarding priorities of types of outcomes (general health, general mental health, disorder specific, or patient satisfaction) to be shared and absence of concordance within the service about these priorities. No guidelines were available about preferred instruments, though the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale emerged as instruments to be prioritized in the service's program. Physicians and nonphysicians differed in their perceptions as to important barriers and advantages of a clinical outcomes assessment program. In conclusion, the survey raised providers' awareness of outcomes assessment and provided information that was used in developing the service's Outcomes Assessment Program. Components of the Program that were influenced by survey input were priorities of outcomes instruments to be included and their potential audiences, time sequence of Program development, time to be allotted to outcomes assessment in clinical encounters, and content of educational experiences for providers.",

Prostate cancer incidence rates were used to estimate the number of Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 years and older with prostate cancer, the denominators for the procedure rates, in the hospital service area of each intervention and control hospital, and in each state and their controls. After interventions, significant reductions in the state-specific radical prostatectomy rates were achieved in the intervention hospitals in 2 states and in 1 of the 4 intervention states where statewide interventions had been implemented. Similar reductions were seen in the control hospitals in 3 other individual states and 8 states combined where hospital-based interventions were implemented. These changes in the procedure rates were most likely due to the national decline in the incidence of prostate cancer, not the PRO interventions.",

We illustrate our approach using the results of a risk/medical management study performed at an acute-care hospital. Traditional risk management (RM) often focuses retrospectively on adverse events and may miss opportunities to prevent errors related to omissions and delays in care. Close-to-real-time utilization management (UM) activity offers ready potential to improve quality and reduce medical malpractice--but only if UM can work synergistically with RM. It is our conclusion that hospitals can implement systematic processes to identify and intervene in patterns of omissions and delays and improve the communication and synergy among stakeholders and thereby improve patient safety and reduce their medical malpractice risks.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the impact of clinically relevant quality improvement activities (QIA) is important to managed care organizations; yet, turnover in enrollment can reduce the data available for analyses, thus decreasing the chance that a difference post-QIA will be detected. The Combined Quality Improvement Ratio (CQuIR) uses matching of patients into pairs pre-and post-QIA to systematically and validly increase the data included in the analysis for evaluation of the QIA. Using a paired cohort study design, 456 pairs of patients with diabetes were identified using the Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) specifications. Patients having retinal examinations were identified pre and post-QIA. The change in retinal examination rates was analyzed and results compared using repeated pairs (RP), matched pairs (MP), and combined pairs (CP). The CQuIR methodology (which uses CP = RP + MP) resulted in an increase in sample size (n = 456 [CPI versusn = 156 [RP] and n = 300 [MP]) and consequently an increase in power (0.92 [CP] versus 0.38 [RPI and 0.82 [MPI) and a decrease in the confidence interval range (0.97 [CP] versus 2.06 [RP] and 1.14 [MPI). The CQuIR uses a statistically valid approach to increase the data available for the evaluation of QLAs.",

Originally developed for industry, many of the principles of action learning can easily be adapted in settings where clinical practitioners can take advantage of each individual's knowledge and experience.",

    "abstract": "Resuming elective surgery amid shortages of rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests and personal protective equipment, while protecting patient and staff safety, posed a challenge at the study institution. Many hospital systems implemented testing of all presurgical patients, using results from tests performed 3 or more days prior to surgery. Among asymptomatic persons, the percent positive rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tests in the region did not appear to justify this practice. Instead of universal preoperative COVID-19 testing, the authors elected to mitigate risk by implementing a preoperative program including 14 days of recommended patient self-quarantine and social distancing. For those unable to complete this program and for those undergoing high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures, targeted rapid polymerase chain reaction testing within 2 days of surgery was performed. Data from the initial 4 months suggests that this approach was noninferior to universal preoperative testing with regard to postoperative COVID-19 detection and patient exposure-related COVID-19 cases among hospital staff.",

The authors administered the Mini-Z burnout survey to clinicians and staff (n = 160) at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Structural equation modeling was used to examine workplace stressors that predicted burnout, and the pathway between burnout and 2 meaningful quality outcomes was tested: (1) lack of compassion and (2) thoughts of leaving one's job or specialty. Females and advanced practice practitioners had the highest prevalence of burnout. The structural equation model achieved excellent model fit, and indicated that workplace atmosphere, control over workload, values alignment, time for documentation, and team efficiency underlie burnout in this sample. The pathways from burnout to lack of compassion and to thoughts of leaving one's job were significant.",

One-to-one propensity score matching was performed based on age, gender, Injury Severity Score, comorbidity index, and critical illness on admission. Outcomes included orders for geriatrics-focused quality indicators, as well as hospital mortality and length of stay. Wilcoxon rank-sum test (continuous variables) and chi-square or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) were used to assess differences. Propensity score matching resulted in 290 matched pairs. The intervention group had decreased use of restraints (P = 0.04) and acetaminophen (P = 0.01), and earlier physical therapy (P = 0.01). Three patients died in the intervention group compared with 14 in the control (P = 0.0068).

One-hundred twenty interns from 14 training programs completed 2 PSERs each. Before the PSER, 5% reported experience entering an event report. Following the PSER, all interns had participated in entering an event report. Mean learner-reported comfort in identifying PS hazards improved significantly (6.3 ± 1.57 to 8.0 ± 1.2; P < 0.001). Individual safety hazards were identified by between 6% and 100% of teams. Mean observer-rated teamwork was lower than learner-rated teamwork (41.5 ± 5.18 versus 45.92 ± 3.87; P = 0.01).

It allows a large group of people to participate in a complex project without the need for structured meetings spread out over a long period of time. The result, a blend of the strong points of quality improvement (inclusive, using the wisdom of a group of people) with a speedy, low overhead process, seems to address the concerns that have slowed the acceptance of the quality improvement process in many organizations thus far.",

Value-based payments emphasize the need to prioritize quality measures and align across organizations. This article describes the process Humana undertook to reduce the quality measurement burden, refine measure consistency across the organization, ensure alignment with national standards, and relate quality measures to improved health outcomes within the health plan. Of the 1100 measures identified in use at Humana, 699 were duplicative or inconsistent. The biggest challenge was reaching consensus on similar measures while staying within regulatory and accrediting agency constraints. After review, physicians, quality experts, and business leaders prioritized 208 quality measures grounded in evidence, supported by credible organizations, and impactful to health outcomes. A governance committee was created to provide ongoing, proactive quality measure review. These efforts allow Humana to better support value-based payments by reducing complexity and helping physicians focus on meaningful measures.",

Following development of the OP structure in 2013, the authors have coordinated the components of outcomes data and reporting, clinical performance review, outcomes committee, knowledge translation, and implementation science programs to impact practice. Through routine provider updates, educational strategies, and prioritization of focused projects that include structured implementation plans, the model of PICU care has been improved. Described herein is the development of the process to evaluate intensive care unit outcomes and address the need for programmatic change through implementation science principles. Such a process may be of use in other PICUs.",

To assess performance, the authors developed benchmarks for 11 measures and compared performance of initiative and benchmark practices. Initiative practices outperformed benchmark practices on 8 measures in 2015 (between 6.3 and 17.7 percentage points) and 9 measures in 2016 (between 1.7 and 20 percentage points). Initiative practices improved significantly on 7 measures from 2015 to 2016 (between 3.3 and 8.6 percentage points). For 3 measures, the improvement was greater than benchmark practices that reported the same measures in a 2-year period (between 1 and 8.9 percentage points).

Few facilities currently use SACs, and there is no literature examining their interrater reliability. Two independent raters assigned frequency, actual harm, and potential harm ratings to a sample of patient safety reports. An actual and potential SAC were determined. Percent agreement and Cohen's κ were calculated. Substantial agreement existed for the actual SAC (κ = 0.626, P < .001), fair agreement for the potential SAC (κ = 0.266, P < .001), and low agreement for potential harm (κ = 0.171, P = .002). Although there is subjectivity in all aspects of assigning SACs, the greatest is in potential severity. This presents a problem when using the potential SAC and is in agreement with previous literature showing significant subjectivity in determining potential harm. An operational framework is needed to strengthen reliability.",

Participants (142 physicians, 53 nurse practitioners, and 9 physician assistants in family medicine, internal medicine, and cardiology) described their management of 4 clinical vignettes, first based on their own practice (unguided), then using care algorithms (guided). The authors quantitatively estimated variation in management. Cardiologists demonstrated 17% lower variation in unguided responses than generalists (fold-change 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68, 0.97]), and those who agreed that practice variation can realistically be reduced had 16% lower variation than those who did not (fold-change 0.84 [CI, 0.71, 0.99]). A 17% reduction in variation was observed for guided responses compared with baseline (unguided) responses (fold-change 0.83 [CI, 0.76, 0.90]). Differences were otherwise similar across clinician subgroups and attitudes. Unwarranted practice variation was similar across most clinician subgroups. The authors conclude that care algorithms can reduce variation in management.",

In most regions of the country, practices received separate confidential feedback reports of claims-based measures from multiple payers, which varied in content and provided an incomplete picture of a practice’s patient panel. Over CPC’s last few years, participating payers in several regions resisted the tendency to guard data as a proprietary asset, instead working collaboratively to produce aggregated performance feedback for practices. Aggregating claims data across payers is a potential game changer in improving practice performance because doing so potentially makes the data more accessible, comprehensive, and useful. Understanding lessons learned and key challenges can help other initiatives that are aggregating claims or clinical data across payers for primary care practices or other types of providers.",

An academic team was contracted to assist DHCS in developing the strategy, which also was informed by extensive stakeholder input, an advisory committee, and a comprehensive inventory of DHCS quality improvement (QI) activities. From 2012 to 2018, the strategy included 129 unique QI activities. Most activities were intended to deliver more effective, efficient, affordable care or to advance disease prevention. This qualitative assessment of the DHCS Quality Strategy provides insights that may inform other Medicaid programs or large health systems as they develop quality strategies.",

In this quality improvement project, the authors developed an electronic medical record (EMR)-based order set with precise instructions and anticipatory guidance for inpatient bowel preparation before colonoscopy. The current study is a nonrandomized intervention study. The authors compared 2 groups: an intervention group using a newly developed, consensus-based, standardized EMR bowel preparation order set and a control group using previously existing EMR bowel preparation orders. Bowel preparation outcomes were followed over the course of 16 months. The aim was to improve inpatient colonoscopy bowel preparation, as evaluated by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, procedure delays, and length of hospital stay. We additionally evaluated the groups’ demographics and patient-level factors. A total of 459 inpatient colonoscopies were evaluated over a 16-month period. The intervention group consisted of 227 inpatient colonoscopies, while the control group consisted of 232. The intervention group showed superior Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score and decreased length of hospital stay. The number of adequate bowel preparations increased in the intervention group when compared to the control group from 77% to 86%. The creation of an EMR-based order set is a low-cost and sustainable action that can be easily implemented throughout a hospital system.",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of health care quality assessment, quality assurance and safety grading systems play a vital role in gauging hospital performance and communicating results to the general public. The primary objective of this review is to analyze the hospitals in California through the lens of Leapfrog Safety Grades and discuss the complex interplay of geographical location, hospital size, and larger system affiliation status. Leapfrog Safety Grades, hospital characteristics, and geographic information were collected. Hospitals were categorized by geographic region, size, rural/urban classification, and larger system affiliation status. Of the 284 hospitals included in the study, 95 were given a grade of A, 68 given a grade of B, 93 given a grade of C, 23 given a grade of D, 2 given a grade of F, and 3 were not graded. The vast majority of hospitals in California were classified as urban, with 183 falling under this category. The average number of hospital beds and SD was 227 ± 47.57. On average, hospitals that received a grade of D were significantly smaller in size than those that received a grade of A, while hospitals that received a grade of B or C were similar in size. A total of 107 hospitals were affiliated with a larger health care system. About 70% of hospitals affiliated with a system received an A or B grade, while 50% of unaffiliated hospitals received an A or B grade. Results of this study demonstrate a need for improving health care access and quality in medically underserved urban and rural areas. Hospitals affiliated with a larger health care system received higher grades than unaffiliated hospitals, suggesting that affiliation may also play a role in the implementation and mitigation of factors that contribute to Leapfrog Safety Grades.",

    "abstract": "Handoffs involve the transfer of patient information and responsibility for care between health care professionals. The purpose of the current scoping review was (1) to describe handoff studies with education as part of the intervention and (2) to explore the role of handoff educational interventions in sustaining handoff improvements. This scoping review utilized previously published systematic reviews and a structured, systematic search of 5 databases (January 2006–June 2020). Articles were identified, and data were extracted by pairs of trained, independent reviewers. The search identified 74 relevant articles, most published after 2015 (70%) and conducted in the United States (76%). Almost all of the studies (99%) utilized instruction, 66% utilized skills practice, 89% utilized a memory aid, and 43% utilized reinforcement. However, few studies reported using education theory or followed accepted tenets of curriculum development. There has been a substantial increase over time in reporting actual handoff behavior change (17%–68%) and a smaller but important increase in reporting patient outcomes (11%–18%). Thirty-five percent of studies (26/74) had follow-up for 6 months or more. Twelve studies met the criteria for sustained change, which were follow-up for 6 months or more and achieving statistically significant improvements in either handoff skills/processes or patient outcomes at the conclusion of the study. All 12 studies with sustained change used multi-modal educational interventions, and reinforcement was more likely to be used in these studies than all others (75%, 9/12) versus (37%, 23/62), P = 0.015. Future handoff intervention efforts that include education should use education theory to guide development and include needs assessment and goals and measurable objectives. Educational interventions should be multi-modal and include reinforcement. Future research studies should measure actual handoff behavior change (skills/process) and patient outcomes, include follow-up for more than 6 months, and use education reporting guidelines.",

Codman’s pioneering call for surgeons to take open responsibility for patient care, a concept integral to the emergence and leadership of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Codman’s End Result Idea, originating in the early 20th century, laid the groundwork for professional responsibility and accountability in surgical practice, catalyzing the formation of the ACS. His innovative use of the “end result” technique at Massachusetts General Hospital highlighted significant variability in surgical outcomes, spurring debates on specialization and accountability. The ACS, under John Bowman’s leadership, aimed to ensure optimal care through defined standards and verification mechanisms. Codman’s Bone Sarcoma Registry, initiated in 1920, marked an early attempt at quality assessment and improvement through data collection. Despite facing resistance, Codman’s vision laid the foundation for modern quality initiatives in surgical care. ACS programs, spanning trauma care to cancer treatment and beyond, have significantly enhanced patient outcomes while reducing costs. Looking forward, advancing surgical quality requires measuring quality, leveraging trusted data, embracing change management, fostering collaboration, and empowering specialists. The future of surgical care depends on collective efforts to uphold standards that ensure optimal care for all.",

While performing retrospective chart reviews, the collaborative practice environment fostered in the Emergency Department at Reston Hospital Center, (wherein the physician and nursing staff are schooled in Deming's Quality Improvement-FOCUS-PDCA-methodology, and the concepts of \"patient care clinical process ownership,\" and \"professional job enlargement and job enrichment\" diffuse throughout the Emergency Services Systems design), identified a potential problem with tetanus immunization related to existing standing orders. Initial data collection utilized count-between methodology. Over a 31-day period, 216 patients who required tetanus immunization were identified. Appropriate tetanus toxoid administration was \"missed\" 20 times, with a median of 9 appropriate tetanus immunizations before an administration was \"missed.\" Flow chart analysis of the tetanus toxioid administration process identified the sources of variation of that process. A pilot PDCA cycle was instituted to redefine the process, control the variability, and measure the results. Upon completion of the third PDCA cycle of 31 days, 367 patients were identified who required tetanus immunization. Appropriate tetanus toxoid administration was \"missed\" 3 times with a median of 120 appropriate tetanus immunizations before an administration was \"missed.\" Conclusions include: a) The appearance of special cause variation, (diaster situations), must be recognized as having the potential to disrupt healthcare process improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The relationship is much stronger for cost per capita especially when the range of SH expenditures is 31-55%, or 43 +/- 12%, of total expenditures. This article hypothesizes that maximum system efficiency occurs when the funding structure of the delivery system reflects a 57%:43% (community [C]/SH) ratio. This ratio was the mean for the 50 states of the United States in 1997, when the national mean SR was 13 per 100,000 of general population. This ratio is identical to the C-to-SH inpatient bed ratio derived theoretically in a previously reported study focusing on fractal (self-similar on all scales) demand for mental health services. The potential for national saving with the redistribution of funding may be as high as $4.5 billion per year, or 23% of SMHA expenditures.",

Initial analyses examined clinics at 4 levels of involvement: withdrew from the project, initial QI proficiency, advanced QI proficiency, and consultant independent. The initial and advanced stages were collapsed into 1 group (consultant dependent) and compared with consultant-independent clinics for multivariate logistic regression. In the multivariate models, 3 factors significantly predicted the clinic being consultant independent: staffing level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-2.2), the number of participating months (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0), and baseline QI readiness (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0-1.3). Receiver operator curves were calculated for significant predictors; the strongest predictor was staffing (c statistic = .79). Clinics that are organizationally prepared for QI, allow adequate time to adopt QI methods into their organization, and provide adequate QI staffing are more likely to independently apply QI methods.",

    "abstract": "A new recipe is presented, splitting quality improvement into 4 levels. The Q1 level corresponds to the everyday processes that guide our daily work flow. Q2 corresponds to commonly thought of outcome measures such as HEDIS criteria. Q3 relates to the executive functions that permit seasoned clinicians to draw generalizations about care for individual patients by synthesizing large amounts of data from both psychosocial as well as classical history/physical sources. Finally Q4 reflects more population-based quality improvement activities. Examples are given for each. Each of these levels requires a different approach for improvement activities. Each must be seen in the context of an expanded \"quality compass\" and in the paradigm of the PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT cycle of quality improvement. Finally, a practical application of how this could be instituted at a Family Practice residency is given.",

A total of 2801 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and their referring physicians were identified from the Iowa Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database during 1989-1996. The Iowa Physician Inventory was used to collect information on characteristics of referring physicians. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate characteristics of the referring physicians and their practice environment to explain surgical referral behavior. Affiliation with physicians' networks and professional diversity among area specialists were associated with increased referrals to surgeons more likely to perform breast-conserving surgery. Promoting interaction among physicians, particularly among those with different specialties, may increase the diffusion of new behaviors into clinical practice.",

Structured questionnaires were distributed. A total of 238/339 (70.2%) were vaccinated. In multivariate analysis, respiratory illness during precedent winter (odds ratio [OR] 3.146, P = .007), working in a medium hospital (OR 2.4, P = .003), and an attending resident with an infectious diseases subspecialty (OR 20.473, P = .007) were associated with a higher vaccination rate. Institutional email or portal messages were associated with decreased vaccination rates (OR = 0.259, P = .007). The leading reason for vaccination was “to stay healthy” (73.5%). Recruiting experts in the field, providing up-to-date information, and increasing management’s involvement could encourage vaccination among health care employees.",

Eighteen physicians were ranked separately according to percentage of top-box scores on HCAHPS and IPSQ. There was an inverse relationship between physician rank for the 2 surveys according to Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ = −0.36, P = .15). Qualitative subanalysis indicated that although “physician interaction” was the most common reason for negative comments on HCAHPS, “ancillary staff” and “workflow” concerns were common on IPSQ. The outpatient setting remains a critical component in achieving high-quality orthopedic care.

    "abstract": "2021 Summit Snapshot Total attendees: 3407 Member attendees: 1843 Power Huddles: 89 Posters: 57 Overall member satisfaction: 91% (In-person and virtual attendees at live sessions)The 2021 Vizient® Connections Summit brought together more than 3400 members, suppliers, and others to celebrate their work in caring for and supporting patients and communities during the pandemic, provide insights into how to sustain top performance in quality and accountability, and offer perspectives on potential systemic changes and how organizations should prepare for them. Held in November 2021, the summit debuted the hybrid format, with both in-person and virtual options. Members pivoted with Vizient to make this format a huge success. Offering 3 ways to participate, the meeting allowed attendees and speakers to join the summit in person in Las Vegas, attend live virtually, or watch asynchronously through on-demand content—with all formats offering continuing education credits. All participants had access to 89 educational sessions and 57 poster presentations. This innovative format proved quite successful, with attendance almost evenly split between in-person and online. Attendees expressed strong approval for content (91% satisfaction), presentation effectiveness (95% satisfaction), and session format (95% satisfaction). The material represented the best of the best from Vizient members, who submitted 372 abstracts—an impressive number given many competing challenges, priorities, and a national pandemic. This response demonstrates a continued high level of passion and dedication for sharing stories and helping others during these unprecedented times. With attendees gathering in person for the first time in 2 years, Vizient members took time to connect, engage with, and learn from one another, sharing successes and proven strategies for improving patient care—even in the midst of a nonstop pandemic. Hardly a \"sit-and-get\" gathering, the summit was highly interactive, with ample opportunities for in-person and virtual attendees to engage in dialogue with speakers and each other. The power huddles and poster sessions spanned 7 focus areas: reliability, systems of care, growth and sustainability, workforce, supply chain and clinical supply integration, strategies for a high-value pharmacy enterprise, and service line optimization. Not surprisingly, many presenters described their organization's response to the challenges presented by COVID-19 and the innovative ideas and strategies that helped get them through the worst of the pandemic. Much of this work focuses on use of predictive modeling related to capacity, workforce, supply chain, and other pressing issues, often using Vizient databases and analytical tools. The goal is to become more thoughtful and rigorous in anticipating and preparing for the future. Overarching Theme—Unite 2O2ONE: Respect, Inspire, Serve The 2021 theme, \"Unite 2O2ONE: Respect, Inspire, Serve,\" could not have been more appropriate for framing the sessions and discussions. Unity Byron Jobe, president and CEO of Vizient, noted during the opening panel that unity acts as a powerful force—one that has been readily apparent over the past 2 years. Health care workers have faced challenges that most never expected to see in their lifetimes. They continue to have a front-row seat to what many people have experienced only through the news. Separated from their families for weeks and months to protect them from COVID-19, health care's best came together as one to serve patients facing life-altering conditions. They have witnessed heartbreaking loss firsthand, even among their own ranks. By joining forces in the spirit of unity, they have prevented even greater loss and heartache. Consistent with the unity theme, 2021 marked the first time that the spring Vizient Connections Summit (supply chain) became part of the fall Vizient Connections Summit, providing opportunities for providers and suppliers to work collaboratively. In fact, team-based collaboration served as a consistent theme across Power Huddles and Poster Presentations. Attendees were eager to hear about how best to work together in what has clearly become an interprofessional world. Panelists and presenters repeatedly discussed how COVID-19 became an unanticipated catalyst for unity. While the demands of the pandemic kept organizational leaders busy, it also provided an unexpected opportunity to reconnect with loved ones—even while juggling workplace demands. During the opening session, Jobe and all 3 panelists (Sanjay Gupta, MD, neurologist and chief medical correspondent for CNN; Scott Gottlieb, MD, former FDA commissioner; and Marc Harrison, MD, president and CEO of Intermountain Healthcare) discussed how they used their time at home to forge tighter bonds with their families. Gottlieb developed some close, trusting friendships completely through virtual interactions. Perhaps fittingly, for Gupta, the summit served as bookends for his public appearances, with the 2019 summit being his last in-person engagement before COVID-19 and the 2021 gathering being his first since the pandemic began. Respect The theme of respect served as an underpinning throughout the conference—respect among and between administrative leaders, clinical leaders, physicians, nurses, and frontline staff; respect for patient and families; and respect for the greater community at large. The opening panel touched repeatedly on this theme. Panelists talked about access to health care services being a right, not a privilege. The discussion touched on examples of cooperation between tertiary and quaternary hospitals and their community partners involving telehealth, digital platforms, as well as other support to rural providers and communities with a goal of keeping care in local settings. Harrison noted that Intermountain has made this a priority with critical access hospitals for years, helping make Utah one of only a small number of states that has not closed a rural hospital in the last decade. Inspire Inspiration served as another cross-cutting theme. The most inspiring stories came from the many members who discussed how frontline staff continue to come to work every day during a seemingly never-ending pandemic. These heroes have managed against all odds during the most difficult of circumstances. As multiple speakers noted, some sacrificed their lives in doing so—a sacrifice recognized and honored by Jobe and other presenters and attendees. Serve Many sessions touched on the theme of service, often focusing on the need to do a better job serving patients and communities by finally addressing longstanding challenges facing the industry. While these and other challenges existed before COVID-19, the pandemic brought about a sense of urgency in addressing them. This list includes enhancing access to mental and behavioral health services; reducing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities; addressing social determinants of health; and scaling appropriate use of telemedicine, particularly in rural communities. The summit covered various ideas and initiatives that begin to address these seemingly intractable issues. Overcoming some challenges will be easier than others. Perhaps none garnered greater attention than health equity, with multiple panelists and presenters discussing the importance of destigmatizing the issue and calling on organizations to proactively identify, measure, and address inequities and social determinants of health. Several of the most popular Power Huddles and Poster Presentations focused on the issue of health equity. Awards and Recognitions The summit featured multiple awards and recognitions: Sustainer organizations: A panel discussed the Vizient \"Sustainers Study,\" highlighting 5 organizations that have consistently been high performers on the Vizient Quality and Sustainability Study: Mayo Clinic, Rush University Medical Center, University of Utah Health, The University of Kansas Health System, and NYU Langone Health. More details are available in the following article titled \"Sustaining Success During a Once-in-a-Lifetime Pandemic.\" Supplier awards: Vizient recognized suppliers and distributors in 14 categories of service excellence. These organizations put forth an incredible effort throughout the pandemic, and this recognition honors their commitment under the most trying circumstances. Volunteer activity: Vizient brought member volunteers together to prepare 2000 care packages, including inspirational messages and nutritious snacks, that were then donated to Three Square Food Bank, which supports the Las Vegas community. Norman Borlaug Humanitarian Award: Vizient honored Ignite, a Chicago-based nonprofit that provides support to youth ages 14–26 who need shelter, primary and mental health care, employment opportunities, and skills to live a healthy and productive life. This award, which includes a $50 000 grant, is named for Norman Borlaug, PhD, an agronomist known for his revolutionary approach to plant breeding. Finally, Vizient recognized the many presenters who developed catchy, creative, and often humorous titles for their work that played an important role in piquing the interest of participants. This led to high attendance, and hence, more exposure to the innovative ideas and the positive impact these projects had on patient outcomes (see pull-out box for a representative sample).Creative Title Examples: Is There a (Supply Chain) Doctor in the House?

Over the years, Vizient has studied organizational and cultural factors and found that being the best requires 5 key characteristics: a shared sense of purpose; a cooperative leadership style and atmosphere; a results-driven environment that always strives for top performance; centralized and decentralized accountability structures; and a culture of collaboration and respect, with deference to expertise. In 2019, Vizient launched its \"Sustainers Study,\" with the goal of understanding the secret sauce of organizations that have achieved top Quality and Accountability performance over a sustained period. Vizient identified 5 organizations that received top-performer designation consistently since 2005 (including at least the past 2 y): Mayo Clinic (12 times), Rush University Medical Center (11), University of Utah Health (10), The University of Kansas Health System (8), and NYU Langone Health (8). Vizient conducted an in-depth evaluation of 3 of these organizations (Rush, Utah, and Kansas) and assessed a comparison group of 3 similar organizations that had not achieved top-performer status in the last 2 years and had appeared on the list only sporadically (but at least once) since 2005. The Secret to Sustained Success Providing the best patient experience requires a palpable intensity related to the 5 previously mentioned key areas. Nonsustainer organizations also focus on these areas, but not to the degree or consistency that sustainers do. People At top-performing organizations, everyone—leaders, physicians, and staff—has a deep understanding of organizational goals and a high level of intensity and energy around achieving them. Staff members understand they have a critical role in achieving top performance and feel accountable for doing so. Leaders routinely encourage staff to be their best self for patients. The University of Kansas Health System encourages employees to take care of themselves and rely on each other when they have a bad day. The medical staff at sustainer organizations has a remarkably high regard for nursing, with physicians and nurses respecting each other as leaders, colleagues, and team members. At nonsustaining organizations, these same elements exist in certain pockets, but not with the same intensity or consistency. Accountability for results varies across individuals and teams, as does the level of physician engagement, with many physicians lacking confidence in and alignment with executive leadership. Finally, the degree of partnership between physicians and nurses tends to be inconsistent, with hierarchy and legacy cultures and behaviors remaining in place, thus inhibiting collaboration and joint decision-making. Board Support The board has an infectious energy at sustainer organizations. Without apology, board members get highly involved in guiding the organization's success. They are knowledgeable about quality and embrace their role in creating accountability for strong performance. Sustainers are committed to full and complete transparency with the board, sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly. The board routinely evaluates performance versus established metrics. They understand the actions that affect outcomes and expect closure from leaders whenever a performance issue arises. The board spends as much time on quality as they do on finance-related issues. At nonsustainer organizations, boards are often kept at bay, with little transparency about performance. Boards are often distracted with other activities such as credentialing. Wide variation exists as to levels of knowledge and how board members see their role with respect to the quality agenda. Processes At sustainers, organizational priorities are cascaded to units and departments, creating team and individual accountability. Performance is monitored daily through various management systems and processes, including rounding, huddles, just-in-time coaching, and transparent data. An army of problem solvers exists at the unit and department levels that addresses issues in real time. Nonsustainers apply these management systems only sporadically. While there may be a handful of problem solvers and individual pockets of high performance, processes, systems, and expectations remain highly variable and inconsistent. There is heavy reliance on the central team with more sporadic team accountability and innovation. Decision-Making At sustainer organizations, leaders respect and support organizational decision-making processes, even when individual decisions do not go their way. This approach facilitates buy-in to any decisions. Nurse and physician leaders collaborate in an environment of bidirectional mutual respect when prioritizing opportunities and implementing action plans. For their part, staff members are empowered to make independent decisions in the best interests of the patient. This autonomy often leads to rapid improvements. At nonsustainer organizations, relationships between physician and nurse leaders—and the accompanying degree of collaboration—remain inconsistent and highly variable. Titles and hierarchy stifle discussion and influence the quality of decision-making related to priorities and patient care. Consistent Goals and Reliable Metrics At sustainers, the organization establishes a clear north star guiding principle and remains focused and aligned on achieving and sustaining top performance. Embracing data-driven transparency, leaders and staff are never fully satisfied and always looking to reflect and improve. Performance versus established metrics is reviewed daily, weekly, and monthly. At nonsustainer organizations, goals are set to avoid penalties rather than to establish a north star. If a north star is chosen, it often changes every 2 or 3 years. Variation exists across physicians and staff in the degree to which they understand and buy in to organizational goals. Often too many disparate goals and metrics exist, with no clear consistency or coherence connecting them. In many cases, benchmarking and risk-adjustment processes become a source of debate and distraction. Sustainer Case Studies The 2021 Vizient Connections Summit included sessions that featured leaders from the 3 high-performing organizations evaluated in the \"Sustainers Study.\" The University of Kansas Health System (Kansas City, Missouri) In 1998, The University of Kansas Health System was in dire straits. Part of the state university system, the organization had some of the worst patient satisfaction scores in the country, high staff turnover (33%), declining patient volumes, dwindling cash reserves, and projected losses of $20 million a year. A consultant produced 3 options for the hospital (the only academic medical center in Kansas): close, be sold, or become a public authority. Organizational leaders convinced the state legislature to pass legislation making the system a public authority, severing formal ties with the university. The new organization received $23 million in cash (enough to last roughly 30 d), along with aging, undercapitalized buildings and equipment. Approximately 2200 former employees joined the new organization. Leaders partnered with them to embark on a remarkable turnaround story that has led to sustained top-notch performance, achieving the Vizient top-performer list 8 times since 2005. Success was driven by an intense focus on the 5 critical ingredients identified in the \"Sustainers Study.\" People: The health system unites around the vision of becoming the best in the country in caring, healing, teaching, and discovering. Everyone on campus understands this vision and buys into it. The premise is simple—if every patient has a great experience, the organization will grow and do well financially. Senior leaders do not expect anyone to do anything they are not willing to do. They regularly participate in rounding to understand what patients and staff experience on a firsthand basis. They personally lead major initiatives and meet with area leaders who do not meet targets. Leadership established 7 simple expectations for everyone and created a formula to guide the organization (see accompanying side bar). To strengthen accountability, all 30 000+ employees go through an expert-led customer service training program. Board support: The board sees all data on a regular basis, regardless of performance level. The board regularly has in-depth discussions with leadership about performance, with an eye toward celebrating successes and stimulating improvements. Processes: The organization is \"hard on the process, not the people,\" according to Bob Page, President & CEO. Problems are seldom, if ever, about 1 person, but rather about a process that has failed multiple times. The system uses various performance improvement methodologies, as no single approach works best. The goal is to get things done in as few steps as possible (ideally 1). Decision-making: The organization uses a dyad model that features physician-administrator partnerships. The system is clinically integrated and governed by a single, common board of directors, with no separate departments or organizations. Employing a true partnership model, physicians serve on both the board and executive team. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: Leadership has established a few consistent metrics in a handful of areas—including service, quality, growth, people, and sustainability. While the goal is to be in the top decile in performance, reasonable interim goals are set. Leaders share and discuss performance information at biweekly meetings of 400–500 key individuals. These meetings have used the same agenda and a consistent scorecard for many years, celebrating successes and discussing ways to improve areas of underperformance. Commit to full transparency—both the good and the bad. Be tough on systems and processes, not people. Learn to celebrate successes, even if you're just moving from the 5th to the 10th percentile. After celebrating, move to the next task of improving further. —Bob Page, President & CEO, The University of Kansas Health System Staff take their cues from senior leaders. If it's important to us, it's important to them. —Tammy Peterman, MS, RN, FAAN, NEA-BC, President of the Kansas City Division, The University of Kansas Health SystemAs noted, system leaders created a formula to guide the organization, along with 7 simple expectations of all employees. Together, they have been the foundation of the organization's success.Seven Simple Expectations We are all here for 1 reason: patient care—providing the best care and support to patients and families. There can be no bad days in front of patients or families. Staff can have a bad day, but they must do so behind the scenes, where they can rely on fellow team members for support. First impressions matter. They always have and always will. Everything we do, we do as a team. Team members must be respectful of each other across disciplines and provider types. We must become the safest, most efficient organization in the country; safety always comes first. New employees are encouraged to speak up if they see something that could compromise safety. Be proud of where we are, but never satisfied with it. Strive to be better teammates and communicators. Own everything that's yours and a little bit more. Make sure that nothing falls through the cracks and make it a habit to do something not in your job description. Rush University Medical Center (Chicago, Illinois) A top performer 11 times since 2005, Rush University Medical Center succeeds because of its strong commitment to setting aggressive goals, consistently measuring performance against those goals, and addressing problems as they surface. Once again, the secret sauce lies in the 5 critical ingredients: People: Rush's leadership has established a clear mission—to improve the health of the community it serves. Without a true north to serve as a guiding principle, organizations falter during difficult financial times or due to social pressures. Leaders also establish aggressive, mission-related goals, strategies for achieving those goals, and clear expectations for everyone associated with the organization. These steps make it easy to attract, hire, and retain the right people, because everyone buys into what the organization is trying to achieve. Board support: The board fully embraces the mission and focus on quality and outcomes. It regularly receives and reviews fully transparent performance data. The board supports Rush's efforts to do what is right for the community, even when such activities may come at the expense of other priorities, including financial considerations. Processes and decision-making: Rush operates with the premise that everyone is trying to do well. The problem rarely lies with a person or group, but rather with underlying processes. Data shines a light on the problem, and key stakeholders work together to address it. A close collaborative relationship exists between clinical and administrative teams. Neither side leads the other; the 2 groups make decisions as true partners. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: Rush establishes clear, aggressive goals on established metrics and consistently measures performance against those goals. The organization regularly celebrates successes while simultaneously addressing identified problems. Health care is full of good people. But they are being pulled in too many directions. Leaders must provide clarity about what we're trying to achieve . . . an organization has an entirely different feel when clinical leaders are not aligned with administration. You can tell in about 5 minutes. —Omar Lateef, President and CEO, Rush University Medical Center University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah) A top performer 10 times since 2005, the University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics similarly focuses on the critical ingredients to sustained success: People: The organization demonstrates a clear commitment to employees through compensation and by promoting an appropriate work-life balance to ensure that staff remain healthy and engaged. Leaders communicate and reinforce this commitment, acknowledging the critical role that everyone plays. Leaders emphasize the core values of mutual respect, trust, and teamwork. These values resonate with staff members, who routinely cite their relationships with teammates and coworkers as the reason they come to work each day. Board support: Board members are extremely engaged and focused on what is important to the organization. Individual board members have expertise in quality improvement methodologies and regularly query leaders about what they have learned during rounding from frontline staff and patients. Processes and decision-making: The organization's emphasis on people translates into collaborative, mutually respectful, nonhierarchical decision-making. Quality improvement processes such as Lean focus on fixing systemic problems rather than calling out individuals. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: The organization's improvement journey began 14 years ago with the establishment of specific goals related to providing an exceptional patient experience and high-quality care while maintaining financial stability. Clear metrics cover each of these areas, with regular measurement, monitoring, and feedback against these goals. Never give up a long-term relationship for a short-term gain. Acknowledge what your people do, support them, and lift them up every day. —Dan Lundergan, MHA, CEO, University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics Sustaining Excellence During a Pandemic At no time have the 5 critical ingredients been more important than during the pandemic. Sustainer organizations have enjoyed even greater relative outperformance since 2019 than they did before the pandemic. The reason is simple: the cultures and systems in place at these organizations allow them to make decisions and take actions that many others simply cannot, as illustrated by the examples below. The University of Kansas Health System When COVID-19 hit, The University of Kansas Health System doubled down on what made it successful. As a result, performance improved in 2020 compared to the year before. The secret was staying true to the formula and the people who make up the organization. In April 2020, senior leaders announced there would be no staff layoffs or furloughs—even though the system was generating only 40% of prior-year revenues. The reasoning was simple—engaged staff are critical to the previously described guiding formula, and a global pandemic was no time to deviate from that formula. At the end of the day, it's about having a sustained, consistent culture—it's what we have built and what has led to our success over the last 20 years. —Tammy Peterman, MS, RN, FAAN, NEA-BC, President of the Kansas City Division, The University of Kansas Health System Rush University Medical Center Because COVID-19 did not hit Chicago immediately, Rush had the opportunity to learn from others. Supported by a culture that discourages egos and values humility, Rush leaders began gathering information from those in early hot spots such as Seattle and New York. Rush created a dedicated triage area and put extra intensive care unit beds and equipment in place before patient zero arrived. Because no one knew what to expect, Rush's leaders emphasized to employees the need to be open and honest about what they were learning every day. To keep staff engaged, leaders remained highly visible. The board also played a critical role, making it clear that Rush would be led by its values and continue putting patient outcomes first. Facing $10 million in losses a week, the board chair approved the idea of Rush taking safety-net transfer COVID-19 patients from everywhere, including the uninsured and those without documentation. Rush expanded capacity to handle these patients, including installing equipment in areas not traditionally used for patient care. We didn't have to do a lot of the things we did when COVID hit. But it's a part of who we are. We all came together to deliver for the community. —Omar Lateef, President and CEO, Rush University Medical Center As the \"Sustainers Study\" and these case histories illustrate, achieving top performance over a sustained period requires a palpable intensity related to 5 areas: people, board support, processes, decision-making, and consistent goals and reliable metrics. Paying attention to these areas drives sustained excellence under both normal circumstances and during unprecedented challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. A New Growth Formula: Relevance, Diversification, and Scalability Joan Moss, RN, MSN Managing Principal and Chief Nursing Officer, Sg2, a Vizient company John Becker Group Senior Vice President, Strategic Growth Solutions, Vizient As the United States and the world slowly transition to an endemic phase of COVID-19, hospital and health system leaders finally have time to breathe again, to turn at least some attention away from day-to-day crises and think again about long-term imperatives like growth and capital planning. Senior executives are having strategic conversations again, including discussions about how to restart growth. Surveys of Sg2® members conducted during the November 2021 Sg2 Executive Summit signaled unequivocally that growth was at the top of the agenda for 2022, an unsurprising finding after 2 years of pandemic-induced volume disruptions. The Realities Uncovered by COVID-19 These executive conversations",

    "abstract": "Improving hospital mortality is a key focus of quality and safety efforts at both the local and national level. Structured interventions can assist organizations in determining whether interventional efforts have led to sustained improvement. The PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) can assist organizations in implementing research into practice. This study investigates the use of the PARiHS framework in implementing a multihospital quality improvement project aimed at improving observed-to-expected mortality as measured by Vizient's Clinical Data Base (CDB). Structured interventions during the study period included mortality reviews, clinical documentation improvement opportunities, educational webinars, training and support in the use of CDB to explore ongoing opportunities for mortality improvement and quarterly reports to each participating hospital's leadership team on their performance. Data were gathered from an improvement collaborative in the Upper Midwest, which comprised 34 hospitals, of which 17 participated in the intervention. Measurement occurred from Quarter 4 2016 through Quarter 3 2020 and consisted of a preintervention, intervention, and postintervention period. Although both participating and nonparticipating hospitals achieved a significant reduction in their mortality observed-to-expected ratio from the preintervention period through the postintervention period, the participating hospitals achieved a greater reduction in their observed-to-expected mortality ratio ( P < 0.0004). In addition, the participating hospitals achieved a relative 21% improvement in the mortality domain rank of the Vizient Quality & Accountability Study.",

    "abstract": "Mortality review is one approach to systematically examine delivery of care and identify areas for improvement. Health system leaders sought to ensure hospitals were adapting to the rapidly changing medical guidance for COVID-19 and delivering high-quality care. Thus, all patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis within the 6-hospital system who died between March and July 2020 were reviewed within 72 hours. Concerns for preventability advanced review to level 2 (content experts) or 3 (hospital leadership). Reviews included available autopsy and cardiac arrest data. Overall health system mortality for COVID-19 patient admissions was 12.5% and mortality for mechanically ventilated patients was 34.4%. Significant differences in mortality rates were observed among hospitals due to demographic variations in patient populations at hospitals. Mortality reviews resulted in the dissemination of evolving knowledge among sites using an electronic medical record order set, implementation of proning teams, and development of checklists for converting COVID-19 floors and units.",

Clinicians completed surveys about handoffs before and after checklist implementation.

    "abstract": "Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a leading tool for risk management in health care. The term \"blanket\" approach FMEA describes a comprehensive simultaneous look at the variety of interrelated factors that may directly and indirectly affect patient safety. Applying FMEA with the \"blanket\" approach is not common, due to FMEA's limitations. Algorithmic prediction of failure modes in health care (APFMH) is leaner and enables the application of the \"blanket\" approach, but, like FMEA, it lacks formal validation. The authors set out to validate the APFMH method while applying a \"blanket\" approach. They analyzed the sterile supply handling at a 1900-bed academic medical center. The study's first step took place in the operating room (OR) aspect of the process. An APFMH analysis was performed using the \"blanket\" approach, to identify the hazards and define the common root causes for predicted hazards. The second step took place a year later at the sterile supply and equipment department (SSED) and aimed to validate these root causes, thus validating the reliability of APFMH. The \"blanket\" approach analysis with the APFMH method consisted of categorization into 3 risk-dimensions: patient safety, equipment damage, and time management. Root causes were defined for 8 high-ranking hazards. All the root causes for failures, identified by APFMH at the OR department, were revealed as actual hazards in the processes of the SSED. The independent findings at the SSED level validated the list of identified hazards that was formed at the target department (ie, the OR). APFMH methodology is a lean in time and human resources process that ensures comprehensive hazard analysis, which can include the \"blanket\" approach, and which was validated in this study.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify how often 2 independent centers defibrillated patients within the American Heart Association recommended 2-minute time interval following ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest. A retrospective chart review revealed significant delays in defibrillation. Simulation sessions and modules were implemented to train nursing staff in a single nursing unit at a Philadelphia teaching hospital. Recruited nurses completed a code blue simulation session to establish a baseline time to defibrillation. They were then given 2 weeks to complete an online educational module. Upon completion, they participated in a second set of simulation sessions to assess improvement. First round simulations resulted in 33% with delayed defibrillation and 27% no defibrillation. Following the module, 77% of the second round of simulations ended in timely defibrillation, a statistically significant improvement ( P &lt; 0.00001). Next steps involve prospective collection of the code blue data to analyze improvement in real code blue events.",

Nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus is a frequent cause of device-related SSI and nasal mupirocin has been used for prevention. More recently, povidone-iodine nasal swabs have become an alternative. It is cheaper, ensures compliance and there are no concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. However, its adoption was suboptimal in a community hospital system in southwestern Ohio, especially in neurosurgery and vascular surgery. Quality improvement techniques, including solicitation of stakeholder input, surgeons and perioperative nurses' education, and the use of reminders to order and administer the povidone-iodine nasal swabs improved physician ordering and nurse administration compliance, leading to fewer infections. The interventions continued after the project was completed, sustaining decreases in neurosurgery and vascular surgery, and fewer SSI through the first years of the pandemic. Despite the complexity of these surgeries, simple interventions were effective in addressing the problem.",

Guided by serum levels, these protocols include no patient-specific factors despite a literature showing ICU patients routinely have significant deficits despite normal serum levels. The authors developed a checklist to help identify patients requiring more aggressive magnesium replacement than the electrolyte replacement protocol would provide. The checklist included risk factors for having significant magnesium deficits and for developing arrhythmias. The checklist was retrospectively applied to 364 medical ICU patients. Diabetic patients prescribed outpatient diuretics were defined as the highest-risk population. A total of 88% of patients in this subgroup had normal magnesium levels. Despite averaging 3.4 risk factors per patient, only 3 of 32 patients received magnesium. Applying the checklist would have suggested additional repletion for at least 85% of patients. A checklist can help identify ICU patients who may require more aggressive magnesium supplementation than protocols will provide.",

Distance traveled did not influence support of ridesharing ( P = 0.617).

As a means of risk mitigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense recommend naloxone for patients on opioids with risk factors, including use of ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents daily, concurrent benzodiazepine/sedative use, and pulmonary or liver disease. An interprofessional quality improvement team consisting of 6 residents, a pharmacist, a nurse educator, and a faculty mentor was formed to increase naloxone coprescriptions at a regional VA medical center Continuity of Care Clinic. Primary intervention identified eligible patients via the VA Primary Care Almanac's Opioid Therapy Risk Report and alerted providers by email and secure messaging. Naloxone coprescription rates increased from 42% initially in June 2022 to 82% by June 2023 (29/69 to 41/50 patients, P < 0.0001). This project demonstrates that notifying providers of high-risk patients can significantly increase naloxone coprescriptions.",

We reviewed the medical records of 288 patients with diabetes receiving ambulatory care over a 2-year period. We determined the availability of different tests of glycemic control and described site performance as the percent age of patients with a blood glucose exceeding either 180 or 240 mg/dl. Glycosylated hemoglobin determinations were performed in only 26.7% of patients. A blood glucose was available in 208 patients (72.2%) during a 6-month outcome period. For almost 50% of the sample, the glucose was greater than 180 mg/dl, whereas in 20% it exceeded 240 mg/dl. Judgments of whether sites dif fered in performance depended on how control was defined. Using a single glucose determination and a threshold of 180 mg/dl, similar fractions of patients were poorly controlled at each site (51.2 versus 45.0 versus 47.0%) (P = 0.75). At 240 mg/dl, although, one site per formed much worse than the other two (14.6 versus 16.7 versus 31.8%) ( P = 0.02).

This essay explores the many dimensions of quality in health care and shows that many understandings of it are narrowly configured to the agendas of the respective participants--providers, patients, and institutions--in today's health care arena. Also, there are many aspects of quality that defy measurement in the epidemiological sense. These are seen in the physician-patient relationship and in special clinical situations, such as the process of dying. Using the idea of quality to buttress ethical and policy decisions, particularly by managed care organizations, is often problematic, given this complexity. It is thus imperative that those so using quality be accountable that their understanding of it be arrived at by responsible means, that it addresses something meaningful, and that it not eclipse the many other dimensions of quality.",

The broad purposes of TOPP® are to manage patient treatment, improve the cost-effec tiveness of care, and provide outcomes reporting for man aged care and other interested parties. The challenge was to develop a system which could measure, evaluate, and report medical rehabilitation patient outcomes in a way that could be easily understood by multiple audiences, including payers, accrediting organizations, physicians, patients and families, case managers, and CMS clinical staff. Using data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation database, CMS created descriptive outcomes reports for each hospital and for the corporation overall, including performance statistics, outcomes report cards, and quality report cards. These initial reports, as well as updates, quarterly reports, and special ad hoc requests, provide CMS corporate and hospital staff with statistically valid and reliable information to manage the outcomes of medical rehabilitation treatment. [email protected] has assisted CMS with meeting accreditation standards for outcomes man agement and measurement and has been used in managed care contract negotiations.

Continued evolution of this ap proach has subsequently enabled the development and implementation of effective processes for managing risk of dangerousness among patients throughout the hospi tal. Supported by management principles that promote hospital-wide quality improvement, clinicians and man agers produced an environment that was conducive to promoting quality. The hospital-wide quality improve ment context involved integrating multiple activities designed to promote quality of care, including signifi cant collaborations with other health care organiza tions. The hospital's mission as an acute care psychiat ric facility has required that it focus on assessing and managing risk of dangerousness in a systematic manner. This was done through developing and utilizing a pre dictive risk assessment instrument and indicators for managerial oversight. This was accomplished in these steps. First, clinical leaders rated potential criteria ac cording to estimates of their ability to predict danger ousness behavior and reviewed their estimates in rela tion to clinical findings. Second (and concurrently), clinicians and managers implemented procedures to monitor clinical risk and performance. Finally, outcome data were reviewed. They suggested that this approach was effective in reducing risk of dangerous behavior among patients on all psychiatric wards.",

These findings were compared to the psychological impact the rotation had on residents with prior EM experience. Data were obtained from a post hoc analysis of a previous study. Prerotation and postrotation psychological distress levels were assessed over a 4-week EM rotation. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Dissociative Experience Scale that together comprise a total of 14 psychometric scales. All scales were given at the beginning and end of the initial EM rotation for the academic year of 1994-1995. All information was coded and confidential. Eighteen junior residents (9/18 EM [50%]) were analyzed as a group and compared to 53 residents (34/51 EM [66%]) with prior exposure to the authors' emergency department. Residents doing their first EM rotation (N = 18) showed improvement in 13 of 14 scales (P = .002). Of the 13 scales that improved, 3 improved significantly: Brief Symptom Inventory = anxiety (P = .002) and Dissociative Experience Scale = absorption (P = .001) and other (P = .001). Residents with prior EM experience (N = 53) displayed worsening in 9 of 13 scales (P = not significant) and no change in 1. Residents undergoing their first EM rotation showed a significant decrease in psychological distress over the 4-week period. Residents with prior EM experience did not show a similar change.",

    "abstract": "Wang and colleagues evaluated patients’ responses regarding their recent emergency department (ED) visits based on the following types: health care ser-vice issue, behavior issues, and unavoidable ED visits. Their survey showed 56% were related to health care ser -vice delivery issues, 2% were associated with population behavior issues, and 42% were unavoidable.However, we believe the validity of their study may be compromised by using patient-reported reasons for their visits. The study found only 2% of the ED visits were related to behavior issues. We believe this figure most likely represents a significant underestimate.Community-wide ED visits related to drug seeking has become a significant problem since the 1990s.",

A site-specific BCS could improve both PICU communication and compliance completing the BCS. Via written survey, PICU staff at an academic children's hospital provided recommendations for improving and revising an existing BCS. Pre- and post-BCS revision, PICU staff were polled regarding PICU communication and BCS effectiveness, and daily compliance for completing the BCS was monitored. After implementation of the revised BCS, staff reporting \"excellent\" or \"very good\" day-to-day communication within the PICU increased from 57% to 77% (P = .02). Compliance for completing the BCS also increased significantly (75% vs 83%, P = .03). Introduction of a focused and concise BCS tailored to a specific PICU leads to improved perceptions of communication by PICU staff and increased compliance completing the daily BCS.",

This retrospective analysis compared diabetes care processes and outcomes within a traditional resident continuity clinic structure (2005) and after the implementation of a practice partnership system (PPS; 2009). Under PPS, patients were more likely to receive annual foot examinations (odds ratio [OR] = 11.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.2, 18.5), microalbumin screening (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.6, 3.4), and aspirin use counseling (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 2.5, 6.0) and were less likely to receive eye examinations (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.36, 0.82). Hemoglobin A1c and lipid testing were similar between periods, and there was no difference in achievement of diabetes and blood pressure goals. Patients were less likely to achieve cholesterol goals under PPS (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.98).

Thus, the events catalyze improvement efforts to mitigate patient harm. A serious limitation is that only a few of the occurrences are investigated. A challenge is leveraging the data to generate knowledge. The goal is to present a methodology to supplement these incident assessment efforts. The framework affords an enhanced understanding of patient safety through the use of control charts to monitor non-harm and harm incidents simultaneously. This approach can identify harm and non-harm reporting rates and also can facilitate monitoring occurrence trends. This method also can expedite identifying changes in workflow, processes, or safety culture. Although unable to identify root causes, this approach can identify changes in near real time. This approach also supports evaluating safety or policy interventions that may not be observable in annual safety climate surveys.",

Study data included 2007 to 2013 diabetes care intermediate outcome measures for 661 ambulatory clinics in Minnesota and bordering states. Health systems provided more consistent performance, as measured by the standard deviation of performance for clinics in a system, relative to propensity score-matched proxy systems created for comparison purposes. No evidence was found that improvements in consistency were associated with higher clinic performance. The combination of high performance and consistent care is likely to enhance a health system's brand reputation, allowing it to better mitigate the financial risks of consumers seeking care outside the organization. These results suggest that larger health systems are most likely to deliver the combination of consistent and high-performance care. Future research should explore the mechanisms that drive consistent care within health systems.",

This paper offers a general procedure based on a Double Track model. Two procedural processes are offered: (1) at the whole organization level, Track 1, as a strategic means to quality improvement; and (2) at the project level, Track 2, for an operational path to quality improvement work at the team level. It is suggested that successful efforts follow this Double Track effort already and that further identification and elaboration of the pathway will speed diffusion of quality improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "Long-term care (LTC) case management has emerged as a way of addressing problems in the long term care system. Case managers serve as links between chronically ill and disabled individuals and the services these individuals need but of which they often are unaware. In this capacity, case managers address the fragmentation in the long-term care system. In guiding clients to cost-effective ways of meeting their long-term care needs, case managers also address the need for cost containment in long-term care. To ensure that case management is effectively addressing these and other problems, attention to quality is essential. However, quality assurance programs too often focus on minutiae rather than on true indicators of quality. In addition, people who are not involved in the related areas frequently make decisions about quality. These decisions impose additional, and sometimes unnecessary, restrictions on the people who are required to implement them. Total quality management (TQM) offers a new approach. In this article, a proposal is made to incorporate TQM principles into LTC case management. The LTC case management demonstration project currently underway in Virginia serves as the case study for this proposal. The proposal demonstrates a process in which quality can be built into a case management system in a way that involves the people who will implement the resultant changes. The proposal shows how case management staff members can learn to identify areas where quality is impaired and to use techniques to aid them in identifying the causes of problems. A procedure for testing solutions and for incorporating the findings into the project is described.",

This review of a large patient population has determined that 27% of emergency department seizures were uncomplicated and occurred in patients already under care. This represented 0.25% of all emergency department visits and nearly $200,000 in claims to this managed care entity per year. Taking some statistical liberties, a national health care expenditure of $270,000,000 is suggested for this single abuse. It is hoped that further education of the public, medical community, and epileptic patients will produce a comfort level that permits decisions about emergency transport and care of seizures. These savings could translate into basic health insurance for thousands of our medically deprived citizens.",

    "abstract": "Over a decade ago, Dr. Robin expressed concern regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of pulmonary embolism. Since that time, significant advances have been forthcoming in the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease. Using Continuous Quality Improvement concepts, this study revisits Robin's concerns and assesses the conformance of clinical practice at one institution with established requirements for the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease to identify remaining opportunities to improve care. The study design is a retrospective chart review. Medical records of all patients (N = 63) discharged from a university-affiliated teaching hospital from 7/1/89 to 6/30/90 with a diagnosis of primary venous thromboembolic disease were studied. Requirements for the diagnosis and treatment were established through review of the medical literature. Conformance to these requirements was assessed and described. Descriptive statistics were used. Only 7 of 63 charts (11%) met all requirements for the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease. Fifty-six charts (89%) failed to meet at least one criterion. There was no evidence of overdiagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease in patients with a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (N = 17). Eight of 62 patients (13%) demonstrated potential overdiagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease involving the lower extremities. Nine of 60 (15%) heparin therapies demonstrated significant nonconformance to recommendations. Fifty-four of 59 (91%) warfarin therapies failed to conform to recommendations. Eighty-three percent of these warfarin errors were considered to be technical. However, 17% were determined to be clinically significant. Of 5 patients treated with a transvenous filter device, 1 failed to meet therapeutic requirements. No patients received thrombolytic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Six neurologists from various parts of the country, all facing widely differing environmental factors, were interviewed. The results demonstrate that health care reform has forced physicians to work more hours to maintain their incomes, has done little to control costs, and has generated little interest in quality improvement plans. In fact, due to referral patterns, quality levels may have decreased under capitated payment plans. The conclusion is that health care must be reformed at the local level and involve physicians with a wide array of specialties.",

    "abstract": "Payors hold hospitals accountable for patient experience using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. The objective was to determine if hospital unit (medicine versus nonmedicine [ie, cardiology, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and surgery]) influences HCAHPS scores when care is given by the same providers on different units. This retrospective analysis of adult inpatient data (n = 845), included overall hospital satisfaction, staff communication, care and communication from physicians, and discharge communication. Average overall satisfaction was 8.9 out of 10 and length of stay was 4.6 days. Patients treated on nonmedicine units had higher overall satisfaction than those on medicine units ( P = 0.02) and higher scores when asked how often doctors listened to the patient carefully ( P = 0.002). The type of inpatient unit can influence overall satisfaction and satisfaction with physician communication. Differences in room environment, amenities, and staffing may explain why medicine patients were more satisfied on nonmedicine versus medicine units.",

    "abstract": "Homebound older adults receiving home-based medical care (HBMC) are high-need, high-cost patients. National Quality Forum (NQF)-endorsed quality measures for this population are lacking. The objective is to describe the reliability and validity testing of 2 new quality measures for such patients to support NQF endorsement. The authors developed 2 new clinical quality measures for HBMC: evaluation of (1) functional status and (2) cognitive function. Data from a large multistate HBMC practice in a Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services-approved qualified clinical data registry were used to test both measures for reliability and validity. In 63 000 patient encounters, provider performance rates were 68% for evaluation of functional status and 40% for cognitive function. Reliability and validity were high for both. This article describes a replicable approach to leverage registry-type data to systematically address quality gaps for high-need, high-cost populations that will raise the profile of HBMC with measure developers and payers.",

The NorthShore Quality and Patient Safety Fellowship was a yearlong program for practicing physicians devoting 4 hours/wk to a didactic curriculum and quality practicum. Thirty-seven clinicians completed the Fellowship from 2011 to 2018. Sixty percent of graduates reported a significant impact on their quality-related career trajectory, with 44% of early graduates and 64% of recent graduates reporting a new quality role or responsibility as a result of the Fellowship. Fifty-four percent of practicum projects were adopted or adapted by the organization. The Fellowship has been an effective framework to identify and train future quality champions and has led to further quality leadership opportunities for many graduates. Evolution of the Fellowship aligned practicum projects with organizational quality priorities. This curricular framework may be useful for other organizations that seek to develop quality champions among practicing physicians.",

These development programs are likely not equally effective for all participants. This study evaluates the efficacy of one such program and determines personality predictors of its efficacy. Before and after a 12-month leadership development program, 28 physicians from various disciplines completed self-reported measures of leadership knowledge across 3 domains. At baseline, participants also provided personality data across the Big-5 factors of personality as well as 2 narrow facets (learning-goal orientation and preference for collaboration). Results suggest that leadership development programs can increase knowledge across leadership domains. Extraversion and conscientiousness predict changes in knowledge. Learning-goal-orientation and preference for collaboration personality facets provide incremental predictive power. Leadership development programs can improve self-rated knowledge across a range of leadership domains and is differentially effective for people based on their personalities.",

The Educational and Clinical Leaders Improving Performance with Structured E3L training (ECLIPSE) program was developed to address this challenge. Clinically relevant components of lean management were leveraged to create an online, flipped-classroom curriculum, and this was paired with Kaizen adapted specifically for physicians and multidisciplinary clinicians to promote experiential skills utilization. The focus of each adapted Kaizen was a topic of institutional QI priority, such as improving patient throughput or reducing readmission rates. Participants were awarded certification in the E3 Leadership management system-a patient-centered, equity-focused system based on lean principles. After 4 years, 50 E3 Leadership certificates were awarded to multidisciplinary clinicians, including 30 to physicians; participants scored an average 85% on module quizzes. The ECLIPSE program has improved physician participation in multidisciplinary QI projects with institutional alignment.",

Existing literature is largely descriptive and there is limited information about how an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization for ACSCs is related to prior ambulatory care visits. A retrospective, observational study was conducted using health records from a large midwestern health system during a 20-month period between 2012 and 2014. Our primary variables were (1) type of care setting (i.e., ED visit or hospitalization) and (2) whether the patient received ambulatory care services in the 14, 30, and 60 days before the ED visit or hospital admission. Of patients seen in the ED for ACSCs, 11.9%, 16.3%, and 21.67% were seen in ambulatory care in the 14, 30, and 60 days prior, respectively. Of those hospitalized for ACSCs, 29.1%, 39.9%, and 53% were seen in ambulatory care in the 14, 30, and 60 days prior, respectively. These results highlight a potential lost opportunity to address ACSCs in the ambulatory care setting. Such knowledge can inform interventions to reduce avoidable ACSC-related acute care use and health care costs, and improve patient outcomes.",

Working with hospitals with recognized leading clinical practices, VHA Inc developed an innovative methodology for generating and transferring knowledge using a visual story format that incorporates structural, process, and contextual elements into a comprehensive knowledge transfer vehicle called a VHA Leading Practice Blueprint. The authors describe a validation study comparing the effectiveness of the Blueprint methodology as a knowledge transfer vehicle to 2 commonly used sources of performance improvement knowledge: traditional case study and peer-reviewed journal article. Six dimensions—display, content, transferability, recall, diffusion, and actionable—were evaluated. Analysis of data indicates that the Blueprint methodology was judged superior to case studies and peer-reviewed articles on all 6 dimensions. The Blueprint methodology appears to hold promise as a new medium for conveying leading practices in health care.",

    "abstract": "To the Editor, In a recent article, Glasgow et al assessed the impacts of organizational context on quality improvement (QI). In their study of organizational characteristics of 100 hospitals participating in a national QI collaborative, they did not find any predictive associations with QI performance. Using a different approach, we conducted a study of 505 French hospitals that are subject to mandatory annual measurements of quality indicators in a national program aimed at promoting continuous quality improvement (CQI). This program is driven by the French Ministry of Health, the French Health Authority, and our research group (COMPAQ-HPST). From an analysis of the literature, we developed a theoretical frame that ranged potential factors of success for a CQI program along 2 axes. One concerned contextual factors (eg, staff stability, QI information), which covered the same organizational characteristics as described by Glasgow et al. The other included managerial factors (eg, managers use quality indicator results to define the hospi-tal's strategy, managers favor multiprofessional commitment when analyzing quality indicator results), which do not seem to have been considered in that article. Seventeen factors were identified and considered to be relevant by a panel of 22 health care professionals, using a consensus method. The relevance of these 17 factors was thereafter confirmed in 505 hospitals by assessing the correlation between the presence/absence of these factors and the results of 3 quality indicators (quality of patient medical records, pain assessment, and delay in sending information at patient discharge). A factorial analysis showed that the managerial axis included 6 factors and the contextual axis included 11. Cronbach α for the 2 axes were .78 and .82, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed a link between managerial score and the results of an indicator assessing the quality of patients' medical records (P = .02) and an indicator measuring the delay in sending information at patients' discharge (P = .03). We believe that managerial capacity is an important factor in the success of QI programs and should be analyzed more precisely.",

The study team evaluated the effect of a multifaceted quality improvement initiative on improving confirmation documentation rates. Rates of documentation of appropriate methods of ETT position confirmation were better for patients undergoing ETT placement in the study site ED than for those arriving already intubated (103/127 [81.1%] vs 19/71 [26.8%]; relative risk [RR] = 3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.04 to 4.49). Overall rates of documentation of appropriate methods of ETT position confirmation were higher after the intervention (557/758 [73.5%] vs 122/198 [61.6%]; RR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.34), with a greater increase among the group presenting to the ED with an ETT already placed (116/259 [44.8%] vs 19/71 [26.8%]; RR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.51) compared with those intubated in the study site ED (103/127 [81.1%] vs 441/499 [88.4%]; RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.8389 to 1.0039).",

An absence of collaboration can compromise the quality and safety of patient care. But having a rationale to provide collaborative medicine without also having a rational clinical strategy can be equally compromising to the quality and safety of patient care. Reasonable evidentiary criteria must be used to determine whether specific therapies merit inclusion or exclusion in a collaborative medicine model. Ranking therapies hierarchically on the basis of their risk-benefit ratio simplifies matching of therapies with the needs of the patient. A unifying taxonomy that categorizes all therapies (complementary/alternative and conventional) on the basis of how we think they work (presumed mechanisms of action) facilitates development of a clinical strategy for collaborative medicine. On the basis of these principles, a rational clinical strategy for collaborative medicine is described to help optimize the quality and safety of patient care.",

Three measures--exclusive contracting, medical staff planning, and exclusive credentialing--have been employed, singly or in combination, at many hospitals to restrict or to deny medical staff appointments and clinical privileges to professionally qualified and competent physicians. Because the hospitals have articulated links, when employing these restrictive measures in making credentialing decisions, to the public's interest in their being able to provide good quality services to the communities they serve, the hospitals have usually been successful in litigation brought by physicians who have been denied staff appointment or specific clinical privileges.",

The authors determined how frequently emergency department (ED) physicians document HIT risk assessment in patients presenting with thrombosis. Relevant data were extracted from the ED charts of 134 patients with venous or arterial thrombosis. Documentation (ie, notation of positive or negative findings) existed for recent heparin exposure in 7 (5.2%) of 134 charts, recent hospitalization in 33 (24.6%), history of thrombocytopenia in 0 (0%), and history of thrombosis in 62 (45.5%). Of 35 patients administered heparin in the ED, the preheparin platelet count was available for 19 (54.3%) and old records for 5 (14.3%). Thus, HIT risk assessment frequently remains undocumented for ED patients with thrombosis, including those administered heparin. Approaches to increase HIT awareness and facilitate HIT risk assessment and documentation in the ED may be needed.",

    "abstract": "Data from the British Columbia Linked Health Database were analyzed to determine if size of hospital is associated with in-hospital death of critically ill adults whose admitting diagnosis is congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients who were <19 years of age, transferred from or to other hospitals, or who developed CHF as a complication were excluded. In unadjusted logistic regression analysis of 2616 patients, the odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital death associated with a doubling of the number of hospital beds was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.23; P = .01). After adjustment for age, sex, CHF-specific comorbidity index, number of cardiac and noncardiac procedures, number of hospital admissions for CHF in the preceding year, and socioeconomic variables, the OR was 1.08 (95% CI = 0.96-1.20; P = .21). The conclusion is that the adjusted rate of in-hospital deaths for this patient group does not differ significantly based solely on the number of acute hospital beds.",

    "abstract": "In the current climate of American health care reform, effective and accurate performance measurement and reporting of the quality of care provided by caregivers have risen to the top of critical priorities. On one hand, there are more than 100 regional quality reporting initiatives relying on public reporting of performance measures, and yet there is a high degree of variability as to which of these measures are reported, compared, and implemented. Certainly, the increased availability of comparative clinical outcomes among providers of care has proven to be an initial effective catalyst in achieving significant improvements and transparency in the quality of care delivered within the US health system, but high-quality evidence of significant overall impact is still lacking. As a result of these documented inconsistencies, in the current issue of this journal, Roski and Kim have correctly called for a more efficient means of generating nationally consistent performance information. Indeed, the Quality Alliance Steering Committee has already developed a road map and 3-year plan to establish a cohesive infrastructure to achieve this very important national goal. Given the growing mandate for health care providers to demonstrate meaningful improvements in clinical quality, the effective implementation of evidence-based performance measures that are derived from well-constructed clinical practice guidelines has become a critical success factor. When developed by professional society and other health care delivery experts, such guidelines and measures must also ensure both feasibility and improved outcomes, especially to the public and payers. To the extent that core performance measures can be adopted uniformly across the spectrum of payers, individual practitioners and groups will be able to implement delivery schemes more effectively. Because the stakes have become higher than ever to achieve these ends, a more rigorous and consistent approach to these complex issues, such as outlined in the following discussion, must now be established. Clinical practice guidelines require a systematic evaluation of evidence behind the science supporting guideline recommendations for care delivery. Using a taxonomy or framework for grading the quality of evidence and providing a subsequent concomitant “strength of recommendation” is desirable whenever possible. This framework should be published along with guideline recommendations and supporting text, which should also include a summary of the quality of the evidence using graphical and tabular summary statistical techniques. Examples include the evidence grade definitions used by the US Preventive Services Task Force, the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system used by the American College of Physicians Clinical Effectiveness Assessment Subcommittee, and the system deployed by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association. Another excellent example is the evidence grading system deployed by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America to reduce hospitalacquired infections, but currently, there is no standard “one size fits all” approach to be used by every group of guideline developers. Performance measures should be based on clinical practice guidelines and are useful to assess whether care delivery is achieved in accordance with guideline recommendations. There are 5 critical aspects of performance measures with respect to scientific evidence. First, any performance measure should be developed and accompanied by a structured evaluation of evidence such as those already mentioned for clinical practice guidelines. The most useful and valid performance measures are those that are based on both the highest quality of evidence and the strongest recommendations from guideline developers. Under these circumstances, it is more likely that well-constructed performance measures will actually evaluate the degree to which quality of care has been delivered. Subsequent quality improvement methods and initiatives designed to increase the frequency of care in accordance with higher success of such measures will also be more likely to have a significant impact on the target population. Second, certain performance measures can be independently evaluated as to whether actual improvements in care can be achieved if levels of performance increase. Such an evaluation will, over time, generate a second type",

Inpatients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from hospitals in California, Florida, and New York were analyzed. A cross-sectional study design was used to perform secondary data analyses. The association between implementing IT applications (ie, electronic clinical documentation, electronic lab orders, medication orders written electronically) in the patients' hospitals (independent variables) and hospital-acquired VTE (the dependent variable) were studied using a hierarchical logistic model. Electronic clinical documentation was associated with lower odds of hospital-acquired VTE (odds ratio [OR] = 0.835, P < .001). An even larger reduction in the odds was found among patients of hospitals that implemented electronic lab orders (OR = 0.627, P < .001). However, the implementation of electronic medication orders did not show such an association.",

Programs, which allow computer entry of such scanned questionnaire results directly into PC based relational databases, have further made it possible to quickly collect and analyze significant amounts of information. We have created an internal capability to easily generate survey data and conduct surveillance across a number of medical practice sites within a managed care/practice management organization. Patient satisfaction surveys, referring physician surveys and a variety of other evidence gathering tools have been deployed.",

    "abstract": "This project was undertaken to determine whether cen tralization of histocompatibility laboratory services for renal transplants performed within eastern Pennsylvania could improve the efficiency of allograft allocation and short-term allograft function. A nonconcurrent cohort study was performed comparing renal allografts trans planted between September 15, 1993, and September 14, 1994, to those transplanted between September 15, 1994, and September 14, 1995. All allografts were procured and allocated by the Delaware Valley Transplant Program, the organ procurement agency in eastern Pennsylvania. Cold preservation time and delayed allograft function were used to measure efficiency of allograft allocation and short term allograft function, respectively. The mean cold preser vation time was reduced from 25.08 hours to 20.68 hours (P < 0.001). The percentage of delayed allograft function was 19.9 and 17.4 for the pre- and postcentralization groups, respectively (P = 0.5). Therefore, centralization of histocompatibility tissue typing was a regionally ef fective process intervention for reducing cold preserva tion time without adversely impacting short-term graft function. The magnitude of this reduction varied between individual centers. Further investigation is required to determine the effect on long-term allograft function and system wide costs.",

The central com ponent of this redesign has been the establishment of \"care centers,\" which are administratively and fiscally separate \"hospitals within the hospital.\" To promote quality and financial goals set for each care center, a novel employee incentive compensation program was created. Performance on both quality and financial in dicators determines the level of bonus payments to hourly employees. The incentive compensation plan was initi ated in the first quarter of 1996. By achieving two of the three performance targets, employees earned a bonus of 6% of base salary for the first two quarters. Nurses and pharmacists did not accept bonus payments because of collective bargaining agreements. The early experience of the Cardiac Care Center has been highly favorable. Changes are planned to improve the process further.",

    "abstract": "Patients with a chief complaint of chest pain are frequently monitored by telemetry for evaluation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, there is insufficient evidence to support this practice in younger patients without coronary artery disease (CAD). The objective is to assess outcomes of patients younger than 50 years of age and monitored by telemetry. Consecutive medical records of patients admitted for chest pain between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, were reviewed. Patients were excluded who had a CAD history, an abnormal initial troponin, or an abnormal initial electrocardiogram. The remaining patients' charts were evaluated for adverse events such as death, dysrhythmias, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or upgrade to a higher level of care. Ultimately, 814 patients were selected for study. No study participants suffered a significant adverse event. When being evaluated for ACS, patients younger than 50 without a history of CAD may not benefit from telemetry monitoring.",

In the present context, NTS comprise the behaviors and cognitions deployed by surgeons to make decisions, maintain awareness of the operating environment, communicate with and lead supporting personnel. A contemporary safety thesis suggests that focusing on what makes things go right (eg, NTS) is far more productive than retrospective analysis (learning from mistakes). The present qualitative research explored how surgeons deploy NTS to facilitate safe and effective outcomes from surgical interventions. The thematic analysis revealed that this surgical cohort engaged specific self-regulated NTS along an intervention construct consisting of planning, implementation, monitoring progress, and deliberate learning through reflection during the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases of care. Behaviors supporting these contentions were identified in the data and used to amplify use of the construct.",

This article describes an effort to identify key reasons for the underutilization of lung cancer screening in a rural population and to develop interventions to address these barriers suitable for both a large health system and local community clinics. Data were generated from 26 stakeholder interviews (clinicians, clinical staff, and eligible patients), a review of key systems (Electronic Health Record and billing records), and feedback on the feasibility of several potential interventions by health care system staff. These data informed a human-centered design approach to identify possible interventions within a complex health care system by exposing gaps in care processes and electronic health record platforms that can lead patients to be overlooked for potentially life-saving screening. Deployed interventions included communication efforts focused on (1) increasing patient awareness, (2) improving physician patient identification, and (3) supporting patient management.

    "abstract": "The following special editorial is an edited version of remarks I delivered at the June 2023 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physician Leaders (AAPL) in Chicago, IL. I was truly honored to receive the inaugural \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" from the AAPL and they asked me to prepare a convocation address. This provided me with a special opportunity to reflect on my three decades of work with AAPL and to give my historical perspective on the evolution of the field of health care quality and safety. The speech has been slightly edited for publication and a modest number of appropriate references have been added for completeness. I hope you enjoy my very personal reflections and anecdotes. What an absolute honor and privilege it is for me to be here today. Thank you all for coming. I am truly humbled to be standing here before you. I would like to divide my brief comments into four parts. In part one, I will describe \"how did I get here\" and the beginning of my own leadership journey. In part two, I will review my three decades of work with AAPL. In part three, I will try to connect parts one and two, and note some milestones on our collective leadership journey. And finally, in part four, I will review some very personal take home messages. Part One, How Did I Get Here?: In Chronologic Order I grew up in a gilded ghetto on the south shore of Long Island, New York, in a town called Merrick, which was the last exit southbound on the Meadowbrook Parkway before Jones Beach. If you missed Exit 9, you were headed to the beach. My parents were both college and graduate school educated individuals so learning and getting good grades was a central activity in our home. My late father was the middle brother of 3 sons born to non-English speaking European immigrants from pre-World War II Poland. He became fatherless at age five when his father died of pneumonia. He probably had the greatest influence on my vague adolescent notion that I could somehow combine business and medicine. I mostly had a happy childhood. I went to a large, mostly Jewish public high school, where it seemed that one-third of a class of 660 students wanted to attend an Ivy League college, followed by medical school. I totally drank the Kool Aid as we say today. But here is where my journey into physician leadership really began. And special thanks to our AAPL colleague, Dr. Art Lazarus,1 for publishing aspects of my story in his great book from 1998 entitled, MD/MBA: Physicians on the New Frontier of Medical Management. In the fall of 1972, a heck of a long time ago, I read an article in the newspaper2 where for the very first time, I saw the juxtaposition of the words, \"physician leader.\" I have a very distinct memory of this moment, now, more than 50 years later. I shared the article with my dad and he urged me to write a note to the author, Dr. Samuel P. Martin, III, a professor at the Wharton School of Business on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Of course, as a 17-year-old, I promptly told my dad that it was a \"stupid idea.\" A day or so later, out came my brand new, ready for college, Smith Corona electric typewriter, and I pecked out an admiring note to Dr. Martin. Well, wouldn't you know it but that son of a gun called me on my home phone line on Long Island? Let us take a moment: back in 1972, no email, no cell phones, my mother probably answered the call from Dr. Martin. In that fateful call, he told me to get on a train and come to the Wharton campus at Penn in Philadelphia. Sometime in the early spring of 1973, just prior to high school graduation, off I went to meet Dr. Martin. This is a very personal and admittedly corny story, but it led me to the prestigious Leonard Davis Institute on Locust Walk at the epicenter of the nation's foremost school of business, practically adjacent to one of the top 5 medical schools in America. Most of this I was blissfully unaware of as a high school senior. Meeting Sam in his office as a high school kid, was truly remarkable. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall, a decorated World War II hero in the O. S. S., and had been appointed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to build a national program to produce academic physician leaders. Penn was one of 5 such sites across the nation, and Sam was the executive director of the Penn program. That day in 1973, began a 20-year mentor–mentee relationship with Sam. He helped me understand the interaction among the broad fields of management, leadership, and medicine. He was, in retrospect, eerily prescient in predicting where our industry was headed. Sam even suggested that I should consider majoring in economics as an undergraduate and simultaneously try to fulfill all of the needed pre-medical requirements. Finding a college where I could actually \"operationalize\" this plan was daunting, and luckily, Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York, fit the bill. Of course, the fact that Vassar had just gone coed, and it was one of the most prestigious girls' schools in America, did not hurt either! While at Vassar, and with advice from Sam, I completed the plan. My senior thesis, written in 1977 in the Department of Economics, was about health maintenance organizations. Literally no one in the entire Economics Department at Vassar even knew what an HMO was. In those days, we went straight from college to medical school, there was no such thing as a gap year or even a junior year abroad for pre-med nerds like me. I was lucky to get into multiple medical schools and off to the University of Rochester I went. I continued to meet with Sam annually. While at the University of Rochester, I became active in student government. In retrospect, my grades in the first 2 years of medical school were so terrible that I probably was running away from further anxiety and embarrassment in the classroom. In the summer of 1978, after year one of medical school, I was selected by the Department of Community Medicine to travel to Portland, Oregon for 3 months and to conduct health services research at the Kaiser Permanente Research Center. This was a pivotal moment in my leadership journey, as I got to meet persons who were thinking about population health, although we did not call it pop health back then! I returned for the second year of medical school with new enthusiasm, and with hope that I would pass and get to the clinical years. My student government activity included representing Rochester as a delegate of sorts to a regional American Medical Student Association (AMSA) meeting in New York City. In October of 1978, the fall of year 2 of medical school, Rochester actually paid for me to fly to New York City to attend an AMSA regional meeting at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. At that AMSA meeting, while staying in New York City with my college girlfriend in her apartment, I found myself sitting next to a really cute brunette from Brown University. I am very happy to report that Dr. Esther Nash is also here with me today, 45 years later. More about her shortly. Part Two, from AAMD to ACPE to AAPL I first learned about the American Association of Medical Directors (AAMD) as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar at Penn Med School. Luckily, following internship and residency, I was accepted into this fantastic National Leadership Program under Dr. Martin's tutelage on the Penn campus. I finished residency on a Friday in 1984 and that Monday was in summer school at Wharton. Later that the same year at Wharton, I believe that Roger Schenke, one of the founders of AAMD, visited the Wharton campus to talk about physician leadership. I was totally struck by Roger's presentation. Although many of the faculty thought that he lacked key academic credentials, I was smitten. I discussed joining the AAMD with other campus leaders, most of whom said it was likely to be a complete waste of time. As a result, I remember traveling to Tampa, using my fellowship resources on Friday, September 20, 1985, to have a private meeting with Roger. How would you describe Roger Schenke? Well, I was a 29-year-old physician oozing ambition, Roger was a tough ex-military non-clinician leader and I made Roger an offer. I told him that I would teach a course on writing research papers for publication, if he would allow me to teach in one or more of the AAMD programs. I added to the offer by saying that if I got a top evaluation, he would then promise to invite me back to future meetings. We shook hands on that deal. I finished my MBA in 1986 and then joined the University of Pennsylvania general internal medicine faculty. I spent nearly 4 years on the Penn campus, practicing general medicine, being a junior faculty member at the med school, and I even had the opportunity to teach an intro health management course at Wharton as well. In 1990, I got recruited from Penn to join Jefferson University, just about 25 blocks east of the Penn campus. The Jefferson Medical College Dean who recruited me, Dr. Joseph Gonnella, just celebrated his 89th birthday with a special ceremony on our campus at Jefferson, not even 1 month ago. But here is where the story connects AAMD to the American College of Physician Executives (ACPE) to AAPL. Roger Schenke called me in 1992 after I had spoken at a series of AAMD meetings, and he said, and I will paraphrase, that \"you've got what it takes and I want you to create a four day core course on quality and safety, go recruit whatever faculty you need, and come back to me with the details. And we're going to launch this course in 1993.\" After nearly a year of work with key colleagues, including the late John Coombs, who was then the associate dean at the University of Washington School of Medicine, we launched the now famous course called the Three Faces of Quality. The Three Faces mirrored the Donabedian tripod3 of structure, process, and outcomes. You have to picture what the course was originally like, 4 days, 2 full 8 hour days and 2 half days. Each recipient received 2 gigantic printed binders. We were using 35 mm slides. I carried a Kodak slide carousel in my briefcase to these meetings and every night rearranged the slides as necessary for the next day's lecture. Special thanks to a former colleague at ACPE, Mr. Howard Horwitz, who insisted that I make the transition from 35 mm slides to a new platform called \"PowerPoint.\" Truthfully, the timeframe from 1993 to 1999 was the heyday of the Three Faces of Quality. Typically, we hosted nearly 100 ACPE attendees in a large ballroom. It was exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. I celebrated multiple birthdays while teaching the Three Faces. It was as though the storied La Paloma hotel in Tucson, Arizona, became my special birthday place. And in a crazy way, celebrating birthday 40, 50, and 60 were all part of the history of the Three Faces of Quality. My wife was generally good natured about this and at various times sent a singing cowboy or other crazy visitors who crashed our course for a few minutes. At my 40th birthday, the college wheeled out a gigantic birthday cake in the middle of the class and it was wonderful show of support. Let's spend a moment further examining the evolution of AAMD to ACPE to AAPL. For example, in 1999, a rocket booster was applied to the Three Faces with the publication of the Institute of Medicine, now the National Academy of Medicine report, To Err Is Human.4 All of a sudden, everybody was interested in adopting the tenets of quality improvement. People like Phil Crosby, and others became household names. In 2001, the publication of Crossing the Quality Chasm5 provided further evidence that the Three Faces was the way to go to obtain the necessary grounding in quality and safety, especially for rising physician leaders. Standout memories of that four day course included the 7 am voluntary Journal Club, the two case studies with vigorous class participation, and, of course, multiple jokes that I certainly could not tell in today's political environment. I enjoyed every minute of the day's classroom work and realized that my energy came from being with these amazing emerging leaders from around the country. In 2006, my first book with ACPE6 was published entitled Practicing Medicine in the 21st Century. This was an edited volume with contributors from all over the country, including some leading ACPE members. Somewhat ironically, this future-focused book had a picture of a palm pilot on the cover! I remember that we had to hurry up and replace that cover with a Blackberry, not a great move! Sadly, John Coombs, died in 2009 of a malignant melanoma at age 63. It was a huge loss to me personally, and of course to the college as well. While I was terribly sad about John's passing, 2009 was also a watershed time at Jefferson, where the University created the nation's first College of Population Health, and I was named the Founding Dean. It was an emotional roller coaster. In 2010, I came to a special ACPE board meeting and presented to Alan Kaplan, who of course is here with us today, about the possibility of Jefferson and our new College of Population Health, becoming a partner with ACPE. The partnership would be focused on our brand new, second in the country, Master's degree in Quality and Safety. Alan and the board thankfully embraced our proposal, and we joined the ranks of other grad schools like Carnegie Mellon and the University of Massachusetts. By 2012, my second book with ACPE, entitled Healthcare Quality, the Clinicians Primer7 was published. This book was designed especially for doctors with big print and lots of pictures. It became the de facto textbook for the Three Faces of Quality. By 2013, it appeared that it was time to break up the band. No one really wanted to spend four days at a hotel where most of the material could really be adapted to 2 full days. As a result, I was compelled to leave the Three Faces in very capable hands of faculty whom I had trained. I joined what we used to call the PIM, Physician in Management team. My new responsibility, more than a decade ago, was to create and deliver a 1 day, 8 hour overall introduction to the \"Fundamentals of Quality and Safety.\" This remains my principal responsibility with AAPL today. In 2019, I voluntarily stepped down from the Deanship of the College of Population Health at Jefferson. I felt strongly that good leaders need to step aside after a decade or more at the helm. It is also true that most Deans exit in one of 2 ways. They get fired, or they get carried out feet first. Neither of those exits was appealing to me. As the only Emeritus Dean still working full time after 33 years on the Jefferson campus, the university president most recently has called me a \"unicorn.\" Well, I have been called far worse. But a good leadership lesson here is if you are looking to your organization for love and affection, I would strongly urge you instead to buy a dog.

In his October 4, 2022 Modern Healthcare editorial,8 our CEO, Dr. Peter Angood, summed up our field well by calling physician leaders, \"interface professionals.\" I think that is a great label. We are translators. We are bridge builders. We are interpreters. And we promote the true north of the biggest industry in America. The true north is our mission to improve health. Let's just take a moment. In 1993, there were no Chief Medical Officers or Chief Quality Officers, there was no \"fund of knowledge\" or agreed upon curriculum for quality and safety. I believe it is fair to say with the evolution of AAMD to ACPE to AAPL that this organization has led the transformation toward the professional Doctor/Leader. We started with CME credit, and then created the Triple M degree (Masters in Medical Management) and then partnerships with other leading universities, and promulgated the notion of the certified physician executive which is now a well-recognized national credential. Finally, looking at this evolutionary arc into the future, I think we can see three key accomplishments including 15 collaborating universities, under the auspices of CAHME (the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education), who are self-evaluating, and ultimately on a mission to certify and accredit master's degrees in health care quality and safety.9 In 1993, we could only have dreamt about 15 universities offering a master's degree in quality and safety. Even the ACGME, right here in Chicago, after a decade of struggle, has approved a 2-year nonclinical post residency fellowship in what they clumsily call HALM, health administration, leadership and management.10 But this, I believe, is a pivotal event in the evolution of our field, whereby academic medicine is recognizing the importance of additional training in the arena that we believe is so critical to the future. Finally, with the publication in 2023 of the Fifth Edition of The Healthcare Quality Book11 by the Health Administration Press, we now have the most widely used graduate level text in our field. It has been my privilege to be one of the editors since the first edition. Part Four: Take Home Messages Now, for some personal take home messages. Good teachers always end with some pithy take home messages. And that is what I would like to conclude with now. Back at Wharton, I had many great teachers but Dr. Bill Kissick stands out, because of his aphorism, \"always be nice to people on your way up, as you will surely need them on your way down.\" All I can say here is \"amen.\" Similarly, Chuck Dwyer, who taught at many AAPL events, said, \"never expect anyone to engage in a behavior that serves your needs and values unless you give that person adequate reason to do so.\" Another great mentor, the consultant Tom Atchinson, taught me as a leader you cannot over communicate. And of course, Dr. Samuel P. Martin. His recipe for success was process, process, process, and then worry about the outcome. All good work is three quarters process and one quarter outcome. In closing, I want to recognize again some key persons. First, of course, my physician wife, Dr. Esther Nash, who is here with us today. We are blessed with three children and two perfect grandchildren and another one on the way! The entire team at AAPL, with a special thanks to Dr. Angood, Dr. Kaplan, and the entire board of directors. Also, thanks to former staff like Howard Horwitz, the late Roger Schenke, and our late colleague, Dr. John Coombs. But finally, I want to thank each and every one of you. By one estimate, I have taught in person, nearly 6000 AAPL members over the past 3 decades. I have had the privilege and honor of being your teacher, your colleague, and your fellow traveler on our leadership journey together. This is something that I will always treasure. Thanks again for joining me here today.",

The interrupted time series study included preintervention, intervention, and postintervention phases, with 2 points of observation each during the pre- and postintervention phases. The baseline hand hygiene compliance was 16%, which improved to 43.9% after the intervention. Health care workers were 4 times more likely to adhere to proper hand hygiene postintervention (odds ratio [OR], 4.117). Independent predictors of hand hygiene compliance included the week of observation (week 3: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.872; week 5: AOR, 3.427; and week 7: AOR, 4.713), health care worker type (consultants: AOR, 0.964; residents: AOR, 2.187; and interns: AOR, 6.684), daytime (AOR, 1.232), and “after” type of hand hygiene opportunity (AOR, 1.577). No significant differences were found in knowledge, attitude, and practices pre- and postintervention, and the interventions’ effect was sustained and increased over time, supporting implementation in hospitals across India.",

    "abstract": "Oncology patients presenting for outpatient evaluation of a respiratory tract infection (RTI) are often tested for a variety of viruses with a respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) in addition to influenza and SARS-CoV-2. This triad of testing is expensive and uncomfortable because it requires 2 nasal swabs. Little evidence supports the use of an RPP in outpatient settings, but it is routinely ordered. This retrospective chart review analyzed 183 RPPs performed at Jefferson between April 2020 and November 2021 in outpatient oncology patients presenting with RTI. Data collected included patient demographics, symptoms, and exam findings at time of RPP, additional testing completed, results of RPP, antibiotic and antiviral use before and after RPP results, and patient outcomes 30 days after RPP. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Of the 183 RPPs analyzed, 16.9% (31) were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus. Fifty-two patients (28.4%) started antibiotics before results of the RPP. Of those, 2 patients (3.8%) had a change in antibiotic plan after RPP results returned. Zero patients were started on antiviral medication before results of the RPP. One patient started antiviral treatment after RPP results returned. In total, only 3 patients (1.6%) had an RPP-driven change in medication management. This study suggests limited utility in use of RPPs for oncology patients presenting to the office with RTI symptoms. Targeted testing with a single nasal swab for influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 may be more clinically relevant. The authors hope to use these data to implement a quality improvement initiative to reduce RPP utilization in this population.",

Primary outcome studied was transfer/discharge order entry time and secondary outcomes included medication order entry time, staff perception, and time spent per patient. The location was a level one pediatric intensive care unit in an academic children’s hospital. Utilizing Lean Six methodologies the major contributor to increased variability was different attending physician rounding patterns. These patterns were evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee, and the most efficient was adopted by all attending physicians during the study period. Data was collected by secret observers and a pre-post staff perception survey. Transfer/discharge order entry improved by 45 minutes/patient. Medication order entry improved by 89 minutes/order. Staff survey showed increased satisfaction in 9 of 12 aspects. Time spent per patient increased by 20%. In conclusion, standardization of rounds improved patient throughput, medication order entry, and staff satisfaction while increasing value-added time during rounds.",

    "abstract": "Access to specialty and private practice providers has been a divisive policy issue over the last decade, complicated by the conflict between a reduction in government-funded health care reimbursement and the need for health care providers to sustain a financially sound practice. This study evaluates the orthopedic spine consult service at an academic tertiary care center at 2 separate time points over a 5-year period to better understand the impact of decreasing orthopedic reimbursement rates and the increasing prevalence of federally supported medical insurance on the access to specialty care. In total 500 patients in 2017 and 480 patients in 2021 were included for the final analysis. A higher percentage of consults in 2021 came from the emergency department (74.0% versus 60.4%, P &lt; 0.001); however, the emergency department saw fewer spinal cord injuries (11.9% versus 21.4%, P &lt; 0.001), and the spinal cord injuries were less severe (3.1% versus 6.2% Association Impairment Scale A or B, P = 0.034). A smaller percentage of patients in 2021 went on to receive orthopedic spine surgery following consultation (35.2% versus 43.8%, P = 0.007), and those receiving surgery had an operation performed farther out from the initial consultation (4.73 versus 4.09 days, P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, fewer patients with Medicare insurance (23.5% versus 30.8%) and more patients with Medicaid insurance (20.2% versus 12.4%) were seen in 2021 compared with 2017 ( P = 0.003). Overall, this study found an increased proportion of Medicaid patients seen by the spine consult service but a decrease in the acuity of consults. Measures to improve access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act have revealed the complexity of this issue in health care. This study’s findings have demonstrated that while more patients did have insurance coverage following the Affordable Care Act, they still face a barrier to accessing outpatient orthopedic spine providers.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines are among the most cost-effective and successful medical interventions, saving approximately 2.3 million lives annually. Unfortunately, vaccination coverage for adults remains low, leading to unnecessary and costly health consequences. An initial chart review revealed that 95% (N = 20) of students were not up to date with vaccines. In a patient survey, 100% of students (N = 21) did not recall receiving useful vaccine information, but 66.7% reported it would be helpful (≥4 of 5 on the Likert scale). Strategies supporting effective care, an Institute of Medicine quality domain, were used to address these gaps. The aim was to increase effective care in university adult students for vaccines by 30% over 90 days. The quality improvement method of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles was used to evaluate iterative tests of change. Examining contextual elements, team and patient feedback, aggregate data, and run charts informed tests of change over 4 cycles. Core interventions included enhanced screening, vaccine shared decision-making, provider checklists, and a team engagement plan. Greater than 83% (N = 152) of students were not up to date with vaccines as per national guidelines. Over 8 weeks, the team effectively referred students for 265 of the 274 vaccines they were eligible for—an accuracy rate of 95.3%. The aim score, a mean composite score reflecting all 3 interventions, increased from 49% to 95%. Effective care for vaccine uptake increased by 83.8%—far exceeding the goal. Campus health centers and other primary care settings could benefit from adopting a similar strategy that provides clear benefits to patients and the broader community while decreasing health care costs.",

We organized a team who studied the process and identified opportunities for improvement in three areas: the selection of equipment items ordered, management of equipment-related data, and standardization of equipment delivery contracts. We produced a reference manual for staff, developed a simple database, and incorporated JCAHO home care equipment management standards into equipment delivery vendor contracts. The results of the team's efforts were an increase in efficiency, a decrease in discharge delays, and improved continuity of care.

The survey included responses to three sec tions of the questionnaire: 25 statements on TQM, information on the TQM process status in the facility, and demographics of respondents and their facilities. The results of the survey indicate a considerable involvement of responding chiefs of staff in the TQM process and indicated their willingness to support it. Respondents agreed that TQM requires time and com mitment of top management, and, again, they indi cated their willingness to devote the time necessary for the process to succeed. They were, however, cau tious in endorsing the statement that TQM will de crease health care costs (fiscal and human).The survey provides information that should prove valuable to administration in planning TQM and Con tinuous Quality Improvement efforts.",

New members were screened by the health maintenance organization, which then informed the for-profit managed care organization responsible for the management of the mental health and substance abuse benefit of its findings. Other than the screening, there were no contractual expectations. The managed care organization was given only the names of individuals who “screened positive,” but was not required to act on the screening results. Twenty percent of newly enrolled Medicaid health maintenance organization members were screened, and 2.5% were identified to have behavioral health and substance abuse treatment needs. As Medicaid managed care is responsible for the health care of low-income beneficiaries who are inherently vulnerable, it is important to make every effort to evaluate the impact of a quality project meant to improve their treatment.",

From March 2010 to December 2014, 711 physicians classified as having OA in their practice, indicated by scoring 15 or higher on the OA checklist, were propensity matched to practices without OA. Patient experience was measured with 5 composites: timely care, communication, staff quality, care coordination, and overall physician rating. Minimally important differences in patient experience ratings were calculated between OA and control practices to determine optimal OA checklist scores. OA positively affected most composite domains for specialist practices, except physician rating, but minimally affected primary care practices. Practices scoring 19 or higher on the OA checklist had significantly higher patient-experience scores than matched controls. The authors recommend practices strive for 20 or higher on the OA checklist to see significant improvements in patient experience ratings.",

It is unclear what factors lead to the transfer of patients with spine pathology to level I care facilities, and which transfers are indicated. All patients with isolated spinal pathology who were transferred from 2011 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients were divided into urgent transfers, defined as anyone who required operative intervention, and nonurgent transfers. Two hundred twenty-seven patients were transferred for isolated spinal pathology over 51 months; 109 (48.0%) patients required urgent intervention and 118 (52.0%) patients required nonurgent care. No significant differences were found between groups in terms of private insurance, age, sex, race, or Charlson comorbidity index. The urgent group was less likely to have a traumatic chief complaint (57.8% vs 78.0%, P = .001). More than half of all spine patients who were transferred to a tertiary care center required minimal intervention.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of Certification (MOC) is one way physicians demonstrate to the public that they are competent to deliver safe, high-quality medical care. The authors conducted a qualitative content analysis of information from 24 Member Boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties. A constant comparative approach was used to categorize themes of quality and safety and related concepts. All Boards (24/24) had public websites with formal documents and 23/24 had at least 1 representative respond to a survey. Sixty-three percent (15/24) of Boards had a patient safety requirement, and 96% (23/24) of Boards had a quality improvement requirement. Nearly all Boards incorporate quality improvement and most incorporate patient safety, but their assessment methods and level of inclusion on the topic vary. Sharing methods of incorporating quality and safety among certifying Boards will allow Member Boards to cater to the evolution of the MOC landscape and benefit from other Boards’ experiences.",

    "abstract": "The authors aimed to improve the rate of pre-dialysis arteriovenous (AV) access placement for hospitalized patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. The authors developed and implemented a protocol for hospitalized adult patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL/min to streamline the workflow for obtaining AV access. The protocol was piloted on 5 inpatient medical services over 3 months at 1 institution. Specific-Measurable-Achievable-Realistic-Timely (SMART) aims, Fishbone diagrams, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, and run charts were used to assess the process and outcomes of the intervention. There were 22 patients in the baseline group and 27 patients in the intervention group. Pre-dialysis AV access increased from 23% to 46%. Length of stay did not differ significantly between the baseline group (8.31 days) and the intervention group (8.4 days). Pathways can improve pre-dialysis AV access without significantly increasing length of stay.",

This article outlines an improvement effort targeting weekday evening inpatient radiology delays through staffing changes replacing trainees with faculty-trainee team coverage, pushing faculty coverage from 4 pm to 8 pm. Order-report turnaround times (TATs), critical findings TATs for pneumothorax and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and percentage meeting target were compared pre and post implementation for the 4 to 8 pm time frame using the Mann-Whitney U and χ 2 tests, respectively. Stakeholder surveys assessed patient safety, morale, education, and operational efficiency. Median TATs (minutes) improved: X-rays 906 to 112, computed tomography 994 to 84, magnetic resonance imaging 1172 to 233, and ultrasound 88 to 58. Median critical findings TATs (minutes) improved from 853 to 30 and 112 to 22 for pneumothorax and ICH, respectively, and the percentage meeting target improved from 45% to 65%. Survey results reported perceived improvement in patient safety, education, and operational efficiency and no impact on morale.",

This study describes the implementation of an interdisciplinary process for helping patients complete HCPs during nonurgent visits at a large urban academic primary care practice between July 2014 and May 2017. The process was mapped using direct observations. Pre- and post-implementation measurement of the percent of patients who completed HCPs during their visit revealed significant improvement (1.4% vs 26.1% in the North Suite, special cause variation). Over the study period, the percentage of patients with HCP information rose significantly across the entire clinic (eg, 37% to 80% in the North Suite, Fisher exact test P < .0001; similar findings in other suites). Key facilitators and barriers to implementation were identified by physician leaders. An interdisciplinary process can sustainably improve the percentage of primary care patients with a completed HCP.",

The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalists’ attitudes and perceived barriers to fall prevention practices in 2 different hospital systems in Portland, Oregon. A total of 42 responses were collected. Although hospitalists in both groups agreed that all patients admitted should undergo fall risk assessments (FRAs), both groups disagreed that hospitalists should be responsible for performing them. Neither group felt that they had the time to complete FRAs and were either neutral or felt the lack of expertise to conduct them. These findings suggest that the hospitalist role in inpatient fall prevention multidisciplinary teams may be unclear to physician providers and that health care systems may benefit from examining this further.",

The goal was to identify a more consistent and efficient approach to survey health care facilities. The authors developed a Peer-to-Peer Interdisciplinary Patient Tracer program to assess compliance with National Patient Safety Goals and to proactively identify areas of inpatient, ambulatory, and procedural risk. The program has been operational for more than 5 years, with continued expansion annually. In all, 96% of frontline leadership reported satisfaction; 100% reported that they would recommend the program to others (Kirkpatrick level 1 results). Mean absolute change in performance scores from 2014 to 2018 was 15%. All survey findings triggered the development of an improvement project. This novel integrated program advanced institutional improvement by strengthening internal peer-to-peer surveillance, engaging leadership, and creating an accountability structure for internal improvement efforts.",

This is especially true of high-risk individuals, who are difficult for clinicians to identify during a typical health care encounter. The authors developed an electronic patient questionnaire that determined an individual’s CRC screening status and identified high-risk individuals. The questionnaire was administered to employees through the Department of Human Resources. The response rate was 44.7%; 81.2% of respondents aged ≥50 years were up-to-date on CRC screening; 878 high-risk individuals were identified, 77.7% of whom were up-to-date on CRC screening. However, among high-risk individuals aged 40 to 49 years, only 45.8% reported up-to-date CRC screening. The questionnaire was effective in measuring CRC screening rates and identifying high-risk individuals. Dissemination by the Department of Human Resources was novel, effective, and was not dependent on a health care encounter to assess screening or high-risk status.",

The authors reviewed the MEDLINE database from 2016 to the present for articles on patient quality and safety measures in the ambulatory setting. The search was guided by the use of specific keywords and medical subject heading terms, including patient safety, ambulatory care, quality, measurements, medical errors, medication safety and electronic prescribing, safety culture, diagnostic error, team training, continuity, care coordination, simulation exercises, and patient-centered. Studying ambulatory quality and safety remains challenging because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the outpatient environment. This review shows that since 2016, very modest progress has been made in this critical area. Effective change in ambulatory quality and safety will require a prioritization and redoubling of efforts.",

    "abstract": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common cause of 30-day inpatient readmission. Studies have found that early follow-up with primary care physicians (PCP) within 7 days of discharge may improve 30-day readmission rates; however, many have used a multidisciplinary discharge coordination team, which is not a resource at all centers. Here, the authors present a resident-driven quality improvement initiative using a monthly quality and safety award to increase early PCP follow-up for veterans discharged following admissions due to a CHF exacerbation. Primary outcomes were percentage of PCP follow-up within 7 days and median time to PCP follow-up. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients attending a PCP visit within 7 days, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.This prepost quasi-experimental cohort study evaluated 3 concurrent quality improvement interventions to increase PCP follow-up after CHF exacerbation. Process maps and Ishikawa diagrams examined the discharge process. Interventions included a standardized discharge scheduling order, monthly education on the process, and monthly aggregated performance feedback for each medical resident. A patient safety and quality award was given to the team with the highest rate of PCP appointments scheduled within 7 days. Patient characteristics and outcomes were gathered for a 6-month historic period and 6-month intervention period. Test of proportions and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test were used to compare groups.A total of 294 patients were discharged (161 in historic group and 133 in intervention group). Appointments scheduled within 7 days of discharge increased from 43% to 79% ( P < 0.001). Median time to PCP follow-up decreased from 8 to 6 days ( P < 0.001). Patients who completed (showed up to) a PCP appointment within 7 days increased from 16% to 41% ( P < 0.001). There was no impact on 30-day readmission or mortality; however, the number of study subjects was too small to rule out an effect.A standardized discharge scheduling order, more robust resident education, and a monthly patient safety and quality award resulted in a significant increase in the rate of primary care follow-up within 7 days of CHF exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "The authors present a tool to improve gaps in patient safety using the electronic health record. The tool integrates gap identification, passive alerts, and actions into a single interface embedded within clinicians' workflow. The tool was developed to address venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, prevention of hypo- and hyperglycemia, code status documentation, bowel movement frequency, and skilled nursing facility transitions. Alerts and actions during silent and live periods were retrospectively analyzed. The most prevalent safety gaps were lack of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (40.4% of alerts), constipation (19.3%), and lack of code status (18.4%). Disparities in safety gaps were present by patient race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Usability testing showed positive feedback without significant alert burden.

Preoperative opioid usage did not vary meaningfully between high- and low-risk zip code groups. Patients in high-risk opioid overdose zip codes were significantly more likely to exhibit chronic postoperative opioid use. The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that opioid discontinuation was less probable at any postoperative time for patients residing in high opioid fatality zip codes.

The intervention included an ACP education module, audit and feedback, as well as workflow and EHR adaptations. The authors prospectively tracked SDM documentation using control charts and used chart review to assess secondary outcome, process, and balancing measures. SDM documentation significantly increased from 69.5% to 80.2% ( P < 0.001) for intervention patients, sustained over 3 years, and was unchanged for control patients (34.6% to 36.3%; P = 0.355). There were no significant differences in secondary ACP outcomes in intervention or control patients. Clinical and EHR adaptations increased SDM documentation for hospitalized adults with minimal risk, although did not affect other ACP metrics.

While blueprints for building successful Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) exist in the literature, few describe the journey to achieving both shared savings and high quality outcomes achieved by a medical group within an academic health system. Clinician education and engagement, prioritizing prevention and achieving benchmarks, developing supportive roles, more precise documentation of accurate diagnostic coding, and risk stratification constituted the approach. When first participating as an ACO, the medical group built programs and teams to improve quality, while CMS simultaneously changed quality measurements from pay-for-reporting to pay-for-performance. Quality scores initially dipped, though scores have since risen to 98.44% in 2020. Between 2015 and 2017, financial results were more than $10 million below the threshold, while in performance years 2018 to 2020, Northeast Medical Group achieved $24 million in aggregate in shared savings.",

This study evaluates the impact of NewYork Quality Care's Clinician Incentive Program on improving quality measure performance over 4 years. Clinicians including primary care physicians and specialists actively opted-in to an incentive program where their quality performance was evaluated and rewarded biannually. Using Medicare Shared Savings Program data extracted for quality measures (2016-2019), this study analyzes quality measure performance between clinicians who opted-in to the program compared to those who did not. Additional analysis was performed comparing primary care clinician and specialist performance. The analysis revealed that clinicians in the incentive program significantly outperform (P < 0.05) clinicians who chose not to join the program in 6 of the 7 quality measures. In addition, the program helped facilitate discussions with clinicians more broadly in population health efforts.",

    "abstract": "Two recent changes in Philadelphia-area hospital organizations are consolidation into systems and acquisition of 2 medical school hospitals by a for-profit chain. This study explored whether such consolidation and conversion affected costs and outcomes of care. The analysis included 1,617,581 discharges from 49 acute-care hospitals from 1997 to 1999. Analyses within and between medical school hospitals examined trends in discharges, case mix, length of stay, and mortality. The study addressed 2 questions: whether, as hospitals consolidate into medical school hospital-based systems, volume, severity, length of stay, and mortality increase in those hospitals; and whether for-profit conversion redistributes complex, high-cost admissions to nonprofit hospitals. The 2 medical school hospitals that became for-profit experienced decreases in volume and resource intensity, coupled at one with an increase in severity. However, these patterns were produced more by the system's financial instability than by consolidation or conversion.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a data-collection system that we believe has wide applicability in dispersed organizations that have different local information systems infrastructures. A questionnaire was developed using commonly available software tools and was implemented several times across a dispersed network of individuals to rapidly collect, organize, and analyze information with a minimum of secretarial time and administrative cost. A common e-mail database was created identifying all of the medical directors and care management directors in the Blue Cross Blue Shield system. Initial polling of these individuals yielded specific questions of interest, and a final questionnaire was developed. The focus of the project centered on the evaluation of disease state management initiatives within each of the plans and on the ongoing use and future potential for various medical management initiatives. A questionnaire was developed using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with the ultimate development of a database in mind. All of the questions, whether single or multiple answers, were mapped from question response sections to a hidden specified range created to import the flat file answer block into a database. Individual cells containing answers to questions were each mapped to a hidden area of the spreadsheet arrayed as a series of rows. As each questionnaire was returned to the central site, data was imported from the hidden range name into a Microsoft Access database. The process of collecting extensive information on a questionnaire-by-questionnaire basis took approximately 20 seconds of time per questionnaire. A final report was ultimately created composed of some 24 pages of detailed information on managed care across the participants, representing some 90% of the member organizations. Secretarial costs were needed only for final transcription of the report.",

    "abstract": "We apply pattern-recognizing artificial neural net works (ANNs) to the patients of two psychiatric hospi tals, a private, for-profit hospital (PH) and a state hospital (SH), both serving the southern tier of Maine (approximately two-thirds of the state's population, i.e., 800,000 persons) over a 19-month period. In our data from the PH, N = 837 admissions, and at the SH, N = 834. Unique patient identifiers were assigned to patients so that their individual patterns of care could be incorpo rated into our ANNs. We used a previously reported methodology to measure quality of care (Q), and devel oped a measure of value of service (V) from the patients' perspective for both facilities. A random portion of the demographic and outcome data of patients from each hospital was sequestered as a test set, whereas the re mainder was used to train ANNs with length-of-stay (LOS) as an outcome measure. Q, and V normalized for risk (RR), i.e., V/RR, were calculated for each test set, which included multiple admissions of individual patients to each hospital. The methodology for V accounts for the severity of illness with the calculation of a metric called U/G, for the differences in case-mix by exchanging \"vir tual patients\" between ANNs, and for entropy in the health care system by using a metric called the risk ratio (RR). Results showed that V/RR was 2.4 times greater at the SH than at the PH. This advantage is likely due to prior knowledge of individual patient patterns of treat ment by the SH's staff. Data sets from each hospital using only single admissions for each patient in the study pe riod (thereby eliminating unique patient patterns of LOS), yielded a V/RR that was only 21% greater at the SH. We hypothesize that this difference is due to the SH's ability to use treatment and discharge based upon pa tient strengths and level of clinical improvement, un fettered by insurance deadlines. Approximately 5% of the admissions to our studied PH went on to our SH, namely, the most severely impaired and indigent patients. The SH not only had twice the value, but also had half the cost of the PH, despite the greater number of treat ment non-responders and non-compliants at the SH. The reasons for this are skilled staff and specialized ancil lary services, staff knowledge of patients' responses to previous therapy, and individualized LOSs. These are fea tures that create a caring environment and better com pliance with treatment. This study emphasizes the value of tertiary care psychiatric facilities in a comprehensive mental health care delivery system. There are few stud ies of the effects of excessive downsizing of SHs on the community, but reports from Massachusetts (in 1995) suggest a 79% increase in suicides when the closing of SH beds exceeded 98% of maximum historical census. Routine use of pattern-recognizing tools such as ANNs would serve to inform the public about the value of men tal health services so that the most vulnerable in our so ciety are not neglected.",

For approximately the next 12 years, those seniors entering the Medicare-eligible health care market, the so-called Swing generation, will have different characteristics and expectations from those generations that precede or follow it. Through standard survey methods, this study explores and compares the differences in selected health services expectations between the current generation of Medicare-eligible seniors and the next Medicare-eligible generation. Significant differences were found between the two groups on variables related to wait time, medical preparedness, communication, and expectations of managed care coverage.

Subsequent to these changes, all orders have been filled immediately, and the average platelet use in cardiac surgery has decreased from 7 to 4 units. There have been no instances of inability to fill platelet orders. Currently, 96% of cardiac surgery platelet orders are for 4 units.

Six complications were assessed: delirium, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or fall. The study included 207 patients and physician responses were obtained for 156 (75%). Complications were identified in 28 (14%) patients by medical record review, 30 (14%) patients by patient-report, and 11 (7%) patients by physician-report. Fifty-four (26%) patients experienced a complication as identified through at least one of the 3 methods. There was little agreement between the 3 methods (Fleiss' ĸ 0.15, P < 0.001). All 3 sources agreed on the occurrence of a specific complication in only 1 patient (1%). Multiple approaches likely are needed to adequately measure hospital-acquired complications.",

Insurance claims data from April 1, 2017 to March 30, 2018 were reviewed. In total, 2895 hospital patients were identified, among whom 398 died from various causes. Controlling effects of the facility and secondary medical care areas, all-cause mortality was associated with older age, heart failure, malignancy, cerebral stroke, severe comorbidity, and the first and ninth centile of physician density. Multilevel analyses indicated a significant variation at facility level (σ22 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.49). Inclusion of all covariates in the final model significantly reduced facility-level variance. Physician density emerged as an important factor affecting survival outcome; thus, a review of workforce and resource allocation policies is needed. Better clinical management and standardized work processes are necessary to attenuate differences in hospital practice patterns.",

A comprehensive intervention was created to increase trainee reporting, partnering a trainee safety council with high-level faculty. Data were collected for 12 months pre intervention and 30 months post intervention, including short-term (1-12 mo) and long-term (13-30 mo) follow-up. A total of 2337 trainee events were submitted over the study period, primarily communication-related (40%) and on the medicine service (39%). Monthly submissions increased from 29.3 pre intervention to 66.2, 77.7, and 58.6 events/mo at post intervention, short-term follow-up, and long-term follow-up, respectively (P < 0.001). Proportion of hospital events submitted by trainees increased from 2.3% pre intervention to 4.1%, 4.9%, and 3.6% at post intervention, short-term, and long-term follow-up, respectively (P < 0.001). Trainee monthly submissions (P = 0.015) and proportion of hospital events (P < 0.001) declined from short- to long-term follow-up. Low- and intermediate-level harm events significantly increased post intervention (P < 0.001) while high-level events did not (P = 0.15-1.0).

Only a handful of VBPs have definitively shown savings or expanded nationally. We suggest that to shift the health care reimbursement system in the United States to paying for value, quality measures used in VBPs should be vetted as \"fit for purpose.\" We advocate that quality measures deemed \"fit\" for VBPs be defined primarily by the impact of the quality measures on providers, patients, the provider-patient relationship and what matters to patients. We define 5 attributes of quality measures we believe necessary to link the actions of providers and patients and lead to value for our health care system. \"Fit for purpose\" quality measures should focus health care delivery on value improvement and create a culture of value in our health care system.",

Questions examined capacity in 4 domains: performance feedback, postacute care provider utilization, care management, and health information technology. Of 424 hospitals, 38% responded. Both co-participant and bundled payment hospitals reported high capacity for performance feedback and risk stratification and predictive risk assessment using health information technology systems.

This article describes a pilot study on implementing a screening process for social determinants of health in a family medicine clinic where there was no prior standard of care. A quality improvement approach was used to frame the implementation and evolution of screening and follow-up strategies for social needs. Social determinant of health screening was successfully implemented during this pilot of 400 encounters, revealing a 26.3% prevalence. Options for addressing social needs grew during the study, although no statistically significant impact was observed on measured short-term health outcomes. Physicians can use quality improvement to counter clinical inertia toward addressing social determinants of health and also to concurrently screen and develop appropriate patient-oriented solutions in their clinics.",

Isolation and discoordination of both individuals and systems, inequities at local and global scales, and false choices between our prosperity and our health, all exacerbated the crisis. To build a better \"normal\" and not just a new one, health care should employ the approach of targeted universalism, which demonstrates that we can often get to universally held societal objectives by using targeted strategies that help provide an advantage to those that have been systematically disadvantaged. The goal is universal, but achieving it requires multiple strategies that target the needs of various groups to help them share in the universal goal. This approach is perhaps most easily understood, and most urgently needed, in the context of improving health equity. Using targeted strategies to permanently remake our health systems will honor the lives of those we lost far too early.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in insurance status before and after implementation of the ACA in patients who present to the emergency room of a single, level 1 trauma and regional spinal cord injury center. Patient demographic and hospital course information were derived from consult notes and electronic medical record review. Spinal consults between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, were initially included. Consults between January 1 and December 31, 2014, were subsequently removed to obtain two separate cohorts reflecting one calendar year prior to (\"pre-ACA\") and following (\"post-ACA\") the effective date of implementation of the ACA on January 1, 2014. Compared with the pre-ACA cohort, the post-ACA cohort had a significant increase in insurance coverage (95.0% versus 83.9%, P < 0.001). Post-ACA consults had a significantly shorter length of stay compared with pre-ACA consults (7.94 versus 9.19, P < 0.001). A significantly greater percentage of the post-ACA cohort appeared for clinical follow-up subsequent to their initial consultation compared to the pre-ACA cohort (49.5% versus 35.3%, P < 0.001). Spinal consultation after the implementation of the ACA was found to be a significant positive predictor of Medicaid coverage (odds ratio = 1.96 [1.05, 3.82], P = 0.04) and a significant negative predictor of uninsured status (odds ratio = 0.28 [0.16, 0.47], P < 0.001). Increase in overall insurance coverage, increase in patient follow-up after initial consultation, and decrease in hospital length of stay were all noted after the implementation of the ACA for spinal consultation patients presenting to the emergency department.",

    "abstract": "CARE PATHS are a managed care tool used in many of today's acute care hospitals. Developed by a hospital's health care team, their strength lies in a clear statement of expectations and accountability, and in their use as a communication tool among those involved in the care of a specific patient. Because individual patients are unique and may require detours from a CARE PATH, these tools are most successful if used as guide lines rather than strict protocols.However, managed care has forced us to expand our definition of health and health care, and the goal of efficiently managing a population or panel of patients has become the focus of a successful health care organization. This includes an increased emphasis on preventive care or wellness programs as well as the use of new, innovative approaches to providing traditionally inpatient services. With this shift, CARE PATHS have had to evolve as well. The following describes the current approach being used in our delivery system, the EXTENDED CARE PATH (ECP).",

The results showed that considerable savings can be realized by using these methods for one group of patients with the same diagnosis. We were able to redefine and track patients during their pre-, peri-, and postoperative period and estimated the time and cost opportunities for work flow improvement. We concluded that considerable savings are possible by extending the analysis to patients in other DRG groups.",

The authors' external peer review experiences suggest that physician timeliness may be of concern during the admission and discharge processes, the monitoring and follow-up of patient progress, the provision of verbal orders, the transfer of responsibility between physicians, and the use of consultants. A full discussion of the implications of physician timeliness could provide the vehicle for greater understanding of the value of continuous quality improvement in the hospital setting and lead to more complete participation in developing strategies to improve the processes of care.",

    "abstract": "Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is necessary in maintaining and improving the quality of medical care delivered. However, quality assurance (QA) in the past was performed superficially to meet require ments of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations and other regulatory agencies. Academic faculty participation in QA activ ity was also limited. Faculty often assume that mean ingful quality process demands excessive efforts and time unrewarded with career advancement, promo tion, or monetary compensation. In addition, unstruc tured QA leads to duplication of data and loss of educational opportunity. We reorganized the QA process in internal medicine using the CQI concept to: (a) improve academic fac ulty participation, (b) incorporate educational con cepts, (c) stimulate interest in outcome research and CQI, and (d) integrate cost containment. A reorganized CQI format has stimulated enthu siastic participation of faculty and residents, and has generated conferences and grand rounds pertinent to medical care, outcome research, and cost contain ment. We conclude that academic faculty should play leadership roles in the CQI process and include teach ing models. Improved and increased academic faculty participation could be realized, when educational val ues, research activities, and cost analysis are incor porated into the CQI process.",
