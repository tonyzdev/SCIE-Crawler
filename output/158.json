    "abstract": "Abstract Background Motor imagery is a cognitive process that involves mentally simulating movements without physical execution. It has been studied in the context of foot pain to understand the role of motor cortical reorganization and its impact on motor imagery abilities. However, further research is needed to establish consistent evidence regarding the relationship between motor imagery and foot pain. Methods This review analyzed five relevant articles that investigated motor imagery in the context of foot pain. The studies involved participants with various conditions, including leg amputation, chronic leg pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and Achilles tendinopathy. Different methodologies were employed, including motor cortical mapping, foot laterality recognition tasks, EEG recordings, and treatment interventions incorporating motor imagery. Results The findings indicated that individuals with leg amputation exhibited functional reorganization in upper limb motor cortical maps, with a breakdown in the inhibitory relationship between foot and hand representations. Participants with chronic leg pain demonstrated slower and less accurate performance on foot laterality recognition tasks compared to healthy controls. Complex regional pain syndrome patients displayed distinct motor imagery strategies and responded differently to first-person and third-person perspectives. EEG studies revealed differences in brain activity during motor imagery tasks under pain-free and pain conditions. Treatment interventions incorporating motor imagery showed promising outcomes in improving functional outcomes and reducing pain levels. Conclusions Motor imagery plays a significant role in foot pain conditions, although the evidence is still emerging. The findings suggest that motor imagery abilities may be affected by leg amputation, chronic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols for assessing motor imagery, identify specific patient populations that may benefit most from motor imagery interventions, and explore long-term effects. Integrating motor imagery into clinical practice has the potential to enhance rehabilitation approaches and improve outcomes in foot pain management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract International guidelines on the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) have been published but are not tailored to the Belgian situation. This publication presents recommendations from a group of Belgian MG experts for the practical management of MG in Belgium. It includes recommendations for treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) or ocular myasthenia gravis (oMG). Depending on the MG-related antibody a treatment sequence is suggested with therapies that can be added on if the treatment goal is not achieved. Selection of treatments was based on the level of evidence of efficacy, registration and reimbursement status in Belgium, common daily practice and the personal views and experiences of the authors. The paper reflects the situation in February 2024. In addition to the treatment considerations, other relevant aspects in the management of MG are addressed, including comorbidities, drugs aggravating disease symptoms, pregnancy, and vaccination. As many new treatments might potentially come to market, a realistic future perspective on the impact of these treatments on clinical practice is given. In conclusion, these recommendations intend to be a guide for neurologists treating patients with MG in Belgium.",

    "abstract": "Since December 2019, the world is affected by an outbreak of a new disease named COVID-19, which is an acronym of 'coronavirus disease 2019'. Coronaviruses (CoV) were assumed to be associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, such as common cold. This perception changed in time due to occurrence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in 2012, both inducing an epidemic severe viral pneumonia with potentially respiratory failure and numerous extra-pulmonary manifestations. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is likewise a causative pathogen for severe viral pneumonia with the risk of progression to respiratory failure and systemic manifestations. In this review, we will give a summary of the neurological manifestations due to SARS and MERS, as those might predict the neurological outcome in the novel COVID-19. Additionally, we provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, to the extent that literature is already available as the pandemic is still ongoing.",

Here, we aimed to investigate sex-specific patterns in the relationship between sleep problems, assessed using the Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS-2), non motor symptoms (NMS), measured by the NMS scale (NMSS), and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), evaluated by the Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39), in a large cohort of PD patients. One-hundred-fifty-four PD patients were included in the study. Female PD patients (n = 62) exhibited a higher prevalence of sleep problems than males (n = 92), with nocturnal motor-related sleep issues being the most frequent. Sleep disturbances differently correlated with a range of NMS between the two sexes. In females, sleep problems mostly correlated with pain; on the other hand, sleep disturbances were linked to a frailer phenotype characterized by global dysautonomia, perception disturbances, and impaired cognitive function in males. Whether female PD patients experienced a lower HR-QoL than males, sleep disturbances were associated with a worse HR-QoL in both sexes. In conclusion, sleep problems in PD differently burden the two sexes, suggesting possible different etiopathogenesis, diagnostic investigations, and possibly tailored approaches.",

    "abstract": "Skull base osteomyelitis is a serious disease with a high risk of complications including neuroinfection. Typically, the inflammation of the skull base results from infection from neighboring tissues. In case of malignant otitis externa, inflammation disseminates from the external auditory canal. In this study, we present our experience with seven patients diagnosed with skull base osteomyelitis that began with otitis externa and have been treated in our department for the last 10 years. Department Patient Database was searched for the diagnosis skull base osteomyelitis. The search covered the last 10 years. The search revealed seven patients who met the above-described criteria. Medical records of those patients were carefully analyzed including age, gender, symptoms and signs, diagnostics details, treatment, performed procedures, number of hospitalization days, comorbid diseases, and complications including any cranial nerve palsy. Detailed analysis of medical records of patients included in this study showed that skull base osteomyelitis presents a challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Treatment strategy requires prolonged aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy, and in some cases combined with surgical intervention. Cranial nerve paresis indicates progression of the disease and is associated with longer hospital stay. Similar relationship is observed in patients with skull base osteomyelitis that required surgery. Diabetes in patient's medical history may complicate the healing process. Diabetes, neural involvement, and surgery may overlap each other resulting in longer hospital stay. Cranial nerve paresis may not resolve completely and some neural deficits become persistent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Whilst stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is common and associated with poor outcomes, less is known about the determinants of these adverse clinical outcomes in SAP. To identify the factors that influence mortality and morbidity in SAP. Data for patients with SAP ( n = 854) were extracted from a regional Hospital Stroke Register in Norfolk, UK (2003–2015). SAP was defined as pneumonia occurring within 7 days of admission by the treating clinicians. Mutlivariable regression models were constructed to assess factors influencing survival and the level of disability at discharge using modified Rankin Scale [mRS]. Mean (SD) age was 83.0 (8.7) years and ischaemic stroke occurred in 727 (85.0%). Mortality was 19.0% at 30 days and 44.0% at 6 months. Stroke severity assessment using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was not recorded in the data set although Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project was Classification. In the multivariable analyses, 30-day mortality was independently associated with age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07, p = 0.01), haemorrhagic stroke (2.27, 1.07–4.78, p = 0.03) and pre-stroke disability (mRS 4–5 v 0–1: 6.45, 3.12–13.35, p &lt; 0.001). 6-month mortality was independently associated with age (&lt; 0.001), pre-stroke disability ( p &lt; 0.001) and certain comorbidities, including the following: dementia (6.53, 4.73–9.03, p &lt; 0.001), lung cancer (2.07, 1.14–3.77, p = 0.017) and previous transient ischemic attack (1.94, 1.12–3.36, p = 0.019). Disability defined by mRS at discharge was independently associated with age (1.10, 1.05–1.16, p &lt; 0.001) and plasma C-reactive protein (1.02, 1.01–1.03, p = 0.012). We have identified non-modifiable determinants of poor prognosis in patients with SAP. Further studies are required to identify modifiable factors which may guide areas for intervention to improve the prognosis in SAP in these patients.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and was initially considered to cause serious damage to the respiratory system. Over time, it has been found to affect other organs due to its ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor (type 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme), which can be found in various tissues, including the central nervous system. In addition, a large formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for various lesions was observed during the evolution of this disease. Our objective was to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms involved in the infection that may demonstrate the relationship between COVID-19 and the development of depressive conditions. Based on the main medical databases (LiLacs, SciELO, Bireme, Scopus, EBSCO, and PubMed) and using the terms 'coronavirus infections' AND 'Inflammation' AND 'depression' AND 'cytokines', we conducted an integrative review of articles published in 2020. Considering this stage of Covid-19 and the inflammatory component of depression, this review showed a relationship between these two conditions based on common pathophysiological mechanisms indicating possible depressive disorders in surviving patients, especially in the most severe cases. The role of inflammatory cytokines and the presence of ACE-2 receptors on the cell surface appear to be the common pathophysiological mechanism between COVID-19 and depression.",

This study aims to systematically review the existing literature to determine whether migraine patients are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We included original empirical studies investigating the microbiome in migraine patients. Data extracted included study design, participant demographics, microbiome differences at various taxonomic levels, and measures of microbial diversity (alpha and beta diversity). The search and selection process involved four independent reviewers who assessed abstracts and full texts to ensure eligibility. The gut microbiota was evaluated using relative abundance and diversity indices. Six studies, encompassing various regions including China, Korea, and Italy, were included in the analysis. The results indicated significant differences in gut microbiota between migraine patients and controls. Key findings include a reduction in Faecalibacterium, a genus known for its anti-inflammatory properties, in migraine patients, including those with chronic migraine. Conversely, Veillonella exhibited elevated abundance compared to controls. Other taxa, such as Prevotella and Parabacteroides, showed variable associations with migraine across different studies, suggesting a dysbiotic gut environment in migraine patients. This review highlights that migraines are associated with specific alterations in gut microbiota, including decreased microbial diversity and changes in the abundance of key taxa. These findings suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a role in migraine pathophysiology. Further research is needed to explore the potential causal relationships and therapeutic implications, particularly targeting the microbiome in migraine management.",

The aim of our study was to verify the occurrence of SC in WD. From January 2010 to May 2015, 81 consecutive, newly diagnosed WD patients underwent detailed ophthalmological examinations, including slit lamp examination with special attention to lens transparency, to verify the presence of SC in WD-naive patients. SC was detected in only one (1.2 %) of the examined WD patients, did not impact visual acuity; moreover, completely disappeared following a year of treatment for WD. SC may be a very rare and reversible ophthalmological manifestation of WD that is observed seldom and only at the time of WD diagnosis. We postulate that a finding of SC in WD patients is an interesting finding that may occur in the course of WD, but it is not a pathognomonic sign of WD.",

As new drugs have become available, others have been withdrawn, new indications have been approved and recommendations for pregnant women have changed, a new update was pertinent. A group of Belgian epilepsy experts (partly overlapping with the group in charge of the 2008/2012 recommendations) evaluated the most recent international guidelines and relevant literature for their applicability to the Belgian situation (registration status, reimbursement, clinical practice) and updated the recommendations for initial monotherapy in adults and children and add-on treatment in adults. Recommendations for add-on treatment in children were also included (not covered in the 2008/2012 publications). Like the 2008/2012 publications, the current update also covers other important aspects related to the management of epilepsy, including the importance of early referral in drug-resistant epilepsy, pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability of AEDs, comorbidities, specific considerations in elderly and pregnant patients, generic substitution and the rapidly evolving field of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "During the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the whole world faced an unusual health emergency. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as Epilepsy, is being neglected. In this survey, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of people with Epilepsy (PwE) and to identify their risk factors for seizure worsening to direct better future medical care. We administered a web-based survey (submitted on August 5, 2020). It included socio-demographic, Epilepsy-related, and psychometric data (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items(DASS21) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. We collected responses from an online survey of PwE during the pandemic. Out of 151 responders, 71 patients complained of issues related to Epilepsy management and all of whom reached the treating physician and solved their problems. Sleep quality was compromised in 84 patients (55.6%). Two-thirds of the patients in our cohort (66.2%) reported depression, 72.2% reported anxiety, and 75.5% reported stress. Eight patients (5.3%) got COVID-19 infection, and only one patient suffered from mild worsening of the seizure. The main concerns were shortage of medications for 46 (30.5%) patients, getting Coronavirus infection for 67 (44.4%) patients, and seizure worsening for 32 (21.3%) patients. Thirty-five patients (23.2%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by retirement or jobless state, having moderate or severe stress, poor sleep quality, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), fear of getting COVID-19 infection, fear of worsening of seizures, or shortage of medication. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced worsening of their seizures. This unusual, challenging experience clarifies the urgent need to establish telemedicine services and home-based management of Epilepsy, including ambulatory EEG, home video, and medication delivery to patients' homes to provide continuous medical care.",

    "abstract": "In Wilson's disease (WD), early neurological deterioration after treatment initiation is associated with poor outcomes; however, data on this phenomenon are limited. Our study analysed the frequency and risk factors of early neurological deterioration in WD.Early neurological deterioration, within 6 months from diagnosis, was defined based on the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): any increase in part II or an increase of ≥ 4 in part III. In total, 61 newly diagnosed WD patients were included. UWDRS scores, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores, copper metabolism parameters, treatment type and serum neuro-filament light chain (sNfL) concentrations at diagnosis were analysed as potential risk factors of early deterioration.Early neurological deterioration was observed in 16.3% of all WD patients; all cases of worsening occurred in the neurological phenotype (27.7%). Higher scores were seen in those who deteriorated compared with those who did not for UWDRS part II (4.3 ± 5.0 vs 2.0 ± 5.9; p < 0.05), UWDRS part III (21.5 ± 14.1 vs 9.3 ± 16.4; p < 0.01) and MRI-assessed chronic damage (3.2 ± 1.6 vs 1.4 ± 2.2; p = 0.006); all these variables indicated the initial severity of neurological disease. Pre-treatment sNfL concentrations were significantly higher in patients who deteriorated compared with those who did not (33.2 ± 23.5 vs 27.6 ± 62.7 pg/mL; p < 0.01). In univariate logistic regression amongst all patients, chronic damage MRI scores, UWDRS part III scores and sNfL concentrations predicated early deterioration. In the neurological WD, only sNFL were a significant predictor. In bivariate logistic regression amongst all patients, sNfL remained the only significant predictor of deterioration when corrected for MRI scores.sNfL concentrations are a promising biomarker of the risk of early neurological deterioration in WD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Wilson’s disease (WD) is a potentially treatable, genetic disorder of copper metabolism, with survival similar to healthy populations if controlled. However, in almost 50% of WD patients, neurological symptoms persist despite treatment, and in up to 10% of patients, neurological deterioration is irreversible. International guidelines on WD treatment do not recommend liver transplantation (LT) as a treatment for neurological symptoms in WD. However, such treatment has been assessed in retrospective analyses, case and series reports. We aimed to systematically assess all available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of LT in WD patients with neurological presentation. Methods This systematic literature review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were identified by searching the PubMed database (up to 6 April 2021) and by screening reference lists. Results Based on the systematic literature review, 48 articles were identified, showing outcomes of LT in 302 WD patients with neurological symptoms. Of these patients, major improvement was found in 215 cases (71.2%), with no difference in neurological status before and after LT in 21 cases (6.9%). There were 29 deaths (9.6%), neurological worsening in 24 cases (7.9%), and 13 cases (4.3%) were lost to follow-up. Conclusions The results suggest that LT is a promising method of WD management in patients with severe, neurological symptoms, particularly if the patient has not responded to pharmacological de-coppering treatment. Further studies of LT in these patients are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY) is a low-grade epilepsy-associated tumor recently introduced in WHO 2021 classification. Since it has been recognized as an independent nosological entity, PLNTY has been mainly studied from a genetic and molecular perspective, not recognizing unique characteristic clinical and radiological features.A systematic literature research has been conducted aiming to identify all relevant studies about the radiological, clinical and surgical features of PLNTY. We described a representative case of a 45-year-old man treated with awake-surgery with confirmed diagnosis of PLNTY, reporting the radiological and surgical characteristics through imaging and intra-operative video. We performed a statistical meta-analysis attempting to assess the presence of relationships between surgical and radiologic tumor characteristics and clinical outcome and type of surgery.A total of 16 studies were included in the systematic review. The final cohort was composed of 51 patients. Extent of resection (EOR) and outcome are not significantly associated with the different genetic profiling (p = 1), the presence of cystic intralesional component, calcification (p = 0.85), contrast-enhancing and lesion boundaries (p = 0.82). No significant correlation there is between EOR and remission or better control of epilepsy-related symptoms (p = 0.38). The contrast enhancement in the tumor is significantly associated with recurrence or poor control of epileptic symptoms (p = 0.07).In PLNTYs, contrast enhancement seems to impact prognosis, recurrence, and seizure control much more than radiological features, genetic features and type of resection of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Dysfunction of the neuronal clearance pathway promotes the accumulation of Aβ. The plasminogen-activating system (PAS) is controlled by various enzymes like tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). Neuronal tPA enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves Aβ; this function is controlled by many inhibitors of PAS, including a plasminogen-activating inhibitor (PAI-1) and neuroserpin. Therefore, the objective of the present narrative review was to explore the potential role of tPA/neuroserpin in the pathogenesis of AD. PAI-1 activity is increased in AD, which is involved in accumulating Aβ. Progressive increase of Aβ level during AD neuropathology is correlated with the over-production of PAI-1 with subsequent reduction of plasmin and tPA activities. Reducing plasmin and tPA activities promote Aβ by reducing Aβ clearance. Neuroserpin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD as it regulates the expression and accumulation of Aβ. Higher expression of neuroserpin inhibits the neuroprotective tPA and the generation of plasmin with subsequent reduction in the clearance of Aβ. These observations raise conflicting evidence on whether neuroserpin is neuroprotective or involved in AD progression. Thus, neuroserpin over-expression with subsequent reduction of tPA may propagate AD neuropathology.",

We conducted a systematic review to assess the prognostic factors associated with falls in PD, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant demographic and clinical parameters, and aid neurologists in identifying subsets of PD patients most susceptible to falls and associated injuries. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective studies assessing factors associated with falls in ambulatory PD patients across different settings, from inception to August 2023. Data extraction was conducted using CHARMS-PF checklist and risk of bias was assessed with QUIPS tool. PRISMA guidelines were followed. The initial search yielded 155 references. Thirty-four studies, involving a total of 3454 PD patients, were included in the final analysis. The mean pooled age was 67.6 years, and 45.1% were women. PD patients presented mild motor impairment (UPDRS III score 27.8) with mean pooled disease duration of 5.7 years. Gait and balance disorders and history of prior falls emerged as the most consistent predictors of falls across studies. Disease duration, disease severity, dysautonomic symptoms, freezing of gait, frontal cognitive functions, and PD medication dosages yielded inconsistent findings. Conversely, dyskinesias, age, sex, and depression were unrelated to future falls in PD. Logistic regression models were most commonly employed to identify factors significantly associated with falls in PD. Substantial heterogeneity prevailed in the inclusion of confounding factors. The evidence suggests that previous history of falls, gait disorders, and poor balance are robust prognostic markers for falls in PD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated disease affecting the central nervous system. Natalizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for MS, has been explored for its off-label extended interval dosing (EID), suggesting a potential reduction in the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) compared to standard interval dosing (SID). Our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of EID in comparison to SID for natalizumab treatment in patients with MS. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, WOS, Scopus, Ovid, Science Direct, Clinical trials.gov, and Cochrane Library. Our assessed outcomes were clinical relapses, MRI activity, change in expanded disability status scale [EDSS], and the risk of PML. The EID group was defined as 5 to 8 weeks [EID (Q5-8W)]. The analysis was conducted using RevMan ver. 5.4. The effect estimates were presented as a risk ratio [RR] or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals [CI] using SID group as the reference for comparisons. Results Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria: 2 RCTs, 1 switched single-arm trial, and 12 observational studies. No significant differences were found in all efficacy outcomes of interest. Risk of clinical relapses [RR = 0.90, (95%CI 0.80, 1.02)], risk of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense MRI lesions [RR = 0.78, (95%CI 0.59, 1.04)], risk gadolinium enhancing lesions [RR = 1.30, (95%CI 0.98, 1.72)], change in EDSS [MD = 0.09 (95%CI − 0.57, 0.76)], risk of PML [RR = 1.09, 95%CI (0.24, 4.94)]. Conclusion In summary, our meta-analysis indicates that natalizumab maintains its effectiveness under extended interval dosing [up to 8 weeks], presenting comparable risks for clinical relapses, MRI lesions, EDSS, and PML. Caution is advised given study limitations and heterogeneity. Robust conclusions necessitate well-designed high-quality prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study is to determine the clinical predictors and the differential diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms and risk factors for PRES. Using the diagnostic algorithm for PRES from Fugate and Rabinstein (Lancet Neurol 14(9):914–925, 1), we carried out a retrospective study on 220 patients, presenting with acute neurological symptoms such as seizures, encephalopathy, headache, visual disturbances or other focal neurological signs that appear in the clinical setting of risk factors such as hypertension/blood pressure fluctuations, chemotherapy, renal failure, autoimmune disorders, or eclampsia, in whom imaging of the brain was performed to exclude PRES. Seventeen percent of patients had a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of PRES. Univariable logistic regression showed a significant association between PRES and epileptic seizures, encephalopathy, hypertension, chemotherapy and renal failure. Multivariable logistic regression of acute neurological symptoms and risk factors showed a significant association of epileptic seizures, encephalopathy, visual disturbances, hypertension and chemotherapy with PRES. Using these variables to predict PRES yielded a discriminative ability (AUC) equal to 0.793. Diagnoses when PRES was not confirmed included primary or secondary headaches (26%), toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (21%), vascular pathology (12%) and other less frequent disorders. Epileptic seizures, encephalopathy, visual disturbances, hypertension, renal failure and chemotherapy were the best clinical predictors of PRES, while headache, immune suppression and autoimmune disease were not useful for the clinical diagnosis of PRES in our study.",

The 5-year incidence of thyroid adverse events in phase 3 clinical trials is up to 40.7%. In most cases, the thyroid dysfunction is mild and easily manageable and only few serious thyroid adverse events have been reported. The need for patient education on the risk of thyroid dysfunction, as well as regular clinical and biochemical thyroid function screening is well described. However, practical clinical guidance in case of abnormal thyroid-related findings prior to or after alemtuzumab treatment is currently lacking. Therefore, a Belgian taskforce consisting of MS and thyroid experts was created in 2016, with the objective of issuing a clinical thyroid management algorithm based on available scientific evidence and personal experience with regard to alemtuzumab treatment-related thyroid adverse events.",

    "abstract": "India is considered the diabetes capital of the world and has the highest burden of mucormycosis. Bacterial, viral and fungal co-infections are increasingly being reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infected patients. India is one of the worst affected countries during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This combination of diabetes mellitus, COVID-19 and mucormycosis has led to the drastic upsurge of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) in India. Immunosuppression, iron disequilibrium, endothelial injury, ketoacidosis and hypoxia are some of the other COVID-19-related risk factors for CAM. There has been an increase in the proportion of mucormycosis affecting paranasal sinuses and central nervous system (CNS) in CAM compared to pre-COVID-19 literature due to the SARSCoV-2-related pathophysiological mechanisms, complications and treatment strategies. CAM is a medical and surgical emergency, and it can present with non-specific symptoms and signs initially resulting in diagnostic delay. High index of suspicion and regular screening for features of CAM are of paramount importance to prevent lethal consequences. Rapid action with a tripod approach consisting of withdrawal of immunomodulators, early antifungal therapy and extensive surgical debridement is considered the best possible treatment model. We review the published data to give a detailed account of the predisposing factors and their mechanisms, diagnostic work-up, treatment modalities and prevention strategies of CAM with special emphasis on CNS mucormycosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To emphasize physio-pathological, clinical and prognosis differences between conditions causing serious and sometimes very similar clinical manifestations: anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies related diseases, and seronegative NMOSD (neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders). Methods Based on Wingerchuk et al. (Neurology 85:177–189, 2015) criteria for NMOSD and on those more recently proposed by Jarius et al. (J Neuroinflammation 15:134, 2018) for MOGAD (MOG associated disorders), we retrospectively surveyed 10 AQP4-NMOSD, 8 MOGAD and 2 seronegative NMOSD, followed at the specialized neuroimmunology unit of the CHU Liège. Results Female predominance was only observed in AQP4 group. Age at onset was 37.8 and 27.7 years old for AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD respectively. In both groups, the first clinical event most often consisted of optic neuritis (ON), followed by isolated myelitis. Fifteen of our 20 patients encountered a relapsing course with 90% relapses in AQP4-NMOSD, 62.5% in MOGAD and 50% in seronegative group, and a mean period between first and second clinical event of 7.1 and 4.8 months for AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD, respectively. In total we counted 54 ON, with more ON per patient in MOGAD. MOG-associated ON mainly affected the anterior part of the optic nerve with a papilledema in 79.2% of cases. Despite a fairly good visual outcome after MOG-associated ON, retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness decreased, suggesting a fragility of the optic nerve toward further attacks. Conclusion As observed in larger cohorts, our MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD cases differ by clinical and prognostic features. A better understanding of these diseases should encourage prompt biological screening and hasten proper diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To review clinical characteristics, auxiliary examination results, treatment effects, and outcomes of patients with autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy (GFAP-A). Methods We collated and retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 15 patients admitted with clinical characteristics of an autoimmune GFAP-A acute encephalitis or meningitis phenotype. Results All patients were diagnosed with acute-onset meningoencephalitis and meningoencephalomyelitis. Initial presentations included pyrexia and headache at onset; dual symptoms of prominent tremor with urinary and bowel dysfunction; ataxia, psychiatric and behavioral abnormalities, and impaired consciousness; neck resistance; reduced extremity muscle strength; blurred vision; epileptic seizures; and reduced basic blood pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed that the degree of protein elevation was significantly higher than the degree of increase in white blood cells. Moreover, in the absence of obvious low chloride and glucose levels, CSF chloride levels decreased in 13 patients, accompanied by a CSF glucose level decrease in four. Brain abnormalities were found in magnetic resonance imaging of ten patients, with a linear radial perivascular enhancement present in the lateral ventricles of two patients and symmetric abnormalities in the splenium of the corpus callosum in three patients. Conclusions Autoimmune GFAP-A may be a spectrum disorder, with acute- or subacute-onset meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis being the main phenotypes. When used for acute stage treatment, combined hormone and immunoglobulin therapy was superior to hormone pulse therapy or immunoglobulin pulse therapy alone. However, hormone pulse therapy alone without immunoglobulin pulse therapy was associated with a greater number of remaining neurological deficits.",

    "abstract": "Contrast-induced neurotoxicity (CIN) is an increasingly recognised complication following endovascular procedures utilising contrast. It remains poorly understood with heterogenous clinical management strategies. The aim of this review was to identify commonly employed treatments for CIN to enhance clinical decision making. A systematic search of Embase (1947-2022) and Medline (1946-2022) was conducted. Articles describing (i) patients with a clinical diagnosis of CIN, (ii) with radiological exclusion of other pathologies, (iii) detailed report of treatments, and (iv) discharge outcomes, were included. Data relating to demographics, procedure, symptoms, treatment and outcomes were extracted. A total of 73 patients were included, with a median age of 64 years. The most common procedures were cerebral angiography (42.5%) and coronary angiography (42.5%), and the median volume of contrast administered was 150 ml. The most common symptoms were cortical blindness (38.4%) and reduced consciousness (28.8%), and 84.9% of patients experienced complete resolution at the time of discharge. Management included intravenous fluids to dilute contrast in the cerebrovasculature (54.8%), corticosteroids to reduce blood-brain barrier damage (47.9%), antiseizure (16.4%) and sedative (16.4%) medications. Mannitol (13.7%) was also utilised to reduce cerebral oedema. Intensive care admission was required for 19.2% of patients. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment and discharge outcomes. The clinical management of CIN should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis, but may consist of aggressive fluid therapy alongside corticosteroids, as well as other supportive therapy as required. Further examination of CIN management is required to define best practice.",

Prior studies have shown that olfaction deteriorates with disease progression, however fluctuations in olfaction and related PD symptoms have been less explored. This study aimed to investigate correlations between changes in odor identification ability and PD symptoms. PD patients recruited from Taichung Veterans General Hospital underwent at least two consecutive Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) evaluations. The patients were grouped based on changes in olfactory identification ability between evaluations, and fluctuations in PD symptoms were compared between groups. Ninety-seven PD patients with 114 complete sets of data were analyzed. Significant divergent results were observed between changes in five MDS-UPDRS non-motor subscores and the conversion status of five pleasant odors, including anxiety vs. bubble gum, apathy vs. banana, dizziness vs. coconut, urination vs. root beer, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) vs. grape. Fluctuations in the ability to detect pleasant odors, may have a complex interaction with other non-motor symptoms, including in the neurobehavioral and autonomic domains. Serial monitoring of olfactory function, particularly with pleasant odors, may provide valuable insights for tracking non-motor symptoms in PD and warrants further investigation into their therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health issue with high mortality and disability rates. Current diagnostic tools lack sensitivity and specificity, under-scoring the need for novel biomarkers. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 as biomarkers for assessing TBI severity and prognosis. Methods A prospective cohort of 89 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI was studied. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected for four consecutive days post-injury. Levels of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent as-say (ELISA). Statistical analyses, including ROC curve analysis, were conducted to assess their predictive performance. Results NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 levels in both serum and CSF were significantly elevated in TBI patients, with higher levels correlating with greater injury severity. ROC analysis revealed that CSF biomarkers, particularly NLRP3, demonstrated superior predictive value. CSF NLRP3 levels on days 1, 2, and 4 had AUC values of 0.9871, 0.9466, and 0.8967, respectively. Dynamic changes in these biomarkers over time provided insights into disease progression and prognosis. Serum markers, while less predictive than CSF, were also effective for assessing injury severity. Conclusions NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 are promising biomarkers for evaluating TBI severity and predicting outcomes. Their dynamic monitoring may improve clinical management and in-form therapeutic strategies. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore interventions targeting these inflammatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, several defects in self-tolerance have been identified in multiple sclerosis. Dysfunction in central tolerance leads to the thymic output of antigen-specific T cells with T cell receptor alterations favouring autoimmune reactions. In addition, premature thymic involution results in a reduced export of naïve regulatory T cells, the fully suppressive clone. Alterations in peripheral tolerance concern costimulatory molecules as well as transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Recent data underline the key role of regulatory T cells that suppress Th1 and Th17 effector cell responses and whose immunosuppressive activity is impaired in patients with multiple sclerosis. Those recent observations suggest that a defect in self-tolerance homeostasis might be the primary mover of multiple sclerosis leading to subsequent immune attacks, inflammation and neurodegeneration. The concept of multiple sclerosis as a consequence of the failure of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms to maintain a self-tolerance state, particularly of regulatory T cells, may have therapeutic implications. Restoring normal thymic output and suppressive functions of regulatory T cells appears an appealing approach. Regulatory T cells suppress the general local immune response via bystander effects rather than through individual antigen-specific responses. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of currently approved immunomodulators (interferons β and glatiramer acetate) are associated with a restored regulatory T cell homeostasis. However, the feedback regulation between Th1 and Th17 effector cells and regulatory T cells is not so simple and tolerogenic mechanisms also involve other regulatory cells such as B cells, dendritic cells and CD56bright natural killer cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spinal adhesive arachnoiditis is a rare pathology involving pia mater of the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can potentially lead to disability—many patients end up wheelchair-bound due to subsequent paraparesis. It is an infrequent but possible cause of lower extremities weakness in patients with a history of spinal surgery, epidural anaesthesia, myelography or spinal tumors. Three patients, one male and two females, admitted to our unit due to paraparesis presented at least one of the above mentioned risk factors. Each of them had a severe course of illness—progressive paresis of lower extremities. All above cases were diagnosed with spinal adhesive arachnoiditis confirmed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan—the most sensitive and specific diagnostic tool. Despite conservative treatment and intensive rehabilitation none of the presented patients preserved the ability to mobilise independently. Considering spinal adhesive arachnoiditis in patients with paraparesis and history of typical risk factors should be included in clinical diagnostic procedure.",

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder that leads to pathological copper accumulation in different organs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed as a marker of neurodegeneration in many neurological diseases. Thinning of the total retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness (Mth) examined by OCT was detected in patients with WD, especially those with brain magnetic resonance imaging changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OCT parameters and the progression of neurological signs measured by the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) in patients with WD. Consecutive patients with WD admitted to the Department of Neurology underwent OCT to assess the thickness of the macula and total RNFL. Patients also had neurologic assessments according to the UWDRS part III. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (UWDRS+) and absence (UWDRS-) of neurological symptoms. Fifty-eight patients (34 females, 24 males) were enrolled. Mean duration of treatment was 9 years (standard deviation [SD], ±10.8). The mean UWDRS score at the time of study was 8.4 (range 1-52; SD ±13.9) points. Total RNFL as well as macula thickness were significantly decreased in the UWDRS+ group versus the UWDRS- group. A significant negative correlation was found between OCT parameters (RNFL and Mth measurements) and neurological impairment according the UWDRS scale. This study confirms that OCT may be a useful tool for measuring the degree of neurodegeneration in patients with WD, and may play role in monitoring disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and objectives Research suggests that diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is related to high serum uric acid (SUA) level, although its correlation with low SUA level has not been reported. Here, diabetic patients with hyperuricemia were excluded, and the correlation between low SUA level and DPN was explored. Subjects and methods This prospective observational clinical study enrolled 525 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without hyperuricemia, who were divided into the diabetes with symptomatic neuropathy (150 cases), diabetes with asymptomatic neuropathy (125 cases) and diabetes with no neuropathy (250 cases) groups. Results The SUA slightly decreased in subjects with asymptomatic DPN compared with those with no neuropathy and greatly decreased in subjects with symptomatic DPN compared with those without ( P &lt; 0.001). The association of the SUA with diabetic neuropathy was independent of the hyperglycemic state and other potential confounders (odds ratio 0.985 [0.981–0.988], P &lt; 0.001). The SUA was closely correlated with the means of motor/sensory nerve amplitude and CV (all P &lt; 0.001). The optimal cut-off point for SUA to distinguish patients with diabetic neuropathy from those without was 324 umol/L, with a sensitivity of 76.0% and a specificity of 79.2% (AUC = 0.806). Conclusions The low SUA level is closely associated with DPN. Future studies are warranted to clarify the relationship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Several neurologic complications have been reported in close temporal association with both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, several cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) have been reported in temporal relationship with COVID-19 vaccination, with two small case series describing a specific phenotype with bifacial weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. Methods We retrospectively collected patients who developed a new-onset neuromuscular disorder in the first 6 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (either first or second dose). The patients were collected from one tertiary care centre and one secondary care centre from February to July 2021. Results We report eight patients who developed phenotypically diverse neuromuscular disorders in the weeks following COVID-19 vaccination, with a presumed immune-mediated etiology. In our case series, we report three patients with classical GBS, one patient with bifacial weakness with paresthesia variant of GBS, two patients with subacute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), one patient with brachial plexopathy and one patient with subacute axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Conclusions New-onset neuromuscular disorders with onset in the weeks after COVID-19 vaccination can include diverse phenotypes. A causal relationship between these disorders and the vaccine cannot be proven at present, and further epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate this association.",

Six Belgian neuromuscular reference centers participated, covering all patisiran-treated hATTR amyloidosis patients at the study time. This study was conducted to collect data requested in the context of the reimbursement of patisiran in Belgium.Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, Coutinho stage 1 or 2, and eligible for active treatment during the data collection period. Of the hATTR amyloidosis patients treated with patisiran (n = 12), seven and five had polyneuropathy stages 1 and 2, respectively. Six patients had cardiac symptoms (New York Heart Association class 2 or above). Follow-up information was available for nine patients. Following patisiran treatment, eight patients showed stable or improved assessments for most neurological or cardiological parameters. Only one patient presented with worsening statuses at the end of the data collection period.The patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Belgium have similar baseline demographics and disease characteristics to those studied in the patisiran APOLLO study and show a similar therapeutic response in the real-world, altering the expected disease progression in most patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Effective rehabilitation of peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) requires reliable assessment tools. This systematic review aimed to identify and validate instruments used in PFP rehabilitation, categorizing them according to the ICF framework. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Cinahl, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2024. Observational analytical studies and one non-randomized controlled trial that validated tools for assessing PFP were included. Results Thirty-three studies were included, covering twenty different tools. Seventeen tools were related to the \"Structure and Function\" domain, while three addressed \"Activity and Participation.\" The Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann scales were the most extensively studied. The Sunnybrook scale exhibited excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility and internal validity, making it suitable for clinical use. The House-Brackmann scale was user-friendly but had limitations in reproducibility and sensitivity to subtle differences, which newer versions like the FNGS 2.0 aimed to address. The FAME scale showed promise by reducing subjective scoring. Computerized tools, such as eFACE and A-FPG, and instruments for lip asymmetry and ocular involvement demonstrated potential but require further validation. The Facial Disability Index and the FaCE Scale were validated for assessing disability and participation restrictions. Conclusion This review identified several validated tools for PFP assessment, with the Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann scales being the most reliable. While emerging tools and computerized programs show promise, they need further validation for routine clinical use. Integrating validated tools into clinical practice is essential for comprehensive assessment and effective rehabilitation of PFP.",

    "abstract": "The Belgian Neuromuscular Disease Registry, commissioned in 2008, aims to collect data to improve knowledge on neuromuscular diseases and enhance quality health services for neuromuscular disease patients. This paper presents a clear outline of the strategy to launch a global national registry. All patients diagnosed with one of the predefined 62 neuromuscular disease groups and living in Belgium may be included in the yearly updated Registry. Basic core data is harvested through a newly designed web application by the six accredited neuromuscular reference centres. In 2010, 3,424 patients with a neuromuscular disorder were registered. The most prevalent disease group in the Registry is Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy, as similarly stated by other studies, albeit the prevalence in Belgium is five times lower: 6.5 per 100,000 in the north of Belgium, versus 17.0-41.0 per 100,000 in other areas of Europe. Very few patients were captured in the south of the country. With the aim to collect valuable epidemiological data, the registry targets to gather high quality data, that the sample to be representative of the population and that it be complete. The past 5 years of building the registry have improved its quality, albeit the consistent gap in data from the south of the country prevails, influencing the estimated prevalence of these diseases. To this day, the true burden of neuromuscular diseases in Belgium is not known but actions have been undertaken to address these issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral ischemia. TIA is a critical early warning signal of stroke. Patients with TIA may have long-term cognitive decline. The pathogenesis and pathological changes of TIA have not been fully elucidated. Animal models can simulate the process of human diseases and are essential tools to investigate injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches of TIA. Most TIA animal models are based on ischemic stroke models and the definition of TIA. Each model has unique strengths and weaknesses. The establishment of a successful and reliable TIA model should follow three criteria: (1) objective evidence of cerebral arteries occlusion and reperfusion, (2) no permanent neurological deficit, and (3) no acute cerebral infarction. However, experimental animal models are impossible to be completely consistent with human TIA, because TIA itself is a heterogeneous disease. In the present review, the selection of animals, methodological development, and evaluation of cerebral blood flow of animal models of TIA are comprehensively evaluated.",

Coronavirus belongs to a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), that have caused human epidemics with high fatality. The spectrum of the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-Co-2 or COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic infections to fatal pneumonia, and differs from other viral pulmonary infections. MERS-CoV is known to be potentially neuroinvasive. Extensive reports from China documented central and peripheral nervous system involvement in patients with COVID-19, and identified in angiotensin converting enzyme2 (ACE2), which is present in multiple human organs, the functional receptor for this virus. Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) has recently been associated to COVID-19 rising concern among physicians. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on GBS during or after COVID-19 infection, attempting to clarify the pathophysiology of the associated respiratory dysfunction and failure.",

    "abstract": "Standard treatment of Parkinson's disease involves the dopaminergic medications. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an important neurosurgical intervention often used as alternative treatment to drug therapy; however, it can be associated with increase of impulsive behaviors. This descriptive review focused on studies investigating the correlation between Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and impulsivity in Parkinson's disease patients, arguing, the action's mechanism and the specific role of the subthalamic nucleus. We searched on PubMed and Web of Science databases and screening references of included studies and review articles for additional citations. From initial 106 studies, only 15 met the search criteria. Parkinson's Disease patients with and without Deep Brain Stimulation were compared with healthy controls, through 16 different tasks that assessed some aspects of impulsivity. Both Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and medication were associated with impulsive behavior and influenced decision-making processes. Moreover, findings demonstrated that: Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) occurred soon after surgery, while, in pharmacological treatment, they appeared mainly after the initiation of treatment or the increase in dosage, especially with dopamine agonists. The subthalamic nucleus plays a part in the fronto-striato-thalamic-cortical loops mediating motor, cognitive, and emotional functions: this could explain the role of the Deep Brain Stimulation in behavior modulation in Parkinson's Disease patients. Indeed, increase impulsivity has been reported also after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus independently by dopaminergic medication status.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak precipitated prolonged lock-down measures. The subsequent social distancing, isolation, and reduction in mobility increased psychological stress, which may worsen Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, telemedicine has been proposed to provide care to PD patients. To evaluate the effects of lock-down on motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the feasibility of telemedicine. Motor and nonmotor aspects were longitudinally assessed using structured questionnaires at baseline (in-person, February 2020) and at follow-up (remote web-based video, lock-down) evaluation. Of the seventeen PD patients evaluated at baseline, fourteen agreed to participate in, and completed follow-up evaluations. There was an impairment of nonmotor aspects measured with the MDS-UPDRS part I (p < 0.001) during lock-down. Nine patients participated independently in the telemedicine evaluation while five needed help from relatives. Our preliminary findings suggest an impairment of nonmotor symptoms in PD patients and support the feasibility and need for telemedicine in monitoring PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, to guarantee optimal assistance with reducing the burden of infection. Our findings also suggest that movement disorder clinics should be carefully considering socio-demographics and clinical features when developing telemedicine programs.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the clinical characteristics, the neuroimaging features and associated anomalies observed in children affected by Dandy-Walker malformations (DWM) and variants (DWV) in a single tertiary hospital in Catania and compare our data to their existent in the literature. A retrospective case series using the medical records has been performed on 28 children diagnosed with DWM and DWV admitted to a single tertiary section of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Catania, Italy from January 2005 to January 2021. We reviewed the neuroimaging using the new diagnostic criteria of Klein et al. RESULTS: Associated anomalies were frequently reported. Among these, hydrocephalus was found in 13/28 (48%), and hydrocephalus plus corpus callosum anomalies in three children (10%). We described corpus callosum, cardiac and genitourinary anomalies in 2/28 (7%), 3/28 (10%), and 3/28 (10%), respectively. The most common clinical features were the developmental delay and epilepsy observed in 19/28 (67%) and in 9/28 (32%) of the cases. The first exam at the diagnosis was MRI in 17/28 patients, followed by transfontanellar ultrasound in 5/28, computed tomography in 4/28 and prenatal ultrasound in 2/28. To note, a child with DWM was affected by Down syndrome and one by congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation (CDG-IId). Children with DWV were more commonly observed than children with DWM. Hydrocephalus is an anomaly, frequently and equally reported in both DWM and DMV. Perinatal complications were frequent adverse events with severe respiratory distress and need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cognitive involvement and epilepsy were the most common comorbidities. Single DWV is associated with a better developmental outcome.",

However, the effect of ALI/ARDS in SAH has not been well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of ALI/ARDS in a cohort of patients with SAH and to determine the risk factors for ALI/ARDS and their impact on patient prognosis. We performed a retrospective analysis of 167 consecutive patients with aSAH enrolled. ALI/ARDS patients were rigorously adjudicated using North American-European Consensus Conference definition. Regression analyses were used to test the risk factors for ALI/ARDS in patients with SAH. A total of 167 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 27% patients (45 of 167) developed ALI. Among all 45 ALI patients, 33 (20%, 33 of 167) patients met criteria for ARDS. On multivariate analysis, elderly patients, lower glasgow coma scale (GCS), higher Hunt-Hess grade, higher simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II score, pre-existing pneumonia, gastric aspiration, hypoxemia, and tachypnea were the strongest risk factor for ALI/ARDS. Patients with ALI/ARDS showed worse clinical outcomes measured at 30 days. Development of ALI/ARDS was associated with a statistically significant increasing the odds of tracheostomy and hospital complications, and increasing duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length and hospitalization stay. Development of ALI/ARDS is a severe complication of SAH and is associated with a poor clinical outcome, and further studies should focus on both prevention and management strategies specific to SAH-associated ALI/ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a prevalent type of intracranial hemorrhage. Surgical interventions, such as Twist Drill Craniostomy and Burr Hole Craniostomy, are employed for its treatment. However, limited information exists regarding the impact of postoperative head position (supine vs. elevated) on clinical outcomes. We aim to assess whether patients’ head position after surgery influences their prognosis. Method We conducted a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis. Our search encompassed PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify relevant published studies. Data were meticulously extracted, pooled using a fixed model, and reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using R and Stata MP v.17. Results Five studies involving 284 patients were included in our meta-analysis. We focused on three primary clinical outcomes, comparing the supine and elevated header positions. Notably, there was no statistically significant difference between the supine and elevated positions in terms of recurrence rate (RR 0.77, 95% CI [0.44, 1.37]), second intervention for recurrence (RR 1.07, 95% CI [0.42, 2.78]) and postoperative complications (RR 1.16, 95% CI [0.70, 1.92]). Conclusion Current studies have proved no difference between supine and elevated bed header positions regarding recurrence rate, second intervention for recurrence, and postoperative complications. Future RCTs with long-term follow-ups are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Predicting long-term stroke mortality is a clinically important and unmet need. We aimed to develop and internally validate a 10-year ischaemic stroke mortality prediction score. In this UK cohort study, 10,366 patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke between January 2003 and December 2016 were followed up for a median (interquartile range) of 5.47 (2.96-9.15) years. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to predict 10-year post-admission mortality. The predictors associated with 10-year mortality included age, sex, Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), pre-stroke modified Rankin Score, admission haemoglobin, sodium, white blood cell count and comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cancer, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and peripheral vascular disease). The model was internally validated using bootstrap resampling to assess optimism in discrimination and calibration. A nomogram was created to facilitate application of the score at the point of care. Mean age (SD) was 78.5 ± 10.9 years, 52% female. Most strokes were partial anterior circulation syndromes (38%). 10-year mortality predictors were: total anterior circulation stroke (hazard ratio, 95% confidence intervals) (2.87, 2.62-3.14), eGFR < 15 (1.97, 1.55-2.52), 1-year increment in age (1.04, 1.04-1.05), liver disease (1.50, 1.20-1.87), peripheral vascular disease (1.39, 1.23-1.57), cancers (1.37, 1.27-1.47), heart failure (1.24, 1.15-1.34), 1-point increment in pre-stroke mRS (1.20, 1.17-1.22), atrial fibrillation (1.17, 1.10-1.24), coronary heart disease (1.09, 1.02-1.16), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.13, 1.03-1.25) and hypertension (0.77, 0.72-0.82). Upon internal validation, the optimism-adjusted c-statistic was 0.76 and calibration slope was 0.98. Our 10-year mortality model uses routinely collected point-of-care information. It is the first 10-year mortality score in stroke. While the model was internally validated, further external validation is also warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Post-stroke spasticity (PSS) is the most common complication of stroke but represents only one of the many manifestations of upper motor neuron syndrome. As an upper motor neuron, the corticospinal tract (CST) is the only direct descending motor pathway that innervates the spinal motor neurons and is closely related to the recovery of limb function in patients with PSS. Therefore, promoting axonal remodeling in the CST may help identify new therapeutic strategies for PSS. In this review, we outline the pathological mechanisms of PSS, specifically their relationship with CST, and therapeutic strategies for axonal regeneration of the CST after stroke. We found it to be closely associated with astroglial scarring produced by astrocyte activation and its secretion of neurotrophic factors, mainly after the onset of cerebral ischemia. We hope that this review offers insight into the relationship between CST and PSS and provides a basis for further studies.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to validate an existing health-related quality of life questionnaire for patients with synkinesis in facial palsy for implementation in the Dutch language and culture. The Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire was translated into the Dutch language using a forward–backward translation method. A pilot test with the translated questionnaire was performed in 10 patients with facial palsy and 10 normal subjects. Finally, cross-cultural adaption was accomplished at our outpatient clinic for facial palsy. Analyses for internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and construct validity were performed. Sixty-six patients completed the Dutch Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire and the Dutch Facial Disability Index. Cronbach's α, representing internal consistency, was 0.80. Test–retest reliability was 0.53 (Spearman's correlation coefficient, P < 0.01). Correlations with the House-Brackmann score, Sunnybrook score, Facial Disability Index physical function, and social/well-being function were −0.29, 0.20, −0.29, and −0.32, respectively. Correlation with the Sunnybrook synkinesis subscore was 0.50 (Spearman's correlation coefficient). The Dutch Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire shows good psychometric values and can be implemented in the management of Dutch-speaking patients with facial palsy and synkinesis in the Netherlands. Translation of the instrument into other languages may lead to widespread use, making evaluation, and comparison possible among different providers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are frequently found in migraineurs. However, their clinical significance and correlation to different migraine phenotypes and treatment responses are not well defined. The study aimed to examine the association of WMHs with migraine clinical patterns and treatment response. Aim of work We aimed to evaluate the association between WMHs and migraine phenotypes and explore the relationship of WMHs to treatment response. Methods Our cross-sectional study formed of 500 migraineurs who sought treatment in Kafr el-sheik university hospital and underwent (3 T) MRI to evaluate WMHs. Different migraine phenotypes were compared between patients with and without WMHs. According to reduced headache pain intensity and frequency, these patients were divided into treatment responder and non-responder groups. Results A total of 145 patients (29%) had WMHs. Patients with WMHs were significantly older, had a longer disease duration, and higher attack frequency. Patients who did not respond to acute and maintenance medications had a higher frequency of WMHs and high WMHs Scheltens score. Migraine with Aura and the presence of vomiting and dizziness were predictors for the development of WMHs. Conclusion WMHs are more common in migraine with aura. It is more frequent in migraine associated with vomiting and dizziness. WMHs increased with advancing age and more severe disease burden. Poorer response to acute and prophylactic medications was found in patients with WMHs.",

    "abstract": "[Objective] Few studies have comprehensively investigated the non-motor symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to investigate this aspect of ALS. [Methods] We held a nationwide webinar, titled \"ALS Café,\" and distributed self-report questionnaires to ALS patients. In addition to the frequency of non-motor symptoms such as fatigue, pain, sleep disorders, defecation disorders, sialorrhea, and sexual problems, we evaluated the quality of life (QoL), ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). [Results] The average age of the 33 respondents (19 male, 14 female) was 60.8 ± 11.2; 96.7% of respondents had some non-motor symptoms. The median ALSFRS-R was 32.0, and seven (21.2%) of the respondents had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher. Fatigue was the most common non-motor symptom (81.8%), followed by pain (60.6%), defecation disorders (57.6%), sleep disorders (48.5%), sialorrhea (48.5%), and sexual problems (24.2%). Fatigue was more frequent in females (P = 0.03). Among the non-motor symptoms, pain was the most common factor affecting QoL, followed by fatigue. More than 90% of ALS patients answered that they had never consulted a physician/counselor about sexual problems. Patients with pain had higher PHQ-9 scores than those without (P = 0.01). There was no correlation between the ALSFRS-R score and QoL and PHQ-9. [Conclusions] Most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had non-motor symptoms, and fatigue and pain were the most common. We showed that many non-motor symptoms affected QoL without correlating with ALSFRS-R score. Attention should be paid to those even if the motor symptoms of ALS are mild.",

This is a retrospective review including consecutive patients with typical symptoms of uni-lateral primary TN who underwent PBC from June 2020 to September 2021 in our institution. We excluded secondary aetiologies of TN. Patient demographics, surgical techniques and outcomes were reviewed. All included patients were initially managed with carbamazepine before PBC. A total of 70 patients were included. The mean length of follow-up was 10.6 months. Sixty-nine (98.6%) were successfully treated, and only one patient failed due to particularly narrow foramen ovale. Amongst successfully treated patients, 68 (97.1%) had immediate pain relief, with one having delayed relief. Sixty-eight patients (97.1%) had immediate facial numbness post-operatively and one (1.4%) presented delayed numbness 7 days after surgery. In the last follow-up, regarding facial numbness, 22 (31.9%) patients had complete resolution, whilst 46 (67.6%) had different degrees of benefit. Forty-nine (71.0%) patients developed masseter muscle weakness with recovery at 3-month follow-up. No anaesthesia dolorosa, keratitis, intracranial infection or death occurred in this study. PBC for treatment of TN has quick and effective result, and could be safely performed under general anaesthesia without discomfort to the patient. The common postoperative complications are facial numbness and masseter muscle weakness, with most being improved or recovered at follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Acromegaly is an endocrine disorder due to the excess production of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland after closed epiphyseal growth plates. Acromegaly is mainly caused by benign GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of the most common cardiovascular complications. It ranks second after ischemic heart disease (IHD) as a cause of disability and death in high-income countries globally. Thus, this review aimed to elucidate the possible link between acromegaly and the development of AIS. The local effects of acromegaly in the development of AIS are related to the development of pituitary adenoma and associated surgical and radiotherapies. Pituitary adenoma triggers the development of AIS through different mechanisms, particularly aneurysmal formation, associated thrombosis, and alteration of cerebral microcirculation. Cardiovascular complications and mortality were higher in patients with pituitary adenoma. The systemic effect of acromegaly-induced cardio-metabolic disorders may increase the risk for the development of AIS. Additionally, acromegaly contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction (ED), inflammatory and oxidative stress, and induction of thrombosis that increases the risk for the development of AIS. Moreover, activated signaling pathways, including activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), nod-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in acromegaly may induce systemic inflammation with the development of cardiovascular complications mainly AIS. Taken together, acromegaly triggers the development of AIS through local and systemic effects by inducing the formation of a cerebral vessel aneurysm, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the development of oxidative stress, ED, and thrombosis correspondingly.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) disease often present with perceptual impairments at an early clinical stage. Therefore, early identification and quantification of these impairments could facilitate diagnosis and early intervention. This study aimed to compare proprioceptive and olfactory sensitivities in individuals diagnosed with PD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Proprioception in the forearm and olfactory function were measured in neurotypical older adults, individuals with PD, and individuals with MCI. Position and passive motion senses were assessed using a passive motion apparatus. The traditional Chinese version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT-TC) and the smell threshold test (STT) were used to identify and discriminate smell, respectively. Position sense threshold between the groups differed significantly (p < 0.001), with the PD (p < 0.001) and MCI (p = 0.004) groups showing significantly higher than the control group. The control group had significantly higher mean UPSIT-TC scores than the PD (p < 0.001) and MCI (p = 0.006) groups. The control group had a significantly lower mean STT threshold than the PD and MCI groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). UPSIT-TC scores significantly correlated with disease progression in PD (r = - 0.50, p = 0.008) and MCI (r = 0.44, p = 0.04). Proprioceptive and olfactory sensitivities were reduced in individuals with PD and MCI, and these deficits were related to disease severity. These findings support previous findings indicating that perceptual loss may be a potential biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.",

Selection of compounds was based on the registration and reimbursement status in Belgium, the level of evidence for efficacy, common daily practice and the personal views and experiences of the authors. In November 2011 the validity of these recommendations was reviewed by the same group of Belgian epilepsy experts who contributed to the preparation of the original paper. The recommendations made in 2008 for initial monotherapy in paediatric patients were still considered to be valid, except for the first choice treatment for childhood absence epilepsy. This update therefore focuses on the treatment recommendations for initial monotherapy and add-on treatment in adult patients. Several other relevant aspects of treatment with AEDs are addressed, including considerations for optimal combination of AEDs (rational polytherapy), pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction profile, adverse effects, comorbidity, treatment of elderly patients, AED treatment during pregnancy, and generic substitution of AEDs.",

We reviewed the clinical feature and genetic mutation results and treatment responses of two sibling sisters. They were detected with the PRRT2 gene mutation through Sanger sequencing. Elder sister was treated with oxcarbazepine oral suspension, while younger sister was treated with levetiracetam oral solution. The two sibling sisters exhibited PRRT2 heterozygous mutation inherited from their mother in c.649dupC p.(Arg217fs). Oxcarbazepine oral suspension had an immediate effect on the elder sister who was treated with it. However, levetiracetam oral solution had no effect on younger sister even though the dose was increased, but she got seizure-free after turning to oxcarbazepine oral suspension. Oxcarbazepine, which plays the mechanism of the sodium channel blockers, has a more significant effect than levetiracetam, which has no mechanism of the sodium channel blockers in self-limited familial infantile epilepsy. The PRRT2 gene of infantile epileptic patients with a family history of infantile convulsions or paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia(PKD) could be detected by sanger sequencing and a biomarker to select antiepileptic drugs which play the mechanism of the sodium channel blockers could be utilized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Giant cell arteritis (GCA) may affect the brain-supplying arteries, resulting in ischemic stroke, whereby the vertebrobasilar territory is most often involved. Since etiology is unknown in 25% of stroke patients and GCA is hardly considered as a cause, we examined in a pilot study, whether screening for GCA after vertebrobasilar stroke might unmask an otherwise missed disease. Consecutive patients with vertebrobasilar stroke were prospectively screened for GCA using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and halo sign of the temporal and vertebral artery on ultrasound. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic literature review for relevant studies. Sixty-five patients were included, and two patients (3.1%) were diagnosed with GCA. Patients with GCA were older in age (median 85 versus 69 years, p = 0.02). ESR and CRP were significantly increased and hemoglobin was significantly lower in GCA patients compared to non-GCA patients (median, 75 versus 11 mm in 1 h, p = 0.001; 3.84 versus 0.25 mg/dl, p = 0.01, 10.4 versus 14.6 mg/dl, p = 0.003, respectively). Multiple stenoses/occlusions in the vertebrobasilar territory affected our two GCA patients (100%), but only five (7.9%) non-GCA patients ( p = 0.01). Our literature review identified 13 articles with 136 stroke patients with concomitant GCA. Those were old in age. Headache, increased inflammatory markers, and anemia were frequently reported. Multiple stenoses/occlusions in the vertebrobasilar territory affected around 70% of stroke patients with GCA. Increased inflammatory markers, older age, anemia, and multiple stenoses/occlusions in the vertebrobasilar territory may be regarded as red flags for GCA among patients with vertebrobasilar stroke.",

Methods Fifty- two children of spastic hemiplegic CP aged 5 up to 8 years from both genders were assigned randomly into two groups: core stability and rebound therapy groups. Both groups received 3 sessions/week, 1.5-h training per session, for 12 successive weeks. The measurement was performed at baseline and post-treatment. Balance as a primary outcome for this study was measured by a Biodex Balance System (BBS), and knee extensor strength and functional capacity as secondary outcomes were assessed using a hand-held dynamometer, and a six-minute walk test (6MWT), respectively. Results All variables showed a significant improvement after intervention in each group ( p &lt; 0.0001), with significant improvement in all stability indices (overall, anteroposterior, and mediolateral) in core stability group when compared to rebound therapy group. Conclusion Core stability exercises and rebound therapy are recommended in the rehabilitation of children with hemiplegic CP. Core stability exercises were more effective than rebound therapy for balance improvement. Trial registration number NCT05739396.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of the Slovenian MoCA as a screening tool for MCI and to determine the optimal cut-off point to detect MCI in the elderly population . Methods Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MoCA, and neuropsychological testing assessment were conducted on 93 individuals aged ≥ 60 years. MCI was found in 35 individuals with 58 cognitively asymptomatic controls. Cut-off values, sensitivity, and specificity of MoCA were calculated with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results MCI and healthy individuals did not differ with respect to age and education. Healthy individuals ( M = 24.5, SD = 1.7) performed significantly better on MoCA compared to MCI individuals ( M = 21.4, SD = 3.2) ( p &lt; 0.001). The Cronbach’s α of MoCA as an index of internal consistency was 0.64. MoCA distinguished between healthy controls and MCI individuals with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 74%, using a cut-off of 23/24 points. Conclusion The Slovenian version of MoCA demonstrates an optimal cut-off value of 23/24 points for detecting older individuals with MCI. As a screening tool for MCI, its better diagnostic accuracy makes it preferable to using MMSE.",

To quantify circulating total NK cells and its subpopulations, CD56 dim and bright, and to characterize the functional phenotype and IFN-γ and TNF-α production in relapsing-remitting patients treated with IFN-β and in apparently healthy controls. CD56bright NK cells were found to be the least represented subpopulation. In relapse patients, the frequencies of IFN-γ-producing NK cells and their subpopulations were significantly decreased. In remission patients, CD56dim NK cells expressed high levels of HLA-DR and CD54. These results suggest that remission RRMS patients, although in an inactive stage of MS, present circulating NK cells with an activation phenotype, supporting the idea that NK cells may be relevant mediators in the MS pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder primarily affecting males, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The absence of dystrophin protein leads to progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Recent advances in the therapeutic landscape underscore the need to identify appropriate outcome measures to assess treatment efficacy in ambulant and non-ambulant DMD patients, across clinical and research settings. This is essential for accurately evaluating new treatments and attributing therapeutic benefits.It is crucial to establish a robust correlation between outcome scores and disease progression patterns. This task is challenging since functional test performance may be influenced by different patient's characteristics, including the physiological evolution of the neurodevelopment together with the disease progression. While widely used DMD outcomes such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, the 6-Minute Walking Test, the 4 stairs climbed, and the Performance of the Upper Limb exhibit reliability and validity, their clinical significance is influenced by the wide phenotype and progression variability of the disease.We present and discuss the features (relevance, quantifiability, validity, objectivity, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, precision) of available DMD outcome measures, including new potential measures that may be provided by digital tools and artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Regular and long-term injections of botulinum toxin (BoNT) are considered the first line therapy for essential blepharospasm (BEB), but no data exists on the long-term effect of this therapy on depressive symptoms and quality of life. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the long-term effects of BoNT therapy on depressive symptoms as well as on daily activities, emotional well-being and quality of life using validated questionnaires (BEB-scale, Beck`s Depression Inventory (BDI)). 86 patients diagnosed with BEB were followed up for a median of 4 years. Clinical symptoms improved significantly after BoNT-injections. Everyday activities and subjective assessment of the overall situation improved gradually under long-term BoNT therapy. Significant correlations (p < 0.0001; r-values between 0.498 and 0.706) were found between the BDI and items of the BEB-scale. No significant antidepressive effect of long-term BoNT therapy was found with a low median BDI total score (5/max. 63), but up to 31.3% of BEB patients had a BDI score ≥ 11, indicating clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Of these, 65.4% had no known history of depression. Although, several studies reported an antidepressant effect of botulinum toxin injections in patients with major depression, this effect does not seem to be present in patients with BEB despite clinical improvement of symptoms. A high prevalence of previously undetected depressive symptoms was found in BEB patients. As this may influence BoNT therapy success, identifying potential depressive symptoms at the time of BEB diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment seems important.",

    "abstract": "Strokes are one of the leading causes of death, morbidity, and disability worldwide, mainly among elderly people. It is also the third most common cause of years of life being lost, indicating a high risk of premature mortality. Revascularisation with endarterectomy (CEA) is effective in reducing the risk of death and strokes in patients with carotid artery stenosis, but the effect of invasive treatment on quality of life (QoL) still needs attention. To shed more light on the patients' perspective on this health condition, we carried out a review of the literature which aimed to analyze the level of health-related QoL among stroke survivors, with special attention to patients who had been treated with CEA. Strokes significantly reduce the level of QoL, which may subsequently be improved in the course of treatment with CEA. Patients experience a reduced level of QoL in the early postoperative period, but at 1 year following CEA, the level of QoL remains stable and is similar to that of chronically ill patients. The domains of QoL which are most affected are physical and emotional functioning, which also serve as markers for decreased QoL in the long term. Older age and comorbidities are predictors of worse QoL. Stroke survivors require proper care both immediately after a stroke happens and during the long-term rehabilitation. Measurement of QoL and of the determining factors that contribute to a reduced level of QoL, as well as focusing on determinants of QoL in stroke survivors may help to reduce patients' disability and improve their daily functioning in society as well as reducing the cost of health care.",

    "abstract": "Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with active disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with alemtuzumab are at increased risk for autoimmune adverse events (thyroid disorders, immune thrombocytopenia, and renal disease). The use of alemtuzumab has been associated with the development of renal immune-mediated adverse events in 0.3% of patients in clinical trials in MS, which generally occurred within 39 months of the last administration. Both anti-GBM disease and membranous nephropathy have been associated with the use of alemtuzumab. Early detection is necessary to allow for early diagnosis and prevent adverse renal and patient outcomes. Through the implementation of the risk minimization measures, patients can be diagnosed, and treated if needed, early allowing for generally favorable outcomes. This important goal can be reached through health care professional and patient education, careful analysis of the monthly lab tests, and close collaboration between the patient, neurologist, and the nephrologist. This article presents the consensus of Belgian MS specialists and nephrologists on the practicalities of diagnosis, management, and treatment of alemtuzumab-associated renal adverse events based on good clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Levetiracetam (LEV) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) are commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy, but their efficacy and safety have seldom been compared for the treatment of children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). We thus assessed the efficacy of LEV and OXC monotherapy in the treatment of children with BECTS, and the effect of this treatment on children's intelligence and cognitive development. This was a randomized, single-center trial. Children with BECTS were randomized (1:1) into LEV and OXC groups, and were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. The primary outcomes were the frequency of seizures and changes in intelligence and cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were electroencephalogram (EEG) results and safety. Seventy children were enrolled and randomized to the LEV group or the OXC group, and 32 of the 35 children in each group completed the study. After 6 months, the effective treatment rate of the OXC group was significantly higher than that of the LEV group (78.12 vs. 53.12%, p = 0.035). However, no significant inter-group difference was observed in EEG improvement (p = 0.211). In terms of intelligence and cognitive development, children in the OXC group exhibited significantly improved choice reaction time, mental rotation, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test results (all p < 0.05). Both LEV and OXC were well tolerated, with 18.75 and 21.88% of children reporting mild adverse events (p = 0.756). OXC monotherapy was more effective than LEV for children with BECTS. In addition, children with OXC monotherapy had higher improvements in children's intelligence and cognitive function than those with LEV monotherapy.",

Viral and bacterial serological evaluation of children were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction method.Twenty-five children (21 M,4 F) included in the study. The most common complaints were walking difficulty and tenderness, pain on the gastrocnemius muscles. Their creatine kinase levels were between 216 and 8770 IU. Twenty-two children were hospitalized. Analgesic, intravenous fluid, antibiotic and/or antiviral drugs were given. The most common etiologies were influenza A and B. One children was diagnosed as suspected COVID-19 by the symptoms and the findings in thorax computerized tomography but the SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody tests were negative.School-aged children admitted to hospital with walking difficulty generally after an upper respiratory tract infection with a moderate creatine kinase elevation should remind at first acute benign myositis. Resolution of the complaints in a short time and normalisation of the biochemical markers will prevent unnecessary tests. Endemic and pandemic infections may cause this entity as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Older patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICH) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are commonly seen by neurologists in clinical practice. Due to the lack of clear evidence on optimal management, most guidelines recommend hospital admission for these patients. However, some studies have shown that selected low-risk patients can be safely discharged from the Emergency Department (ED). In light of these differing opinions and a lack of Class 1 evidence, we aimed to explore current management practices and attitudes toward tICH in older mTBI patients in the Netherlands. Methods A national online survey, involving the disposition strategies for five case vignettes of tICH, was sent to neurology residents and neurologists to explore current variations in clinical practice. We evaluated patient and hemorrhage characteristics influencing decisions regarding the discharge disposition of a patient from the ED. Results The survey was completed by 113 respondents, including 36 (32%) residents and 77 (68%) neurologists. In all the cases, over 70% of respondents preferred hospital admission over ED discharge for older mTBI patients with tICH. There was substantial variation in the respondents’ willingness to participate in a randomized trial evaluating the necessity of hospital admission after mTBI with tICH. Factors influencing admission varied between cases. A secondary deterioration risk of 1–2% was considered acceptable by the majority (53%) to allow direct ED discharge. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate limited willingness among clinicians to discharge older mTBI patients with tICH directly from the ED. To support safe and consistent decision-making, high-quality evidence is urgently needed to guide disposition decisions for older mTBI patients with tICH.",

AD affects more than 30 million individuals globally every year. No cure for AD has been discovered yet. The available therapeutic options are administered to slow down the progress of the disease. The currently available treatment plans are used to relieve symptoms and improve cognitive abilities, thus slowing progression. Nanotechnology is highly effective and has demonstrated significant benefits across various medical applications. Nanoparticles have been explored as promising drug delivery systems for the targeted delivery of anti-AD therapeutics and for the precise diagnosis of the condition. Nanoparticles, such as dendrimers, lipid-based nanoparticles, polymer-based nanoparticles, and metal-based nanoparticles, have been designed and reported to inhibit Aβ aggregation, fibril formation, and disaggregating mature fibrils, prevent neuroinflammation and Aβ1-42-induced cell damage, treat oxidative stress and lower hallmark of Aβ, and display excellent capability to bypass blood-brain barrier (BBB). This review is focused on the preclinical therapeutic outcomes of nanoparticles and the challenges encountered in the treatment of AD. This review highlights the significant advancements of nanoparticles that are currently undergoing clinical trials for management of AD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The 2024 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines introduced the CHA₂DS₂-VA score by removing female sex as an independent risk criterion. Although intended to simplify risk stratification and avoid sex-based overtreatment, the real-world implications for women who present with AF-related ischemic stroke/TIA remain unclear. In this prospective observational study, we examined the clinical implications of CHA₂DS₂-VA recalibration in a post-stroke setting, focusing on sex-specific differences in stroke severity and early functional outcome, and on the proportion of women who newly fall below the anticoagulation threshold (score ≤ 1). Methods In a prospective cohort of 714 consecutive stroke patients, 161 (22.5%) had documented AF. Risk stratification was performed using both CHA₂DS₂-VASc and the revised CHA₂DS₂-VA score. Stroke severity (NIHSS) and functional outcome (mRS) were analyzed by sex. Propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the independent association between sex and stroke severity. Results Female patients with AF were older and had a higher vascular risk burden than men. They presented with significantly more severe strokes (median NIHSS 12 vs. 8; P &lt; 0.01) and tended toward worse outcomes. After score recalibration, 11 of 81 women (13.6%) had a CHA₂DS₂-VA score ≤ 1, falling below the ESC anticoagulation threshold—despite having experienced an ischemic stroke. Most of these patients had cardioembolic strokes and moderate-to-severe neurological deficits. In matched analyses, female sex remained independently associated with severe stroke (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03–2.29). Conclusion In this prospective cohort of AF-related ischemic stroke, women had greater comorbidity burden and higher stroke severity than men. A subgroup with CHA₂DS₂-VA ≤ 1 nonetheless sustained ischemic stroke, and exploratory 5-year follow-up suggested excess recurrence without anticoagulation. These findings require validation in larger cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The hypothalamus is involved in cluster headache (CH) pathophysiology and is a hub for autonomic control. While cranial autonomic symptoms are prominent during attacks, other autonomic manifestations may be present in CH. This study aims to explore the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in patients with CH during remission period. Methods Cross-sectional study including 30 CH and 30 age- and sex-matched controls. We analysed time- and frequency-domain parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) and active orthostatic tests. To investigate the sympathetic nervous system, plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were determined. All assessments were performed during remission period. Results All HRV parameters were lower in CH; the percentage of adjacent R-R intervals that differ by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals in 24 h (SDNN) were significantly lower in CH (pNN50, 31.0 [5.3–44.3] vs. 44.5 [25.8–58.5], p = 0.043; SDNN, 79.6 ± 42.6 vs. 99.6 ± 42.6, p = 0.004). All other time-domain parameters, including the root mean square of successive R-R differences (RMSSD) were lower in CH than in controls (RMSSD 59.5 ± 36.9 vs. 77.3 ± 39.4, p = 0.077). Compared to controls, mean HR was significantly higher in CH (64.2 [59.6–75.8] vs. 60.4 [57.3–62.7], p = 0.038). Supine and upright NE levels were significantly higher in CH, (supine 228.9 [161.6-324.1] vs. 209.9 [151.2-314.1], p = 0.015; standing 376.1 [264.6-527.8 vs. 327.4 [256.4-400.9], p = 0.019). Conclusions The present study indicates a significant decrease in HRV and an upward trend of plasmatic NE levels in CH during remission periods, suggesting an imbalance of the ANS in this state.

Alemtuzumab demonstrated superior efficacy over active comparator in both treatment naive patients and those with inadequate response to prior therapy. Alemtuzumab is associated with a consistent and manageable safety and tolerability profile. Treatment with alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis increases the risk for autoimmune adverse events including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Complete blood counts with differential should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter for 48 months after the last infusion. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP onset is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including immediate referral to a specialist. This paper presents the consensus of Belgian multiple sclerosis specialists and hematologists to guide the treating physician with practical recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Since Alzheimer's disease may affect driving performance, patients with Alzheimer's disease are assessed on fitness to drive. On-road driving assessments are widely used, and attempts have also been made to develop strategies to assess fitness to drive in a clinical setting. Preferably, a first indication of fitness to drive is obtained quickly after diagnosis using a single test such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The aim of this study is to investigate whether the MMSE can be used to predict whether patients with Alzheimer's disease will pass or fail an on-road driving assessment. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 81) participated in a comprehensive fitness-to-drive assessment which included the MMSE as well as an on-road driving assessment [PLoS One 11(2):e0149566, 2016]. MMSE cutoffs were applied as suggested by Versijpt and colleagues [Acta Neurol Belg 117(4):811-819, 2017]. All patients with Alzheimer's disease who scored below the lower cutoff (MMSE ≤ 19) failed the on-road driving assessment. However, a third of the patients with Alzheimer's disease who scored above the upper cutoff (MMSE ≥ 25) failed the on-road driving assessment as well. We conclude that the MMSE alone has insufficient predictive value to correctly identify fitness to drive in patients with very mild-to-mild Alzheimer's disease implicating the need for comprehensive assessments to determine fitness to drive in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging health care systems worldwide. People with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks, little is known about the potential impact of COVID-19 on patients with DM1. We studied the clinical course of COVID‐19 in three hospitalized patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 or Steinert's disease, between April 1, 2020‐April 30‐2020. All three had advanced Steinert's disease receiving non-invasive nocturnal home ventilatory support. Two of them lived in a residential care centre. Two patients had a limited respiratory capacity, whereas one patient had a rather preserved functional capacity but more comorbidities. Two out of three patients were obese, none of them had diabetes mellitus. Two patients received hydroxychloroquine. Despite maximal supportive care with oxygen therapy, antibiotics, intensive respiratory physiotherapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, all three patients eventually died due to COVID-19. Our case series of three patients with DM1 admitted for COVID-19 confirms that they are at high risk for severe disease and poor outcome. Clinical trials are needed to define best practices and determinants of outcomes in this unique population.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) is involved in neural development, neuronal differentiation, and neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between ATG5 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Han population.A case-control study was conducted in 120 PD patients and 100 healthy volunteers. MassArray platform was used to analyze polymorphisms in three different regions of ATG5 gene (rs510432, rs573775 and rs17587319). In the included subjects, 50 PD patients and 50 healthy volunteers were selected, and the plasma ATG5 concentration was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The allele and genotype frequencies of SNPs were assessed using the SHEsis program.We found a significant correlation between rs17587319 and PD, and the subcomponent showed a high correlation between rs17587319 with cognitive impairment and age at onset in PD patients. At the same time, the total plasma ATG5 level of PD patients and the plasma ATG5 expression level of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) patients were significantly higher than the control group, while there was no significant difference of ATG5 expression between late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) patients and the control group.These findings suggest that genetic variations in the ATG5 gene and low levels of the ATG5 protein are associated with susceptibility to PD and with cognitive impairment in PD patients. ATG5 could be a potential biomarker to assess the severity and prognosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The proportion of stroke patients eligible for intravenous or intra-arterial treatment is still limited because many patients do not seek medical help immediately after stroke onset. The aim of our study was to explore which intrinsic factors and considerations influence help-seeking behaviour of relatively healthy participants, confronted with stroke situations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 non-stroke participants aged 50 years or older. We presented 5 clinical stroke situations as if experienced by the participants themselves. Recognition and interpretation of symptoms were evaluated and various factors influencing help-seeking behaviour were explored in-depth. We used the thematic synthesis method for data analysis. Five themes influencing help-seeking behaviour in a stroke situation were identified: influence of knowledge, views about seriousness, ideas about illness and health, attitudes towards others and beliefs about the emergency medical system. A correct recognition of stroke symptoms or a correct interpretation of the stroke situations did not automatically result in seeking medical help. Interestingly, similar factors could lead to different types of actions between participants. Many intrinsic, as well as social and environmental factors are of influence on help-seeking behaviour in an acute stroke situation. All these factors seem to play a complex role in help-seeking behaviour with considerable inter-individual variations. Accomplishing more patients eligible for acute stroke treatment, future research should focus on better understanding of all factors at various levels grounded in a theory of help-seeking behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) may not be beneficial for patients with brain metastases (BMs). The Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) is a suggested prognostic factor for malignancies. However, GPS has never been assessed in patients with BMs who have undergone WBRT. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GPS can be used to identify subgroups of patients with BMs who have a poor prognosis, such as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class 2 and Class 3, and who will not receive clinical prognostic benefits from WBRT. Materials and methods A total of 180 Japanese patients with BMs were treated with WBRT between May 2008 and October 2015. We examined GPS, age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), RPA, graded prognostic assessment (GPA), number of lesions, tumor size, history of brain surgery, presence of clinical symptoms, and radiation doses. Results The overall median survival time (MST) was 6.1 months. seventeen patients (9.4%) were alive more than 2 years after WBRT. In univariate analysis, KPS ≤ 70 (p = 0.0066), GPA class 0–2 (p = 0.0008), &gt; 3 BMs (p = 0.012), &gt; 4 BMs (p = 0.02), patients who received ≥ 3 Gy per fraction (p = 0.0068), GPS ≥ 1 (p = 0.0003), and GPS ≥ 2 (p = 0.0009) were found to significantly decrease the MST. Patients who had brain surgery before WBRT (p = 0.036) had a longer survival. On multivariate analysis, GPS ≥ 1 (p = 0.008) was found to significantly decrease MST. Conclusion Our results suggest that GPS ≥ 1 indicates a poor prognosis in patients undergoing WBRT for intermediate and poor prognosis BMs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalized patients with dementia exhibit high mortality rates, underscoring the importance of investigating variables associated with reduced survival. This study aims to determine the incidence of dementia among hospitalized patients and survival rates at 1 and 3 years post-hospitalization. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using administrative databases from the Ministry of Health of Colombia. One- and three-year survival rates, along with adjusted hazard ratios for survival accounting for comorbidities included in the Charlson Index, were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. This analysis was performed for patients with dementia versus a control group without dementia. Additionally, findings were compared with those from an inverse propensity score weighting model. Results 6.769 (1.04%) patients were diagnosed with dementia, and 5798 (85.65%) were over 65 years of age. The unadjusted HR, the HR adjusted using the proportional hazards Cox model, and the HR obtained through propensity score matching (PSM) were 10.32 (95% CI 9.82 to 10.84), 1.69 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.78), and 1.32 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.71), respectively. The 1-year adjusted mortality rates for patients with dementia and those without were 12.5% and 1.31%, respectively, while the corresponding 3-year adjusted mortality rates were 21.25% and 2.76%. Through PSM, we determined that the mean survival time for patients with dementia, in comparison to those without, was − 0.98 months (95% CI: -0.65 to -1.94; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Dementia significantly reduces survival rates of hospitalized patients, regardless of other comorbidities. Specifically, our research revealed that dementia was associated with a decrease in 3-year survival by an average of 0.98 months.",

The patient never received acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Persistent twichings, irrespectively of clinical status, were signs of cholinergic hyperactivity. MuSK antibodies disrupt MuSK-collagen Q interaction with resultant deficient binding of acetylcholinesterase at synaptic cleft and impaired breakdown of acetylcholine. In myasthenia gravis, clinical signs of cholinergic hyperactivity may point to seropositivity of MuSK antibodies with therapeutic implications in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A (CMT1A) is the major subtype of hereditary peripheral neuropathies and arises from a 1.5 megabase (Mb) tandem duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-p12 that contains the complete peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Patients commonly present with progressive weakness and atrophy of the distal muscles, accompanied by hyperalgesia, decreased or absent tendon reflexes, and foot deformities. Current clinical management relies on multidisciplinary supportive care. Recent preclinical studies targeting potential therapeutic strategies for CMT1A have focused on correcting the gene-dose imbalance of PMP22. Notably, PXT3003 has shown phase III clinical efficacy in relieving symptoms and reducing neuropathy, and is expected to be the earliest CMT1A-targeted drug on the market. Gene editing approaches have also shown therapeutic promise in animal models, but off-target effects remain a concern. In addition, the rapid development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has paved the way for stem cell therapies, which may be a promising therapeutic approach. This article reviews the existing literature on therapeutic strategies for CMT1A and aims to provide a valuable reference for the clinical treatment of CMT1A.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the upper and lower motor neurons causing progressive weakness. It eventually involves the diaphragm which leads to respiratory paralysis and subsequently death. Phrenic nerve (PN) conduction studies and diaphragm ultrasound has been studied and correlated with pulmonary function tests in ALS patients. However, PN ultrasonography has not been employed in ALS. This study aims to sonographically evaluate the morphologic appearance of the PN of ALS patients. Thirty-eight ALS patients and 28 normal controls referred to the neurophysiology laboratory of two institutions were retrospectively included in the study. Baseline demographic and clinical variables such as disease duration, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score, and ALS region of onset were collected. Ultrasound was used to evaluate the PN cross-sectional area (CSA) of ALS and control subjects. The mean PN CSA of ALS patients were 1.08 ± 0.39 mm on the right and 1.02 ± 0.34 mm on the left. The PN CSA of ALS patients were significantly decreased compared to controls (p value < 0.00001). The PN CSA of ALS patients was not correlated to any of the demographic and clinical parameters tested. This study demonstrates that ALS patients have a smaller PN size compared to controls using ultrasonography.",

In the affected children, the ages at first diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 16 years with a mean age of 8.2 years (± 5.4); twelve (54.5%) suffered by developmental delay and intellectual deficit; eleven children (50%) complained of epileptic seizures, mostly focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. In addition, in the periventricular heterotopia group (PVNH), cerebral and systemic malformations were reported in twelve (70%) and in ten (58%) children, respectively, out of seventeen. In the SBH plus SUBH group, epileptic seizures were recorded in 3 (60%) out of 5 children, cerebral malformations in one child and systemic malformations in two children.Heterotopic gray matter malformations include a group of disorders that manifest with a variety of neurological implications, such as cognitive impairment and epilepsy, and often related with epilepsy, other cerebral malformations and systemic anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Migraine and endometriosis are chronic disabling pain conditions. There is evidence for a shared genetic background. Migraine phenotype and course in patients with the comorbidity are insufficient investigated. Both conditions can be treated with progestins. Methods For this observational study we included women with migraine and endometriosis, visiting our clinic from 2015 to 2021. We collected available information from charts and complemented these data by a structured phone interview to collect more specific information on migraine and the course of both diseases. Results From 344 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 94 suffered from both, endometriosis and migraine. Migraine with aura was reported by 41% of the patients and was associated with earlier onset of migraine (age &lt; 17 years (OR 6.54) and with a history of medication overuse headache (OR 9.9, CI 1.6–59.4). Present monthly migraine frequency (1.5 ± 2.6) was significantly lower than five years before the interview (2.9 ± 4.64). There was a correlation between medication overuse headache and use of analgesics more than 3 days/months for dysmenorrhoea ( p &lt; 0.03). ASRM endometriosis score was not associated with migraine characteristics. Conclusions We conclude that the comorbidity of endometriosis is highly linked to migraine with aura. Migraine onset in these patients was earlier. Further studies are needed to explore, if the observed decrease in migraine frequency can be attributed to recent endometriosis surgery and to understand if early diagnosis and treatment of both conditions may contribute to improve the course of both conditions.

The samples of 16 nemaline myopathy patients diagnosed by characteristically pathological features went through whole exon sequencing. Clinico-pathological and genetic features of the cases were systematically analyzed. According to the classification of nemaline myopathy by ENMC, 8 cases are typical congenital subtype, 6 cases are childhood/juvenile onset subtype and 2 case are adult onset subtype. In histological findings, characteristic purple-colored rods are discovered under modified gömöri trichrome staining (MGT). Electron microscopy revealed the presence of high electron-dense nemaline bodies around the submucosa and the nucleus nine patients (9/16 56.3%) were detected pathogenic causative mutations, among whom mutations in the NEB gene were the most frequent (6 patients, 66.7%). KBTBD13 gene mutation was discovered in two patients and ACTA1 gene mutation was discovered in 1 patient. Nemaline myopathy is a congenital myopathy with highly clinico-pathological and genetic heterogeneity. NEB gene mutation is the most common mutation, in which splicing change c.21522 +3A > G is hotspot mutation in Chinese NM patients.",

Cognitive impairment was assessed using the MoCA, and potential correlations were explored between clinicodemographic characteristics (sex, age, stroke location and etiology) and MoCA dimensions or total MoCA score.Univariate linear regression showed that the total MoCA score was significantly associated with sex, age, executive function, naming, attention, abstract generalization ability, memory ability, and visuospatial orientation. However, multivariate linear regression identified only executive function, naming, attention, memory ability, and visuospatial orientation as significantly associated with the total MoCA score.We showed that the MoCA test can be used for patients with basal ganglia stroke. The total MoCA score of basal ganglia stroke was significantly associated with impairments in executive function, naming, attention, memory ability, and visuospatial orientation.",

    "abstract": "Stroke incidence among young adults has risen in the last decade. This research attempts to determine the effect of substance use disorder (SUD) on the clinical characteristics of stroke, mortality, outcome after IV thrombolysis, and functional dependency after 1 month among young adults. Through a retrospective study, data were extracted from the electronic medical records of stroke in young adults admitted to intensive care units in Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital (February 2018-January 2021). The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Modified Rankin Scale were documented at the onset and after 1 month. The study included 225 young adults with stroke (median age of 40, IQR: 34-44). Only 93 young adults (41%) met the criteria of SUD. Anabolic steroid use disorder was significantly associated with cerebral venous thrombosis (P-value = 0.02), while heroin use disorder was significantly associated with a hemorrhagic stroke (P-value = 0.01). Patients with tramadol, cannabis, and cocaine use disorders had significantly more frequent strokes in the posterior than the anterior circulation. Patients with heroin use disorders had significantly higher mortality than those without heroin use disorders (P-value = 0.01). The risk of poor outcomes was doubled by alcohol or heroin use disorder, while it was tripled by cocaine use disorder (P-value = 0.01 for each). Forty-one percent of young adults diagnosed with a stroke had SUD, with a relatively higher posterior circulation involvement. Increased mortality was associated with heroin use disorder more than other substances. Poor stroke outcome was associated with alcohol, heroin, and cocaine use disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Relationships between stressful life events (SLEs) and health outcomes in people living with multiple sclerosis (plwMS), beyond relapse, are not well-established. We examined associations between SLEs and fatigue and symptoms of depression in plwMS. Methods 948 participants were queried whether they had experienced any of the 16 SLEs (Holmes–Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale) in the preceding 12 months. SLEs were summated to estimate SLE number and SLE load (weighted for the degree of associated stress). Cross-sectional associations between SLE (number, load and individual) and fatigue, and depressive symptoms were examined using log-binomial or log-multinomial regression adjusted for age, sex, relapse symptoms, education, MS type at baseline, disability, fatigue, comorbidity, depression, and antidepressant/antifatigue medications, as appropriate. Sub-analyses restricted to SLEs with a negative emotional impact were performed. Results Median SLE number and load were 2 (IQR 1–2) and 57 (IQR 28–97), respectively. SLE number and load were not associated with a higher prevalence of fatigue, or depressive symptoms, even when restricting analyses to SLEs with a perceived negative emotional impact. A new relationship or family member with a negative impact was associated with a threefold and 2.5-fold higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, respectively. Serious illness was associated with a 28% higher prevalence of depressive symptoms. Conclusion Psychological support for SLEs, and/or intervention targeted to SLE appraisal, may be beneficial in mitigating the adverse effects of SLEs with a perceived negative emotional impact on depressive symptoms in plwMS. Potential associations between serious illness and increased prevalence of depressive symptoms may warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a crucial pathway for the degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells, is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the accumulated autophagosomes in the cells resulting in the death of cells. Sevoflurane can impair spatial learning and memory in mice with AD and lead to the apoptosis of nerve cells; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We aim to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of sevoflurane in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice. 51 heterozygous APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice were involved and divided into three groups, including control group, sham group and sevoflurane group. Morris water maze experiment was used to test the learning and memory abilities of mice, flow cytometry was conducted to detect apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential of brain cells in mice, transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the number of autophagosomes at the axon in mice, and western blot was carried out to detect the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, LC3II, P62, KIF3B and DIC proteins of brain cells in mice. In our study, we found that significantly longer escape latencies, fewer crossings of the platform and shorter time spent in the target quadrant of the morris water maze experiment in the sevoflurane group. Flow cytometry showed cellular apoptosis was increased and the membrane potential of the mitochondria was reduced of brain cells in the sevoflurane group. Transmission electron microscopy displayed that there was a remarkable upregulation of autophagosomes at the axon of brain cells in mice after treatment of sevoflurane. Western blot demonstrated that the expression of Bax, LC3II, P62 and KIF3B proteins were elevated, and the expression of Bcl-2 and DIC proteins were reduced in the sevoflurane group. Sevoflurane impaired acquisition learning and memory function, promoted the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice, and the mechanism might be related to the activation of autophagy along with the disruption of autophagosomes retrograde transport in axons.",

Analysis of the medical records of patients treated for hydrocephalus in the Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery in Katowice in 2000–2010. The Barthel scale was used to assess the children’s independence. Information on the children’s functioning was obtained directly from their parents using a questionnaire developed by the author. The parent group comprised 131 people, including 110 women (85%) and 21 men (15%). The study group comprised 131 children treated for hydrocephalus. In the examined group, 59 children (45%) were fully independent (first degree), 44 (34%) were partially independent (second degree) and 28 (21%) were completely dependent (third degree). Most of the children with congenital and post-inflammatory hydrocephalus attended the generally accessible school (public school), while the majority of the children with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus attended rehabilitation and educational centers or special schools ( p &lt; 0.05) The lowest level of independence was found for children with hemorrhagic hydrocephalus who had undergone repeated operations. The child’s degree of independence and the etiology of hydrocephalus determined the type of school the child attended. The study’s results indicate that rehabilitation plays a key role in the lives of children with hydrocephalus.",

    "abstract": "In the psychological thriller film Joker, released in 2019 and starring Joaquin Phoenix in the first role, another possible origin story for this iconic character is reported. Above all, it brings us medical elements for the understanding of the development of this complex character. Contrary to other interpretations, we discover a lonely, timid and uncharismatic man (Arthur Fleck). He seems to be suffering from psychobehavioral disorders and seems depressed. There is a strangeness in his behavior along with social withdrawal. He suffers from fits of laughter that occur at socially inappropriate times. He also suffers from psychotic symptoms with visual delusions. We learn through the film that he was a beaten child, psychologically and physically abused with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The uncontrollable outbursts of laughter, behavioral and psychotic disorders followed these elements. As a neurologist, I was intrigued by these symptoms. I have explored the neuropsychiatric symptoms complicating TBI from which he seems to suffer and which have been reported in the literature. We can assume that the Joker is suffering from neuropsychiatric sequelae related to childhood TBI involving the frontotemporal regions and, in particular, the lateral aspect of the left frontal lobe. The movie Joker has medical significance and covers social aspects of medicine and health care. First, it allows us to discuss whether psychotic disorder due to TBI should be considered a neurobiological syndrome. More broadly, albeit fictitious, it asks us about the management of patients with neuropsychiatric illness, which is a public health problem. It also reminds us that semiological descriptions of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders have served as inspiration for many authors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Erenumab is a monoclonal antibody, targeted against the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. Clinical studies have demonstrated prophylactic efficacy in both episodic (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment in tertiary headache centers under real-life conditions. In a retrospective analysis, the period of 3 months before and after initiation of erenumab therapy was compared. Relevant parameters (headache days, headache intensity, headache duration, acute medication, previous prophylaxis treatments) were collected from medical charts of all migraine patients ( N = 82) who started treatment with erenumab between November 1st 2018 and May 1st 2019 at two tertiary headache centers in Germany. The sample included 68 female (82.9%) and 14 male patients aged between 22 and 78 years (mean 51.1 years, SD 10.5 years). Of these patients, 57.3% met the criteria for CM and 56.9% overused acute medication. Under therapy with erenumab, a significant reduction of headache days was observed from the first month on. The effect was most pronounced in the third month with a decrease in monthly headache days from 16.6 to 11.6 days ( p &lt; 0.001). There was also a significant reduction in reported headache intensity ( p = 0.004) and average duration of headache attacks ( p = 0.016). The 50% responder rate in patients with CM was lower in the first month compared to EM but then increased similarly to EM. Patients with medication overuse (MO) also responded to the therapy. There was a reduction in medication overuse from 57% at baseline to 29% after therapy ( p = 0.011). Overall, a positive result of treatment with erenumab can be shown in a highly selected sample with severely affected migraine patients and a refractory course prior to treatment. This re-confirms the clinical trial data also for this highly selected group.",

    "abstract": "A baby girl, born to second-degree consanguineously married couple, was delivered by forceps, after a full-term pregnancy. Apgar scores were 9 and 10, birth weight 4,100 g, and head circumference 35 cm. The baby was hospitalized, at the age of 20 days, for recurrent myoclonic seizures. Physical examination found hypotonia and absent reflexes. Amino acid analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma was performed, to exclude the possibility of metabolic disorder. A brain ultrasonography found hypoplastic corpus callosum. An expansion of the cisterna magna communicating with the fourth ventricle and a cerebellar vermis hypoplasia were also showed. These findings, suggested a Dandy–Walker malformation. 1 day later, brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy were performed. MRI confirmed the brain ultrasonography findings (Fig. 1). On the T1and T2-weighted images, the appearance of the white matter myelination was inappropriate for age. The axial T2-weighted images revealed increased signal intensity in the dorsal brain stem, the middle cerebellar peduncles, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. Diffusion-weighted MR images found hyperintense signal intensity in these areas, in combination with low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, consistent with restricted diffusion (Fig. 2). Localized proton MR spectroscopy showed a markedly increased peak intensity at 3.55 ppm, which was assigned to glycine and a lactate peak at 1.33 ppm (Fig. 3). The diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) was made by laboratory findings of elevated CSF and plasma glycine levels, which were 250 lmol/L (normal range 1–15 lmol/L) and 1,540 lmol/L (normal range 230–740 lmol/L), respectively. The CSF-to-plasma glycine ratio was also elevated to 0.16 (normal range 0.02–0.03). 4 days later, the baby became lethargic, and the shallow respiration which began at that point progressed to intermittent apnea, requiring mechanical ventilation. 1 day later the infant died.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global public health crisis and profoundly impacted acute treatment delivery. This study conducted long-term evaluations of the impact of the pandemic on acute stroke management. Methods Data from a university-owned medical facility in Tokyo, Japan, were retrospectively analyzed. The number of hospital admissions for stroke and time metrics in the management of patients with acute ischemic stroke were evaluated. A year-over-year comparison was conducted using data from April 2019 to December 2021 to assess the impact of the pandemic. Results The year-over-year comparison demonstrated that the number of admissions of patients with stroke and patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and thrombectomy during the pandemic remained comparable to the pre-COVID data. However, we found a decrease in the number of admissions of patients with stroke alerts and stroke when hospital cluster infection occurred at this facility and when the region hosted the Tokyo Olympics games during the surge of infection. The door-to-computed tomography time in 2021 was affected. This is plausibly due to the reorganization of in-hospital stroke care pathways after hospital cluster infection. However, no significant difference was observed in the onset-to-door, door-to-MRI, door-to-needle, or door-to-groin puncture times. Conclusions We did not observe long-term detrimental effects of the pandemic at this site. Prevention of hospital cluster infections remains critical to provide safe and timely acute stroke management during the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Our study aimed to investigate the predictive value of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral oxygen metabolism monitoring in the postoperative prognosis of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). Methods The clinical data of 55 patients with SICH treated by neurosurgery were analyzed retrospectively. These patients were divided into two groups based on postoperative Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores, i.e., the poor prognosis group (GOS I-III) and the good prognosis group (GOS IV and V). Next, the ICP and cerebral oxygen metabolism indexes, such as brain temperature (BT), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), internal jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO 2 ), and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), were recorded after the operation. Further, the prognostic differences between the two groups were compared, and the predictive values were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC). Results The results showed that the average ICP and BT in the good prognosis group were lower than those in the poor prognosis group. However, the CPP and SjvO 2 in the good prognosis group were higher than those in the poor prognosis group. Moreover, the incidence of low PaCO 2 in the poor prognosis group was higher than that in the good prognosis group. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the average ICP, BT, CPP, SjvO 2 , and arterial PaCO 2 may reflect the changes in brain function and cerebral blood flow, which are significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients. Further, our findings indicated that the combined postoperative ICP levels with cerebral oxygen metabolism indexes could guide clinical treatments and predict prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Stenosis of arteries that supplies blood to the brain is one of the main causes of ischemic stroke which is the third most common cause of deaths in Europe. Atherosclerosis of carotid and vertebral arteries is responsible for 20% of the ischemic stroke cases. Stenosis may be either asymptomatic or manifested with typical neurological symptoms including motor and sensory disturbances as well as disturbances in vision and speech. However, discrete non-specific symptoms of ischemia, including headaches and vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss, are also quite common. These symptoms may be indicative of a clinically significant stenosis of carotid and vertebral arteries, particularly within the internal carotid artery region, as well as of a risk of ischemic stroke. To date, research reports were unable to provide exact explanation of correlations between impaired hearing and the stenosis of carotid and vertebral arteries. Despite this, numerous articles list these symptoms as one of the first non-specific symptoms of this disorder. The ischemic mechanism within the inner ear region may lead to early symptoms of atherosclerosis of large vessels. However, no evidence of relationship and no explanation could be provided with this regard. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of carotid and vertebral artery stenosis on the function of the hearing and equilibrium organ on the basis of diagnostic audiological examinations including pure-tone threshold audiometry, impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emission tests and brainstem auditory evoked potential tests. The study was conducted in 63 patients (32 males, 31 females) aged 45-75 years, presenting with carotid and vertebral artery stenosis and treated at the Vascular Surgery Clinic of the University Clinical Hospital in Wrocław. Patients were stratified into two subgroups according to their age (45-60 years, 61-75 years). Patients were also divided into subgroups according to the stenotic arteries and to the symptomatic/asymptomatic status of the disorder. All patients were homogeneous in terms of the degree of artery stenosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy persons (14 males, 18 females) aged 48-75 years. Patients qualified to the control group reported no history of middle or inner ear disorders, disturbed hearing, vertigo and balance disorders, as well as cardiovascular diseases; they also presented with unremarkable ultrasound scans of the arteries. All patients were subjected to precise audiological examinations. Prior to being qualified for the study, patients were subjected to the assessment of arteries by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The hearing organ function was assessed by means of pure-tone threshold audiometry, impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emission tests and brainstem auditory evoked potential tests. Reduction of the flow through the carotid arteries causes problems in the organ of hearing; abnormalities are reported especially in tone threshold audiometry, examinations of the stapedius muscle reflexes and brainstem auditory evoked potentials, which prove the presence of receptive cochlear-extracochlear hearing damage. Disturbances of the organ of hearing have similar severity in stenosis of the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. Abnormalities found in audiologic examinations in patients with carotid artery stenosis are not always explicitly clinically expressed in patients with hearing loss; we should consider diagnostics for carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have found an association between chronic kidney disease and poor outcomes in stroke patients. However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating this association by stroke type. We therefore aimed to explore the association between CKD and stroke outcomes according to type of stroke. The data consisting of 594,681 stroke patients were acquired from Universal Coverage Health Security Insurance Scheme Database in Thailand. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of CKD and outcomes, which were as follows; in-hospital mortality, long length of stay (>3 days), pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure and myocardial infarction. Results: after fully adjusting for covariates, CKD was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality in patients with ischemic (OR 1.32; 95% CI = 1.27-1.38), haemorrhagic (OR 1.31; 95% CI = 1.24-1.39), and other undetermined stroke type (OR 1.44; 95% CI = 1.21-1.73). CKD was found to be associated with increased odds of pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure and myocardial infarction in ischaemic stroke. While CKD was found to be associated with increase odds of sepsis, respiratory failure, and myocardial infarction, decrease odds of pneumonia was observed in patients with haemorrhagic stroke. In other undetermined stroke type, CKD was found to only be associated with increase odds of sepsis and respiratory failure, while there is no significant association of CKD and increase or decrease odds with pneumonia and myocardial infarction. CKD was associated with poor outcomes in all stroke types. CKD should be considered as part of stroke prognosis as well as identifying at risk patient population for in-hospital complications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Headache is frequent in patients with mitochondrial disorders. Previous studies point to a higher prevalence of headache in these patients than in the general population. As mitochondrial disorders often present a variety of other symptoms, the question arises how much the presence of headache really influences daily life. We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study investigation with 61 patients with a genetically proved mitochondrial disease mainly composed of CPEO phenotype. Headache was examined using a standardized questionnaire, and classified according to ICHD-2. Headache-related disability was evaluated by the Headache-Impact-Test-6 (HIT-6). Additionally, depression and anxiety were examined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Short-Form-Health Survey (SF-12) was used to investigate the health-related quality of life. Headache was reported by 43/61 (70.5%) of the patients. 35/61 patients (57.4%) described a Tension-type headache (TTH) and 26 patients (42.6%) a migraine. Patients reporting headache had a significantly higher HIT-6 score than those without (mean: 54.47 vs. 38.47, p &lt; 0.001). The HIT-6 score was significantly higher in patients reporting a migraine compared to those with a tension-type headache (mean: 62.13 vs. 46.18, p &lt; 0.001). In the HADS score and in the SF-12 were not significantly influenced by the occurrence of headache. This study confirms the previously reported frequent occurrence of headache in a large cohort of patients with a confirmed mitochondrial disease. Migraine had the greatest impact on daily living, which appeared not to be confounded by depression and anxiety. Thus, we conclude that Migraine may be a substantial contributor for burden of disease in patients with mitochondrial diseases.",

    "abstract": "Patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) suffer from slowly progressive muscle weakness. Approximately 20% of FSHD patients end up wheelchair-dependent. FSHD patients benefit from physical activity to maintain their muscle strength as much as possible. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of FSHD patients was unknown. This study assessed changes in daily care received, perceived psychosocial stress, and worsening of FSHD complaints in 2020. Furthermore, we compared COVID-19 infection incidence and severity of symptoms between FSHD patients and non-FSHD housemates. Three online survey rounds were sent out to all adult participants of the Dutch FSHD registry regarding daily care received, perceived psychosocial stress, COVID-19 infection rate, and COVID-19 symptoms severity. They also included COVID-19-related questions regarding the participants' housemates, which served as control group. Participation rate was 210 (61%), 186 (54%), and 205 (59%) for survey 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Care reduction was reported by 42.7%, 40%, and 28.8% of the participants in the respective surveys. Perceived psychosocial stress increased in 44%, 30%, and 40% of the participants. Compared to the 197 non-FSHD housemates, the 213 FSHD patients reported more possibly COVID-19-related symptoms (27% vs. 39%, p = 0.017) of mostly minimal severity (63%). No difference in (possible) COVID-19 infection incidence rates was found (2.0% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.527). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted care received and increased perceived psychosocial stress in FSHD patients. However, COVID-19 infection incidence in FSHD patients was similar to their non-FSHD housemates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Balance confidence is an essential component of fall risk assessment in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Aims The aims of this cross-sectional study were to 1) investigate the ability of the 16-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-16), 6-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-6), and each item of the ABC-16 for distinguishing fallers and 2) determine cutoff scores for these scales to discriminate fallers and non-fallers in pwMS. Methods One hundred and fifty-six participants [fallers/non-fallers: 60 (38.5%)/96 (61.5%), median EDSS: 1.5] were enrolled. Balance confidence was assessed using the ABC-16 and ABC-6. The self-reported number of falls in the past three months was recorded. Descriptive assessments, including walking, balance, and cognition were performed. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to estimate the sensitivities and specificities of the ABC-16 and ABC-6. Results Both the ABC-16 (AUC: 0.85) and ABC-6 (AUC: 0.84) had the discriminative ability for falls. Each item of the ABC-16 scale was a significantly related to falls [odds ratio (OR) range: 1.38 to 1.89]. Items 8 and 10 had the highest odds ratio (OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.47–2.33, OR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.49–2.40; respectively). We found cutoff scores of ≤ 70 of 100 (sensitivity: 71.67, specificity: 86.46) and ≤ 65/100 (sensitivity: 76.67, specificity: 79.17) in discrimination between fallers and non-fallers for the ABC-16 and ABC-6, respectively. Conclusion Both original and short forms of the ABC scale are an efficient tool for discriminating fallers and non-fallers in pwMS. Although all items are related to falls, outdoor walking activities have the strongest associations with falls than other items.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Erenumab is a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting the CGRP-receptor. Several studies showed efficacy and safety in patients with migraine. Less is known regarding dosage increase, especially in a difficult to treat patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the increased dosage under real world conditions with particular focus on 70 mg non-responders. Methods In a retrospective analysis, patients treated in tertiary headache centers (Halle or Jena, Germany) receiving 70 mg erenumab for at least 3 months with a dosage increase to 140 mg were analyzed. Data were evaluated regarding headache days, intake of acute medication, previous prophylaxis, and medication overuse. Baseline and all treatment intervals were determined as three-month periods. Results Datasets of 52 migraine patients (90.4% women) aged between 22 and 78 years (mean 50.4 years, SD 12.1 years) were analyzed. At baseline (mean headache-days 15.67 ± 6.37) 51.9% met criteria for chronic migraine and 56% were currently overusing acute medication. While therapy with 70 mg showed significant improvement in headache days and 50% response, further improvement was not achieved for therapy escalation to 140 mg. The same applies to the secondary endpoints and covers the entire study population as well as the subgroups of chronic and episodic migraine. The 50% response of the 70 mg non-responders for escalation was only 5.14%. Conclusions In this difficult-to-treat patient cohort we reconfirmed the effectiveness of erenumab, but could not detect any additional benefit for a dosage escalation from 70 mg to 140 mg erenumab.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and CHARGE syndrome are complex neurological disorders, which never occurred together in the same family and, to date, no putative correlation between them has been described on PubMed Central. Due to our aim was to evaluate the presence of different genetic variants involved in these pathologies, we reported a clinical and genetic description of two sisters affected by these two different disorders. In the CHARGE patient, molecular analysis of the CHD7 gene revealed the c.8016G >A de novo variant in exon 37. The ALS patient had been screened negative for mutations in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS/TLS, C9orf72 and KIF5A genes. Anyway, targeted next generation sequencing analysis identified known and unknown genetic variations in 39 ALS-related genes: a total of 380 variants were reported, of which 194 in the ALS patient and 186 in the CHARGE patient. To date, although the results suggest that the occurrence of the two syndromes in the same family is co-incidental rather than based on a causative genetic variant, we could hypothesize that other factors might act as modulators in the pathogenesis of these different phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have described the features of menstrually related migraines but there is a lack of knowledge regarding the features of migraine in combined hormonal contraceptive users (CHC). Hormone-withdrawal migraines in the pill-free period could differ from those in the natural cycle. Gynaecologic comorbidities, like dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, but also depression or a family history might modify the course of migraine. A better understanding of migraine features linked to special hormonal situations could improve treatment. For this prospective cohort study, we conducted telephone interviews with women using a CHC and reporting withdrawal migraine to collect information on migraine frequency, intensity, triggers, symptoms, pain medication, gynaecologic history and comorbidities (n = 48). A subset of women agreed to also document their migraines in prospective diaries. The mean number of migraine days per cycle was 4.2 (± 2.7). Around 50% of these migraines occurred during the hormone-free interval. Migraine frequency was significantly higher in women who suffered from migraine before CHC start (5.0 ± 3.1) (n = 22) in comparison to those with migraine onset after CHC start (3.5 ± 2.1) (n = 26). Menstrually related attacks were described as more painful (57.5%), especially in women with migraine onset before CHC use (72%) (p < 0.02). Comorbidities were rare, except dysmenorrhea. The majority of migraine attacks in CHC users occur during the hormone-free interval. Similar as in the natural cycle, hormone-withdrawal migraines in CHC users are very intense and the response to acute medication is less good, especially in those women, who developed migraine before CHC use.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) headaches in the Emergency Department (ED) is frequent despite many specialist visits performed. The aim of the study was to examine specialist visits carried out in the patients discharged from ED with diagnosis of NOS headache to evaluate discrepancies between specialist and ED diagnosis at discharge. We retrospectively (1.6.2018-31.12.2018) analyzed all the patients admitted with non-traumatic headache to the ED of the tertiary-care University Hospital of Trieste. We evaluated the patients discharged from ED with a final diagnosis of NOS headache and who underwent at least one specialist examination. Demographic data, specialist and ED diagnosis were analyzed. One hundred twenty-four patients (93 F, 31 M, mean age 44 ± 15 years) were included. 71.8% of patients were examined only by a neurologist, 12.9% by non-neurologists, 15.3% by both neurologist and non-neurologist. Only 37% of the patients received a precise diagnosis. Neurologist made a diagnosis slightly more frequently than the other consultants (40.5% vs 37.5%). Neurologists diagnosed primary headaches, headaches secondary to neurological diseases, and facial neuralgia, instead non-neurologists diagnosed only headaches secondary to non-neurological diseases. Primary headaches were diagnosed in 25.7% of cases, migraine being the most frequent. Physicians did not report any specialist diagnoses in the ED discharge sheet. Specialist consultants made specific diagnoses in about one-third of patients that were not reported as final in the discharge records by the ED physician. This leads to a loss of diagnoses and to an overestimation of NOS headache.",

This case series suggests that with increased use of OCT in routine clinical care, entoptic phenomena can be demonstrated as a relevant differential diagnosis to optic neuritis. Patients should be explained the benign nature of their symptoms.",

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of lockdown on the burden of migraine attacks during COVID-19 lockdown.Patients were interviewed, and data about demographics, PA, daily behaviour, working habits, disability (HIT-6) and characteristics of migraine and drugs consumption were compared between the first month of the lockdown in Italy (March 2020), and a reference month prior the lockdown (January 2020).37 patients were analysed, classified as migraine without aura (MwoA) (n = 26) and migraine with aura (MwA) plus migraine with and without aura (MwA/MwoA) (n = 11). During the lockdown, a greater proportion of patients with insufficient PA (65% vs 31%; p = 0.012) were found. Reduced mean headache duration [3 h, (2-12) vs 2 h (1-8); p = 0.041] and HIT score [59 (51-63) vs 50 (44-57); p = 0.001] were found in MwoA patients during the lockdown, while no changes found in patients with MwA + MwA/MwoA.Lockdown induced significant changes in PA and working habits of people with migraine and was found to be associated with improved migraine-related symptoms which might depend by different lifestyle habits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Numerous but inconclusive findings have sparked an ongoing debate about whether the arteries of migraine patients undergo vascular alterations. The outlet angle of the superior cerebellar artery (SUCA) and the lateral displacement of basilar arteries are good surrogate parameters for determining elongation of the vertebrobasilar arteries. Methods We retrospectively determined the SUCA outlet angle and the lateral displacement of the basilar artery in 63 patients with migraine (30.6 ± 8.9 years, 84% women, 16% chronic migraine, 60% migraine with aura) and compared these with 126 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Results In patients with migraine, the SUCA outlet angle was lower (159 ± 26° vs. 169 ± 29°, p = 0.020) and the lateral displacement of the basilar artery was greater (3.7 ± 2.7 mm vs. 2.8 ± 2.4 mm, p = 0.020) than in the control subjects. Age, gender, migraine characteristics and presence of any cardiovascular risk factors did not affect the SUCA outlet angle or lateral displacement of the basilar artery. Conclusion Migraine patients exhibited a lower SUCA outlet angle and greater lateral displacement of the basilar arteries. Both may be attributable to the elongation of the vertebrobasilar arteries, which is an indication of arterial wall pathology in migraine.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) may present with neurological signs, but whether people already affected by neurological conditions are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 is still not known. We, therefore, aimed to investigate the association of previously diagnosed neurological conditions with COVID-19. 502,536 community-dwelling UK Biobank participants (54.4% male, mean age 56.6 ± 10.3 years) were included. Among these, 57,463 participants had a diagnosis of neurological conditions (11.43%) and a total of 1326 COVID-19-positive cases were identified (0.26%). Neurological conditions were identified through medical history and linkage to data on hospital admissions (ICD-10 code G00-G99). COVID-19 presence was diagnosed using the data provided by Public Health England. The association of previous diagnosis of neurological conditions with COVID-19 was evaluated through logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (G50-G59) were the most common conditions identified. The presence of COVID-19 was almost doubled in neurological conditions compared to the general population (0.45 vs. 0.24%, p < 0.0001). Previously diagnosed neurological conditions were associated with 60% higher odds of COVID-19 positive in the multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8). Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, polyneuropathies and other disorders of the peripheral nervous system, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes were significantly associated with a higher odds of COVID-19. The presence of neurological conditions was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of COVID-19 compared to the general population.",

    "abstract": "The potential impact of insulin resistance on stroke prognosis after IV thrombolysis is poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the effect of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome on the outcome of IV thrombolysis in non-diabetic patients with acute ischaemic stroke. This prospective observational study was conducted on 70 non-diabetic acute ischaemic stroke patients who received rt-PA within 3 h of stroke onset. Patients were subjected to baseline and follow-up NIHSS measurements at 24 h and 3 months post-treatment. Stroke outcome was assessed after 3 months using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated for the included patients at stroke onset. The mean age of included patients was 57.04 ± 14.39 years. Patients with unfavourable outcome had a significantly higher frequency of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, higher values of baseline NIHSS, insulin, HOMA-IR, uric acid and lower levels of HDL than those with favourable outcome (P value = 0.035, 0.007, ≤ 0.001, 0.001, ≤ 0.001, 0.002, 0.033, respectively). Each point increase in NIHSS before rt-PA increased the odds of an unfavourable outcome by 2.06 times (95% CI 1.22 - 3.478). Also, insulin resistance increased the odds of the unfavourable outcome by 11.046 times (95% CI 1.394-87.518). There was a statistically significant improvement in NIHSS 3 months after receiving rt-PA in all patients, significantly higher in patients who did not have insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were associated with worse functional outcomes in non-diabetic stroke patients after receiving rt-PA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Safinamide is a recent multimodal antiparkinsonian drug that inhibits monoamine oxidase B and modulates the glutamatergic system with positive effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This post-hoc analysis of the European SYNAPSES study provides first-time data on the use of safinamide in routine clinical practice in Belgium. Objective To describe the efficacy and safety of safinamide in Belgian PD patients in real-life conditions. Methods Post-hoc analysis of the Belgian cohort from the European SYNAPSES trial, which was an observational, multicenter, retrospective-prospective cohort study. Patients were followed up to 12 months. Analyses were performed in the overall population and according to different criteria such as the age limit (&gt; 75 years), presence or absence of relevant comorbidities, presence or absence of psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, patients on levodopa monotherapy or levodopa in combination with other treatments, patients on rasagiline before inclusion or not. Results Of the 172 patients included, 29.2% were &gt; 75 years, 58.9% had relevant comorbidities and 32.7% had psychiatric conditions. Almost all the patients reported motor (98.8%) or non-motor (86.3%) symptoms. During the study, 36.3% of patients reported drug-related reactions. The adverse drug reactions were those already described in the patients’ information leaflet. The majority were mild or moderate and completely resolved and no differences were detected between the subgroups of patients. Almost 35% of the patients demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in the UPDRS and 50% of the patients with wearing-off at baseline, did not report wearing-off anymore after one year of treatment. Patients under levodopa monotherapy compared to patients receiving levodopa combined with other antiparkinsonian treatments benefit more from safinamide treatment. Patients switched from rasagiline to safinamide seemed also to benefit more from safinamide treatment. Conclusion The study confirms the excellent safety and efficacy profile of safinamide, particularly in more vulnerable groups of patients such as the elderly and patients with significant comorbidities or psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety.",

    "abstract": "A 43 years old woman was consulted in the psychiatric ward for acute signs of catatonia. She was scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy. Her medical history showed a borderline personality disorder, depression and back surgery. Six  weeks preceding our consultation, she had a cardiac arrest following an auto-intoxication with benzodiazepines. She was resuscitated 30 min, followed by cooling for 24 h. Four days later she was discharged from the hospital without any neurological sequela. After 6 weeks she was re-admitted for severe rigidity and hypokinesia with a subacute onset. At examination she was comprehensive but mutistic. She was able to communicate by pointing at a letter chart with her eyes. Her limbs were symmetrical hypokinetic and rigid with cogwheel phenomenon. Due to the hypokinetic-rigid syndrome she was bedbound.\r\n\r\nA non-contrast head CT was performed, which revealed a symmetric hypodense signal in the caudate nucleus and the putamen (Fig. 1). An additional MRI bilaterally showed a hyperintense signal in the caudate nuclei and the putamen (Fig. 2a–c). Laboratory examination showed no abnormalities. The hypokinetic-rigid syndrome improved on levodopa therapy. Three weeks later at discharge she received 250 mg levodopa 4 times daily and 125 mg slow release at the evening. Although some rigidity and hypokinesia remained, she regained independent living. Additional follow-up showed no further deterioration, and levodopa was halved in dosage. Two years later a follow-up MRI showed that the ischemic structures had become atrophic (Fig. 2d–f). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen in a separate window\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\n\r\nA non-contrast head CT, 6 weeks after cardiac resuscitation, showing symmetrical hypodensity of caudate nuclei and putamen",

Methods 106 patients aged ≥ 16 years were recruited consecutively in this single-center prospective observational study. All patients received LCM as an add-on treatment on the basis of clinical judgement. Seizure frequency, adverse events (AEs) and retention rates were obtained at 3 and 6 months after LCM introduction. Result The overall response rates were 53.3 and 70.4% after 3 and 6 months, respectively, and the freedom of seizures at the same points was reached at 19 and 26.5%. The retention rates were 99.1% at the 3-month follow-up and 93.3% at the 6-month follow-up. The overall incidence of adverse events was 35.8%. The leading AEs were dizziness (16.98%) and sedation (6.6%). Conclusions Our study confirmed the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive LCM in Chinese patients in real-life conditions. Based on our treatment experience, a universal maintenance dose of LCM would be needed in Chinese patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The purpose of this mini review is to describe metabolomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its potential in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). In brain injury, patients’ micro dialysis enables detecting biochemical change in brain tissue. Indicators for ischemia were detected such as lactate, pyruvate, glucose, and glutamate. In aSAH patients, the pathophysiology and the factor for poor outcome are not completely understood yet. Routine use of biomarkers in CSF, particularly in aSAH patients, is still lacking. Methods This mini review was performed on the role of metabolomics alterations after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results We identified five clinical studies that addressed metabolomics in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Conclusion There is increasing evidence suggesting that biomarkers can give insight in the pathogenesis and can serve as an outcome predictor. In this mini review, we present a brief overview of metabolomics profiling in neuroscience and wish to discuss the predictive and therapeutic value in aSAH patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nemaline myopathy, the most common of the congenital myopathies, is caused by various genetic mutations. In this study, we attempted to investigate the clinical features, muscle pathology and genetic features of 15 patients with nemaline myopathy. Results Among the 15 patients, there were 9 (60.00%) males and 6 (40.00%) females, and 9 (60.00%) of them came from three families respectively. The age of seeing a doctor ranged from 9 to 52 years old, the age of onset was from 5 to 23 years old, and the duration of disease ranged from 3 to 35 years. Ten out of the 15 patients had high arched palate and elongated face. Only one patient had mild respiratory muscle involvement and none had dysphagia. Muscle biopsies were performed in 9 out of the 15 patients. Pathologically, muscle fibers of different sizes, atrophic muscle fibers and compensatory hypertrophic fibers could be found, and occasionally degenerated and necrotic muscle fibers were observed. Different degrees of nemaline bodies aggregation could be seen in all 9 patients. The distribution of type I and type II muscle fibers were significantly abnormal in patients with nemaline myopathy caused by NEB gene, however, it was basically normal in patients with nemaline myopathy caused by TPM3 gene and ACTA1 gene. Electron microscopic analysis of 6 patients showed that nemaline bodies aggregated between myofibrils were found in 5(83.33%) cases, and most of them were located near the Z band, but no intranuclear rods were found. The gene analysis of 15 NM patients showed that three NM-related genes were harbored, including 11 (73.33%) patients with NEB, 3 (20.00%) patients with TPM3, and 1 (6.67%) patient with ACTA1, respectively. A total of 12 mutation sites were identified and included 10 (83.33%) mutations in exon and 2(16.67%) mutations in intron. Conclusions The clinical phenotype of nemaline myopathy is highly heterogeneous. Muscle pathology shows that nemaline bodies aggregation is an important feature for the diagnosis of NM. NEB is the most frequent causative gene in this cohort. The splicing mutation, c.21522 + 3A &gt; G may be the hotspot mutation of the NEB gene in Chinese NM patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background When shunt dysfunction is suspected, radiation exposure due to X-rays or a CT-scan is inevitable. Less-invasive and more reliable methods are warranted. In this study, we aimed to assess the usability of smartphone-based thermography to detect shunt patency in patients with hydrocephalus. Methods This prospective observational pilot study evaluated the use of smartphone-based video thermography to detect flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the shunt of 51 patients from the Department of Neurosurgery at a tertiary referral institute. Patients with a shunt for hydrocephalus without the suspect of dysfunction were included in the study from December 2021 to May 2022. Results We included 51 patients with a mean age of 53.3 years. Of these patients 14 were male (27.5%) and 37 were female (72.5%). The most frequent cause of the hydrocephalus was the normal pressure hydrocephalus followed by the congenital hydrocephalus. Most patients (96%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, whereas two had a ventriculo-atrial shunt. In total, 43 patient (84%) had a shunt on the right side and 8 patient (16%) had the shunt located on the left side. In 45 patients (88.2%), we observed a clear flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the cooled shunt trajectory. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that in patients with a shunt to treat hydrocephalus, the smartphone-based video thermography may be a safe and simple alternative to show shunt patency without the exposure to radiation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is uncommon but may lead to significant disability. The benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) for ACA occlusions remains uncertain. Methods We included patients treated with EVT and compared patients with ACA occlusions with patients who had internal carotid artery (ICA) or proximal (M1/M2) middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions from the MR CLEAN Registry. Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS). Secondary outcomes were functional independence (mRS 0–2), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, delta-NIHSS (baseline minus NIHSS score at 24–48 h), and successful recanalization (expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) score 2b-3). Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), periprocedural complications, and mortality. Results Of 5193 patients, 11 (0.2%) had primary ACA occlusions. Median NIHSS at baseline was lower in patients with ACA versus ICA/MCA occlusions (11, IQR 9–14; versus 15, IQR 11–19). Functional outcome did not differ from patients with ICA/MCA occlusions. Functional independence was 4/11 (36%) in patients with ACA versus 1949/4815 (41%) in ICA/MCA occlusions; median delta-NIHSS was − 1 (IQR − 7 to 2) and − 4 (IQR − 9 to 0), respectively. Successful recanalization was 4/9 (44%), versus 3083/4787 (64%) in ICA/MCA occlusions. Mortality was 3/11 (27%) versus 1263/4815 (26%). One patient with ACA occlusion had sICH; no other complications occurred. Conclusion In this cohort ACA occlusions were uncommon. Functional outcome did not differ between patients with ACA occlusions and ICA/MCA occlusions. Prospective research is needed to determine feasibility, safety, and outcomes of EVT for ACA occlusions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and purpose Diagnosing Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) is challenging. In contrast to other types of autoimmune encephalitis, HE shows an excellent response to steroid treatment. We aimed to investigate the rates of antithyroid antibodies (ATAs) and probable HE in patients with unexplained mental dysfunction and compare the clinical characteristics between the good- and poor-outcome groups. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging findings of patients admitted to the Department of Neurology of our hospital from March 1, 2006, to February 28, 2023. Using our proposed diagnostic criteria for probable HE, we compared the clinical characteristics between the good- and poor-outcome groups. We also investigated the rates of ATA positivity and probable HE. Results In total, 198 patients exhibited altered mentation, rapidly progressive cognitive decline, or myoclonus. ATA tests were performed on 86 patients, and the detection rates of ATAs and probable HE were 29.1% and 25.6%, respectively. Of the 22 patients enrolled, the good- and poor-outcome groups comprised 19 and 3 patients, respectively. Clinical seizures occurred in seven patients. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus on EEG was observed in six patients, all of whom were intractable to antiepileptic drugs. Nineteen of 21 patients (90.5%) treated with immunosuppressants showed good outcomes. Conclusions HE is a rare clinical disorder, but not as rare as previously thought. When HE is suspected, steroids should be considered the first-line treatment. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are critical to achieve good outcomes in HE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives The aim was to evaluate endolymphatic hydrops in patients with severe Ménière’s disease (MD) before and after vestibular neurectomy to verify if vestibular denervation results in hydrops regression. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging was performed after intravenous gadolinium injection in twenty patients with unilateral definite MD before and after the vestibular neurectomy. Clinical symptoms and audiovestibular tests were evaluated. Follow-up intervals ranged from 18 to 35 months after the surgery. Results Endolymphatic hydrops were visualized in all patients in the preoperative scans. After the vestibular neurectomy, all patients presented a complete resolution of vertigo episodes. Regression of the endolymphatic hydrops was observed in 35% and 15% of cases analyzing cochlea and vestibule, respectively. In 71.43% of patients with utricular herniation into the lateral semicircular canal, withdrawal of the hernia was visualized. Asymmetrical contrast enhancement in the cochlea regressed in 17.64% of cases. Analyzing all the parameters collectively, in 60% of patients, partial regression of at least one of the radiological signs was confirmed in the follow-up examination. No progression of the endolymphatic hydrops was visualized after the surgery in either the cochlea or the vestibule. Conclusions Vestibular neurectomy is an effective treatment, eliminating vertigo attacks and improving the quality of life in patients with MD. Magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear allows visualization of changes in endolymphatic hydrops degree after treatment. Regression of the endolymphatic hydrops after vestibular neurectomy suggests that vestibular denervation may effectively halt the progression of the endolymphatic space dilatation and result in hydrops regression.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a recognized risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely used to treat hypertension. However, the association of RAS inhibitor use with PD has still been an area of controversy. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between RAS inhibitor use and PD. PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published up to Oct 2023. All studies that examined the relationship between RAS inhibitor use and the incidence of PD were included. Seven studies with total 3,495,218 individuals met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Overall, RAS inhibitor use was associated with a reduction in PD risk (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.79-0.98) compared with the controls. When restricted the analysis to individuals with RAS inhibitor use indication, RAS inhibitor exposure was also associated with a decreased risk of PD (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.62-0.92). Pooled results of cohort studies also did support a protective role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.89-1.07) users and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR = 0.8, 95%CI = 0.63-1.02) in PD. Overall, RAS inhibitor use as a class is associated with a reduction in PD risk. However, the findings of ACEIs and ARBs may be limited by small sample size. Future well-designed studies considering the classification by inhibitor type, duration, dose, or property of BBB penetration of RAS inhibitors are needed to clarify the contribution of these exposure parameters on the risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Familial cerebral cavernous malformations (FCCM) is a rare autosomal dominant disease, characterized by vascular malformations that can lead to macro and microhemorrhages. The neurocognitive impact of FCCM is still underrecognized. Methods We report the clinical, neurocognitive, imaging and genetic data of a three generation family with FCCM. Results A 63-year-old man (proband) had progressive memory impairment since the last year. Neurologic exam was unremarkable. Brain MRI showed multiple large cavernomas (mainly in the pons, left temporal, and right temporo-parietal) and scattered microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment mainly revealed left frontal and right temporo-parietal dysfunction. A 41-year-old daughter, presented with headache, vertigo and memory complaints in the last 2 years. Neurological examination revealed left central facial paralysis. Brain MRI showed two small right parietal and internal capsule cavernomas, as well as microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment showed moderate temporal neocortical left dysfunction. A 34-year-old daughter had recurrent headache and memory complaints, with unremarkable neurological exam. Brain MRI revealed two large cavernomas (left fronto-orbitary and inferior temporal), with few microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment was normal. A granddaughter had mild headaches and a small right cerebellar cavernoma, without microhemorrhages. Neuropsychological assessment showed mild temporal neocortical left dysfunction. A nonsense variant, c.55C &gt; T; p.R19* generating a premature stop codon in CCM2 gene shared by all affected family members was identified. Conclusions Neuropsychological evaluation showed that memory complaints and cognitive impairment could be an important unrecognized finding in FCCM. Its pathophysiological mechanisms are still unknown but the role of recurrent microhemorrhages could provide an interesting hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is described in 80% of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Brain focal areas of T2w increased signal intensity on MRI, the so-called Unidentified Bright Objects (UBOs) have been hypothesized to be related to cognitive dysfunction, although conflicting results are available in literature. Here, we investigated the possible relation between UBOs' volume, cognitive impairment, and language disability in NF1 patients. In this retrospective study, clinical and MRI data of 21 NF1 patients (M/F = 12/9; mean age 10.1 ± 4.5) were evaluated. Brain intellectual functioning and language abilities were assessed with specific scales, while the analyzed MRI sequences included axial 2D-T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. These images were used independently for UBOs segmentation with a semiautomatic approach and obtained volumes were normalized for biparietal diameters to take into account for brain volume. Possible differences in terms of normalized UBOs volumes were probed between cognitively affected and preserved patients, as well as between subjects with or without language impairment. Patients cognitively affected were not different in terms of UBOs volume compared to those preserved (p = 0.35 and p = 0.30, for T2-weighted and FLAIR images, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found between patients with and without language impairment (p = 0.47 and p = 0.40, for the two sequences). The relation between UBOs and cognition in children with NF1 has been already investigated in literature, although leading to conflicting results. Our study expands the current knowledge, showing a lack of correlation between UBOs volume and both cognitive impairment and language disability in NF1 patients.",
