    "abstract": "The present guideline on allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) was established by the German allergy societies in conjunction with other scientific and medical societies (dermatology, ear-nose-throat, pediatrics, lung and airway diseases) and a patient support group according to criteria of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is a unique causal treatment of IgE-mediated allergic diseases and induces longterm tolerance to the applied allergens due to numerous immunologic effects. Non-modified allergens are used as aqueous or physically coupled (depot) allergen extracts, chemically modified allergens (allergoids) are used as depot extracts for SCIT. Efficacy of SCIT has been demonstrated for pollen and house dust mite allergens in a large number of studies in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and for animal dander (cat) and mold allergens (Alternaria, Cladosporium) in few studies. SCIT has been well-studied in intermittent and mild persisting IgE-mediated allergic asthma and is recommended as a therapeutic option besides allergen avoidance and pharmacotherapy. Preventive aspects, particularly reduced development of bronchial asthma and less novel allergic sensitizations, are increasingly considered during the decision for SCIT. In case of systemic reactions due to Hymenoptera (bee, wasp) venom allergy SCIT has excellent efficacy and should be continued for at least 3 - 5 years. An extended, sometimes lifelong SCIT, is necessary in a few patients. SCIT is indicated in patients with IgE-mediated sensitizations and corresponding clinical symptoms to allergens which do not permit allergen avoidance and which are available as suitable extracts. Diagnostic procedures, indication and selection of appropriate allergens for SCIT are made by a physician with certified training or qualified knowledge and skills in allergology. Contraindications have to be considered on an individual basis. Injections of SCIT are administered by a physician experienced in this therapy and who is able to perform emergency treatment in case of an allergic adverse event. Patients information and documentation are mandatory previous to the start of SCIT. Children tolerate SCIT very well and benefit especially from its immuno-modulatory effects. Systemic adverse reactions can occur due to SCIT, being rare in case of complete adherence to safety standards. Most adverse events are mild to moderate and easily treatable. Risk factors for and sequels of unwanted systemic effects can effectively be minimized by training the staff members involved, adhering to safety standards and immediate emergency treatment. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an option for adults with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to pollen allergens, particularly if SCIT is not suitable. In house dust mite allergy and allergic asthma, SLIT does not substitute SCIT. Due to the present data, SLIT is not recommended for routine use in children and adolescents. A final conclusion on SLIT for children and adolescents is warranted if further study results are available. Various research fields like allergen characterization, routes of application, adjuvants, updosing regimen and preventive aspects demonstrate new developments in SIT being currently examined for clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Although exact numbers on the prevalence of histamine intolerance are lacking, it seems to be on a rise during the last years. The estimated prevalence the population is 3%. This is particularly true for middle-aged female patients. A deficiency of 1 of the histamine metabolizing enzymes, diamine oxidase (DAO) has been postulated as the main causal factor. Recently, a commercial radioimmunoassay for determination of DAO activity has been launched. To evaluate the clinical impact of this assay for the diagnosis of histamine intolerance, we performed a prospective, multicentre study 207 adult patients. In 77 patients, a diagnosis of histamine intolerance was made based on clinical criteria, 67 a diagnosis in question, and 61 healthy patients without anamnestic evidence for histamine intolerance served as a control. Interestingly, no correlation between diamine oxidase serum levels and clinical status could be found any of the 3 groups. We, therefore, recommend further investigations, before determination of DAO serum activity should be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of histamine intolerance.",

    "abstract": "Detection of allergen-specific IgE represents the most important tool for in vitro diagnostic testing of food allergy. Applied methods vary in design (single allergen sources or mixtures, panel tests, single allergen components) and diagnostic efficacy. High specific IgE to hens egg, cows milk, peanut and fish is associated with an increased risk for clinical reactions, but rarely supersedes oral challenge tests. Cellular tests with basophil leukocytes, demonstrating IgE-mediated sensitizations indirectly, are useful only in selected cases. Particular protein families (i.e. Bet v 1 homologs, lipid transfer proteins and profilins) consist of allergenic molecules with similar sequence and structure. Their shared IgE binding sites form the basis of cross-reactivity. Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD), frequently from plant origin, can also bind IgE being rarely clinically relevant. Allergy to plants (i.e. tree nuts, fruits, legumes) and animals (cows milk, hens egg, fish) is diagnosed with extracts, if their quality is sufficient. Detecting IgE to single allergenic components allows molecule-specific diagnoses, their value varies for each allergen source and single allergen component. Allergen-specific IgE detections are indicated in case of suspected food-allergic reactions despite uncertain history and skin tests, sensitizations to foods not applicable for skin testing, severe reactions to foods, conditions hampering skin testing or its interpretation, and in children. Interpreting should consider incorrect results due to inferior reagents or laboratory errors and clinically irrelevant results due to highly elevated total IgE, low assay thresholds or cross-reactive allergens (errors of interpretation). Positive test results indicate allergen-specific sensitizations, being clinically relevant only in case of corresponding symptoms. The following methods are not useful for diagnosing food allergy: bioresonance, electroacupuncture, kinesiology, cytotoxic food allergy test (methods without validity and/or evidence), lymphocyte stimulation test, food-specific IgG and IgG4 (methods with invalid interpretation).",

    "abstract": "Histamine can induce headaches by s.c. and i.v. injections, oral intake and inhalative administration. The aim of the study was to eliminate headache by following a histamine-free diet in histamine-intolerant patients. A pilot study was performed in 35 patients (29 female, six male, average age 35 years) with an average frequency of headache of 14 days a month. Besides, headache patients reported of diarrhea (16 times), dermatological problems, mostly urticarial reactions (16 times), cardial arrhythmias (9 times) and bronchial asthma (4 times). Twelve out of 29 female patients suffered from menstrual pain. Patients were put on a histamine-free diet for four weeks; then case history concerning severity and frequency of headaches was taken again. Plasma histamine levels and serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity were determined on both visits. Histamine was assessed by radioimmunassay (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Levels lower than 0.3 ng/ml were considered as normal, levels between 0.3 and 0.5 as borderline and levels above 0.5 as elevated. Diamine oxidase (DAO) was determined by the C14 putrescine method as described by Tufvesson and Tryding (1969). At the first visit, plasma histamine was found elevated in 9 of 30 patients, whereas DAO was decreased in 23 of 27 patients. At the second visit, average headache frequency dropped from 14 - 2 days per month; 22 patients were completely free of symptoms, five reported a reduction of more than 50%. Add-on medication with antihistamines prescribed to half of the patients in a randomized manner had no additional effect. While plasma histamine levels did not fall significantly (p = 0.07), a significant rise in DAO activity was noted (p < 0.0001). A subsequent telephone survey 3 to 12 months later revealed deterioration of headaches in three cases and amelioration in five. Thus, only five of the 35 patients did not benefit from the diet at the end of the study. Diet errors were reported by 26 patients, leading to headaches in 20 of them. Culprit foods were chocolate, wine, wine vinegar and salami. This dietary intervention study, although not double-blind and placebo-controlled, shows that avoidance of histamine-rich food may lead to a complete remission of headaches in 63% of the patients and a reduction in headache frequency in another 23%. Due to long-lasting case histories, patients served as their own controls. Performance of a double-blind diet study is difficult. Since placebo success rates rarely exceed 30%, the very high success rate of 86% observed in this study and the reported effects of incidental diet errors strongly argue for a causative role of dietary histamine and other biogenic amines as important headache triggers. The increase in DAO even in four of five non-responders parallels the effect of the histamine-free diet and indicates that causes other than histamine seem to play a role in these patients. Headaches associated with recurrent diarrhea, postprandial rhinitis and other characteristic symptoms of histamine intolerance, should be considered as candidates of choice for a histamine-free diet. Preferentially, however, double-blind placebo-controlled studies should be initiated in specialized headache divisions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only causative method of treatment in the case of IgE-mediated allergic disease. There is extensive literature on the use of SIT in the management of respiratory allergies and insect venom hypersensitivity, but there is a paucity of published data concerning its use as a therapeutic approach in atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted over a period of 12 months in order to evaluate the efficacy of SIT in the management of atopic dermatitis attributable to house dust mites or grass pollens. Methods: A total of 20 patients (5 - 40 years old) with AD and monovalent sensitization to airborne allergens (house dust mites or grass pollens) were enrolled in the study. SIT was performed using aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed allergen preparations administered by subcutaneous injection. Clinical efficacy of the treatment was assessed using the clinical score W-AZS index. Serum concentration of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE were measured, as were various immunological parameters including ECP, SIL-2R, IFN-y, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. Results: The mean value of W-AZS index in the SIT group before treatment was 87.6 ± 15.8 patients, and this decreased to 38.8 ± 34.4 patients after 12 months of therapy (p < 0.01). In the placebo group, the mean W-AZS index before treatment was 86.3 ± 15.7 patients and after 12 months of therapy it increased to 111.9 ± 41.7 patients. Comparative statistical analysis indicated a significant difference between the 2 groups in favor of patients treated with the active allergy vaccines (p < 0.01). Serum levels of specific IgE in the SIT group showed a tendency to decrease, whilst those in the placebo group tended to increase. Serum concentrations of selected immunological parameters including ECP, SIL-2R, IFN-y, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 were monitored before and after treatment, but did not show significant differences. Conclusion: Allergen-specific immunotherapy appeared to be an effective method of treatment for atopic dermatitis as judged by significant improvement in clinical index in cases with well-documented IgE-mediated allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is considered as the only causal treatment of IgE-mediated allergies apart from allergen avoidance. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, efficacy and tolerability of a preseasonal short-term immunotherapy with 4 injections was evaluated in patients with tree-pollen allergy. Eighty-four patients with clinically relevant seasonal allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and/or asthma sensitised to birch/alder/hazel pollen were enrolled. The active group received 4 injections of L-tyrosine-adsorbed tree pollen allergoids plus 50 μg/ml monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL; n = 57). The placebo injections consisted ofL-tyrosine-solution (2%) in excipient solution (n = 27). The combined symptom-/medication score served as a primary endpoint. Changes in skin reactivity measured by titrated skin prick test and blood levels of pollen-specific IgG and IgE antibodies served as secondary endpoints. There was a significant advantage in favour of the active treatment for the combined symptom-/medication score (p = 0.028). Titrated skin prick testing revealed a significant reduction of skin sensitivity after therapy (p < 0.01) and a significant decrease of mean sum of wheal areas in the active group compared to placebo (p = 0.03). Already 2 weeks after active treatment, levels of specific IgG rose significantly (p < 0.01). An increase of specific IgE during and after pollen season was only observed in the placebo group (p < 0.01). The tolerability of the therapy was good. There were no reports of serious or severe adverse events. In this study, the efficacy and tolerability of a short-term immunotherapy with 4 injections was shown. The application of this short-term therapy may improve acceptance by patients and encourage wider application of SIT in the treatment of IgE-mediated allergies.",

    "abstract": "Hintergrund: Eine Nahrungsmittelunvertraglichkeit kann durch einen verminderten enzymatischen Histaminabbau aufgrund einer verringerten Aktivitat der Diaminoxidase (DAO) induziert sein (Histaminintoleranz (HIT)). Zielsetzung: Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es herauszufinden, ob die DAO-Aktivitat im Serum bei Patienten, deren Vorgeschichte eine HIT vermuten lasst, im Vergleich zu Patienten ohne eine Vorgeschichte mit HIT signifikant verringert ist. Methoden: Untersucht wurden 61 Patienten und 20 Kontrollen. Bei 26 Patienten (schwere HIT) lag eine Vorgeschichte mit mindestens zwei typischen HIT-Symptomen in Zusammenhang mit der Aufnahme von mindestens zwei histaminreichen Nahrungsmitteln vor. Bei 35 Patienten (masige HIT) war nach der Aufnahme von mindestens einem histaminreichen Nahrungsmittel mindestens ein HIT-Symptom aufgetreten. Die 20 gesunden Kontrollen zeigten keinerlei HIT-Symptome. Die Patienten wurden zur Art der klinischen Symptome und zum Zusammenhang der Symptome mit der Aufnahme der Nahrungsmittel befragt. Die DAO-Aktivitat im Serum wurde mittels ELISA analysiert. Ergebnisse: Es konnten keine Unterschiede bezuglich der DAO-Konzentration im Serum zwischen den Gruppen festgestellt werden. Schlussfolgerung: Basierend auf der Anamnese mit allergieahnlichen Symptomen nach Aufnahme von histaminreichen Nahrungsmitteln bietet die Bestimmung der DAO-Aktivitat im Serum in der alltaglichen klinischen Praxis keine Hilfestellung fur die Diagnose einer HIT.",

    "abstract": "diagnosis of contact sensitization relies on patch testing. selection of allergens to be applied is a crucial aspect. In principle, those (and only those) allergens should be tested which can be regarded as suspects based on the individual patients history. However, suspicion does not only rely on individual history. Those allergens which have proven to be frequent sensitizers in large-scale patch test studies may be important in the case in question, too. This is the rationale of the Baseline series. These series are useful to diagnose contact sensitization which was initially not suspected based on the history. composition of the Baseline series thus depends on the descriptive statistics of the most frequent contact sensitizers. This implies that the composition should adapt to a pattern of allergen exposure which may change over time and which may differ between countries. Baseline series of the DKG underwent significant changes in the last 20 years. These comprise the inclusion of new allergens, the exclusion of obsolete allergens or the adaption of concentration or vehicle to new evidence. While there is a considerable amount of variation among the allergens included in the Baseline series, a certain set of allergens seems to be of secular importance. Previous and current analyses of the IVDK on the other hand show that the Baseline series only diagnoses about 42% of all contact sensitizations. Thus, in each case the application of additional test series should be contemplated. However, in times of dwindling health care resources it should be stressed that the application of the patch test Baseline series must be considered as the minimal standard and that according to Calnan: The greatest abuse of patch testing is failure to use it.",

    "abstract": "Once the diagnosis of food allergy is established by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, the only proven therapy is a strict elimination diet. Special food exclusion diets exist that allow patients to avoid food allergens while maintaining a good quality of life. If the allergen provokes anaphylactic reactions, the restriction diet has to be combined with the prescription of an emergency medication (antihistamine, corticosteroid, adrenaline). As symptomatic food allergy is often lost over time, food challenges can be repeated at intervals of 1 - 2 years under monitored conditions. Immunotherapy with food extracts should only be used in controlled studies for the treatment of food hypersensitivity. Concerning their associated food allergy, patients with tree pollen illergy may profit from a specific immunotherapy with tree pollen extract. An induction of oral tolerance using increasing amounts of raw food is only useful in selected, highly compliant patients and in instances of not reliably avoidable foods. Antihistamines may partially mask symptoms of oral allergy syndrome and IgE-mediated skin symptoms. In allergic reactions with gastrointestinal disorders, cromoglycate might be used for a short time. Alternative therapies such as rotation diets, electroacupuncture or bioresonance should be disapproved.",

    "abstract": "Tick bite-induced IgE-mediated reactions to the oligosaccharide galactose α-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) are increasingly recognized. This study investigated alpha-gal sensitization in three groups with different tick bite exposure.Specific IgE antibodies to alpha-gal and total IgE were investigated in 485 patients with Lyme borreliosis with different disease manifestations and compared to a control group of 200 randomly selected patients without increased exposure to tick bites. A group of 232 hunters and forest workers served as a model for multiple tick bites.Specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies to alpha-gal (> 0.1 kU/L) were found in 12.6% of all borreliosis samples compared to the control group with 9% (relative risk 1.4; 95% CI 0.85 - 2.3; not significant (n.s.). The highest prevalence of sIgE to alpha-gal was observed in hunters and forest service employees (22.8%, relative risk 2.5; 95% CI 1.5 - 4.2; p < 0.001). Higher age and elevated total IgE were also associated with alpha-gal sensitization.IgE sensitization to alpha-gal tends to be more frequent in tick-exposed patients with borreliosis than in controls (n.s.). Moreover, hunters and forest workers show an even higher rate of elevated IgE to alpha-gal. Thus, frequent tick contact may result in alpha-gal sensitization. In the area of Munich, the prevalence of alpha-gal sensitization appears lower than in the state of Baden-Württemberg and lower than in the USA, which may be due to the difference in tick species or the frequency of tick exposure. This study could show that alpha-gal sensitization and presumably alpha-gal syndrome does not seem to be a modern problem but existed already more than 30 years ago.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis in children is underestimated. In the first years of life it is often confused with other types of dermatitis, such as atopic eczema. In fact, contact sensitisation may be found in 13.3 - 24.5% of randomly selected children; moreover, 56.5-94.4% of the positive test results are clinically relevant. There are convincing data that sensitisation to common contact allergens may occur already in the first months of life, and that contact allergy is more common among children under 3 years than in older children and adults. A meta-analysis of 23 epidemiological studies comprising altogether 2794 randomly selected children and 5705 children with suspicion of contact dermatitis has shown that sensitization appears most commonly to nickel (8.3% of random children and 19.2% of children with dermatitis), thimerosal (2.1% and 14.0% respectively), cobalt (1.9% and 13.5%), fragrances (1.7% and 11.8%), chromium (1.5% and 12.4%), Kathon CG (1.4% and 21.0%), lanolin (0.7% and 12.1%) and balsam of Peru (0.5% and 10.8%). This suggests that patch testing should be included into the diagnostic routine in children with dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "Intolerance reactions to acetylsalicylacids (ASA) (e.g. in Aspirin) and to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have first been described by Widal et al. in 1922 and show a classic triad of symptoms (Samters triad): chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, bronchial asthma and hypersensitivity to ASA, respectively Aspirin. In recent years, clear evidence has been found that ASA intolerance is likely to be mediated by a deviation of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway toward excessive leukotriene (LT) production. Apart from surgical procedures, the treatment of ASA intolerance is based on medical therapy and ASA desensitization. ASA desensitization represents the only specific treatment that can be offered to ASA-intolerant patients. In classic ASA desensitization, gradually ascending doses of NSAIDs are given by oral application. This study was initiated to evaluate the possible side effects by using the intravenous route for the ascending doses in ASA desensitization. We investigated 36 patients (20 females, 16 males) aging from 20 - 64 years (34.3 ± 6.9 years) on behalf of side effects of intravenous ASA desensitization during the dose-increase phase. The total amount of systemic reactions observed was n = 27 or 6.6% of all therapeutic doses. Of those, 20 (74%) were classified as immediate reactions, 6 (22%) were late-phase reactions and 1 (4%) was a combined immediate and late-phase reaction. Of all systemic reactions, 81% were 1 st degree reactions and 19% 2nd degree reactions. Reactions of the 3rd or 4th degree have not been seen. Together, our study clearly demonstrates that the intravenous route for the ascending phase of ASA desensitization is a safe procedure without severe complications. Our study reveals the methodical feasibility of the intravenous route for the dose-increase phase of ASA desensitization. These data suggest that the rate of systemic side effects is not higher compared to the peroral route. A clinical benefit of the procedure might be the opportunity of interrupting the ASA application by stopping the infusion therapy in case of (beginning) systemic reactions. More studies are warranted to investigate the intravenous application concerning its safety aspects and comparability to the peroral application in the early phase of therapy.",

    "abstract": "Allergenic epitopes may consist of classical peptide epitopes or carbohydrate determinants. In contrast to peptide epitopes, glycan epitopes may share significant structural elements with allergens of other, nonrelated protein families. Therefore, they are responsible for cross-reactions between completely different allergen sources, for example plant-derived pollen and insect venoms, meaning that they behave like pan-epitopes. Most allergens reveal a glycan-associated IgE reactivity, particularly allergens of plant origin. IgE reactivity towards pollen-associated food allergens may be due to CCD. The detection of anti-CCD-IgE is specific and truly positive, it does, however, mostly not correlate with the patients history. Originally this was thought to be associated with low affinity binding and a poor biological activity of anti-CCD-IgE. However, most recently, it has been shown that low binding affinity of anti-CCD-IgE cannot be the reason for the disputed clinical significance of IgE against plant or insect glycan epitopes. The affinity of IgG to CCDs is higher than to protein allergens, and it may, therefore, function as blocking antibody. It has been hypothesized that the regular consumption of CCD via plant food may induce CCD-tolerance. However, there is evidence that for single individuals anti-CCD-IgE play an important role in the development of the clinical reactions. The presence of anti-CCD-IgE has to be suspected when there is a discrepancy between skin test and in vitro diagnostic results and there is IgE positivity towards several plant allergens. In these cases, a CCD-containing allergen should be added as screening allergen to the automated in vitro diagnostic systems, for example, horse radish peroxidase, bromelain, ascorbat oxidase. MUXF is an isolated CCD from bromelain without the protein component and is already commercially available as MUXF-Immuno CAP. If possible, an inhibition assay with the applied CCD screening allergen should subsequently be performed to further increase test specificity.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility of diagnostic patch testing is an important quality criterion which has been addressed by several studies. The reanalysis presented utilises data of a previous study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) on the synchronous left versus right reproducibilty of patch testing with 10 allergens of the standard series, quantifying reproducibility with Cohen's K coefficient. The degree of concordance between dichotomised reactions at 72 hours (positive versus not positive) varies between allergens. The K coefficient was 0.80 and above for nickel sulphate, p-phenyl-enediamine, cobalt chloride and balsam of Peru, while for the two allergens tested in water, i.e., (chloro-) methylisothiazolinone and formaldehyde, it was below 0.70. Longer patch test exposure (48 hours compared to 24 hours) mostly improved concordance, which was, however, a significant effect only for potassium dichromate (p < 0,05). For the evaluation of concordance between chemically related allergens in terms of cross-reactivity, a quotient between the K coefficient found with the related allergens and the K coefficient found with the marker allergen involved (with synchronous duplicate application) is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Patients intolerant to histamine-containing foods (histamine intolerance) frequently suffer from diminished histamine degradation based on deficiency or reduced activity of the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). Here, we present an easy-to-use, commercially available test kit for the quantification of DAO activity in blood. Radiolabeled putrescine is added as a substrate to 100 μl of plasma or serum. DAO converts one amino group to an aldehyde. The resulting molecule spontaneously reacts to cyclic Δ 1 -pyrroline which can be extracted selectively by ethylacetate. With an optimized buffer system, we could improve the yield of extractable reactants four-fold compared to previous systems. A calibration curve with DAO from porcine kidney is used for quantification. Intraassay variation is < 10% (3.5 - 14%,n = 20), interassay variation is < 15% (4 - 21%, n = 10). Mean recovery of DAO added to samples was 104% (86 - 123%, n = 20). Results are available within three hours. DAO activity in samples was stable at 4 °C for one week, storage at -20 °C with repeated freeze cycles did not affect activity. This assay is a reliable tool for the determination of blood DAO activity and is a helpful tool in the diagnosis of non-allergic food hypersensitivities. Due to the good stability of DAO, blood samples may be drawn in the doctors office and shipped to the diagnostic lab.",

    "abstract": "Acute intolerance reactions to aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are referred to as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), a nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction with potentially anaphylactoid character. AERD is essentially based on a continuous and progressive subclinical airway inflammation, due to an altered arachidonic acid metabolism. Intake of COX-1 inhibitors induces an excessive production of leukotrienes due to an insufficient and dysbalanced production of prostaglandin E 2 . Clinically, the resulting reactions comprise attacks of rhinitis and asthma. Todays gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of AERD is provocation testing with COX-1 inhibitors. However, due to the potentially severe complications resulting from provocation testing, it should only be performed in centers with suitable emergency facilities. Based on the known pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease during the last decade, many attempts have been made to establish a reliable in vitro testing approach to substitute provocation testing. Current assays can be classified according to the underlying methodology: mediator release assays, tests based on flow cytometry, or combinations of these methods. Accordingly, the present article reviews existing mediator release assays: the cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST), the Analgetikaintoleranztest (AIT), and the aspirin-sensitive patients identification test (ASPItest) as well as tests based on flow-cytometric quantification of CD63 expression (CAST-Flow, Basotest), and the hybrid test system CAST-Combi. Based on the most recent data concerning their sensitivity and specificity, the review provides an overview on the current status of this challenging field of in vitro diagnostic testing.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sodium cromoglycate (SCG) and the short-acting β2-agonist reproterol are known to protect from exercise-induced asthma (EIA), though not completely. As a result of previous studies it may be suggested that thecombined application of both single drugs provide enhanced bronchodilating and bronchoprotective effects in specific and non-specific provocation models by a yet not well understood mechanism. Objective: The aim of the study therefore, was to assess the superior protective effect of fixed drug combination (2 puffs each containing 1 mg SCG and 0.5 mg reproterol) compared to both single drugs and to their combined application (free combination) in 6-18 years old patients with proven exercise-induced asthma. Method: The study was performed in a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-period cross-over fashion. The primary variable was the overall protective effect which was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline FEV 1 before exercise (t - -5 min) to post exercise (t= 20 min). The study was conducted using an adaptive test plan with two interim analyses. The confirmatory comparison was done using one-factorial analysis of variance with repeated measurements with factor treatment The global level of significance was at alpha = 0.025 (one-sided). The first interim analysis was performed after 16 patients had completed the study. Based on the results for FEV 1 the null hypothesis could be rejected. Accordingly, recruitment was stopped after completion of the 5th random block including a total of 20 patients. Results: It could be shown that the protective effect of the combination of SCG and reproterol in fixed and free combination was statistically significant superior (p < 0.01) to each single drug. without differences between the two forms of combination (fixed or free). Conclusion: A superior protective efficacy of the fixed drug combination of SCG and reproterol compared to each of the single drugs could be observed in patients with exercise-induced asthma. This result confirms previous findings, suggesting a synergistic bronchoprotective effect by adding SCG to reproterol. However, the mode of action is not yet understood.",

    "abstract": "The following guideline of the Arbeits-gruppe Nahrungsmittelallergie der DGAKI und des ADA (Task Force on Food Allergy of the German Society for Allergology and Clinical Immunology and the Medical Association of German Allergologists) summarizes different procedures, when food allergy is suspected in atopic dermatitis (neurodermatitis, atopic eczema). The problem is clinically relevant because many patients assume allergic reactions against foods being responsible for triggering eczematous reactions or worsening eczema. It is important to identify such patients who indeed benefit from an elimination diet and to avoid unnecessary diets. Elimination diets (especially in early childhood) are associated with the risk of malnutrition and additional emotional stress for the patients. The gold standard for the diagnosis of food-dependent reactions is to perform placebo-controlled, double-blind oral food challenges because specific IgE, prick tests and anamnestic data often do not correlate with clinical reactivity. This is particularly true in the case of delayed eczematous skin reactions. The instrument of diagnostic elimination diets should be used before an oral provocation test. If multiple sensitizations against foods are discovered in a patient, an oligoallergenic diet and a subsequent stepwise supplementation of the nutrition should be performed. If a specific food is suspected of triggering food allergy, oral provocation should be performed after a diagnostic elimination diet. As eczematous skin reactions may develop slowly (i.e., within one or two days), we recommend that the skin is inspected the day after the provocation test and that a repetitive test should be performed if the patient has not reacted to a given food on the first day of oral provocation. The guideline discusses various clinical situations for patients with atopic dermatitis, allowing for differentiated diagnostic procedures.",

    "abstract": "A 40-year-old female farmer is described, with a rare coexistence of 4 different occupational diseases sharing one common cause: allergy to cow epithelium (Bos domesticus). First symptoms started after 6 years of working on the farm. The allergic diseases appeared in the following sequence: rhinitis, protein contact dermatitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, and finally contact urticaria. The time span between the first and the last allergic manifestation to develop was 9 years. By the time of examination, 4 shock organs (the upper and lower airway, conjunctivae and the skin) were involved. Skin prick tests with common aeroallergens, farm animals, pets, and agricultural dusts were all negative, total IgE was within normal range (90 kU/l). Intracutaneous test and bronchial provocation with cow epithelium allergens were both positive. Specific IgE was detected to cow dander (CAP class 3) but not to bovine serum albumin (CAP 0). A positive reaction to goat dander (i.c. positive, CAP 2) was interpreted as a cross reactivity, because the patient never had contact with goats. The article also reviews known sources of cow allergens and occupations at risk. Besides farmers and veterinary surgeons, also butchers, cheese makers, bakers, cooks, laboratory workers and even beauticians may be at risk for developing occupational allergy to cow allergens.",

    "abstract": "The clinical impact of allergen tight mattress encasings has still been debated. Beside encasings, recommended measures include the use of HEPA filter in the vacuum cleaner, reducing the humidity by increased ventilation rate and weekly change of bed linen. Materials and methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of mattress covers (VarioProtect encasings, Sanders, Germany). We included 30 patients with rhinitis or asthma due to house dust mite allergy of which 26 completed the study. At an initial visit for evaluation of the inclusion criteria, patients received a hygrometer and were seen 4 additional times for blood sampling and delivery of the active cover and later the placebo cover (cotton cover) or vice versa. Both study phases lasted 9 - 11 weeks, the wash-out period in-between lasted 2 - 10 weeks to avoid any interference with pollen allergy. At the patients' homes, a study-independent person collected dust samples which were analyzed for house dust mite allergen using an immunodot assay with monoclonal antibodies against the house dust mite allergen Der p 1, Der f 1 and mite group 2. For the evaluation of allergen content, the sum of the 3 allergens was used. Serum eosinophil cationic protein was measured to define the underlying allergic inflammation. Subjective clinical complaints regarding rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma were asked using a standardized questionnaire by E. Juniper. All patients were informed to wash their bed linen weekly and to increase the level of air exchange. A score for medication intake was calculated and the sleeping comfort with the active or placebo covers was evaluated. Results: A statistically significant reduction of the allergen content from 1.43 μg/m 2 /2 min to 0.65 μg/m 2 /2 min was found after using the active cover, but not after using the placebo cover (1.49 μg/m 2 /2 min). The measurement of the relative humidity in the air revealed no change throughout the study. At the beginning of the study, 49.5% relative humidity was measured, at the end of the study in summer time 64.3% were measured. The clinical complaints did not significantly change comparing both groups (active/placebo or placebo/active). A carry-over effect could be excluded since baseline values were similar. Pooling all data for the subjective rhinitis score revealed a statistically significant decrease in all 26 patients receiving either placebo or active treatment. In 8 patients with an elevated serum ECP level (> 16 μg/l), an amelioration of rhinitis could be seen in the active phase compared to the placebo phase. In addition, 12 patients with asthma reported fewer symptoms using the active cover compared with the placebo cover. After the active cover phase, 6 of the 8 patients with elevated ECP had a lower level of ECP, while 6 patients with the placebo cover had a higher level of ECP (p < 0.025). The medication intake was reduced during the active phase as well as during the placebo phase. The general comfort using the active cover was good with the exception of some rustling. The data confirm the clinical efficacy of allergen impermeable covers: an allergen reduction as well as a clinical relieve can be achieved, whereby the patients with elevated ECP may be particularly susceptible to allergen avoidance measurements.",

Bei Kindern und Jugendlichen sind sie die haufigsten Ausloser schwerer allergischer Reaktionen, bei Erwachsenen stehen sie nach Insektengiften und Medikamenten an dritter Stelle. Im Anaphylaxie-Register werden seit Juli 2006 anaphylaktische Reaktionen aus Deutschland, Osterreich und der Schweiz gemeldet. Aktuell sind 78 Kliniken und Schwerpunktpraxen angebunden. Von Juli 2006 bis Februar 2009 wurden 1.165 anaphylaktische Reaktionen registriert. In der Gruppe der Kinder und Jugendlichen (n = 197, 3 Monate – 17 Jahre alt) stellten die Nahrungsmittel mit 58% den haufigsten Ausloser dar. Bei Erwachsenen (n = 968, 18 – 85 Jahre alt) lagen Nahrungsmittel an dritter Stelle (16,3%) nach Insektengiften und Medikamenten. Bei Kindern und Jugendlichen waren am haufigsten Hulsenfruchte (31%), vor allem Erdnusse ursachlich, gefolgt von Nussen (25%) mit Haselnussen als haufigstem Ausloser. Bei den Erwachsenen fuhrte Obst (13,4%) am haufigsten zur Anaphylaxie. Tierprodukte (12,2%) wurden am zweithaufigsten als Ursache angegeben, besonders haufig wurden Krustazeen und Mollusken genannt. Bei den nahrungsmittelabhangigen Anaphylaxien wurde mindestens ein Kofaktor bei 39% der Erwachsenen und 14% der Kinder und Jugendlichen angegeben. Bei den Erwachsenen waren die haufigsten Kofaktoren mit 22% Medikamente und bei 10% korperliche Anstrengung, wahrend bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bei 8,7% korperliche Anstrengung und bei 2,6% Medikamente angegeben wurden. Begleitende Erkrankungen aus dem atopischen Formenkreis lagen bei Kindern und Jugendlichen bei 78% und bei Erwachsenen bei 67% vor. Die Nahrungsmittelanaphylaxie unterscheidet sich bei Kindern und Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen im Ausloserprofil und zeigt in Bezug auf Kofaktoren und Begleiterkrankungen Unterschiede. Eine differenzierte Analyse ermoglicht es, perspektivisch Risikofaktoren der Anaphylaxie zu identifizieren.",

    "abstract": "Parabens are commonly used preservatives in topical preparations, including cosmetics, in medicines, and in food. They are capable of inducing contact sensitisation, especially in patients with stasis dermatitis. Between 1990 and 1994, a mix containing 5 parabens (benzyl-, butyl-, ethyl-, methyl- and propylparaben, 3% each) was used for diagnostic patch testing. Of 23025 patients tested with this mix, 1.6% had positive test reactions. In break-down testing with single constituents (tested with 3%) mainly benzyl paraben, which was not tested (and not used) due to possible carcinogenic risk any more, and propyl caused positive test reactions (in 10 of 184 and 13 of 616 patients, respectively). The sensitivity of the mix with regard to detecting contact allergy to one (or more) of the constituents was 88% and specifity 96%; however, the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 23%, i.e., about 3/4 false-positive reactions occurred. In a subsequent study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) 1286 patients were patch tested with the above mentioned mix, which had to be replaced, and 2 mixes (4 x 3% and 4 x 4%) containing the remaining parabens; positive reactions were observed in 2.1%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively. The sensitivity of the new mixes was lower (47% and 53%, resp.), however, the PPV (44% and 42%, resp.) was more acceptable. Between 1995 and 2000 altogether 51260 patients were patch tested with the standard series, including the 4 x 4% paraben-mix in the IVDK centres, with 1.5% positive reactions. Break-down testing was performed in 1270 of these. The diagnostic performance of the mix found here (sensitivity: 78%, PPV: 44%) was similar to that in the DKG-study. In conclusion, patch testing with parabens is still difficult, in particular, as several paraben paradoxes hamper the application of a valid gold standard (e.g., a repeated open application test [ROAT] on uninvolved skin) when judging patch test reactions. Despite these limitations in risk assessment, parabens can be regarded as relatively safe, although this benefit is somewhat limited by the necessity to add other - potentially more sensitising - biocides to achieve adequate protection against microbial decay in some products.",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent soy allergy in Central Europe is based on birch pollen-related cross reactions. Due to structure similarities of birch pollen major allergen Bet v 1 and soy allergen Gly m 4, 75% of birch pollen-allergic subjects show serological IgE-mediated cross reactions to the soy protein Gly m 4 from the family of Bet v 1 -homologue, pathogenesis-related (PR)-10 proteins. Interestingly, only 10% of birch pollen-allergic patients develop clinical symptoms after ingestion of non- or slighty processed soy products (soy flakes, soy milk, tofu, diatery powders with soy isolate). Predominantly local oropharyngeal symptoms can lead to massive and severe swellings of throat or facial areas with dramatic severity. In addition, systemic reactions with urticarial, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms have been described. A typical case history of reactions with quick onset after ingestion of mildly processed soy products together with a strong allergic sensitization to birch pollen represent highly suggestive diagnostic clues. Native soy products are more useful for skin testing than commercial soy extracts due to labile Gly m 4 and its low abundance of 0.01 - 0.1% in total soy protein. For the same reason crude soy extracts are not sensitive enough for allergen-specific IgE detection in case of suspected Gly m 4-induced soy allergy. Recently introduced recombinant Gly m 4 is superior in demonstrating specific IgE. In case of established birch pollen-associated, clinically relevant soy allergy non- or hardly processed soy products should be avoided. Subsequent declaration of soy products about potential risks for birch pollen-allergic subjects might be helpful for future avoidance and instant diagnosis of the usually unexpected reactions. Heated and strongly processed products like soy sauce, textured soy proteins, roasted soy beans or soy oil are unlikely to represent inherent risks due to their low Gly m 4 content. Soy allergy on the basis of birch pollen-related crossreactions should be publicized more frequently.",

    "abstract": "Lupine (Lupinus albus) belongs to the family of the legumes (Leguminosae) and, therefore, demonstrates strong cross-reactivity with peanuts, chickpeas and white beans. Due to the high protein and lipid content, lupine flour is extensively used in food industry. It is added to cereal flours and used as emulsifier. Concomitant with the increasing intake of lupine, a rising prevalence of allergic reactions after ingestion as well as inhalation of lupine flour has been observed. We here present a patient with known severe peanut allergy who reacted after eating a pizza with severe respiratory symptoms, which required an intubation in the emergency room. Our investigations revealed that the pizza dough used in this take-away pizza was enriched with lupine flour. The sensitization to lupine could be proven by means of the skin prick test (SPT) with native lupine flour and also serologically as 44.30 kU/l (class 4) of specific IgE antibodies were measured by means of CAP-FEIA to lupine seed (f335, Pharmacia Diagnostics). A peanut contamination of the pizza was excluded by the manufacturer as well as by analysis in an immunoassay. IgE binding to major proteins at 20, 34, 60 and 62 kDa was detected by means of immunoblotting. In inhibition experiments, IgE-binding to lupine proteins was partially inhibited by peanut extract. Shortly after that first observation of a lupine allergy, a patient was admitted to our clinic who experienced allergic reactions including edema in the face and abdominal pain after ingestion of gingerbread that was declared to contain lupine flour. Apart from a slight pollinosis in childhood, the patient had no history of allergic reactions and no history of food allergy at all. She revealed a positive reaction to lupine flour in skin prick test and was positive for specific IgE against lupine flour in CAP-FEIA (class 3; 7.59 kU/l). Contrary to the first case, the IgE binding to lupine flour was not inhibited by peanut extract. On the basis of our observations in the two patients and further cases described in the literature, we conclude that allergic reactions to lupine can be mediated by cross-reacting IgE antibodies to peanut, chickpea and white beans or may occur due to an isolated sensitization as well. Because of the increasing use of lupine flour in the food industry and its high allergenic properties, lupine flour should be regarded as a highly allergenic food. Similar to peanut and soy, lupine should be added to the list of allergenic foods of the EU and Swiss Food Regulation that have to be mandatory declared.",

    "abstract": "Chronic urticaria, recurrent angioedema and non-allergic asthma may be due to pseudoallergic reactions to food ingredients. For atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms the role of these non-allergic reactions is discussed controversially. Pseudoallergic reactions can be elicited by food additives as well as naturally occurring food components. An altered histamine metabolism may be associated with pseudoallergy. Extensive diagnostic measures are not indicated for an acute urticaria or a short episode of angioedema. Only when symptoms become chronic or at least intermittent, basic diagnostic measures are justified. If this procedure is unsuccessful, pseudoallergy to food components should be considered as a causative factor. In order to confirm this suspicion, patients should adhere to a low pseudoallergen diet for 3 weeks. During this period, a daily documentation of symptoms is recommended. As the underlying pathomechanism is not IgE-mediated, skin and blood tests are not useful for diagnosis. After apparent improvement or remission of symptoms, the causative role of a low pseudoallergen diet can be proven by re-exposure to foods rich in pseudoallergens over 2 days. As food additives only play a minor role in pseudoallergic reactions, a mixture of relevant food additives can be given at one time in most patients. Patients with asthma bronchiale or a history of anaphylactoid reactions should be challenged with single food additives in increasing doses. If adverse reactions to histamine are suspected, an oral provocation with histamine dihydrochloride is recommended. For patients with respiratory symptoms inhalant challenge tests are suggested. Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge is recommended if the patient suffers from gastrointestinal symptoms only and pseudoallergy is suspected.",

    "abstract": "As published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming is a reality and its impact is huge like the increase of extreme weather events, glacier recession, sea level rise and also effects on human health. Among them allergies to airborne pollen might increase or change in pattern due to the invasion of new allergic plants or due to different behavior of plants like earlier flowering. In this study we used the longest Swiss airborne pollen data set to examine the influence of the temperature increase on the time of flowering. In the case of Basel, where pollen data for 39 years are available, it was shown that due to a temperature increase the start of flowering in the case of birch occurred about 13 days earlier. Apart from a shift of the start of the flowering there is also a trend to higher annual birch pollen quantities and an increase in the daily maximal pollen concentration. Due to global warming and because symptoms might appear earlier in the year people suffering from a pollen allergy might face a new unaccustomed situation.",

    "abstract": "Urtikaria ist eine haufige Erkrankung. Die Lebenszeitpravalenz fur Urtikaria liegt bei nahezu 20%. Urtikaria verursacht nicht nur eine Einschrankung der Lebensqualitat, sondern beeinflusst auch die Leistungsfahigkeit bei der Arbeit und in der Schule und zahlt daher zur Gruppe der schweren allergischen Erkrankungen. Diese Leitlinie umfasst die Definition und Klassifikation der Urtikaria unter Einbeziehung der wesentlichen Fortschritte in der Erforschung der Ursachen, auslosenden Faktoren und Pathomechanismen dieser Erkrankung. Daruber hinaus befasst sie sich mit evidenzbasierten Strategien zur okonomischen Diagnostik der verschiedenen Unterformen der Urtikaria. Die optimale Therapie der Urtikaria ist von enormer Wichtigkeit fur die Patienten und sehr komplex. Sie wird daher in einer separaten Leitlinie behandelt. Diese deutschsprachige Leitlinie wurde auf der Basis der internationalen englischsprachigen, durch die UEMS (EuropeanUnion of Medical Specialists) anerkannten Leitlinie unter besonderer Berucksichtigung der medizinischen Gegebenheiten im deutschsprachigen Raum erstellt. Diese Leitlinie ist zusammen mit der Schwesterleitlinie zur Therapie der Urtikaria das Ergebnis eines Konsensus, der auf einer Podiumsdiskussion beim 3. Internationalen Konsensusmeeting zur Urtikaria, der „Urticaria 2008“, erzielt wurde. Die „Urticaria 2008“ war eine gemeinsame Initiative der Sektion Dermatologie der EAACI (European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology), des EU-geforderten Network of Excellence GA2LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network), des EDF (European Dermatology Forum) und der WAO (World Allergy Organization). Zum ersten Mal wurde hier, bei ausreichender Beweislage, die Grading-of-Recommendations-Assessment-Development-and-Evaluation(GRADE)-Methode mit Modifikationen so weit moglich verwendet.",

    "abstract": "Allergens from Ricinus communis (castor bean) are among the most potent allergens causing type I allergy in humans. Patients are usually exposed to the allergen at work or by living in the vicinity ofcastor bean processing farms. Several, even epidemic asthma outbreaks have been described in occupational workers; however, allergens of Ricinus can elicit allergic symptoms even in individuals who have only occasional and non-occupational contact with castor bean seeds or pollen. There are two known forms of castor bean 2S albumin allergens, Ric c 1 and Ric c 3. In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of a number of allergenic 2S albumin isoforms present in castor bean seeds. At least 9 different but biochemically related 2S albumin polypeptides were identified. The allergenic potential of the 9 different albumin fractions was analyzed by PCA tests and by ELISA experiments. Seven fractions showed clear biological activity, similar to the activity of the 2S albumin pool. Our results demonstrate that there is a large variety of allergenic albumin isoforms present in castor bean seeds. These studies could contribute to improve the reliability of in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: During the last years, increasing numbers of proton pump inhibitors have been introduced into the market and the range of indications for which they are used has expanded. In this context, also the reports on allergic reactions, particularly immediate type reactions, to representatives of this group have increased. Next to some single case reports on vasculitis, erythematous, bullous or exfoliative dermatitis and others, there are escalating numbers of reports on anaphylactoid reactions to omeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole. So far, the diagnostic procedures have not been evaluated. Patients: We report on six patients with immediate-type hypersensitivity to pantoprazole, who underwent skin prick tests, intracutaneous tests and CAST as well as LTT. Results; All these test procedures were not useful as there were false positive as well as false negative results, therefore, skin tests and laboratory investigations were not sensitive enough. So far, provocation tests are still the gold standard. Conclusion; Currently, accidental reexposures or controlled provocation tests are the most reliable tools in the clinical diagnosis of these reactions. This may be due to the fact that proton pump inhibitors are rapidly metabolized by the gastric parietal cells to a sulfonamide derivative. As one explanation, the hypersensitivity reaction may occur to the metabolite and not to the parent drug. However, experienced physicians should only do provocation tests under intensive surveillance conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Anaphylaxis is an acute generalized hypersensitivity reaction initiated by various triggers which involves the entire organism and which may be life threatening. Although international guidelines for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis have been published, the therapeutic recommendations are implemented differently. In this study besides the etiology of anaphylaxis, we were interested in how and where the patients have been treated and whether or not this reaction did occur for the first time. Methods: From January 1 to December 31 of 2008 1,075 patients have been referred to the allergy unit of the communal hospital in Berne (Zieglerspital) for an allergological work-up. 54 (5.0%) of them had had an anaphylaxis defined as shock, drop of blood pressure or collapse. The examination consisted of a detailed history and a comprehensive allergological assessment. Results: The average age of the 54 patients ― 28 women (52%) - was 43 years. In 46 (85%) of them the cause for anaphylaxis was a Hymenoptera venom allergy. Other triggers were: drugs [3], exercise-induced [2], multi-factorial [2] and food [1]. 20/54 subjects (37%) had a recurrent systemic reaction; all of them were allergic to Hymenoptera venom. 6 of them (30%) possessed emergency medications (antihistamines/corticosteroids); none of them had an epinephrine-autoinjector. 48/54 patients (89%) have been treated in a hospital or by the emergency doctor; 2/6 were supported by family members, and 4 recovered spontaneously. For therapy most often corticosteroids (92%) and antihistamines (89%) were used; epinephrine, however, only in 9 cases (17%). Conclusion: This investigation shows that emergency treatment of anaphylaxis in the region of Bern does not concur with the advocated guidelines. Epinephrine as first-line therapy in anaphylaxis has been used rarely. More than one-third of the patients already had a previous allergic generalized reaction elicited by the same culprit (in our case hymenoptera stings). Only one-third of these carried emergency medications but none of them possessed an epinephrine-autoinjector.",

    "abstract": "Unconventional methods are increasingly used for allergic diseases and the list of commonly used unconventional methods for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is long. Various factors influence physicians and patients intheir choice of treatment and therapist, respectively. It is often difficult for patients and physicians to distinguish whether an effect on symptoms is due to the natural course of disease or causally related to the medical intervention. The ,,placebo-effect can contribute to the therapeutic success. Among the numerous unconventional methods, medical herbs, bioresonance, homeopathy, acupuncture, relaxation techniques and diets are mentioned and the results of controlled studies are reported. In conclusion, unconventional methods inherit chances and risks. However, only by considering controlled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic methods can be advocated according to evidence and not to ideology.",

    "abstract": "Pine nuts belong to the family of Pineaceae spp. and are widespread in the Mediterranean region. Allergy against pine nuts are rather rare up to now. We report a case of a male patient, showing a shock syndrom with mentalblackout after ingestion of pine nuts. The sensitization to pine nuts was investigated by means of the skin prick test (SPT), the determination of specific IgE antibodies, the cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) and Westernblots. A self-produced pine nut extract and extracts of several nuts were used in the prick tests as well as in the CAP and CAST experiments. CAP inhibition assays were carried out using pine nut extracts with different protein concentrations. The determination of the characteristic proteins of the pine nut extract was performed by means of the SDS-Page/immunoblotting. The IgE-mediated sensitization to pine nuts was demonstrated clearly. Inhibition assay showed the homogenous inhibition of the specific IgE antibody up to 98% by the self-produced pine nut extract. An increased sulfidoleukotrien release (sLT) (2,400 -2,600 pg/ml) could be shown by the CAST experiments. The sLT values of the controls amounted under the background values. The characteristic pine nut allergen bands of 10, 30 and 47.5 kDa could be detected in the immunoblots. In conclusions, our patient demonstrated an isolated, IgE-mediated type C (according to Pichler's nomenclature) hypersensitivity to pine nuts. Because of the increasing use of pine nut in food, these proteins seem to become an important food allergen with increasing significance.",

Quantitative values (kU/l) of both systems were associated to different degrees depending on the allergen: allergen/n t3/48, g6/47, w6/39, e1/40, e5/42, d1/39. Spearman's rho 0.95***, 0.9***, 0.82***, 0.9***, 0.82***, 0.85***, allergen/n f1/37 f2/38 f4/68 f14/52f17/40 f49/40. Spearman's rho 0.84***, 0.6***, 0.6***, 0.31*, 0.68***, 0.82***, *** p < 0.001; * p < 0.05. Values to inhalants (t3, g6, el, e5) were scattered moderately around an ideal regression line (diagonal between x-and y-axis). In contrast, sIgE-levels to FA (f2, f4, f14, fl7) showed stronger discrepancies between both systems. Similarly, different degrees of association and spreading, depending on the individual allergen, were found comparing semiquantitative classes (0 - 6) of both systems. Taken together, values of sIgE to inhalants detected by different in vitro methods are stronger associated than sIgE to FA; IgE-values to allergens with one dominant major allergen (i.e. t3, el) seem to be more concordant than complex allergen mixtures (i.e. dl); identical units (kU/l) can not garantee equivalent IgE results. The data presented do not allow estimates of the real IgE concentrations or judgement on superiority of one of the tests over the other. The study is restricted to compare both methods analytically, since the diagnostic concordance could not be calculated due to a lack of corresponding clinical data. Despite these limitations, comparative sIgE studies are necessary and helpful to define the concordance of IgE values detected by different immunoassays. They also set the basis for subsequent improvement of allergens used in test systems detecting specific IgE.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated so far that only digestion-stabile food allergens can directly sensitize via the gastrointestinal tract. For this reason, in vitro digestion experiments are used as safety tests for characterizing food allergens and for evaluating the allergenic potential of novel dietary proteins. Peptic digestion strictly relies on low pH, and even by elevating the pH only marginally digestion-labile proteins remain intact up to two hours. In clinics, pH elevation, i.e. hypoacidity, is the ultimate goal when treating dyspeptic disorders. Thereby, the natural gate keeping function of the stomach could be hindered and also digestion-labile food proteins could acquire allergenic potential. There is sparse information in the literature on a possible link between anti-ulcer therapies and food allergy. However, our recent animal studies pointed towards the importance of conformational protein epitopes for IgE induction and, consequently, an impact of anti-acidic therapy on the development of type I food allergy. More importantly, the relevance for humans was proven in an observational study of gastroenterological patients. After a three-months therapy with H2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors, in 15% of all patients de novo sensitizations towards various, often digestion-labile food proteins of the daily diet could be revealed. Thus, impairment of the gastric digestion capacity plays a central role in sensitization to food allergens. These findings could be applied for the generation of true food allergy animal models and, more importantly, could be used for dietary recommendations for patients treated with anti-ulcer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is the most common allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis in humans. The diagnosis of the complex disease is based on defined criteria. Five clinical stages of ABPA have been proposed. The extent of the defined criteria varies in the different stages, thus, making diagnosis difficult. Particularly the discrimination of ABPA in remission stage (stage II) and allergic asthma with A. fumigatus sensitization may be an important problem. Early diagnosis in stages without persistant changes of bronchial wall and lung parenchyma is needed to prevent severe end stages of ABPA. The up to now widely used commercial (crude) allergen extracts for in vitro and in vivo diagnosis show batch to batch variation, insufficient standardization and lack of reproducibility. Potentials and limitations of routine diagnostic procedures in ABPA are described. The production of a panel of recombinant allergens of A. fumigatus and their evaluation for in vivo and particularly in vitro use has brought an important step forward in the early and precise diagnosis of ABPA. A panel of recombinant allergens is now available for routine assay in CAP system. In cystic fibrosis, a higher prevalence of ABPA is reported. Although it appears that the patient with ABPA provides a favorable milieu for the occurrence ofAAS, it is surprising that in spite of similar histopathological features the coexistence of both diseases is infrequently recognized. Glucocorticosteroids play a central role in therapy of ABPA. The approach in exacerbation phase and the long-term therapy are described and also the indication for antimycotic drugs.",

    "abstract": "In adults, the majority of IgE-mediated food allergies is caused by cross-reacting allergen-molecular structures that are present in inhalant as well as food allergens. On the one hand, synthesis of IgE stimulated by a cross-reactive allergen in pollen can result in a diverse pattern of sensitizations against various foods. On the other hand, even anaphylactic reactions may occur after first consumption of a food containing a cross-reactive allergen. In clinical practice, it is not sufficient to detect cross-reactivities by immunologic assays. Clinically relevant sensitizations have to be distinguished from clinically irrelevant IgE responses. Hence, in cases of unclear history, oral challenge tests are necessary. A few open studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential in pollen-related food allergy: in at least 50% of the cases, tree pollen immunotherapy led to an improvement of associated food allergies. However, these results have to be confirmed in placebo-controlled studies. As we are facing an increase of pollen allergies, a shift in sensitization patterns and changes in nutritional habits, the occurrence of new, so far unknown cross-reactions, is expected.",

In the 7 administrative districts of Eferding, Freistadt, Grieskirchen, Linz-Land, Perg, Urfahr-Umgebung and Wels-Land in the Austrian province of Upper Austria, the parents of all children attending preschool classes and first- and second-grade elementary school (i.e. 6 to 7 years of age) were asked to (anonymously) fill in a standardized questionnaire and to return it to school. There was a total number of 13,731 children eligible, 91.3% of which participated (n = 12,541). For asthma, a lifetime prevalence of 5%, for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis of 4.5% and for atopic eczema of 13.6% was observed. There was small variation between ages and sexes. Compared to the ISAAC Phase I Study (1995 - 1997) the lifetime prevalence of asthma rose by 0.6%, that of rhinitis by 0.9%, and the lifetime prevalence ofatopic eczema increased by 3.7%. Parts of this increase could be driven by altered diagnose habits of physicians, but also by a rise in health awareness in parents.",

    "abstract": "Allergies and respiratory diseases are widespread in modem industrial countries. Because of the increased spreading of ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in Germany and due to the high allergenic potential of ragweed pollen, increasing diseases related to ragweed are likely. Ragweed blooms in the second half of the year (July to August), therefore polysensitized persons may suffer the entire year from allergic reactions. Since 1992, the sentinel health public offices have carried out allergy screenings on school children of grade 4 (approximately 10 years old) from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Since 2004, allergy screening for Ambrosia artemisiifolia and other allergens, which are known to trigger cross-reactions with ragweed as well as the native major allergen of ragweed and mugwort, Amb a 1 respectively Art v 1, were included in those investigations. Since 1992, no or a slight increase in the sensitization against the sxl-test (atopie screening) could be demonstrated in the investigations as well as in the results of questionnaires filled out by parents about the medical diagnosis of asthmatic diseases of the screened children. Atotal of 2,678 children were examined. 36.6% of them were sensitized against the sx1-test, 14.6% against the native Ambrosia artemisiifolia-allergen, 2.4% against the native major allergen of ragweed (Amb a 1) and 5.5% against the native major allergen of mugwort (Art v1). There was a high cross-reaction from native Ambrosia artemisiifolia-allergen to mugwort-allergen and to other allergens. The data on such positive sensitization does not necessarily involve a clinical relevance. Only a suitable differential diagnosis may give answers on the clinical importance. Even though from the current state of spread of ragweed no conclusion can be drawn on potential health risks, the further spreading of ragweed should be prevented in the terms of the precautionary principle and of the consideration of proportionality.",

Vor Evaluation zusatzlicher Therapieoptionen sollten Differenzial diagnosen ausgeschlossen, Komorbiditaten behandelt, persistierende Trigger eliminiert und die Adharenz optimiert werden. Des Weiteren sollten Rehabilitationsmasnahmen zur nachhaltigen Asthmastabilisierung und Verringerung von Fehltagen in Schule und Beruf angestrebt werden. Zu den medikamentosen Zusatzoptionen zahlen Tiotropium, Omalizumab (bei IgE-vermitteltem Asthma) und Azithromycin (bei nichteosinophilem Asthma). Die Zulassung von Antikorpern gegen Interleukin-5 oder dessen Rezeptor zur Behandlung von schwerem eosinophilen Asthma wird in den nachsten Jahren erwartet.",

The history includes the general information and specific data concerning used drugs, the classification and circumstances of the reaction. Skin tests are performed in all hypersensitivity reactions with allergic symptoms. Tests should be done between four weeks and six months after clearance of the symptoms by performing skin prick test, intradermal test, patch test or photopatch test. Validated tests for the detection of specific IgE antibodies in the serum are available for only few drugs, especially betalactam antibiotics. Other laboratory tests, e.g., the basophil activation test are done only in special cases. Provocation tests are indicated, if the culprit drug cannot be identified by the above mentioned tests. If possible, the evaluation of provocation tests should rely on objective parameters. The concluding assessment will be discussed with the patient and will be documented in an allergy pass.",

    "abstract": "Allergies caused by marine creatures are mainly prevalent where they are catched, bred, handled and eaten, i.e. in coastal regions. Due to an increasing number of journeys and as a result of the fact that more and more seafood is consumed, also inland physicians find themselves more and more confronted with allergies caused by these creatures. The most important of these are fish, crustaceans and mollusks. The term seafood is normally used for edible marine creatures that are - unlike fishes or whales - no vertebrates. Mussels, marine gastropods, cuttlefish and squids, shrimps, crabs, crayfish and lobsters are typical seafood. Seafood can be obtained by catching or breeding. The pathology of allergies caused by marine creatures is extremely diverse and can affect all organs. There are contact dermatitides, contact urticaria, allergic rhinitides and bronchial asthma, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms, culminating in anaphylactic shock. The so-called hidden allergens make diagnosis difficult: according to the allergen labeling act all fish components have to be named in the list of ingredients, but there is no labeling obligation for bulk goods. The only suitable therapy is allergen avoidance. As severe sensitization is possible and cross reactions are frequent, no compromises should be made here.",

    "abstract": "Effectiveness of preparations with non-modified allergens for sublingual application evaluation of evidence by reference to clinical trials Background: As in the case of other preparations for specific immunotherapy, the approach taken when choosing a preparation for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) should, for ethical and economic reasons, be an evidence-based one. As yet, however, there is no overview available for proof of effectiveness of SLIT preparations marketed in Germany. Aim: The aim is to check, by means of a systematic review, which SLIT preparations available in Germany have had their clinical effectiveness documented. Methods: A literature search looked for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled effectiveness trials (DBPC trials) conducted with SLIT preparations, which are commercially available in Germany and contain native extracts from the allergen group grasses, trees and house dust mites. The evidence of effectiveness was assessed on the basis of the criteria of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Results: 85 DBPC SLIT trials were identified, of which 23 met the inclusion criteria for the review. 16 DBPC trials involved preparations with grass allergens, 1 with tree pollen allergens and 6 with house dust mite allergens. 4 SLIT grass preparations met the effectiveness criteria and for 2 SLIT tablet preparations there are 8 positively evaluated trials in children and adults. A further positively evaluated preparation has been studied in children, teenagers and adults, whilst the fourth preparation has only been studied in adults. In the group of tree pollen preparations, one preparation yielded positive evidence of effectiveness. Of the DBPC trials with mite allergens, the only statistically significant changes were seen in the symptom scores. Conclusion: Of the 12 SLIT preparations available in Germany, there are no DBPC trials providing evidence of effectiveness as per WAO/EMA criteria for 8 of the preparations. However, there is high evidence of effectiveness with a total of 8 positively evaluated trials for the two grass tablets.",

    "abstract": "Background: The risk for anaphylaxis from insect stings or food, in the general population is about 1 - 2%. The rapid self-administration of emergency treatment may be life-saving. In a retrospective study, the knowledge about and the use of emergency treatment in patients with severe allergic reactions to insect venoms, food allergens, drugs and natural rubber latex was investigated. Patients and methods: 219 patients, who had all received emergency tablets (2 x 10 mg cetirizine and 2 × 50 mg prednisone) and epinephrine (Asthmahaler MIST, some in addition an EpiPen auto-injector) were investigated by a questionnnaire. Results: 128 (58.4%) patients answered, 99.2% remembered having received tablets, 87.5% an Asthmahaler and 39.1% had additionally received an EpiPen, 100 patients had still their tablets, in 23.5% the medication was expired; 91 patients (74.6%) carried their tablets always with them, 79 patients still had an Asthmahaler, of them 49.3% had passed the peremption date. 92.5% patients still knew how to use the device, 43.2% carried the spray (some expired) always with them. Forty-one still had an EpiPen, 27.5% of the sprays had expired. 93.9% still knew how to use it, 36.6% always carried it with them. Among 60 patients who had been accidentally reexposed to their respective allergen, 48 immediately took their tablets, 18 inhaled with the Asthmahaler and 2 injected epinephrine. In 62%,this treatment abolished or reduced allergic symptoms. Conclusions: The majority of the patients were still sufficiently instructed. Compliance to carry tablets was clearly better than for the 2 epinephrine-containing devices. Most patients preferred the inhalation to the injection of epinephrine. However, the compliance to immediately use epinephrine was low. A repeated instruction and a continuing replacement of the emergency drugs are crucial to optimize this important first-line therapy in patients with severe allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin - first described by Widal et al. in 1922, and reactions to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), show a classic triad of symptoms: chronic rhinitis with nasal polyps, bronchial asthma, and intolerance to aspirin. In angloamerican literature intolerance to NSAIDs is known as Samter's syndrome. Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, predominantly cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) but also COX-2 inhibitors, is unlikely to be mediated by IgE-dependent mechanisms. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that aspirin hypersensitivity is likely to be mediated by a deviation of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway toward excessive leukotriene (LT) production, which then produces all the clinical features of analgesic-induced asthma (AIA). Up to now, the diagnosis of AIA was based on anamnesis and provocative tests. In most cases, the clear history should enable the physician to make a diagnosis. In doubtful cases, carefully controlled challenge testing with aspirin or other NSAIDs is necessary. The methods of nasal, bronchial and oral provocative tests are extensive, not only in private practice, and mostly unpleasant and painful for the patient. In some cases, like nasal obstruction, non-compliance or severe asthma, it is even not possible to perform provocative tests. This study was initiated to test the qualification of a functional cellular in vitro test (analgesic intolerance test: AIT) for the diagnosis of AIA. Therefore, the results of conventional diagnosis and AIT results obtained from 50 patients, suspected to suffer from AIA, were compared. The 38 patients of the control-group had no indications to AIA, neither in the anamnesis nor in the clinical findings, such as nasal polyposis and bronchial asthma. The conventional diagnosis was based on nasal and oral provocative tests (negative nasal test lead to an oral test), which were not performed in patients reporting from relapsing severe intolerance reactions to NSAIDs. The AIT detects the relation of peptide LT and prostaglandine (PG)E 2 produced by leucocytes upon stimulation as described recently [21]. The sensitivity of the test was determined to be 100%, the specificity 73.3%. The negative predictive value was 100% but the positive predictive value was only 71%, which is explained by patients with a negative conventional diagnosis but a positive AIT. These patients were characterized by a modified arachidonic acid metabolism with an increased LT production compared to the control group. A follow-up study has to clarify whether these patients suffer from a clinically irrelevant AIA which may change to a manifest AIA, or the AIT shows false positive results. In summary, the objective AIT is not yet sufficient to diagnose analgesic intolerance even though the first results are satisfyingly. Nevertheless, the test might be useful as a screening method reducing the need of provocative tests. Additional studies including more patients have to be performed to ameliorate the validity of the test because ofthe test's advantages such as easy handling and extremely low risk for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The lists of foods that cause hypersensitivity, varies between different countries and can also change with time because of changed eating habits. Our main goal was to find out which foods that, according tothe views of the patients, cause hypersensitivity. We also wanted to compare the case histories of patients with the results of the skin tests with some common foods. Methods and patients: Consecutive patients, referred for allergy testing at the 4 clinics were asked: Do you think that you have a hypersensitivity against foods? Those answering Yes (n = 467, 310 women and 157 men) were asked to fill in a questionnaire in which 52 different foodstuffs were listed. For each of the foodstuffs, the patients were asked to answer if they regarded themselves having a sure or a probable hypersensitivity. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed with standardized 10 HEP extract of birch, timothy and mugwort and with not standardized extract of wheat, cod, hazelnut and shrimp. Results: The foods that most frequently caused hypersensitivity were apple, kiwi, stone fruits (like plum, cherry and peach), peanut, orange, tomato and crustaceans. The majority of the patients reported a hypersensitivity against several foods (median 5) while only 20% had a monoallergy. The most common symptoms were oral allergy syndrome (OAS) (67%), skin symptoms (47%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (38%). The foods that most frequently caused OAS, were stone fruits, kiwi, carrot, hazelnut, banana, parsley and celery while orange, crustaceans, fish, chocolate, tomato and strawberry more often elicited skin symptoms. Milk, peas, bean, egg, poultry and spice often caused gastrointestinal symptoms. A significant correlation was found between positive SPT with birch pollen and hypersensitivity against apple, pear, hazelnut, kiwi, stone fruits, potato scarves and sunflower seed. A significant correlation was found, too, between positive SPT with mugwort and hypersensitivity against carrot, celery and parsley. The correlation between the case histories and the results of the SPT varied between the allergens. If the patients' histories were regarded as the true answer regarding clinical relevant hypersensitivity, the sensitivity of the SPT with hazelnut was 51%, with cod 23%, with wheat 9% and with shrimp 22%. The specificity of the SPT was with hazelnut 84%, with cod 98%, with wheat 89% and with shrimps 95%. If, however, the SPT was supposed to be the correct result, the sensitivity of the CH with hazelnut was 72% , with cod 65%, with wheat 6% and with shrimp 56%. The specificity of the case history was for hazelnut 68%, for cod 89%, for wheat 93% and for shrimp 80%. Conclusion: Vegetable food like nuts, apple, kiwi, peanut and stone fruits often cause food hypersensitivity in Sweden. The birch pollen allergy highly influence the pattern of the food hypersensitivity. In comparison with a similar investigation that was carried out 1973, hypersensitivity against kiwi and peanut is nowadays much more frequent. The correlation between the case histories and the results of the SPT is rather poor and varies between the allergens.",

    "abstract": "Allergic skin and respiratory diseases range among the most frequent afflictions in industrialized countries. Due to this fact the importance of indoor mold pollution based on dampness is discussed. In a sentinel health study of the State Health Agency (LGA) children attending of 4th grade of a primary school were tested by an in-vitro allergy screening (UniCap 100/Phadia) for the mold allergens mx1 (Penicillium chrysogenum m1, Cladosporium herbarum m2, Aspergillus fumigatus m3 and Alternaria alternata m6). Primarily about 5% of the children were sensitized against molds which are associated with the ambient air. The investigations showed that most of the children were sensitized against Alternaria alternata and concerning the IgE-concentration (kU/l) Alternaria alternata had the highest concentration among the tested allergens. Commonly children with sensitization against molds were polysensitized. It is unclear if the allergy screening against mold mx1 includes molds with indication for indoor mold pollution such as Acremonium spp., Aspergillus penicillioides, Aspergillus restrictus, Aspergillus versicolor, Chaetomium spp., Phialophora spp., Stachybotrys chartarum, Tritirachium (Engyodontium) album und Trichoderma spp. by means of crossreaction. Therefore, such investigations do not admit any conclusion about health problems as a result of indoor mold pollution. At the present state of knowledge exposure measurements of indoor mold pollutions are not possible, at most a semiquantitative assessment. Although it is generally accepted that dwellings with moisture and mold represent a health risk, knowledge about indoor mold pollution and the related health problems is lacking.",

    "abstract": "Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders with different severity and prognosis, which are characterized by excessively increased numbers of mast cells in the skin or in other tissues. The diagnosis of mastocytosis is made on the basis of typical clinical skin manifestations or symptoms of mast cell mediator release and is confirmed by biopsy. In cutaneous mastocytosis, which is generally found in children, mast cell proliferation is restricted to the skin. In the majority of adults, systemic mastocytosis is diagnosed with involvement of the bone marrow or other extracutaneous organs. Evidences for severe systemic involvement are high concentrations of tryptase, soluble CD25 and/or soluble CD 117 (KIT) in serum or plasma as well as the extent and density of the skin involvement. Bone marrow examinations are crucial to confirm the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. Sometimes specific immunphenotyping and analysis of KIT-mutations in mast cells are necessary to establish the diagnosis. The severity and form of disease is assessed by screening procedures. Indolent systemic mastocytosis is the most common form of systemic disease. Whereas the prognosis of this disease variant is good, that for systemic mastocytosis with associated non-mast cell lineage hematologic disease, aggressive mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia is less favourable. At the moment research projects look for new therapeutic appoaches to improve the prognosis of these aggressive forms of systemic mastocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Approximately 20% of subjects with asthma experience an acute bronchoobstruction after ingestion of ASA/NSAID. In specialized clinics the inhalative broncho-provocation test (IPT) with L-ASA is a well-established method to confirm the diagnosis of aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). The objective of this investigation was to establish a new, short-during IPT with L-ASA as a diagnostic tool in an outpatient clinic. Method: In the years 2001 to 2005, 65 patients (35 F, 30 M, mean age 42 years (16 - 73 years), performed an IPT with L-ASS. Group 1 comprised 37 patients with asthma and nasal polyposis, Group 2 17 patients with asthma but without nasal polyposis, and Group 3 11 patients with only cutaneous symptoms after intake of aspirin/NSAID. The IPT was performed stepwise with 5, 15 and 40 mg L-ASA up to a cumulative dose of 60 mg. Patients with a negative IPT underwent an oral provocation test with aspirin. Results: In group 1 11/37 (30%), in group 2 6/17 (35%), and in group 3 none of 11 (0%) had a positive IPT. The threshold dose was in 13 out of 17 reactors (76%) ≤ 20 mg L-ASA. Except in 1 patient, the bronchial-obstructive reaction was well-reversible after the inhalation ofsalbutamol. 24 out of 48 patients with a negative IPT with L-ASA underwent consecutively an oral provocation test with aspirin. 4 of them reacted with mild clinical symptoms after a cumulative dose of> 500 mg ASA. Conclusion: Our modified schema of IPT with L-ASA up to a cumulative dose of 60 mg L-ASA is suitable for diagnosing an AIA in an ambulatory setting. The IPT with L-ASA is a sensitive and safe provocation test lasting about 3 h. A negative IPT at 60 mg L-ASA excludes a significant reaction following the intake of low-dose aspirin (100 - 300 mg), this information may be essential in the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific imunotherapy (SIT) is the only treatment that interferes with basic pathophysiological mechanisms of allergic disease. New data demonstrates a role of SIT not only as a therapeutic agent but also as a preventive strategy to reduce onset of new sensitization and progression from allergic rhinitis to asthma. SIT is the only treatment that affects the natural course of the allergic disease and therefore should be started early in childhood. Data of SIT in children under the age of 5 is rare however. There is a need for studies investigating the primary and secondary preventive effect in very young children. Future research also needs to focus on treatment of atopic dermatitis and food allergy with SIT. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a promising new modality of SIT since it has a good safety profile and is patient-friendly. The results of paediatric SLIT studies are heterogeneous and meta-analyses do not allow general recommendations for SLIT in childhood. New data however demonstrates that high dose of grass allergen tablets in children is capable to reduce symptom and medication scores in a same magnitude as observed in adults previously. New SLIT studies using high dose of other seasonal and perennial allergens as well as trials in children with asthma are required in order to define indications for SLIT in childhood. Furthermore, follow-up trials are needed to further elucidate the long-term effect and preventive capacity of SLIT in children.",

    "abstract": "With the introduction of the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) into the German hospital financing system, the reimbursement of hospitals will be shifted from a per-day to a per-capita basis. Currently, health insurers are charged a flat fee for each day a patient stays in hospital. Therefore, hospitals are encouraged to keep patients rather than discharge them into the hands of their doctors in private practice. In future, hospitals will be payed a fixed amount for patients, depending on, e.g., their diagnoses and age, but within limits irrespective of the length of stay. Hospitals will be inclined to discharge their patients as soon as possible and limit their diagnostic and therapeutic efforts in order to avoid unneccessary costs. It is anticipated that this new financing system will considerably reduce the average length of stay in hospital and will also lead to a sharp decline in the number of hospital beds. Here, we calculate revenues and costs in 3 core areas of clinical allergy, namely allergen-specific immunotherapy for hymenoptera venom allergy, oral allergen challenge in suspected drug or food allergy and the diagnostics of chronic urticaria. Gross differences in the profitability of these areas can be found and may lead hospitals to reconsider their admission strategies. Cases of oral allergen challenge compare favorably to cases of chronic urticaria and might therefore preferentially been admitted when patients compete for a limited number of hospital beds in future.",

    "abstract": "Bei Patienten mit allergischer Rhinokonjunktivitis ist neben Karenzmasnahmen die Hyposensibilisierungstherapie oder spezifische Immuntherapie (SIT) die einzige kausale Behandlungsmoglichkeit. Die Wirksamkeit der Therapie ist umfangreich belegt und abhangig vom spezifischen Allergen, der Qualitat und Gesamtdosis der verabreichten Allergenextrakte und dem Applikationsschema. Bei der konventionellen SIT wird ein Allergenextrakt repetitiv in ansteigenden Dosen subkutan injiziert (Dosissteigerungsphase), bis eine individuelle Maximaldosis erreicht ist (Beginn der Erhaltungsphase). Es existieren unterschiedliche Therapieschemata fur die subkutane SIT. Bei der Cluster-Therapie werden wahrend der Dosissteigerung 2–3 Injektionen je Behandlungstag in wochentlichen Abstanden verabreicht, wodurch das rasche Erreichen der Maximaldosis gewahrleistet wird. Verschiedene Cluster-Protokolle sind in der Literatur beschrieben. Zusammenfassend zeigen die Daten der Cluster-Studien, dass Art und Anzahl der unerwunschten Reaktionen den konventionellen Schemata entsprechen. Unter Sicherheitsaspekten konnte daher die Cluster-SIT zu einer interessanten Alternative herkommlicher Therapieschemata fur die Dosissteigerungsphase werden. Neuere Studien der schnellen Cluster-Aufdosierung belegen zudem, dass eine klinische Wirksamkeit rascher eintritt als bei der konventionellen Therapie.",

These nuts originating from Australia have become popular in Germany since 2000. We report on 2 patients who developed an anaphylactic reaction with bronchial obstruction, urticarial rash and shock fragments after ingestion of macadamia nuts. Skin prick-to-prick test with macadamia nut was performed in the dermatological private office and revealed a strong immediate-type reaction to macadamia nut. Specific IgE antibodies to nuts could not be detected. A possible cross-reactivity with other nuts - particularly with hazelnut - is discussed, although there is no botanical relationship between the families of Proteaceae and Rosaceae. Until today, only 7 cases of an allergic reaction due to macadamia nut ingestion have been published in literature, mainly in Europe. The increasing import of these nuts to European countries, especially to Germany, might cause a larger number of hypersensitivity reactions in future.",

    "abstract": "anu acquers Painters and lacquerers are exposed to a broad spectrum of allergens. Aim of the study was to characterize and clarify the spectrum of allergens in paints and lacquers. Firstly, the literature was searched forpublished contact allergies due to paints and lacquers, and the allergens mentioned were assembled in a list. Allergens that are known to be used in the formulations were added to the list. Then the list was sent to leading manufacturers of paints and lacquers. They were asked to indicate whether any allergen mentioned in the list was being used in their formulations and to note, where appropriate, any related or new substances in use. An allergen list was compiled from the information gathered. The specific allergens were then tabulated according to their occurrence in the diverse types of paints and lacquers and the various fields of activity of painters and lacquerers. From an allergological aspect the most frequently reported binders were acrylate and epoxy resins and polyurethane. Acrylate resins are utilized in solvent-based, high solids, and water-based lacquers, and radiation-curing systems. The acrylates most frequently reported were butyl acrylate, methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, 2-ethyl hexylacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate respectively. Epoxy resins (bisphenol A and bisphenol F resins, and cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, various hardeners and reactive diluents included) are used in solvent-based, high solids, and water-based lacquers, and in powder coatings. Polyurethanes are utilized mainly in high solids and water-based lacquers. Among the additives, biocides are important components. Biocides are needed for the preservation of water-based lacquers, dispersion paints, and wood preservatives. Frequently reported biocides were isothiazolinones, chloracetamide, dibromodicyanobutane, formaldehyde, iodopropynyl.butylcarbamate, and bronopol. Categorizing the various lacquers showed that high solids, solvent-based, and water-based lacquers are utilized in nearly all fields. Powder coatings are applied chiefly in engine and tool construction, electro-technology, and vehicle manufacturing, less frequently in optics and precision mechanics. Dispersion paints are used almost exclusively by house painters. Radiation curing systems are used mostly in the timber industry. Knowing the types of paints and lacquers applied in a specific field makes it possible to assess the spectrum of allergens to which the painter/ lacquerer is exposed. However, as seen from the allergen list, paint and lacquer formulations contain numerous substances that are known to be sensitizers but of which the impact as occupational relevant allergens is as yet unknown.",

    "abstract": "Food allergies mediated by immunoglobulin E are the result of a complex pathomechanism. Contributing factors to the dysfunction of the immune system are the allergenic sources and the variable matrix effects arising from the processes involved in interaction with the gastrointestinal tract, the allergens by themselves through their structural features and the specific behavior of the individual immune system. The very starting point for elucidating the pathomechanism of food allergy is the identification of allergens and the description of their structure. They are the basis of in vitro diagnostics and foundation for the development of immunotherapeutic drugs. Of the group of class I food allergy, peanut allergy represents the largest group of sufferers. In peanut as an allergenic source, 11 allergens have been shown to be present. Ara h 1, Ara h 3 and Ara h 4 belong to the protein superfamily of cupins, Ara h 2, Ara h 6 and Ara h 7 to the superfamily of prolamins; Ara h 5 and Ara h 8 are associated with aeroallergens. Peanut agglutinin (PNA), -oleosin and -LTP have had allergenic properties attributed to them, but they are not registered by the IUIS nomenclature subcommittee. The effect of the above-specified allergens is, of course, only to be understood in the context of their matrix, which is subject to the effects of processing factors.",

    "abstract": "In literature the incidence of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy in young children is reported to be 2.5 up to 7%. The majority outgrows the allergy at the age of 3 years. After the age of 6, however, patients have a very low probability of spontaneous recovery. First-choice treatment is the complete avoidance of cow's milk. However, even consequent adherence to an elimination diet only leads to a spontaneous remission in about 1/3 of the cases. We report on a 5-year-old boy, who developed Quinckes edema, generalized urticaria, hypotension and somnolence (anaphylaxis grade III) after the introduction of cow's milk in a baby formular in his diet at the age of 12 months. A milk-free diet was introduced, but several times, anaphylactic reactions occurred due to accidental intake of low amounts of hidden cow's milk in different finished products. IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy was diagnosed by skin prick test and specific IgE. For oral tolerance induction to cow's milk, a rush protocol within 6 days was used. End-point prick test titration with cow's milk (native cow's milk, dilutions 1 : 10, 1 : 100, 1 : 1 .000 milk/water, etc.) was performed. Starting with 1 ml of the prick test-negative dilution (1/1.000.000 (milk/water), cow's milk was given in increasing dosages. Doses were doubled ever 20 - 60 minutes. During up-dosing, no severe anaphylactic reactions were seen. At Day 3, the patient developed minor allergic symptoms (periorally localized urticarial lesion, mild rhinitis), which could be managed with oral antihistamines. On Day 6, the child tolerated 250 ml cow's milk without any side effects. Oral tolerance to cow's milk was induced successfully and was accompanied by immunological changes during the maintenance therapy. At the follow-up examination after 2 years, levels of specific IgE for whole milk protein (2.68 - 1.12 kU/1), casein (2.99 to 0.56 kU/1) and whey (1.78 to 0.63 kU/1) had decreased substantially. Simultaneously, Westemblot analysis showed a pronounced signal for IgG4, which was negative before tolerance induction. Tolerance induction in IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy is practicable within a few days. Due to the potential anaphylactic side effects, we recommend to perform the therapy only in an in-patient setting.",

    "abstract": "15 - 25% of the German population suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, which is caused by grass pollen in half of the cases. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is considered the only causal treatment. For the first time a registered preparation for sublingual immunotherapy designed as a lyophilisated grass pollen tablet is available for the treatment of grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis. The tablet consists of standard quality- (SQ) standardized grass pollen allergens from timothy (Phleum pratense) in a dosage of 75.000 SQ-T. The application is once daily. This review summarizes the clinical studies for the evaluation of the safety and clinical efficacy of this new preparation. In the early phase of the development program, the main interest was related to safety issues. In total, 3 Phase I studies have been performed. In 1 of these studies patients were treated outside the pollen season with dosages of up to 1.000.000 SQ-T (> 13 times the dosage of the actual tablet) without severe or serious adverse events. In a dose-finding study, the optimal therapeutic dose was found to be 75.000 SQ-T once daily. With this dose the following studies were performed. In a Phase III study (GT-08) 634 patients were included. A mean reduction of the symptom score of 30% (p < 0.0001) and of the medication score of 38% (p < 0.0001) was demonstrated in the first treatment year. For the second treatment year (351 patients) a mean reduction of the symptom score of 36% (p < 0.0001) and of the medication score of 46% (p < 0.0001) was found. Serologic analyses revealed a modified systemic response of the immune system with a significant progessive increase of specific IgG4 antibodies after each treatment year.",

    "abstract": "Currently there exist native extracts and allergoids (chemically modified extracts) for the treatment with SCIT of patients suffering from allergic rhinitis. Unfortunately, those extracts have several unfavourable properties (such as collection of allergens, standardization, comparison with extracts of other companies, ...). In producing novel substances for SCIT, research groups hope to improve those properties: recombinant allergens promise to permit precise definition and evaluation of the specific properties of those molecules. In this way, allergens could be produced in maximal purity and in a standardized, reproducible manner. Beside that the amount of allergens could be defined easily by mass units. Furthermore, the potency could be increased and the number of adverse events could be reduced by creating hypoallergenic variants of recombinant allergens. This article describes how those allergens are produced and modified. Consecutively, the first clinical experiences with recombinant allergens, hypoallergenic variants of recombinant allergens and allergens conjugated to substances are presented. Those trials especially use molecules of grass pollen, birch pollen and ragweed pollen. The results showed a significant reduction of symptom medication score and immunological parameters (IgGl/IgG4: increase, reduction of IgE). Some of the trials even proved a favorable safety profile. Concluding those perceptions, it seems to be likely that SCIT with recombinant allergens could represent a possible alternative to the common SCIT. But, therefore, clinical trials have to follow in order to strengthen and support those results.",

For dietary education regarding elimination of offending food(s), not only information regarding food labelling and hidden sources of the allergen should be given to the patient. For pollen-associated food allergy and certain chronic conditions it might be necessary to be aware of possible triggering factors as well as potential cross reactions. Apart from avoidance, safe alternative foods have to be determined to maintain a nutritionally balanced diet and to keep up a high quality of life. To ensure the nutritionally adequacy of the diet, micro- and macronutrient intake should be analysed and improved, if necessary. An effective individual management of food allergy in every day life by the patient is to a high degree dependent on the quality of the nutritional education and therapy.",

The best characterized allergic diseases due to insects are anaphylaxis caused by stings of Hymenoptera (particularly apids, vespids, ants) and asthma elicited by allergens from cockroaches. Mosquitoes, lice, bed bugs or fleas mainly cause skin disease. Reactions to butterflies, moths, or caterpillars (lepidopterism), e.g. elicited by the oak processionary moth, are due to toxic or allergic mechanisms. There have been reports of allergic reactions to many other insects, e.g. lady bugs or flies. Insect stings and intense exposure to insects frequently induce sensitization.

Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are obtained from a possibly sensitized patient and cultured in the presence of the suspected drug for 5 - 7 days. For the last 12 - 18 h, 3H-thymidine is added. The proliferative response can be measured by means of the incorporation of 3H-thymidine and is expressed as stimulation index (SI). The SI forms the ratio of the proliferation in the cultures with antigen divided by the proliferation in the cultures without antigen. Discussion: The LTT is a helpful tool for the detection of drug-specific sensitization with the advantages of an in-vitro-test. However, sensitivity and specificity may vary depending on the clinical reaction and antigen investigated. In addition, reproducibility of the LTT is limited. This manuscript reviews the role of the LTT in the detection of drug hypersensitivity and aims to enable the reader to assess the potentials and limitations of the LTT in a realistic manner.",

    "abstract": "Background: Clinical efficacy of pollen allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been broadly documented in randomized controlled trials. The underlying clinical endpoints are analysed in seasonal time periods predefined based on the background pollen concentration. However, any validated or generally accepted definition from academia or regulatory authorities for this relevant pollen exposure intensity or period of time (season) is currently not available. Therefore, this Task Force initiative of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to propose definitions based on expert consensus. Methods: A Task Force of the Immunotherapy and Aerobiology and Pollution Interest Groups of the EAACI reviewed the literature on pollen exposure in the context of defining relevant time intervals for evaluation of efficacy in AIT trials. Underlying principles in measuring pollen exposure and associated methodological problems and limitations were considered to achieve a consensus. Results: The Task Force achieved a comprehensive position in defining pollen exposure times for different pollen types. Definitions are presented for “pollen season”, “high pollen season” (or “peak pollen period”) and “high pollen days”. Conclusion: This EAACI position paper provides definitions of pollen exposures for different pollen types for use in AIT trials. Their validity as standards remains to be tested in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Food hypersensitivity reactions have different underlying pathomechanisms and manifest in different ways on several target organs. This hampers the assessment of valid population-based data. The prevalence according to selfreported food allergy in single studies ranges from 2.1% for children in France to 35% for adults in Berlin. Two studies deliver comparable data for the European region as they have implemented the same methodology in different countries. According to a ECRHS-based study in young adults, the prevalence of food allergy was 12% on average and was as low as 4.6% in Spain and reached a maximum of 18% in Sweden (Germany 16%). Based on parental reports on their children under 18 years of age, given in a telephone survey, the prevalence of food allergy in 10 European countries reached 4.7% on average with frequencies as low as 1.7% for Austria and as high as 11.7% in Finland (Germany 3%). At least, six studies from the UK, The Netherlands and Germany have used a placebo-controlled double-blind oral food challenge test, at least in subgroups of population-based studies. The prevalence estimates, based on the test results reached from 0.1-4.2% and lay between 2 and 3% on average. Women report food hypersensitivity reactions more often and subjects with such reactions suffer significantly more often from other atopic diseases, especially allergic rhinitis. Further large and high-standard studies are needed, which should also allow for an international comparison. In this context, the EuroPrevall Project should be mentioned.",

    "abstract": "Psychosomatische Aspekte in der Allergologie sind zur Differenzialdiagnostik notwendig. Neben somatoformen Reaktionen – bei denen Patienten auf eine Allergie fixiert sind ohne positive Nachweise in der Allergiediagnostik – sind vor allem Angststörungen und Depressionen als Folge einer Allergie zu differenzieren und ggf. eine additive Indikation zur Psychotherapie zu stellen. Angstsymptome können anaphylaktoiden Symptomen sehr ähnlich sein und müssen von validierten Allergiereaktionen unterschieden werden. Neue psychoimmunologische Studien konnten den Einfluss von Neuromediatoren auf das allergische Entzündungsgeschehen sowohl in tierexperimentellen als auch in Studien am Menschen zeigen. Die neurogene Entzündung ist ein Erklärungsmodell, das die stressbedingte Exazerbation einer bestehenden Allergie erklärt. Psychotherapien sind in Deutschland gut etabliert; ergänzend kommen die psychosomatische Grundversorgung in der Allergologie selbst, die ambulante kassenärztliche Psychotherapie sowie stationäre Behandlungen in der Akut-Psychosomatik oder in psychosomatischen Reha-Kliniken für die allergologische Diagnostik und Therapie in Betracht.",

Für die Aktivierung von T-Lymphozyten ist die Allergenerkennung durch den T-Zell-Rezeptor wichtig, aber ebenso die Allergenpräsentation durch antigenpräsentierende Zellen (APC). Sowohl T-Zellen als auch APC müssen dabei aktiviert werden. Unterstützend für die T-Zell-Aktivierung sind kostimulatorische Signale. Zytokine bestimmen während der T-Zell-Aktivierung schließlich die Differenzierung der T-Lymphozyten in unterschiedliche spezialisierte Subpopulationen. Diese Subpopulationen werden durch die Expression unterschiedlicher Zytokine und Transkriptionsfaktoren charakterisiert. Die jeweilige spezialisierte adaptive Immunantwort entscheidet letztlich über die Entstehung von Allergie und Toleranz. In diesem Kapitel wird der aktuelle Stand über die Prinzipien der adaptiven Immunantwort, beteiligte Zellen, Rezeptoren, Zytokine und Signalwege dargestellt.",

    "abstract": "Allergische Erkrankungen sind sehr heterogene Krankheitsbilder, deren Entstehung und Verlauf in erheblichem Maße durch erbliche Faktoren beeinflusst werden. Durch den Einsatz moderner molekulargenetischer Methoden konnten innerhalb der letzten 10 Jahre eine Vielzahl bislang unbekannter genetischer Risikofaktoren identifiziert werden. Obwohl die zugrunde liegenden kausalen Mechanismen häufig noch unzureichend verstanden sind, haben die bisherigen Erkenntnisse schon jetzt pathophysiologische Konzepte nachhaltig verändert und wichtige Stimuli zur Entwicklung gezielter präventiver und therapeutischer Ansätze gegeben. Insbesondere wurde die wichtige Bedeutung epithelialer Mechanismen in der Ätiologie allergischer Erkrankungen deutlich. Erste Studien deuten außerdem darauf hin, dass epigenetischen Faktoren in der Pathogenese eine wichtige Rolle zukommt. Die fortschreitende Entwicklung molekularbiologischer Strategien und die Integration klinischer und molekularer Daten werden zur weiteren Aufklärung erblicher Mechanismen und zur Abgrenzung von Patientensubgruppen beitragen und so die Entwicklung einer stratifizierten Medizin im Bereich der Allergologie befördern.",

    "abstract": "Die temporäre Toleranzinduktion bei Medikamentenunverträglichkeit und Nahrungsmittelallergie ist nicht als Routineverfahren zu betrachten, die Indikation wird jeweils im Einzelfall nach Risiko-Nutzen-Abwägung gestellt. Wiederholte Applikation von zunehmenden Mengen des relevanten Allergens bis hin zur Symptomfreiheit ist für zahlreiche Arzneistoffe gelungen. Im Unterschied zur klassischen allergenspezifischen Immuntherapie ist allerdings hier der Mechanismus nicht geklärt, und es wird in der Regel keine echte langanhaltende immunologische Toleranz erreicht. Auch für Nahrungsmittelallergien ist die wiederholte Aufnahme von zunehmenden Mengen des relevanten Nahrungsmittels bis hin zur temporären Verträglichkeit der zuletzt verabreichten Menge beschrieben. Unter Beachtung einer Reihe von Vorsichtsmaßnahmen ist das Prinzip der temporären Toleranzinduktion in spezialisierten Zentren ein erfolgreiches Verfahren. Unterschiedliche Ansprechraten bei der Toleranzinduktion sind u. a. auf Unterschiede in Methoden und Schemata sowie auch auf die individuelle Reaktionsbereitschaft der Patienten zurückführbar.",

    "abstract": "In the EU more than 3 million employers are exposed to wood dusts. This can induce irritative as well as allergic respiratory diseases. Sensitization prevalence between 3% for non-tropical wood species and up to 30% for tropical woods was documented. For sensitive and specific diagnosis of wood dust sensitization it is important to establish standardized test procedures and standardized test extracts. The diagnosis of wood dust allergy is often difficult because of missing commercial wood test extracts. In addition, cross-reactive carbohydrate detenninants (CCDs) can produce false positive test results. Especially in poly-sensitized patients specific IgE-measurement alone is not sufficient to evaluate the relevance of the wood dust sensitization. In these cases further diagnostic tests are necessary to identify the causing allergen of occupational problems. Provocation testing is the gold standard to ascertain clinical relevance of an allergen. In addition or as alternative, a combination of skin prick test (SPT), basophile activation test (BAT) and CCD-inhibition test can be applied to identify the relevant wood allergens.",

    "abstract": "Die Therapie immunvermittelter und maligner Erkrankungen befindet sich im Umbruch. Zunehmend kommen gezielt mit molekularen Zellstrukturen interagierende therapeutische Proteine, sogenannte Biologika oder Biopharmaka, zum Einsatz. Biologika sind in der Regel Antikorper oder Fusionsproteine und werden gentechnologisch nach dem Vorbild korpereigener Strukturen in zellularen Expressionssystemen, wie zum Beispiel Hamster-Ovarzellen, hergestellt und in hochreiner Form verabreicht. Biologika haben mit den klassischen kleinmolekularen Medikamenten, den sogenannten Synthetika, sowohl in der Wirkungsweise wie auch hinsichtlich der Nebenwirkungen nur noch wenig gemein. Der zunehmende Einsatz von Biologika im klinischen Alltag stellt eine Herausforderung fur die anwendenden Arzte dar, die nebst den neuen Wirkmechanismen auch den Umgang mit komplexen Nebenwirkungsmustern von direkt mit dem Immunsystem interagierenden Substanzen kennen und behandeln lernen mussen. Akute Infusionreaktionen (infusion-related reaction, IRR) stellen mit einer Inzidenz von 0,1 – 3% die haufigste Nebenwirkung dar. Interessanterweise handelt es sich in den meisten Fallen nicht um IgE-vermittelte Reaktionen und lassen sogar eine Reexposition zu. Wahrend regulatorische Behorden und die Pharmaindustrie sich vor allem auf anti-drug-antibodies (ADA)-vermittelte Nebenwirkungen konzentrieren, wollen wir hier einen Uberblick uber das Nebenwirkungsspektrum und mogliche Abklarungsalgorithmen geben.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxie eine akute systemische Reaktion mit Symptomen einer allergischen Sofortreaktion, die den ganzen Körper erfassen kann und potenziell lebensbedrohlich ist. Damit gehört die Anaphylaxie zu den schwersten Ereignissen in der Allergologie. Von 1–3 Todesfällen bedingt durch Anaphylaxie pro 1 Mio. Einwohner/Jahr ist auszugehen. Die Symptome einer anaphylaktischer Reaktionen werden durch die Freisetzung verschiedener Mediatoren vermittelt. Überwiegend werden Mastzellen durch eine immunologische IgE-vermittelte Reaktion aktiviert. Die häufigsten Anaphylaxieauslöser sind Arzneimittel, Insektengifte und Nahrungsmittel. Die Symptome einer Anaphylaxie können sich einzeln, in Kombination, simultan oder sukzessive an Haut, Magen-Darm-Trakt, Atemwegen und Herz-Kreislauf-System manifestieren. In der Notfalltherapie der Anaphylaxie haben sich Adrenalin, Antihistaminika und Glukokortikoide bewährt.",

    "abstract": "Die relativ häufigen allergischen Reaktionen auf Arzneimittel an der Haut manifestieren sich als unkomplizierte makulöse oder papulöse Exantheme, das Flexurenexanthem ohne systemische Symptome, oder als Urtikaria und Angioödeme. Bei ersteren spielen eher T-Zell-mediierte Pathomechanismen eine Rolle, häufig auslösende Medikamente sind Antibiotika, aber auch Chinolone sowie Antiepileptika. Ein Sonderfall stellt das fixe Arzneimittelexanthem dar, bei welchem eine umschriebene Plaque gelegentlich mit zentraler Bulla, teils mit daraus resultierender Hyperpigmentierung vorliegt. Schwerwiegendere Exantheme umfassen die akute generalisierte exanthematische Pustulose sowie das medikamentöse Hypersensitivitätssyndrom. Systemische Befunde wie Fieber, Neutrophilie, Eosinophilie sowie eine Innenorganmitbeteiligung sind zu suchen. Die schweren bullösen Exantheme sind ein Kontinuum vom Stevens-Johnson-Syndrom bis zur toxisch epidermalen Nekrolyse. Urtikaria und Angioödeme, bei welchen sowohl IgE-vermittelte Reaktionen wie auch sog. pseudoallergische Reaktionen mit nichtspezifischer Mastzell- oder Basophilenaktivierung involviert sind, werden eher von nichtsteroidalen Antiphlogistika und Röntgenkontrastmitteln ausgelöst. Diagnostisch ist eine detaillierte morphologische Diagnose entscheidend sowie die exakte Dokumentation der Chronologie des Ablaufs. Hauttests und Laboranalysen zur Feststellung des Auslösers sind nur teilweise validiert und kommerziell erhältlich. Therapeutisch sollten die verdächtigten Auslöser unverzüglich abgesetzt werden. Bei entsprechender Indikation können Antihistaminika sowie topische oder auch systemische Glukokortikoide eingesetzt werden.",

    "abstract": ". Risk factors should be part of the decision, of which patient should be offered venom immunotherapy (VIT) and how VIT should be performed. Risk factors for a severe systemic anaphylactic reaction (SAR) after a Hymenoptera field sting include a preceding less severe sting reaction, a wasp sting, an increased baseline serum tryptase concentration (BSTC), mastocytosis, older age, ACE inhibitor medication, and male gender. During VIT, treatment with honey bee venom is the most important risk factor for a SAR. Further risk factors include a high BSTC (for vespid VIT only), presence of venom specific IgE in serum, any antihypertensive medication during therapy, and an ultra-rush protocol for build-up. Treatment failure is more common in patients suffering from honey bee venom allergy, high BSTC (for vespid VIT only) or mastocytosis, and in those who had experienced side effects during VIT. Besides discontinuing antihypertensive medication or switching to a moderate type of dose increase during build-up, little can be done to minimize the risks associated with VIT. Increasing the maintenance dose may improve the efficacy of VIT. In patients with a particularly high risk for treatment failure, or in case of treatment failure, VIT should include an increased maintenance dose right from the beginning. Usually, 200 µg will be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "The authors have been leading a team from the Institute of Standardization and Quality Control in Medical Laboratories (INSTAND) conducting ring tests into in vitro allergy diagnosis on behalf of the Federal Chamber of Medical Practitioners since 1995. The aim of the program was to test the comparability of results of specific IgE results against inhalation and food allergens in different laboratories. To date, 190 laboratories have taken part in ring tests and have determined specific IgE antibodies against the following allergens: birch pollen, dust mites, cat and dog, chicken protein, proteins in cow milk, bee and wasp venom, soya, celery, mugwort, apple and carrot. All the results were compared with each other. Those participating in the ring test were informed of the allergens the specific antibodies were aimed at. Their task was to determine the (as known RAST tests are used anymore. In this article, the word will be used because it is generally handled in the official allergologic doctor offices) and the IgE concentrations (kU/1). While all RAST results were simply compared with one another, the concentrations were compared on the basis of an area of 25% either side of the average IgE results. The results were also studied according to the testing systems and equipment used. The RAST classes were generally comparable among the individual companies represented by the participants. One negative result was the differing classification (RAST 0 - 4) of specific IgE antibodies in every group of participants independent of the company, including those against bee and wasp venom. There were clear differences when the results in kU/1 were compared. In our opinion the differing results with specific IgE are linked to a specific laboratory's experience in the field. Our results show that ring testing is essential to check the quality of in vitro allergy diagnosis. Quality can only be improved by discussing ring test results with the laboratories themselves as well as the test and equipment manufacturers. As a result of our investigations, we urgently recommend participation in ring testing and internal quality assessment.",

Desloratadine shows the highest affinity for H 1 receptors, a relatively long adherence to H 1 receptors and a strong insurmountable antagonism. Suppression of inflammation mediators, dependent and not dependent on H 1 receptors, is an important component of the therapeutic actions and of different strength for the new H 1 antihistamines. Pharmacokinetic properties are important for the duration of action, for the dose regimen if the elimination organs are disturbed and for drug interactions. In decreased renal function, e.g. the doses of cetirizine and levocetirizine have to be adjusted. In SAR and PAR the new H 1 antagonists have been used successfully, activity against nasal obstruction of desloratadine being superior to that of loratadine, fexofenadine and cetirizine. The new H 1 antihistamines show a low rate of side effects and are safe. Sedation is a rare undesired effect, but still different for the new H 1 antihistamines. The profile of action and side effects of desloratadine justifies the assignment of this drug to a 3rd generation of antihistamines.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic yeast Malassezia belongs to the normal cutaneous flora but can also cause IgE-mediated sensitization in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis (AD). We investigated the prevalence of sensitization to M sympodialis serologically and by skin test in various allergic conditions. Furthermore, a purpose of this study was to identify the causing allergenic structures of the yeast by using different recombinant allergens of M. sympodialis. Totally, 613 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to seasonal or perennial allergens (378), allergic asthma (83), AD (55), urticaria (31), food allergy (24), insect sting allergy (42) and 38 healthy controls were investigated. As natural allergen, a crude extract prepared from the M. sympodialis strain ATCC 42132 was used. Specific serum IgE was analyzed by ImmunoCAP (m70, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden); for the recombinant allergens an ELISA assay was established. Recombinant M. sympodilialis allergens (rMal sl, rMal s5, rMal s6, rMal s7, rMal s8, and rMal s9) were cloned and expressed in the E. coli M15 system and used for detection of allergen-specific IgE in the serum measured by ELISA. In 34 of 55 patients with AD, specific IgE against M. sympodialis was detected. The ELISA assay with recombinant allergens showed differential recognition patterns against the different molecular structures with a predominance of sensitization to rMal s5, rMal f6 and rMal f9. No reactivity to rMal s allergens was seen in other patients or healthy controls. In conclusion, sensitization to M. sympodialis occurs almost exclusively in patients with AD. The use of antifungals may therefore be highly beneficial in some AD patients. Recombinant allergens are an excellent tool to determine the immunologic relevance of fungi in AD.",

Objective: We report the results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the local tolerability of Euphorbium comp. Nasentropfen E (nasal pump spray) in healthy subjects. The study drugs of both treatment groups contained 0.02% benzalkonium chloride. Results are evaluated in the context of the currently available data. Methods: 24 healthy subjects for 4 weeks applied Euphorbium comp. Nasentropfen E or placebo (5 × 2 sprays per nostril daily). Before and after the application phase the following examinations regarding local tolerability were performed: measurement of saccharine transport time, anterior rhinomanometry, determination of nasal secretion performance, orientating smell test, anterior rhinoscopy. Local and systemic adverse events were documented during the application phase. Results: Data of 21 subjects could be used for analysis of the parameters of local tolerability. Clinically relevant differences or changes were not found, neither between the groups nor in pre-post comparison. Saccharine transport time always was in the normal range and in both groups was even slightly reduced. Conclusion: Neither the reported study nor the literature yield sufficient arguments to limit the duration of usage of benzalkonium chloride-containing intranasal drugs with active substances other than α-sympathomimetics to 5 - 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent cytokine and chemokine research has rapidly expanded our understanding of nasal polyposis. Specific cytokines and chemokines that appear to play a central role in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis, have now been identified. The objective of the present study was to investigate the mRNA expression of the chemokine receptor CCR3 and his ligands eotaxin and RANTES in nasal polyps in a precisely characterized patient population, with special attention to etiological factors and to compare the results with turbinate nasal mucosa of control subjects and within the patient group. Methods: Eosinophilic nasal polyps from 30 patients (comparable CT score and eosinophilia) and tissue samples taken from the inferior turbinate of 10 control subjects were obtained during endonasal surgery. Histologic examination was performed to determine the extent of eosinophilia. Realtime TaqMan PCR was performed to analyze and quantify CCR-3n eotaxin―, RANTES mRNA expression. The results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Spearman test. Results: In nasal polyps, CCR3― (p < 0,001) and eotaxin (p = 0,001) mRNA expression were significantly higher than in controls. There significantly correlation between CCR3― and eotaxin mRNA expression (p = 0,01). No correlation was detected between the CCR3 and RANTES mRNA values and the RANTES and eotaxin mRNA values. In nasal polyps of patients with ASS sensitivity and allergy, CCR3 mRNA expression was significantly evelated, compared with the other patients. There was no difference in RANTES mRNA expression between patients and controls, but within the patient group, non-allergic patients (p = 0,012) and allergic patients (p = 0,029) had increased RANT'ES mRNA values compared with patients suffering from ASS sensitivity and allergy. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the CCR3 eotaxin system plays a key role in the selective recruitment of eosinophils and in the development of nasal polyps. The differences in RANTES mRNA expression within the patient group indicate a disease-specific pathomechanism in patients with different etiological factors. Data may lead to the assumption that ASS sensitivity and also allergy are important etiological factors in the multifactorial genesis of polyposis nasi.",

    "abstract": "Allergic/atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, are mainly mediated by Th2 cells. However, the immunologic mechanisms that protect against these diseases are poorly understood. Suppressor T cells play an important role in the regulation of immune responses and the mediation of immunologic tolerance. Th3 cells produce TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-4, and suppress activation and cytokine production of effector cells via a TGF-β-dependent manner. T-regulatory 1 (Trl) cells are differentiated in the presence of IL-10, produce themselves high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β and suppress via a cell contact-independent, but IL-10-dependent mechanism. A third population of CD4 + T cells (2 - 10%) express the IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25) and the recently defined transcription factor Foxp3. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that these CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role in the prevention of tumor immunity, organ-specific autoimmunity and allograft rejection leading to transplantation tolerance. Additionally, they are involved in the control of chronic infections. CD4 + CD25 + Treg are also present in human peripheral blood where they inhibit the proliferation and cytokine production of activated CD4' CD25 - responder T cells. In this review, we summarize the function of CD4 + CD25 + Treg in allergic immune responses. We show that most of the examined atopic or allergic patients also harbor CD4 + CD25 + Treg with intact regulatory functions as described above. In a subset of patients, CD4 + CD25 + Treg show less reduced proliferation and higher amounts of IL-4 and IL-10 production with no suppressing capacity apart from that of IFN-γ.",

    "abstract": "87 (1.6% of all patients) predominantly adult patients with IgE-mediated food allergy (FA), were seen at the Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of Zurich during the year 1998. The age of manifestation was between 1 and 60 years, with a mean of 27.7 years. These patients were classified according to the way of sensitization (via gastrointestinal tract or via aerogeneous allergens with crossreactivities with foods) and the age of manifestation into the types A, B, C of food allergies, according to the concept of Pichler [1998]. FA type A is seen in infants and small children, which get sensitized to food proteins via the gastrointestinal tract. FA type B is due to crossreactivities of IgE, which are originally directed to aerogeneous allergens in pollen, latex, dust mites, etc. FA type C does not appear predominantly in atopic persons. The affected persons get sensitized via gastrointestinal tract to selected, stable food proteins. In the present series, only 7 children (8%), 1 - 4 years old, belonged to type A and the FA was higly associated with a familial, or personal atopy. The main food, eliciting symptoms of the skin and gastrointestinal tract were nuts and eggs. This small group is not representative as such cases are seen by pediatricians. FA type B was diagnosed in 64 patients (73.6%), aged between 6 - 60 years. The peak of age manifestation was between 21 - 30 years. 64.1% were females; 78.1% of the patients had a pollen allergy and, therefore, the main crossreactivities were birch or mugwort pollen associated (80.7%). The latex-fruit was seen in 18.8%, the house dust mite-crustaceans in 12.5%, the grass-cereals and the ragweed-melon in 4.7% each. Only 1 patient (1,6%) presented itself with a pork-cat syndrome. Fruits, vegetables, hazelnut and spices elicited mainly an oral allergy syndrome (OAS) (in 67.2% of the cases), but also symptoms of the skin (urtikaria in 48.8%) and the airways (65.6%, particularly as dyspnea (48.8%)). The main food allergens in this group were apple (40.6%), celery (34.4%) and hazelnut (23.4%). FA type C represents 16 patients (18.4%, age between 12 and 58 years; 62.5% were females. This group is heterogeneous; only 31.3% had a family history and 18.8% had a personal history of atopic diseases, and the symptoms due to FA were predominantly acute or recurrent. Fish and crustaceans, meat and kiwi were predominant as food allergens and often elicited symptomes of the skin and airways. An OAS was rare. In 1 previoulsy nonatopic patient, the way of sensitization was the skin due to occupational contact with fish and crustaceans (contact urticaria syndrome). This may represent a fourth type (D) of FA.",

Following a single-blind, placebo run-in period of three days to five days, patients were randomized to oral montelukast 10 mg (n = 415) or placebo (n = 416) daily during the two-week, double-blind, active-treatment period. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was daily rhinitis symptoms score, average of daytime nasal symptoms and nighttime symptoms, as self-rated by patients on a 0 - 3 scale on daily diaries. Results: Montelukast reduced the daily rhinitis symptoms score: difference between montelukast and placebo in mean change from baseline was -0.12 (95% CI -0.18, -0.06; p < 0.001). Similar improvements were seen in daytime nasal symptoms (-0.14 (-0.21, -0.07; p < 0.001)) and nighttime symptoms (-0.10 (-0.16, -0.04; p < 0.001)). Improvements (p < 0.05) were seen in daytime eye symptoms and in the secondary endpoints of global evaluations of AR by patient and by physician, and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life. In exploratory analyses, improvement in rhinitis symptoms was numerically (though not statistically) larger in patients with greater levels of asthma at study start. Montelukast provided benefit in the global evaluations of asthma by patient and by physician: mean differences were -0.24 (-0.41, -0.06; p = 0.008) and -0.17 (-0.33, -0.01; p = 0.037). Similarly, as needed, β-agonist use (puffs/day) was reduced with montelukast (p < 0.005). Conclusion: Montelukast provides significant relief from symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, while also conferring a benefit for asthma, in patients with both allergic rhinitis and asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Repetitive individual ambulatory education sessions after an individual ambulatory asthma training program are known to increase its effectiveness. We aimed to study how many additional ambulatory asthma training sessions are necessary in order to optimize the training effect. Methods: Within 2 years, a total of 522 patients participated in our ambulatory asthma training program. At the first visit in the asthma clinic, each patient obtained individual asthma training. Additional individual training sessions were offered at each appointment in the asthma clinic. The appointments were at intervals of 3 - 6 months. 1 additional training session was accepted by 185 patients. 155 patients took part in 2 additional training sessions, 108 in 3,56 in 3, 15 in 5 and 3 patients in 6 sessions, respectively. At each appointment, the course of the disease was evaluated by a questionnaire, furthermore, lung function testing was performed. The percentages of patients showing improvement, no improvement, or deterioration in asthma severity were compared by Χ 2 -tests. Results: The highest percentage of patients (72.2%) showing improvement in asthma severity was documented at the fourth appointment, i.e. after 3 additional individual training sessions. Conclusion: In individual ambulatory asthma training programs, at least 3 additional individual training sessions at intervals of 3 - 6 months appear to be necessary for obtaining the maximum effect. In conclusion, structured education programs can be effective even in an outpatient setting, especially if additional training sessions are offered.",

This approach was, therefore, chosen to investigate the extreme events occurring in the case of airborne pollen. Extreme events in this case means the largest daily pollen count in each of the years of the periods studied. The study, based on the Basel pollen observation, indicates how often extreme events have to be expected and how often a certain amount of either birch pollen or grass pollen might occur. A general trend in more extreme events concerning airborne pollen cannot be observed by using the Loess smoothing approach.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of allergies to particular foods in adults has never been documented over time. Therefore, it is not possible to give evidence about a possible shift in the spectrum of food allergens over the years. There are periodic analyses of the patients of the Allergy Unit of the Department for Dermatology at the University Hospital of Zurich that were diagnosed with food allergies between 1978 - 1998. Detailed data about food allergens are taken from previous published data. In order to detect trends in food allergens, the yearly frequency of food, responsible for systemic allergic reactions among food allergic patients diagnosed in these publications, is calculated for the observation period. Between 1978 - 1982: 173, between 1983 -1987: 229, between 1990 - 1994: 383 and in the year 1998: 87 patients have been evaluated to have a food allergy. Over the entire observation period of 20 years, celery root was the most frequent allergen. The frequency of carot allergy was stable, but - in respect to celery - over all relatively low. Since the 90s, a marked increase of the following food allergies can be observed: allergies to peanuts and soy, which are both legumes, as well as to nuts (hazelnuts and almonds), exotic fruits (kiwis and bananas), and, in the year 1998, to crustaceans. The possible explanations for these findings, for example an increase of pollen allergies and, consequently, of pollen-associated food allergies (birch fruits vegetables nuts mugwort celery spices syndrom), the latex fruit syndrome, the fast advancing and globalization of the American fast food culture (peanuts), among others are discussed.",

Our study of more than 100 hairdressers from 2001 - 2005 has shown two age peaks for suspected cases. The first one in mostly young atopic hairdressers lies between 18 and 22 years. The second peak was determined to be between 3 8 and 45, comprising almost exclusively smokers with chronic bronchitis. Our results show that in most cases working in a salon does not cause asthma but that the inhalative exposure to numerous chemical substances increases symptoms and in a few cases leads to a progression of pre-existing bronchial hyperreactivity and asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Aim of this study was the development of a screening questionnaire for allergic respiratory diseases. The questionnaire should be as short as possible and easy to administer. Methods: The test version consisted of 33 items asking for the occcurrence of typical symptoms and whether these symptoms were associated with specific circumstances (e.g. season, contact to animals). Additionally, the severity of symptoms was rated on a 10-point scale. The questionnaire was tested on a sample of patients from the practices of 185 dermatologists, ENT physicians, pulmonologists and pediatricians who were all specialized in allergology. Each study physician should include all subsequent patients who visited the practice for the first time during a specified period (April - July 2003). Of 13,604 documented cases 8,822 patients could be included in the analysis. Excluded patients had either incomplete data or diagnostic assessment was not finished. Allergic airway disease was confirmed by positive skin or laboratory tests in 1,562 of these patients (prevalence 17.7%). Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the questionnaire items most predictive of a diagnosis of allergic airway disease. For these items, a simplified scoring procedure was defined leading to the calculation of the additive ASF Score (range 0 - 24) for each patient. To determine cut-points of the ASF Score for the diagnosis of allergic airway disease we calculated the sensitivities, specificities and predictive values for all possible values of the score and for 3 prevalences. Results: The multivariate regression model identified 12 items (Nagelkerke R 2 = 0.532). Depending on the study purposes, 2 cut-points of the ASF Score are recommended that yield positive predictive values (at prevalence 17,7%) of 50% or of 67%, respectively. Conclusion: The ASF Questionnaire is an effective screening test to identify patients with possible allergic airway disease that is very short and easy to administer.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis results when mast cells and basophils are activated to release mediators. In these reactions, histamine and metabolites of histamine can be detected in the plasma and/or urine. However, the value of histamine as a marker substance for anaphylaxis is hampered by the fact that it is rapidly degraded and that the concentration of histamine metabolites in the urine also dependends on other factors, such as the intake of histamine-rich foods. The serine protease tryptase is the gene product of two genes, which are rather specifically expressed in mast cells: the α-protryptase gene and the p-tryptase gene. A formerly available immunoassay was directed against β-tryptase, the form of the enzyme that is released during anaphylaxis. The currently available commercial tryptase assay measures total tryptase and only an increase in comparison to basal concentrations may be used to confirm an anaphylaxis. Permanently elevated tryptase concentrations are a sign for systemic mastocytosis. Elevated serum tryptase concentrations were found in the majority of anaphylactic reactions to insect venoms, drugs and foods. There is a trend towards higher values in more severe reactions. In fatal anaphylaxis, only extensively increased serum tryptase values can confirm the diagnosis. There are reports of increased values of prostaglandin D2 and IL-6 after anaphylactic reactions, however, the value of these and other lipid mediators and cytokines in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis remains unclear. The demonstration of elevated concentrations of the mast cell mediators histamine and tryptase helps to confirm a suspected anaphylaxis and increases our understanding of the mechanism of those reactions.",

    "abstract": "Caterpillars of the pine and the oak processionary moth, endemic in many European countries, produce poisonous hairs (setae) from its third to fifth larval stage. These setae contain highly allergenic, urticating proteinsdefined as thaumetopoein which induces various symptoms of lepidopterism, most frequently associated with pruritus and dermatitis. T. pityocampa directly induce dermatitis by a toxic-irritative, non-IgE-mediated mechanism. Additionally, true allergenic reactions to Tha p 1, a highly immunogenic 15 kDa protein fraction has been demonstrated most recently by positive skin prick tests and specific IgE determination by immunoblotting. Preliminary investigations showed that cross-reacting thaumetopoein-like fractions occur in T. processionata. Herein, we report on a 40-year-old German female suffering from toxic-irritative dermatitis approximately two weeks after returning home from vacation to Portugal. The initially suspected communicable form of urticaria could be linked to a contact dermatitis produced by setae of the pine processionary caterpillar imported from Portugal by clothing and personal utensils. This is the first documented case of a severe form of processionary caterpillar dermatitis introduced from southern European recreational areas to Germany. Secondary infections have to be prevented therapeutically. Decontamination of setae from the personal environment as well as from personal utensils resulted in the effective prevention of new skin lesions. The documented case reveals that dermatitis caused by processionary caterpillars is obviously still widely unknown although sylvatic mass infestation by the oak processionary caterpillar does frequently occur in central Europe potentially causing outbreaks of lepidopterism.",

    "abstract": "Although the literature on urticaria is vast, little is known about seasonal variations regarding the appearance of acute urticaria (AU) in children. Therefore, we have conducted a retrospective study in a private pediatric office in a small town in southern Germany, evaluating seasonal variations and associated clinical symptoms in 150 children presenting with AU during 1995 - 2002. Subgroups of different ages were examined as well. Overall, the incidence of AU was 1.82%, was found in ages 0 - 13 years, with slightly more females (57%). Atopy was found in 16% of AU patients. Associated infectious diseases, mostly of the upper respiratory tract, were diagnosed in 56% of children. Surprisingly, in all patients, the lowest frequency ofAU was observed in summer, while the disease occurred more often in winter, with another peak in June. This variation was independent of sex, but was not observed in children of 5 years. During peak incidences, there were also more associated airway infections, and the disease was more severe, involving > 30 surface area, with more frequently associated angioedema. No correlations were seen between atopy and seasonal variations. These findings underline the significance of mostly viral airway infections as a cause of AU in children. On the basis of the peaks of incidence, influenza-, adeno-, respiratory syncytial, possibly also parainfluenzaand rhinoviruses must be considered in winter and different types of coxsackie-, corona- and adenoviruses in June.",

The clinical efficacy of commercially available allergoid products is hardly comparable to nonmodified allergens, because of their differing manufacturing methods, allergen compositions, therapy schemes and modifications, To ensure an evidence-based therapy, clinical efficacy of each allergoid should be proven by adequate clinical trials. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of available allergoid products in Germany for subcutaneous specific immunotherapy on the basis of the recommendations for clinical trials of the World Allergy Organization (WAO). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted and the clinical efficacy was analysed according to the recommendations of the WAO. Results: 6 of 9 double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) studies were included in the analysis. All trials were conducted with adults. A parallel literature search of German publications resulted in 2 DBPC studies. Clinical efficacy was documented for grass pollen allergoids in 3 studies with 3 products, and for mite allergoids in 2 studies with I product. Additionally, a German publication proved clinical efficacy in a DBPC study with a tree-allergoid preparation. There were no DBPC studies found for allergoid products with central European weeds. Moreover, studies showing long-term effects, prevention, carryover effects and studies in children were missing. Conclusion: Evidence of clinical efficacy, analysed according to the recommendations for clinical trials of the WAO, is limited to a few allergoid products and allergens.",

    "abstract": "Occupational disease and allergic bronchial asthma are the main occupational disease in the food processing industry registered by the institution for statutory accident insurance and prevention in the foodstuffs industry and the catering trade (BGN). In the years 1999 and 2000, about 26 Mio Euro were spent on occupational disease. Most of the money went into occupational retraining (about 22 Mio Euro), but only a few trainees were able to get an employment after retraining, because of the worse situation on the labor market. To create an alternative to this depressing situation the skin disease prevention program in the baking, hotel and catering trades (SDPP) was developed by the BGN, regional office Erfurt, the Department ofDermatology and Allergology, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, and the Research Centre for Applied System Safety and Industrial Medicine, Erfurt. The pilot phase was performed in Thuringia and Saxony. A detailed analysis of the occupational exposure of the employees and their personal occupational disease history was followed by the reevaluation of the patients' diagnosis and therapy. Individual care and protection regimes were provided and the application was practiced. Skin care and protection ointments were supplied during the program. Skin care and protection seminars as well as follow-up appointments were offered to the participants. From 1.10.1999 - 31.10.2001, 107 employees suffering from occupational hand dermatitis were included. Most of the employees (n = 84, 78%) showed signs and symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis. Follow-up date are available for 62 (58%) of the participants. In most of the cases, occupational hand dermatitis was caused by the ignorance of risk factors, the unawareness and unavailability of preventive measure. The interventions within the SDPP showed a significant advantage for long-term participants (> 6 months) of the program compared with a matched-control group. In 76% of the participants of the SDPP the lesions, cleared or improved substantially compared to 36% in the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, costs for rehabilitation and retraining could be halved by the intervention compared to the control group. These results underline the medical and economical efficacy of the SDPP.",

    "abstract": "Foods are common elicitors of allergic reactions. Whereas the majority of symptoms are mild, fatal reactions do occur. Foods represent the most common elicitor of anaphylaxis treated in emergency departments. Fatal anaphylaxis is caused by food in 1/3 of the cases, especially by peanuts, tree nuts, cows milk, shellfish and fish. Asthma bronchiale is the principal risk factor for a fatal reaction. Whereas a large inter- and intraindividual variability does exist, often minute amounts of food are sufficient to result in serious reactions. Although the majority of patients do know about their food anaphylaxis, many are not able to avoid the offending food completely. Education and training of patients and treating physicians is necessary. Thus, an anaphylaxis training and educational program is being constructed by the Arbeits-gemeinschaft Anaphylaxie Training and Education (AGATE) to better protect patients with prior anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Only approximately 15% of all adverse drug reactions are caused by true drug allergies. It can be difficult to make the diagnosis of a drug allergy and to identify the causal drug. The clinical pattern, including the temporal relationship, usually enables a suspected diagnosis only. In most situations skin tests are the allergological investigations of first choice. In prick tests and other intradermal tests a small amount of the incriminated drug is administered into the upper dermis, where it comes into contact with peri-vascular mast cells and T-lymphocytes. If the patient is sensitized, such contact may induce a local allergic skin reaction of both immediate and delayed type. In the patch test the incriminated drug is applied to the skin by an occlusive plaster. It can then permeate the epidermis and induce local skin reactions, predominantly of the delayed type. The sensitivity of skin tests is limited. It decreases in immediate type reactions, if the reaction dates back more than 6 months. Additionally it depends on which drug is involved. For the investigation of IgE-mediated allergies against the penicillin core-structure a test kit is a commercially available. However, the investigation of allergies against betalactam-antibiotics requires the inclusion of the offending drug, so that immunoreactions against the side chain structures can be identified. IgE-mediated allergic reactions against local aesthetics are extremely rare. The diagnostic value of intradermal skin tests in immediate reac-tions is limited because of a rather low specificity. T-cell mediated contact sensitizations against topically administered local aesthetics occur more frequently (often with ointments for haemorrhoids). According to recent data both immediate and delayed type reactions against radio-contrast media can be immune mediated and be reliably diagnosed by skin testing. IgE mediated allergies against heparins are rare. However, T cell mediated reactions against sub-cutaneously administered preparations are more frequent. The sensitivity and specifity of skin testing in the evaluation of such allergies are not known.",

    "abstract": "Though many occupations, animal keeper and breeder, veterinarians, horse trainer result in exposure to animal allergens, only epidemiologic studies in farmers elucidate the prevalence and course of occupational allergic airways diseases. Farmers undergo a mixed exposure, in addition to animal allergens they are exposed to other allergens like storage mites, dust of animal feed, gases and endotoxins. About 23% of farmers exposed to animals are sensitized against animal allergens, 4% develop an allergic asthma. Prevalence of occupational asthma is less in farmers compared to overall population, but for example in Germany about 5% of all occupational diseases are caused by occupational asthma in farmers. In Europe, depending on the way of animal keeping, up to 15% of occupational asthma is caused by cattle allergen. The diagnostic of occupational asthma has to confirm the disease itself and the clinical relevance of the sensitization against occupational animal allergens. The chronological course of disease and respiratory symptoms associated with typical work routine helps to decide on the causal connection. Modem technical prevention measures should lead to reduction of allergen exposure and minimize the risk of sensitization. The prognosis of occupational asthma depends on the duration of disease; the most effective preventive measure is the cession of exposure. Nevertheless bronchial hyperreactivity and respiratory symptoms persist in more than half of the cases. Secondary prevention is also important, besides regular medical examinations self-administered check lists, provided by the Agricultural Institutions for Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention, may be useful.",

    "abstract": "During the evolution, the immune system has been well prepared to handle protein antigens, but the interplay with xenobiotics was minimal and restricted to some substances in plants in low concentrations. The generation of millions of new molecules and their use in rather large amounts thus poses a rather unexpected new challenge to the human immune system, which can cause rather surprising reactions by the specific and unspecific immune system, which partly contradict the existing immunological dogmata. In this short review 4 topics are shortly presented: a) the rather frequent observation that certain i.v. applied drugs like neuromuscular blocking agents as well as radiocontrast media can cause anaphylactic reactions at the first encounter - which nevertheless appears to be IgE-mediated. For neuromuscular blocking agents the prior use of e.g. pholcodin, a cough sirup containing a tertiary amino group, may have been sensitizing; the crossreactive compound for a possible sensitization to radio-contrast media is unknown. b) The subclassification of Type IV reactions according to Gell and Coombs into IVa, IVb, IVc and IVd types: these reactions differ due to distinct functions of involved T cells, which recruit different inflammatory effector cells. This better explains the clinically often rather distinct clinical pictures elicited by drugs. c) The p-i concept, which implies a pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors, has been established using drug specific T cell clones and explains the generalized reaction to drugs. And last, d) the transfer of these new concepts to a better diagnostic of drug allergies using new in vitro tests.",

    "abstract": "Neural mechanisms have long been regarded as factors contributing to the pathogenesis of asthma and involved in airway hyperresponsiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the vagal cholinergic tone in patients with persistent allergic asthma is increased not only in acute asthma and if this cholinergic tone correlates with airway hyperresponsiveness. Methods: The study comprised 22 healthy control subjects and 40 patients with mild and moderate persistent allergic asthma. Diagnosis was established by clinical and functional follow-up: skin prick test, spirometry with bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide and methacholine challenge testing. Our results showed positive bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide in all patients with persistent allergic asthma - mean value of FEV 1 increased by 19.14 ± 6.74% (from 12.10 - 37.20%, p < 0.01). Methacholine challenge testing was also positive: mean value of FEV 1 decreased by 25.75 ± 5.16% (from 20.20 - 40.40%, p < 0.01) after inhalation concentrations between 0.03 and 2.0 mg/ml methacholine (PC 2O FEV 1 from 0.026 - 1,914 mg/ml). Correlations between methacholine challenge testing and bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide were positive, weak and statistically not significant for all parameters. Conclusion: Patients with persistent allergic asthma have increased cholinergic tone, and this tone correlates positive and weak with airway hyperresponsiveness.",

The mean age of patients was 38.4 years, the proportion of women was 56%. A total of 30% of patients were diagnosed with intermittent and 57% with persistent allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Other allergic diseases of the airways (possibly in addition) were seen in 15%, and chronic urticaria in 16% of patients. The switch to a 3rd generation antihistamine provided benefits especially for patients with strong to severe nasal obstruction in 64% of patients with intermittent and 53% of patients with persistent rhinoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, 61% of patients with chronic urticaria suffering from strong to severe pruritus achieved an improvement of symptoms when switched to a modem antihistamine. The tolerability of the antihistamine was rated as good or very good by 84% of generic drug users and by 96% of patients receiving a 3rd generation drug. The prevalence of adverse events was 5.4% under generic drugs and 1.7% under 3rd generation antihistamines. This practice survey documented a benefit for patients with allergic diseases switched from a generic to a 3rd generation antihistamine, both for symptom improvement and better tolerability as well as for improved patient information.",

    "abstract": "Background: For patients with food allergy there has been no alternative treatment to food allergen avoidance. In a study supported by the European union, a new approach aimed to reduce the allergenicity of foods of animal origin to achieve better tolerance. Patients and methods: the prevalence of food allergy was assessed by telephone interviews with more than 40000 persons in 10 European countries. By thermal and enzymatic the allergenicity of the animal food allergens hen's egg, cow's milk, beef and poultry was reduced. Patients with proven food allergy to those foods of animal origin were recruited and assessed allergologically. In-vitro cellular test systems were established. The allergenicity of food products were investigated before and after allergen reduction. Results: The prevalence of food allergy in Europe is 3% with considerable regional differences. In 41.1% of food allergic patients, food allergens of animal origin were thought to be responsible for eliciting symptoms. In total, 249 patients with food allergy were recruited. The threshold for eliciting symptoms was below the lowest test dose (e.g. 10μg egg powder) in the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge in 53 of 249 (21%) of patients, whereas 50 of 249 patients (20%) only reacted to the highest given dose (e.g. one full egg). Symptoms in the provocation test developed predominantly on the skin and in the gastrointestinal tract, however, also involved respiratory tract and cardiovascular system. Allergen-reduced cow's milk and hen's egg were produced and in part tolerated by patients in the skin prick test and provocation test. The extent of allergen reduction was characterized, also by cellular test systems involving mast cell lines. Conclusions: the concept of allergen reduction in food allergy is a new approach, which could reduce dietary interventions and support tolerance in food allergic patients.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is the most severe reaction of mast cell-dependent diseases and may cause death. Due to a degranulation of mast cells which can be either IgE-dependent or IgE-independent, result in a massive release of mediators which will, in turn, induce clinical symptoms like dyspnea or cardiovascular collapse. A mast cell degranulation is probably also possible due to Fcγ-receptor binding, however, here further research is needed. Histamin is one of the most potent mediators, but also several other mast cell mediators like leukotrienes, chymase, tryptase and the platelet-activating factor are released. The relevance of mediator measurements within the diagnostic work-up anaphylaxis is currently under investigation. These include the determination of carbopeptidase A3 whereas tryptase has already been confirmed to be increased after severe anaphylactic reactions. Until today there are no data regarding the frequency of anaphylaxis in German-speaking countries. Therefore, we established in collaboration with many allergy centers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland an internet-based questionnaire which covers severity, elicitating factors, cofactors but also therapeutical measures of anaphylaxis. The latest data indicate that insect venom, food and drugs are the most frequent elicitators of severe anapyhylactic reactions. We also registered two cases of death due to anaphylaxis, one caused by venom, the other caused by peanut. Cofactors like allergic asthma, cardiovascular diseases seem to play an important role as augmenting factors, but also physical activity and alcohol. Taken together, anaphylaxis needs attention within the medical community in order to improve the care of affected patients. The anaphylaxis registry is an important platform to gain more information to reach these goals.",

    "abstract": "The further increase of allergies in industrialised countries demands evidence-based measures of primary prevention. The recommendations as published in the Guideline of 2004 were updated and consented on the basis of a systematic literature search. Evidence was searched for the period February 2003 -May 2008 in the electronic databases Cochrane and MEDLINE as well as in reference lists of recent reviews and by contacting experts. The retrieved citations were screened for relevance first by title and abstract in a second step as full paper. Levels of evidence were assigned to each included study and the methodological quality of the studies was assessed as high or low. Finally, the revised recommendations were formally consented (nominal group process) by representatives of relevant societies and organisations including a self-help group. Of originally 4.556 hits, 217 studies (4 Cochrane Reviews, 14 Metaanalyses, 19 RCTs, 115 cohort- and 35 case-control studies) were included and critically appraised. Grossly unchanged remained the recommendations on avoiding environmental tobacco smoke, breast feeding over 4 months (alternatively hypoallergenic formulas for risk babies), avoiding a mould-promoting indoor climate, vaccination according to current recommendations, and avoidance of furry pets (especially cats) in risk babies. The recommendation on reducing the house dust mite allergen exposure as a measure of primary prevention was omitted. A prolonged introduction of solid foods and a dietary restriction of potent food allergens for primary prevention cannot be recommended due to insufficient evidence. New recommendations were passed concerning fish consumption (during pregnancy/breast feeding and as solid food in the first year), avoidance of overweight and reducing the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants. The revision of this guideline on a profound evidence basis led to a conformation of existing recommendations, substantial revisions, and new recommendations. Thereby it is possible to give evidence-based and up-to-date recommendations of primary prevention of allergies.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus germs constitutively have the possibility to release classical and egc locus-derived enterotoxins (SEs) which have superantigen activity, and effectively modify the functions of T- and B-cells, eosinophils, and other inflammatory and structural cells. The stimulation may lead to a TH 2 -polarized eosinophilic inflammation as well as a multiclonal IgE production, aggravating airway disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Recently, Staphylococcus aureus could be demonstrated to reside intraepithelially, and potentially to release superantigens into the tissue from within the epithelial cells. An immune defect, either in the innate or adaptive immunity, might be responsible for this phenomenon. Follicle-like structures and lymphocyte accumulations, specifically binding enterotoxins, can be found within the mucosal tissue. Interestingly, also IgE antibodies to enterotoxins can be found in the majority of aspirin-sensitive patients, in nasal polyps and severe asthma alike. We here summarize the current evidence from animal and human studies for an active role of SEs in allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, asthma, COPD and, finally, early childhood wheezing, and discuss the similarities between those disease manifestations. As a principle, the occurrence of IgE antibodies to SEs correlates to disease severity in terms of total IgE formation, inflammatory markers and clinical expression of disease. Preliminary evidence from animal models underlines the high potency of SEs to induce or modulate disease, and a few pilot intervention trials may serve as proof of concept for the impact of SEs on disease severity. However, therapeutic approaches are so far limited and empirical, and need further improvement to tackle this currently underestimated clinical challenge.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the factors associated with atopic asthma in the adult Serbian population. Method: A case-control study of 134 atopic asthmatics and 134 non-asthmatics was carried out, during the period from March 2002 June 2003. The cases and controls were matched by sex, age (± 5 years) and place of residence (urban, rural). A detailed questionnaire based on the latest research results in the field was used to obtain information on the known risk factors. Stressful life events were recorded using Paykels Interview for Recent Life Events. Results: According to multivariate conditional logistic regression, the following factors were independently significantly associated with the occurrence of atopic asthma: allergic rhinitis (OR = 30.74, 95% CI = 7.62 - 123.98, p < 0.001), sinusitis (OR = 5.06,95% CI = 1.27 -20.17, p = 0.022), and lower respiratory tract infections in childhood (OR = 5.72, 95% CI = 1.65 - 19.87, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Our study indicates potentially important roles of allergic rhinitis, sinusitis and infections of the lower airways in childhood as factors increasing the risk of atopic asthma. Recognizing of the risk factors is important for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease.",

In this review further indications for anti-IgE antibodies are discussed which have been addressed in clinical studies or observational reports. Patients with severe peanut allergy have already been investigated in a controlled clinical study in 2003 with another anti-IgE antibody (which has, however, not been approved for the treatment so far). This antibody increased the threshold of peanut allergens in oral provocation tests. In a first clinical study it could be shown that omalizumab may have similar beneficial effects in food allergy. Patients with atopic dermatitis respond to omalizumab to a variable degree which has been described in small open observational studies so far. Interestingly, the substance has been shown to work in cold urticaria and mastocytosis - the mechanism of action is however still unclear in these diseases. One controlled study performed with health workers suffering from IgE-mediated latex allergy showed a beneficial effect of omalizumab. These publications show that anti-IgE may have therapeutical effects in a number of disease entities, however prospective controlled studies are necessary for the indications discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Background: Theophylline has been widely used for decades in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because of its bronchodilator activity as well as its immunomodulatory, anti inflammatory, and bronchoprotective effects. On the other hand, its use has declined with the advent of potent steroid inhalants. In Austria, the current frequency of prescription is 6 in 1,000 insurants, according to Austrian health insurance data. Slow-release theophylline has become an established medication for asthma, and the development of adequate assays made drug monitoring readily available. Since the efficacy and toxicity of theophylline are closely related to the serum drug concentration, reflected by an adequate serum level of 10 - 20 mg/l, monitoring of its serum concentration is essential. Methods: This was an open-label, 1-year prospective, monocenter study, performed in male as well as female patients consecutively admitted to the Department of Environmental Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria. The only inclusion criterion was taking a theophylline medication at the time of admission. Test parameters were gender, age, body mass index, nicotin abuse, medication, blood levels of the transaminases as well as serum levels of theophylline (measured by EIA). Results: 25 patients could be included (17 female, 8 male). At the time of admission, only 20% of the patients under theophylline medication had an adequate theophylline serum level, in 76% of the patients the drug was underdosed, in 4% the theophylline was found to be overdosed. After 3 days of controlled intake of theophylline preparations in 74% of the patients, an adequate theophylline level could be measured, but 36% of the patients continued to be underdosed. Conclusions: Because of the wide variation in theophylline metabolism between individuals and the narrow therapeutic index of its use, monitoring of theophylline serum levels is essential to reach an effective steady state. Despite this common knowledge, the data of our study suggest that the majority of outpatients may be below an effective level. Limitation of our study is the small number of patients included, and a larger study may be necessary to confirm the results.",

    "abstract": "Cosmetics are a heterogeneous group of products, consisting of products abundantly used as shampoos or cleansing agents on the one hand, and of products not so frequently used as those applied for decorative purposes such as nail cosmetics. Due to a differing frequency of use and due to differing (chemical) properties of the ingredients, unwanted effects due to different product categories are observed with differing frequency and with differing intensity. In principle, cosmetics may have systemic effects on the organism, and local effects on the skin. Two systemic effects are essentially discussed: endocrinological and cancerogenic effects. Whereas endocrinological effects very probably are no reason of concern, the results of many epidemiological studies on cancerogenicity of hair dyes are equivocal. Major unwanted local effects on the skin comprise irritant (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Although less frequent than ICD, sensitization must be considered as a serious unwanted effect, as, once acquired, it constitutes a remaining risk for ACD due to a non-cosmetic-related exposure (e.g. occupational). Main sensitizer are certain fragrance compounds, preservatives and hair dyes. The incidence of cosmetic-related ACD is about 0.1%, i.e. 100 per 100.000 per year. Although the frequency of unwanted effects due to cosmetics can be regarded as very low, the remaining cases still require continuous surveillance and efforts to reduce their occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Most of the intolerance syndromes to alcohol are due to a metabolic cause like a genetically or pharmacologically related enzymatic defect or due to systemic diseases like Hodgkins disease, mastocytosis or hypereosinophilia. Whether an immunological intolerance to alcohol exists is unclear, but in rare cases such as urticarial or anaphylactoid reactions it may be probable. A 25-year-old patient suffered repeatedly from anaphylactoid reactions after ingestion of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine and spirits. Prick tests with acetic acid (5%) and acetaldehyde (50/100%) were positive, prick tests with ethanol (9.6/80/96%) were negative. The open oral provocation test with 10 ml ethanol 20% caused palmar erythema and a wheal on the abdomen. Due to these results, an immunological pathogenesis could be postulated. In this case, apparently, ethanol itself does not act as an allergen, but its metabolic products, acetaldehyde and acetic acid do. Positive prick tests to acetic acid are documented in the literature. However, the positive prick test to acetaldehyde in our patient is unusual. Until now, acetaldehyde was regarded as a hapten. A positive prick test would only be expected with a complete neoantigen. So, we could postulate, that in rare cases, acetaldehyde itself can react also as an antigen. On the other hand, in our patient, the prick test to acetic acid was also positive. Possibly, our patient is sensitized to both, acetic acid and acetaldehyde. It remains, however, unresolved, whether only one or both of the molecules are relevant for the clinical reaction.",

    "abstract": "In allergic rhinitis, cross linking of IgE molecules upon allergen contact induces degranulation of mast cells and basophils within the mucosal tissue, and results in the release of typical mediators, which consecutively induce the well-known symptoms. Omalizumab counteracts these interactions by a reduction in serum levels of free IgE. Therapy targeted against IgE also interferes with its binding to the high- as well as the low-affinity receptors, inhibiting the amplification of the Th2-type response. Treatment of allergic rhinitis with anti-IgE has been shown to be safe and to reduce specific symptoms. Furthermore, the combination ofomalizumab with specific immunotherapy (SIT) may offer not only an increase in efficacy, but also in safety in appropriate patients. The currently available studies with omalizumab in allergic rhinitis, as monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapy, are summarized. In nasal polyp disease, a local polyclonal IgE response has recently been described, initiated by Staphylococcus aureus-derived enterotoxins, which at least modifies the inflammatory reaction within the tissue. Evidence accumulates that these enterotoxins act as superantigens resulting in a polyclonal T- and B cell activation with massive IgE formation within the airways. Because of the polyclonality, a range of allergens could possibly maintain a constant degranulation of mast cells present in polyp tissue, which may contribute to the disease severity. We here discuss a proof-of-concept treatment trial with omalizumab in nasal polyposis, which in case of a positive therapeutic response, also would open the door for anti-IgE treatment approaches for severe nonatopic lower airway disease.",

    "abstract": "Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a proven therapeutic option for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Many guidelines or national practice guidelines have been produced but the evidence- based method varies, many are complex and none propose care pathways. This paper reviews care pathways for AIT using strict criteria and provides simple recommendations that can be used by all stakeholders including health professionals. The decision to prescribe AIT for the patient should be individualized and based on the relevance of the allergens, the persistence of symptoms despite appropriate medications according to guidelines as well as on the availability of good-quality and efficacious extracts. Allergen extracts cannot be regarded as generics. Immunotherapy is selected by specialists for stratified patients. There are no currently available validated biomarkers that can predict AIT success. In adolescents and adults, AIT should be reserved for patients with moderate/severe rhinitis or for those with moderate asthma who, despite appropriate pharmacotherapy and adherence, continue to exhibit exacerbations that appear to be related to allergen exposure, except in some specific cases. Immunotherapy may be even more advantageous in patients with multimorbidity. In children, AIT may prevent asthma onset in patients with rhinitis. mHealth tools are promising for the stratification and follow up of patients.",

    "abstract": "Hymenoptera venom allergy is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction following a honeybee, vespid, or ant sting. Systemic-allergic sting reactions have been reported in up to 7.5.4threatening anaphylaxis. Patients should carry an emergency kit containing an adrenaline autoinjector, H1-antihistamines, and corticostcroids depending on the severity of their previous sting reaction(s). The only treatment to prevent further systemic sting reactions is venom immunotherapy. This guideline has been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology's (EAACI) Taskforce on Venom Immunotherapy as part of the EAACI Guidelines on Allergen Immunotherapy initiative. The guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of venom immunotherapy, has been informed by a formal systematic review and meta-analysis and produced using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) approach. The process included representation from a range of stakeholders. Venom immunotherapy is indicated in venom-allergic children and adults to prevent further moderate-to-severe systemic sting reactions. Venom immunotherapy is also recommended in adults with only generalized skin reactions as it results in significant improvements in quality of life compared to carrying an adrenaline autoinjector. This guideline aims to give practical advice on performing venom immunotherapy. Key sections cover general considerations before initiating venom immunotherapy, evidence-based clinical recommendations, risk factors for adverse events and for relapse of systemic sting reaction, and a summary of gaps in the evidence.",

IVIP29-02 (Dymista (R)) is a novel drug for AR treatment consisting of a new intranasal formulation of the antihistamine azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and the nasal glucocorticoid fluticasone propionate (FP).\r\nMethods: Based on a literature review we summarise the results of several clinical trials regarding efficacy and safety of MP29-02 compared to AZE and FP monotherapy and placebo.\r\nResults: Compared to AZE, FP, and placebo, MP29-02 has demonstrated a superior efficacy in regard to nasal and ocular symptoms. Patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) treated with MP29-02 showed an up to 7 days faster response of nasal symptoms than AZE and up to 5 days faster than FP treatment. Also, in patients with chronic rhinitis, MP29-02 significantly improved nasal symptoms compared to the FP therapy.\r\nDiscussion and conclusion: MP29-02 represents a novel and promising combination for the treatment of AR with superior efficacy over current first line therapies.",

Eine Voraussetzung ist oftmals die Stratifizierung der Patienten. Dies bedeutet, unter der Überschrift einer Erkrankungsentität immer spezifischere Subentitäten (Endotypen) auch gezielt behandeln zu können. Die Entschlüsselung von komplexen Zusammenhängen verschiedener Erkrankungen erlauben zudem die gezielte Neutralisierung oder Blockade ganz bestimmter Moleküle und Pathways. Auch bekannte Therapieverfahren werden optimiert, nach den neuesten Erkenntnissen modifiziert und in neuen Studiendesigns analysiert. In diesem Kapitel werden neue Therapieansätze, sich im Zulassungsverfahren befindliche neue Therapien sowie Konzepte vorgestellt. Die Darstellung umfasst Urtikaria, Anaphylaxie und Mastozytose, Ansätze zur atopischen Dermatitis, Konzepte zur allergischen Rhinitis und zum Asthma sowie den letzten Stand der Entwicklung zur spezifischen Immuntherapie.",

    "abstract": "Neuronale Faktoren spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei allergischen Erkrankungen. Es gibt dabei zum einen die lokale Interaktion von Nerven- und Immunsystem am Ort der allergischen Entzündung. Eine Reizung der sensorischen Nerven führt u. a. zu einer lokalen Freisetzung von sensorischen Neuropeptiden in der Umgebung der Reizung. Die lokal ausgeschütteten Neuropeptide bewirken dann am Ort der Reizung eine lokale Reaktion, die als neurogene Entzündung bezeichnet wird. Dabei kommt es zu einer verstärkten Durchblutung, Muskelkontraktion, Drüsenaktivierung und Immunregulation und so zu einer Verstärkung von allergischen Reaktionen. Zum anderen gibt es die zentralnervöse Steuerung der (immunologischen) Homöostase durch z. B. Stresshormone und die direkte Innervation von lymphatischen Organen. Dieser Mechanismus wird für die Therapie von allergischen Erkrankungen ausgenutzt. Für das allergische Asthma ist das besonders deutlich. Zentrale Bausteine der pharmakologischen Therapie ist die agonistische Stimulation von Glukokortikoidrezeptoren und β2-adrenergen Rezeptoren. Damit werden zwei zentrale Mediatoren der physiologischen Stressantwort pharmakologisch imitiert, nämlich Kortisol und Adrenalin.",

Much less common is that also bites of blood-sucking insects (mosquitos, horseflies, flies, bugs, lice and fleas) and arachnids (ticks) represent relevant elicitors of allergy. Although, local cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are more common, also severe systemic reactions can occur. In the last decades the molecular knowledge of the allergen composition of hymenoptera venoms has led to considerable improvements of diagnostic and therapeutic options. Even though bloodsucking insects might be the most common elicitors of allergy overall, surprisingly little is known about their relevant allergens and possible cross-reactivities. The lack of diagnostic tools in this area results in the fact that these allergies remain underdiagnosed and-treated. © 2016 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.",

    "abstract": "Depending on the literature source 10 - 15% of all asthma diseases in adults are related to the workplace. Work related asthma can be triggered by allergens as well as by chemicals. The diagnostic of work related asthma includes work place related medical history, allergological tests for occupational allergens and the attempt to objectify the reported association of symptoms to the workplace, for example by monitoring lung function with and without exposure at the workplace. During career counselling patients with allergic asthma should be advised against taking a job with occupational allergen exposure. Also in patients with occupational asthma relations between psychological comorbidities like depression or anxiety can be stated. Quality of life in patients with occupational asthma is low compared to patients with fateful asthma, possibly due to extensive social and financial consequences. Psycho- logical factors can also fake an occupational asthma, as it is known in vocal cord dysfunction, sick building syndrome or anxiety due to emissions of laser printers in offices.",

    "abstract": "Insektengiftallergie führt bei etwa ¼ der Bevölkerung zu gesteigerten örtlichen Reaktionen, bei etwa 3,5 % zu Anaphylaxie. Auslöser sind meist Honigbienen oder Faltenwespen. Erforderlich ist eine langfristige Versorgung dieser Patienten: Anleitung zur Allergenvermeidung, Verordnung einer persönlichen Notfallmedikation, Erlernen der Selbsthilfe bei erneutem Stich. Bei Patienten mit Anaphylaxie ist die SIT indiziert. Sie erfolgt auf der Grundlage einer umfassenden allergologischen Diagnostik, die neben Anamnese und Nachweis der Sensibilisierung v. a. individuelle Risiken für besonders schwere Anaphylaxie (z. B. Mastozytose, ACE-Hemmer-Behandlung) und die Insektenexposition erfasst. Kontraindikationen der SIT sind zu beachten und gegen das Risiko erneuter Stichreaktionen abzuwägen. Die Wirksamkeit der SIT wird durch einen Stichprovokationstest überprüft. Kommt es wieder zu einer systemischen Reaktion, so kann durch eine erhöhte Erhaltungsdosis der SIT fast immer ein Therapieerfolg erreicht werden. Die Beendigung der SIT ist eine individuelle Entscheidung, die insbesondere vom Risikoprofil des Patienten abhängt.",

    "abstract": "Worker and patient education has been shown to be of importance in the management of established cases of occupational dermatitis as well as a tool for primary prevention of diseases. In the framework of primary prevention, an interventional study concentrated on hairdressers' apprentices. At the end of the training program, 80% of the panelists of the interventional group and 66% of the control group had no skin changes (p < 0.05). A project of secondary individual prevention comprising dermatological and educational intervention has shown that 79.5% (n = 117) ofthe project participants could remain in work, opposed to 60% (n = 80) in a control group. To evaluate a program on tertiary prevention, patients with occupational skin diseases resistant to standardized outpatient care, that had been admitted to hospital, were questioned about the status of skin and profession condition 1 year after hospital release. The majority (65.9%, n = 232) of the participants had remained in their profession and practised the advised skin care strategies (81%). Establishing a formal consensus on what works in workers and patient education in occupational skin diseases and encouraging research about what is unknown, should be a priority. The description of variations in clinical practice has provided a useful impetus for fostering consensus and eliminating care of uncertain effectiveness. The concept of self-efficacy beliefs is of great importance and will be discussed. In teaching methods, equal emphasis is placed on the transmission of information as on the development of practical know-how.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Paraphenylenediamine (PPD) was identified as the major allergen responsible for most contact reactions due to black henna tattoos. Lawsone, a naphthoquinone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinon) and the allergenic compound in henna, seemed to have low sensitization potential. As a consequence, lawsone was not considered important in adverse reactions to henna tattoos. Methods: 12 Patients with adverse reactions to black henna tattoos were investigated. Epicutaneous tests were performed using a standard series. Furthermore, PPD at a concentration of 1% and lawsone at a concentration of 10% were used. The substances were applied to the upper back. Readings were made after 3 days. Reactions were scored as recommended by the ICDRG. Results: Patch test results revealed 11 allergic reactions to PPD 1%, 4 allergic reactions to lawsone 10%, 4 to benzocaine 5% and 2 to IPPD 0,1%. Conclusion: All patients with allergic reactions after black henna tattoos reacted as expected to PPD, but 4 of 11 also to lawsone. In this context, lawsone might have more relevance than previously assumed. Furthermore, 4 of 11 patients showed cross-sensitization to benzocaine which, in this circumstance, might be attributed more clinical value as well. Taken these observations and the rare occurrence of contact allergic reactions due to lawsone into consideration, it seems that the allergic reaction caused by the potent allergen PPD triggers sensitization to weak allergens.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The analysis of nasal secretion (NS) has become a standard procedure in recent years. To obtain a representative sample of NS, nasal lavage is the method of choice in many cases. However, the reliability of this method is reduced because the dilution factor of the NS by the nasal lavage fluid (NALF) is unknown. Our study was conducted to develop a reliable method to calculate this dilution factor. Method We determined urea concentrations in NALF, NS and plasma in 18 healthy subjects and 17 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis to calculate the dilution factor and validated our method by comparing albumin and urea in NALF and in plasma before and after nasal provocation with histamine in 5 healthy controls. Results: A strong correlation was found between urea concentration in plasma and in NS: r 2 = 0.82 (p < 0.0001) for controls and r 2 = 0.91 (p < 0.0001) for patients, so that the following equations can be used: dilution factor = [urea plasma] x 1.2 / [urea in NALF] and [substance in NS] = dilution factor x [substance in NALF]. Conclusions: Urea concentrations, measured in plasma and in NALF, are valid parameters to calculate the dilution factor of NS in NALF.",

    "abstract": "Pollinosis during spring (March/April) is attributed mostly to birch (Betula sp.) Pollen (BP). Due to an increasing number of ash (Fraxinus sp.) pollen (AP) counted in Switzerland during the last decades, their clinical relevance was evaluated in a study from the Allergy Unit in Zurich, published 1994 in this journal. Patients suffering from the so-called spring pollinosis were sensitized not only to hazel, alder and birch pollen, but also frequently to AP. In 72% of the skin prick test-positive patients to AP, nasal provocation tests were also positive. Because of moderate cross-reactivity to BP and significant monovalent sensitization, it was concluded that AP should be included in the routine prick skin testing (SPT) of patients suffering from spring pollinosis, when AP are present in the environment. Therefore, AP should also be included in vaccines for specific immunotherapy (SIT) of patients with tree pollen allergies. The genus Fraxinus belongs to the family Oleaceae, closely related to jasmine (Jasminum), lilac (Syringa), privet (Ligustrum), forsythia (Forsythia) and olive (Olea). Using ash and olive pollen extracts for IgE inhibition studies, evidence was provided for the presence of cross-reactive allergens/epitopes in both pollen sources. This rises the possibility of symptoms of AP allergic patients from Northern Europe, when travelling in the Mediterranean area, where olive pollen (OP) are important allergens and vice versa for OP-sensitized patients. In clinical practice, the indication for SIT is often based on positive results of both, SPT and IgE determination, usually by the CAP method, as nasal provocation tests are too much time-consuming. Observations in the own private office about discrepancy between the results of SPT and CAP have shown that the CAP of Fraxinus americana (tl5), having been used until now in the clinical routine, is in the described cases, despite high cross-reactivity in former studies, less sensitive than a preparation from Fraxinus excelsior. Therefore, extracts from Fraxinus excelsior should be used for diagnosis (in vivo and in vitro) and therapy of AP-allergic patients in our countries.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Allergic rhinitis is a chronic respiratory inflammatory disease affecting many aspects of patients daily activities. The aim of the present study was the comparison of quality of life between intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis patients in pollen season and to test measurement properties of the Serbian version of Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Patients and methods: The investigation comprised 75 outpatients with intermittent and 25 outpatients with persistent allergic rhinitis, recorded from March to November 2002 at the Institute of Allergology and Immunology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade. Medical Outcome Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and RQLQ were used in the study. Results: Postnasal drip (t = 1.977, p = 0.051), itchy eyes (t = 2.756, p = 0.007), sore eye (t = 2.925, p = 0.004) and swollen eyes (t = 2.168, p = 0.033) were significantly more discomfortable to patients with intermittent than with persistent rhinitis, while mopping the floor was more troublesome to patients with persistent rhinitis (t = 3.166, p = 0.002) According to final multivariate logistic regression model, physical functioning (RR = 1.030, p = 0.020, 95% CI = 1.00 - 1.06) and sore eyes (RR = 1.546, p = 0.003, 95% CI = 1.16 - 2.07) were variables by which the patients with persistent and intermittent rhinitis differed significantly. Conclusion: Intermittent rhinitis patients in comparison with persistent rhinitis patients experienced significantly worse quality of life during pollen season. Serbian version of RQLQ has good discriminative properties and high reliability, and the specificity of our RQLQ version has been confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by variable bronchial obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity associated with chronic inflammation in which eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells are involved and activated. Hyperreactivity is manifested by coughing or dyspnea induced by allergens, nonspecific stimuli (i.e. cold air, dust, tobacco smoke) and respiratory tract infection. Diagnosis is based on careful medical history with respect to bronchial hyperreactivity, on clinical findings including wheezing at forced long expiration manoeuvres, on lung function tests, and on allergen testing. An asthma attack requires oxygen insufflation, stronger inhaled or even systemic bronchodilation, and a high-dose systemic anti-inflammatory therapy. Long-term asthma therapy aims at a symptom-free course of the disease, which cannot be achieved in all patients, and at the prevention of chronic inflammation which results in an irreversible remodeling process. Drug treatment is performed according to evidence-based guidelines with increasing extent in 4 steps (I - IV). In persisting asthma (II - IV), inhaled corticosteroids are an essential component of asthma therapy. Subcutaneous specific immunotherapy is recommended if an allergen is clinically relevant and cannot be avoided. Patients with house dust mite allergy benefit from encasing of pillow and mattress. In children older than 12 years with severe allergic asthma, treatment with recombinant humanized anti-IgE antibody is a new option. A continuing individual education of all patients and parents is essential to establish correct disease management for all patients. If there is no satisfactory stabilization, a careful differential diagnosis is required using various lung function tests, recently developed techniques for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (e.g. measuring nasal potential difference to evaluate the trasnsepithelial chloride transport, complete mutation analysis of the cystic fibrosis gene) and, if necessary, bronchoscopy to exclude foreign body aspiration etc. In addition, pulmonary rehabilitation, including group education, should be attained by means of validated rehabilitation hospitals.",

    "abstract": "In the majority of affected patients mastocytosis presents with no or only minor symptoms. Symptoms may be induced by spontaneous or IgE-mediated release of mediators from mast cells. Immediate-type-like symptoms may occur only at the skin, but may also present as anaphylaxis. Organ malfunction or failure can result from an increase of mast cells in various organs but is rare. This review focuses on the more common types of mastocytosis and their corresponding treatment. As mastocytosis is a rare disease, controlled studies are scarce which evaluate larger numbers of affected patients. Up to now, there is no cure for mastocytosis. If treatment is necessary, it depends on the dominating symptoms. There are 2 different treatment options: symptomatic therapy of symptoms induced by mediator release from mast cells and/or cytoreductive therapy. For general prevention it is essential to avoid mast cell release and to equip patients with an emergency kit. We provide patients with a short written information which is to be presented to the treating physician. Through this information we indicate those drugs which may potentially induce mast cell release and which should only be given under certain measures of precaution. Immediate-type-like symptoms induced by mast cell release may be relieved by antihistamines. For cutaneous symptoms treatment with topical or oral psoralens and UVA-radiation (PUVA) may sometimes be very effective. In patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy, venom immunotherapy is urgently indicated. According to current knowledge it is necessary to continue this therapy for the rest of the patients life. In patients with systemic mastocytosis osteoporosis shall not be overlooked. Cytoreductive treatment is only necessary in patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis.",

Wir berichten uber eine 16-jahrige Patientin, die unter einer Bienengift-SIT wiederholt systemische anaphylaktische Reaktionen erlitt.

Im Anschluss an die letzte Allergen-Injektion in den rechten Oberarm entwickelte die Patientin therapieresistente Schmerzen im Bereich von Thorax und linkem Arm. Mit Abnahme der Schmerzsymptomatiknach einigen Tagen traten sensible Ausfalle in beiden Handen auf, innerhalb von 2 Wochen entwickelte sich eine schlaffe Parese des linken Arms sowie eine linksbetonte Zwerchfellparese. Neurophysiologische Untersuchungen waren mit einer Plexus-brachialis-Neuropathie (syn. Neuralgische Amyotrophie, NA) vereinbar. Nach einer systemischen Kortikosteroidbehandlung im Fruhstadium sowie unter intensiver Physiound Ergotherapie konnte innerhalb eines Jahres eine weitgehende Ruckbildung der Parese von Arm und Zwerchfell erreicht werden. Die Hyposensibilisierung wurde nicht weitergefuhrt. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen der entzundlichen Erkrankung des Plexus brachialis und der Hymenopterengift-SIT ist anzunehmen.",

Insbesondere zum wissenschaftlichen Kenntnisstand nichtallergischer Uberempfindlichkeitsreaktionen bestehen grose Defizite. Ein Beispiel ist die Histamin-unvertraglichkeit, die. aufgrund der starken Thematisierung in den Medien und im Internet von Betroffenen oftmals als Ausloser ihrer Gesundheitsbeschwerden vermutet wird. Die wissen-schaftliehe Evidenz fur die postulierten Zusammen-hange ist begrenzt, eine verlassliche Labarbestirnmung zur definitiven Diagnose nicht vorhanden. Obwohl wissen-schaftliche Untersuchungen zur Unvertraglichkeit gegenuber exogen zugefuhrtem Histamin bisher ausschlieslich bei Erwachsenen durchgefuhrt wurden, wird die Diagnose auch bei Kindern und Jugendlichen gestellt, mit oftmals ein-schneidenden Konsequenzen fur den Speiseplan der Betroffenen. Die vorliegende Leitlinie der Arbeitsgruppe Nahrungsmittelallergie der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Allergologie und klinische Immunologie (DGAKI) in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Arzteverband Deutscher Allergologen (ADA) und der Gesellschaft fur Padiatrisehe Allergologie und Umweltmedizin (GPA) fasst wichtige Aspekte zur Histaminunvertraglichkeit und deren Konsequenzen fur die Diagnostik und Therapie zusammen.",

    "abstract": "In-vitro diagnostics of Hymenoptera venom allergy Patients with a history of anaphylactic sting reactions require an allergological work-up (history, in-vitro tests, and skin tests) to clarify indications on venom immunotherapy and on the type of venom to be used. To demonstrate a venom sensitisation, measurement of IgE-antibodies (sIgE) specific to the natural composite venom is the standard in-vitro method. In-vitro tests are performed after a field sting reaction. After a sting, an increase of sIgE concentrations, which is followed by a decrease, indicates a previous exposure, and may help to identify the culprit venom. If the eliciting insect is doubtful, it is recommended to do repeated measurements shortly after a sting. In adults measurement of baseline serum tryptase concentration should be included into routine diagnostics of venom allergy. If a sensitisation to the presumably causative composite venom cannot be demonstrated, one may determine sIgE to recombinant COD-free allergen compounds, thereby possibly demonstrating a sensitisation to molecular venom allergens. In addition, one should consider the involvement of in Germany rare elicitors of insect sting anaphylaxis, such as bumble bees, hornets, Dolichovespula, or Polistes. If these rare elicitors could have been involved into allergic reactions, one should test patients for IgE specific to the respective venom. Moreover, several cellular tests (e.g., basophil activation test) are available to confirm venom sensitisation. Herein basophils, which carry cell-bound sIgE, can be used to confirm the involvement of suspected venoms (e.g., by showing a histamine release or up-regulation of cell surface markers upon incubation with venom allergens). Double sensitisation to both honey bee and vespid venom may either indicate true double sensitisation or cross sensitisation. In double-sensitized patients, inhibition tests and tests using molecular allergens may help to clarify the diagnosis. Results of the above mentioned in-vitro tests, however, do not precisely correlate with the clinical relevance of the putative elicitor. Double sensitisation to both honey bee and vespid venom may either indicate true double sensitisation or cross sensitisation. In double-sensitized patients inhibition tests, and tests with molecular allergens may help to specify the diagnosis. None of the mentioned in-vitro tests, however, allows a precise prognosis with respect to clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Whereas the efficacy of the specific immunotherapy (SIT) in pollen allergy has been established, its consequence on the pollen-associated food allergy particularly the oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is less clear. In a retrospective study, we investigated the effect of SIT with pollen extracts in pollen-allergic subjects on the OAS. In addition, we looked for factors that could be prognostic for the change of OAS. 72 subjects (39 male, 33 female with a mean age of 32 years) allergic to pollen with a concomitant pollen-associated food allergy, namely OAS, who have been treated for an average of 2,0 years by SIT were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. For control served 40 individuals (17 male, 23 female; mean age 29 years) allergic to pollen and a pollen-associated food allergy (OAS) without SIT. 38 of 72 subjects (53%) treated with SIT had an improvement of their OAS. However, 23 (32%) claimed an unchangeable and 11 (15%) even an increase of the OAS. Of the controls, an improvement was realized in only 3 individuals (8%). 20 of them (50%) declared no change and 17 a worsening of the OAS. In conclusion, our results suggest that pollen-associated food allergy, specifically the OAS, can be reduced in more than half of the patients by SIT. On the other hand, in 15% of the SIT-treated collective an expansion of the spectrum of foods inducing symptoms was experienced. A successful development of the OAS by SIT seems to occur if patients are older than 20 years of age, have a clinical relevant birch pollen allergy and suffer from an intensive OAS. Failure regarding OAS seems more likely if SIT with birch pollen is combined with grass pollen extracts.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Cross-reactivity between house dust mite and molluscs or crustacean has been reported in the past, mainly French and Italian publications are related to this subject. In our region this house-dust mite associated food allergy seems to play a less important role. Patients: 33 patients consulting our outpatients department because of a clinically relevant type-I-sensitization to house dust mite were included in the study. The relevance of a possible house dust mite related food allergy due to cross-reactive IgE antibodies was studied by a questionnaire, skin prick tests and in vitro assays, as well. Results: 29 patients consumed shrimps, but only 2 patients reported on adverse reactions after consumption. Snails were rarely eaten, only one person regularly eats snails, 10 persons sporadically, but 22 persons never eat snails. No adverse effects were reported after consumption of snails. The two persons with clinical symptoms after consumption of shrimps had positive skin prick test results in the prick to prick test, but specific IgE was detected in one case. Conclusion: In our opinion patients suffering from a sensitization to house dust mite should be informed about possible related food allergies to molluscs and crustacean in spite of the fact that such adverse reactions are quite rare. Therefore this related food allergy can not be compared to the mugwort/celery syndrome. Patients with a food allergy after consumption of invertebrates should be examined if they are sensitized to house dust mite because in adults food allergy is mainly due to cross-reactivity between inhalative and food allergens.",

    "abstract": "Although allergy to lettuce has been described only rarely thus far, it is a plant-derived food that has to be considered as responsible for severe reactions after its ingestion. Allergic reactions to lettuce are usually associated with hay fever. Our case is a good example of a systemic reaction due to lettuce ingestion in a 3.5-year-old boy with pollen sensitization, without hay fever symptoms. Diagnosis of lettuce allergy with specific IgE may be difficult because of the variability in IgE response. Oral food challenge with lettuce is the gold standard in the diagnosis of lettuce allergy. To our knowledge, lettuce allergy without respiratory symptoms (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma or both) due to pollen allergy has not been reported before. This is the first case with lettuce allergy without hay fever symptoms but with pollen sensitization. Lettuce allergy should, therefore, be considered in children with recurrent angioedema and urticaria with or without hay fever.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: By the changing attitude of eating habits, increasing import of exotic food into industrialized countries and growing worldwide tourism, also in temperate climate zones, patients with diseases elicited by marine parasites or toxins may be observed. From an epidemiological point of view the most common and important diseases are scombroid or histamine fish poisoning, anisakiasis and ciguatera. Whereas the former two may be also encountered in northern countries, ciguatera intoxications are only observed from tropical sea fish. In all three allergy-like symptoms may occur, they represent, therefore, an important differential diagnosis from IgE-mediated allergic reactions to fish and seafood allergens. Methods/patients: We present five typical cases of scombroid poisoning and a case of anisakidosis, and discuss the characteristics, elicitors, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis of these disorders. Results and discussion: Scombroid poisoning is an intoxication from biogene amines that are formed due to inadequate storing and insufficient freezing after the catch. Particularly the odor- and tasteless histamine, possibly together with other substances or cofactors, may induce acute allergy-like symptoms such as flush, pruritus, urticaria and gastrointestinal symptoms. The reaction is self-limiting, it lasts a few hours and it usually results in complete recovery. Anisakidosis or anisakiasis is caused by the fish parasite Anisakis simplex. The acute parasitic infestation of the accidental human host by live parasites results in acute severe abdominal pain, caused by an eosinophilic inflammation in the gastrointestinal wall, which subsides within a few hours after the death of the worm. In sensitized individuals exposure to undercooked fish infested by anisakis elicits allergic symptoms ranging from urticaria, angioedema to dyspnoe and life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Some authors have reported a combination of parasitic and allergic reaction called gastroallergic anisakiasis. Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble toxins known as ciguatoxins accumulated in the muscles of carnivorous subtropical and tropical fish. Ciguatoxins arise from biotransformation in the fish from gambier-toxins produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus, a marine dinoflagellate that lives on macroalgae in corals. The toxins and their metabolites are concentrated in the food chain when carnivorous fish prey on smaller herbivorous fish. More than 400 species offish can be vectors of ciguatoxins. Symptoms include gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances, in severe cases paralysis, coma and death may occur. Symptoms subside typically in few days but may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. In the differential diagnosis toxins from seafood such as saxatoxin and brevitoxin have to be considered. Conclusions: In patients with suspected allergic symptoms after the consumption of fish or seafood, the differential diagnosis should include disorders from marine toxins or parasites, which may elicit allergy-like symptoms and signs. This permits an exact diagnosis, therapy and adequate preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic (AE) is a multifactorial skin disease caused by a variety of factors such as genetic conditions, alterated skin structure, immunologic deviations and environmental factors, among others. According to the new WAO nomenclature, the term eczema should be used as the umbrella term to cover all different subtypes of atopic dermatitis, i.e. the IgE-associated (atopic eczema) and the non-IgE-associated type (non-atopic eczema). Besides some comments on the new nomenclature and the so-called march, we provide an overview of the diagnostic importance of atopy patch tests, especially in the formerly called intrinsic type of AE and the role of Staphylococcus aureus-enterotoxins with superantigenic activity, and of fungi (Coprinus comatus and Malassezia furfur sive sympodialis) as illness-specific allergens in AD/AE. The use of antiinfectious and antifungal drugs (topic or systemic) may be of notable benefit in some AD/AE patients. Especially in children with AD/AE, is easily aggravated by contact with irritating factors (e.g. aggressive detergents, synthetic and woolen clothes). Also, skin colonization with Staphylococcus aureus is known as a major trigger of the disease. Silver-coated textiles and a silk fabric coated with AEGIS AEM 5772/5, an antimicrobial substance, efficiently reduce Staphylococcus aureus colonization in patients with AD/AE. Some new studies even have shown a superior improvement by treatment with silver-coated textiles or specially manufactured silk clothes compared to cotton textiles or mild topical corticosteroids. Finally, the development of a new class of steroid-free, topic immunomodulatory drugs (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) has substantially improved the treatment of AD/AE. Nevertheless, patient education is still very important in the management of the disease since it often follows an unpredictable course.",

    "abstract": "Nickel ist the most prevalent allergen in western world. In patients who are sensitized to nickel, cupro-nickel coins may elicit or maintain allergic contact dermatitis of the hands. Two cashiers presented work-related dyshidrotic eczema. Patch tests showed positive reactions to nickel sulfate 5% pet in both patients as well as to the 1- and 2-Euro coins. The patch test reactions to the coins were, however, doubtful in the first case. In the second patient, occupational hand eczema was probably elicited from handling of the new Euro coins. However, sensitization from nickel in the Euro coins was unlikely because intolerance of nickel-containing jewellery was present since childhood in this patient. The new European cupro-nickel coins have a nickel release of23.2 up to 65.1 μg/cm 2 /week after immersion in artificial sweat. A factor contributing to this high release is corrosion due to the bimetallic structure of the coins, which generates a galvanic potential of 30 to 40 mV in human sweat. However, according to the European Union nickel directive, limits for objects in direct and prolonged contact with the skin should not be greater than 0,5 μg/cm 2 /week. Nickel-containing coins have been shown to elicit similar responses in nickel-sensitized subjects as those obtained with standardized patch tests. Considering the literature and our cases, it appears to be possible that a sensitized person develops hand eczema after contact with such coins. However, sensitization to nickel via the new Euro has not yet be demonstrated.",

About one third of all patients suffer from persistent rhinitis, and 75% of patients have moderate to severe rhinitis with impact on their quality of life. This asks for an adequate therapeutic approach to answer to the severity of the disease. Based on the DGAI guidelines published in 2003, new studies are referenced and included into a modified treatment strategy. Among topical treatment options, nasal steroids (GCS) are the most effective and inexpensive treatment modality, with special indication in patients with persistent moderate to severe symptoms including nasal obstruction. The highly selective non-sedating oral antihistamines (AH) represent the first choice of treatment for intermittent and persistent AR. A combination of nasal GCS and oral AH is indicated in patients with moderate to severe AR and conjunctivitis or other non-nasal symptoms. In subjects with allergic asthma and AR, an oral therapy with a leucotriene-receptor antagonist is an option. The indication for specific immunotherapy (SIT) should be considered in patients with moderate to severe intermittent and persistent AR, taking the preventive and causal potential of SIT into account. New studies confirm the clinical value of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), but further studies are needed to evaluate its preventive and long-term potential.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy is a common problem in patients with atopic dermatitis, particularly in children. Cow's milk, hen's egg, soy and wheat have been identified as frequent food allergens in this age group. While immediate reactions to food are well characterized, the importance of food as a provocation factor for late eczematous reactions has been a subject of debate for several decades. We have investigated the importance of food for the induction of late eczematous reactions in children with atopic dermatitis aged 1 - 10 years. This article shows the results of our study and discusses the previous literature. 46% of our challenges were related to a clinical reaction. 43% of these reactions were associated with an isolated immediate reaction. An exacerbation of atopic dermatitis (late eczematous reaction) commonly occured 24 hours after the ingestion of food. Isolated late eczematous reactions were seen in 12% of all positive challenges. 45% of the positive challenges were associated with late eczematous responses, which followed immediate-type reactions. We correlated the clinical outcome to the results of specific IgE determinations and atopy patch tests, which resulted in poor predictive values for both in-vitro and skin tests particularly for the late eczematous reactions. Therefore, food challenges have still to be regarded as the gold standard for the appropriate diagnosis of food responsive eczema in children with atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "Cats are an important allergen source in indoor environments and public places. Due to their adhesiveness which results in binding to very small particles, cat allergens become airborne even without disturbance. It has been demonstrated that clothes of cat owners are a main source for dispersal of allergens in cat-free environments. Therefore, cat allergen can be ubiquitously deposited and may thus elicit a sensitization even in human beings not owning a cat. This justifies the common observation that allergen avoidance is often insufficient to reduce the risk of developing allergic sensitization and symptom exacerbation in highly susceptible patients. Recent epidemiological studies of exposure to cats in households and the risk of asthma have provided conflicting results. In several studies, household contact to cats has been shown not only to be a risk factor for sensitization, but in some studies also to be protective. However, asthma development remains the most important risk in cat allergy, therefore, prevention should be considered in an early state of disease. This review summarizes the most recent data on epidemiology, prevention and therapy of cat allergy.",

It is licensed in the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. The pharmacologically active metabolite carebastine reaches C m a x at 4 h, demonstrates plasma elimination half-life values of 15 - 19 h and is mainly eliminated renally. Clinical studies did not demonstrate relevant anticholinergic or cardial side effects. In contrast, the substance has several anti-inflammatory effects and a high antihistaminic activity which are responsible for its potency. In comparison to loratadine and cetirizine, the efficacy of ebastine 10 mg is equally potent or better. Moreover, the licensed 20 mg dose has additional clinical effects in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Ebastine demonstrates an advantageous risk-benefit profile and thus is another important option in the treatment of immediate allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Extreme events happen in meteorology by exceeding the long-term average of 30 years, according to the definition by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Especially important in this context are the 2 parameters wind and precipitation. Both parameters may have severe effects for men and nature. Floods of rare magnitude in the summer of 2002 in Europe - extending from the United Kingdom to Romania and Bulgaria -left hundreds dead and billions of dollars worth of damage. For the statistical analysis of the extreme values, the parametric model of the Gumbel distribution (for the maximum) was used. It is well-suited to investigate the frequency of such extreme events. This approach was therefore chosen to investigate the extreme events occurring in the case of airborne pollen. Extreme events means in this case the largest daily pollen count in each of the years of the periods studied. Extreme events of pollen are important for understanding clinical symptoms of patients with rhinitis, asthma or eczema. The study gives also a hint, how often extreme events have to be expected and how often a certain amount of either birch pollen or grass pollen might occur. Additionally, the study shows that the same concept as for the calculation of meteorological extreme events can also be applied for airborne pollen.",

    "abstract": "Background: Patients suffering from environmentally related health disorders show a multitude of complaints of uncertain origins and often with different psychopathological background. Therefore, the Basel environmental health disorders research project collected allergological-medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental data from a sample of 63 patients with environment-related complaints. In this publication the following questions were investigated: which physical symptoms do these patients exhibit and how do these differ from comparative samples with the same goal as well as with studies aimed for epidemiological questions? Furthermore, psychological-psychiatric variables of patients with allergological and respiratory findings were compared to study subjects without allergic disorders. Results: The observed variety of complaints was in line with findings resulting from other environmentally related burden studies. General and non-specific symptoms such as sleeping disorders, tiredness, decreased concentration, nervousness, unspecific indisposition or hay fever were frequent. Bronchial asthma was reported in 16 cases (25%) which is a clearly higher frequency when compared with a normal sample. A positive prick test for inhaled allergens was shown by 36.5% of the patients and by 27% positive atopic serum parameters were detected. Patients with allergologicalmedical results reflected a heterogeneous psychological-psychiatric picture. Within specific psychological-psychiatric dimensions, statistically significant differences could be yielded out: asthmatics showed raised rates of depression, rhinoconjunctivitis patients showed unfavorable coping strategies. Conclusion: In patients with disorders related to the environment, allergic reaction may be more frequent and associated with specific psychological values; therefore, a thorough and 3-fold simultaneous diagnostic approach is justified and needed in patients with environment-related health complaints.",

These immunologic features are associated with skeletal symptoms like failure of dental shedding, typical facies, scoliosis, hyperextensible joints, and pathologic fractures, defining HIES as a multisystem disorder. Etiology and pathogenesis are still unknown. Diagnosis may be adopted by a mosaic of clinical criteria. On one hand severe atopic dermatitis may be confused with HIES, on the other hand atypical clinical expression of HIES may hamper the diagnosis. Although some clinical features may only be present in older patients, diagnosis should be established early in life to prevent complications, such as pneumatoceles following pneumonia, by intensive antibiotic and antimycotic therapy. Classic HIES seems to follow an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and a candidate-region was identified on chromosome 4q21. Patients from consanguineous families present an autosomal-recessive variation of HIES characterized by the absence of skeletal and dental abnormalities but severe cerebral involvement.",

    "abstract": "Background: Various controlled clinical trials have proven the efficacy and safety of a short-term specific immunotherapy (SIT) with 7 injections. This post-marketing surveillance study should show whether the good results are confirmed in a large number of patients in allergologists' practices. Methods: In a post-marketing surveillance study, 2,047 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and neurodermatitis were treated for at least I season (1 year) with an allergoid preparation adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide (Allergovit). Doses were given in accordance with the package insert. Efficacy was measured by physician's and patient's self-assessment on an interval scale and by the use of anti-symptomatic medication. Safety was shown in terms of local and systemic reactions, and compliance by the number of drop-outs. Results: In total, case report forms for 2,435 years of therapy were evaluated. After 1 year of therapy, 81% of patients showed a relevant improvement in their condition. After an improvement of 3 points (median) on a 10-point interval scale at the end of the first year, the efficacy improved still further in the second and third years of therapy (p < 0,001). The intake of systemic antihistamines could be reduced by 36%, of local mast cell stabilizers and corticosteroids by 44% and 42%, respectively. The time of the start of SIT had no influence on the success of the therapy whereas underdosing of the preparation resulted in less efficacy. The response of children and patients above 50 years of age were not different compared to those of the other patients. Patients with clinically relevant sensitizations against 3 or more allergen families showed a trend (p = 0,148) towards less efficacy, probably because of symptoms attributable to other sensitisations. Local reactions were seen in association with 241 (1.1%) of the injections and systemic reactions with 48 (0,3%). The systemic reactions were mainly rhinitis, conjunctivitis, difficulties in breathing and cutaneous reactions. Severe systemic reactions were not observed. In 97% of the cases, the physicians judged the tolerance of the therapy as good. After the first 2 years of therapy, 95% of the patients wanted to continue the treatment. In total, nearly 5% of the patients droped out. Conclusion: The short-term SIT with allergoids (7 injections) showed a good efficacy and safety in the allergologist's practice. SIT is also suitable for children and elderly patients. Treatment should start early during the course of disease because the chance of success decreases with rising numbers of clinically manifest sensitizations.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is the most severe manifestation of a mast cell dependent hypersensitivity reaction. Recent data on epidemiology indicate that food and drug induced anaphylaxis has increased within the last years. The epidemiological data on anaphylaxis vary throughout the world as the overall incidence and also relevant elicitors depend on different endogenous, but also exogenous factors (e.g. ICD-code, life style, comorbidities). Data from the anaphylaxis registry has shown that venom, drugs and foods are the most frequent elicitors for anaphylaxis within German-speaking countries, while the ranking of the elicitors is age-dependent. Risk factors for anaphylaxis are comorbidities like asthma or mastocytosis or other circumstances, which can increase either the relative risk or the severity. Further risk factors are age, gender and the concomitant intake of drugs like ACE inhibitors or acetylsalicylic acid but also exercise. Data on the clinical epidemiology of anaphylaxis are essential to follow up the most frequent elicitors and risk factors over time and accumulate data about diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in patients suffering from a potential fatal manifestation of an IgE-dependent disease. The anaphylaxis registry within the German-speaking area achieved to provide data of the most frequent elicitors, risk factors and the medical treatment from affected individuals to optimize the management of patients with anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Mastocytosis describes a group of disorders which are characterized by a pathologic increase of mast cells in various tissues. The extent of organ involvement, the severity of clinical symptoms, and the prognosis of patients suffering from mastocytosis may be highly variable. The clinical presentation of mastocytosis ranges from isolated cutaneous disease (cutaneous mastocytosis; CM) to systemic types of mastocytosis (systemic mastocytosis, SM). The latter commonly involves the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes and/or the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of mastocytosis either result from the activation of mast cells with consecutive release of mediators and/or from the pathologic accumulation of mast cells in various tissues. Skin dysfunction is induced by the local action of mediators, which are released from mast cells upon mechanical or thermal stress. Anaphylactic symptoms may occur in all types of mastocytosis, even in patients with cutaneous involvement only. If anaphylactic reactions occur in patients with mastocytosis, these reactions are most often severe and sometimes even fatal. Diagnostic work-up and treatment of anaphylactic reactions is urgently required. Cutaneous mastocytosis has a good prognosis in children, and often remits several years after the diagnosis has been made. In adults cutaneous mastocytosis with or without systemic mastocytosis is usually persistent. Systemic mastocytosis may occur without significant clinical symptoms (indolent SM; ISM) or may have a major impact on the health of the patients (aggressive SM; ASM). ASM is associated with major medical symptoms, e.g. with osteoporotic fractures especially of the vertebral column or hematologic abnormalities. ISM is without effect on survival time, but life expectancy is significantly shortenend in at least 40% of ASM patients with associate myeloproliferative diseases.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades a large number of epidemiological studies investigating the change of prevalence of hay fever showed an increase in the occurrence of this disease. However, other studies carried out in the 1990s yielded contradictory results in this regard. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the increasing hay fever rate including both indoor and ambient air pollution, reduced exposure to microbial stimulation and changes in diets. However, the observed increase has not convincingly been explained by any of these factors and there is limited evidence of changes in exposure to these risk factors over time. Additionally, recent studies show that no further increase in asthma, hay fever and atopic sensitisation in adolescents and adults has been observed during the 1990s and the beginning of the new century. As the pattern of pollen counts has changed over the years, partly due to the global warming, but also as a consequence of a change in the use of land, the changing prevalence of hay fever might partly be driven by this different pollen exposure. Epidemiological data for hay fever in Switzerland are available from 1926 until 2000 and Pollen data are available from 1969 until now. This allows an investigation as to whether these data are correlated. It would also be feasible to correlate the pollen data with meteorological data which, however, is not the subject of the investigation. This study focuses on analyzing time series of pollen counts and of pollen season lengths in order to identify their trends and to ascertain whether there is a relationship between these trends and the changes in the hay fever prevalence. It is shown in this paper that the pollen exposure has been decreasing in Basel since the beginning of the 1990s whereas the rate of the hay fever prevalence in Switzerland remained approximately unchanged in this period but with a slight tendency to decrease.",

To our great surprise and against the current dogma these models show that epidermal LC seem to be dispensible for contact sensitisation. A newly described population of Langerin+ dermal DC seems to be sufficient for the sensitisation process. Subsequent studies suggest that LC and dermal DC play complementary roles in the initiation of the adaptive immune response. The analysis of DC subpopulations isolated from human skin explants demonstrates a functional specialisation, in which epidermal LC preferentially act as inducer of cellular immune responses, while dermal DC preferentially induce humoral immune responses. Similar results are reported in mice, in which epidermal LC and Langerin+ dermal DC were demonstrated to be unrelated and to display distinct functions with regard to induction of humoral and cellular immune responses.",

Methods: A prospective post-marketing multicenter observational study with TOL SL® (Leti Laboratorios LETI, Spain) was conducted in 735 patients in Germany. The majority (66.9%) of the patients were suffering from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Assessments should take place at baseline, after 2 - 3 and 12 months of SLIT. The build-up phase lasted for 12 days followed by a maintenance phase of at least 12 months. Results: Oral swelling was reported by 14.6% and oral burning by 21.2% of the patients. In 2 patients (0.3%) the therapy was discontinued due to local reactions. Overall tolerability was assessed as very to good by the physicians in 93.6 and by 91.2% of the patients. Similar ratings for efficacy of the therapy were given by the physicians in 85.9 and by 82.6% of the patients and 95% each appreciated the practicability of the substance administration and the therapy regimen. Conclusion: In the present study TOL SL® was safe and well-tolerated in the control of allergic diseases in everyday practice.",

One of the minor criteria is the detection of the gain of function mutation D816V of the c-kit proto-oncogene in extracutaneous organs. The receptor molecule KIT is a potential therapeutic target for tyrosin kinase inhibitors. KIT mutations have been described in more than 80% of systemic mastocytoses, but only in the minority of cutaneous mastocytoses. Usually exon 17 amplicons generated by polymerase chain reaction are analyzed for the detection of c-kit mutations. Most frequently the method of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using the endonuclease Hinf I is used. Onother well established technique utilizes melting point analysis of amplification products with specific hybridization probes. Recently, also allele-specific PCR assays have been described. The technique used for the detection of c-kit mutations in mastocytosis is dependent on the kind of material to be analyzed and the laboratory equipment available.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylactic reactions can be lethal and most recent data indicates a continuous increase of anaphylaxis within the last 10 years. The anaphylaxis register in German speaking countries was founded 2006 and until the end of August 2008, 869 cases were registered. Among these 135 were children and 734 adults. The analysis of the most frequent elicitators of anaphylaxis in children and young adults indicates that food allergens are among venom and drugs the most frequent elicitators. In adults the most frequent elicitators are venom and drugs, whereas food allergens range in the third position. Up to one third of affected patients experience repetitive reactions which indicates the need of educational programmes. Adrenaline is only used in 10% of the registered cases. This indicates the need of improved information regarding the first aid treatment for patients but also doctors. Cofactors are important for the elicitation of severe allergic reactions. This phenomenon is also given reflected by the data from the anaphylaxis register. The most frequent cofactors are drugs, physical activity, mental stress and alcohol. The experiences from the anaphylaxis register indicate that it is possible to perform a computer-based online-registration system which enables a countrywide integration of centres. The anaphylaxis register is the basis to receive informations regarding the elicitators of severe allergic reactions and it is an important platform to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care of affected patients.",

    "abstract": "Neurodermatitis (better called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema, AE) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, which often appears already in early childhood and may be associated with a reduced quality of life for affected children. Research in adult patients has shown that AE often is associated with sleep problems. There is, however, little published information regarding this point in childhood. The main target of this paper is to provide an overview of the current evidence for the relation between sleep and AE in early childhood. A systematic literature research was conducted to identify relevant studies. The seven studies detected for this age group show that similar to adults, children with AE have increased sleep problems. They experience reduced sleep efficiency and sleep duration with an increased sleep fragmentation and prolonged sleep onset latency. Moreover, the severity of the disease directly influences the sleep quality. In general, there are few studies, which address the described relations in childhood. Therefore, more systematic research is required in this area. It is important to diagnose and treat chronic skin diseases such as AE early in childhood also to prevent sleep problems and related adverse effects on children's psychological well-being and on future development of children.",

    "abstract": "For different reasons, population based epidemiological studies are an exception in the field of contact allergy (CA) research. In this area, the systematic capturing and analysis of clinical routine of patients patch tested, collected in a research network such as the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK, www.ivdk.org) offers the opportunity to examine time trends of specific CA, or to identify subgroups with an elevated risk of specific CA. Distinct examples of such time trends include the decline of CA to glyceryl monothioglycolate after withdrawal from the market, of nickel after regulatory initiatives to limit liberation, and of certain fragrance compounds after the issuing of recommendations for lowered use concentrations. The confounding of such results by relevant patient characteristics (e.g. age, gender) needs to be considered. This also holds true for the analyses of risk factors for certain CA, which thus need to be multifactorial and appropriately adjusted. Based on the wealth of data yet accumulated in the IVDK, such analyses have been performed targeting CA to bufexamac, neomycin sulphate, p-phenylenediamine and fragrance mix, among others. In these analyses, polysensitization has consistently been identified as eminent risk factor, i.e. the presence of further CA. Possible genetic determinants of this putative phenotypic susceptibility factor are in the present research focus of the IVDK, together with continual and ever refined surveillance, and attempts to improve risk assessment by formal consideration of sufficiently specific information on human exposure to contact allergens.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Urticaria is one of the most common dermatological disease. In Germany more than 1 million patients suffer chronically from urticaria leading to a severe impairment in quality of life, as well as having a considerable social and economical impact. The specific aim of this study was to investigate the relation between possible triggers and the course of chronic urticaria. Patients and methods: Hospitalized patients (1990 ― 2000) with chronic urticaria and/or nonhereditary angioedema were surveyed in the department of dermatology of the Nurnberg hospital. A standardized questionnaire was used to inquire disease development and time course. The statistical analysis for the healing probability was done by log-rang test and Kaplan-Meier plot. Results: The median length of chronic urticaria was surprisingly high at 97 months. Interestingly, patients with continuous symptoms were healing faster than those with recurrent symptoms. However, age and gender did not have any influence on the healing process. In addition, it was shown that neither concomitant infections, nor pseudoallergic reactions, nor the treatment of focal infections significantly changed the time course of chronic urticaria. Discussioh and conclusions Chronic urticaria often is displayed as a symptom influenced by multiple factors. The present study showed that commonly known triggers only play a minor role. However, investigation and therapy of these factors continue to be crucial since they still influence amelioration as well as partial remission. The mechanism of the often spontaneous remission remains unknown and needs further clarification.",

    "abstract": "Nasal polyps (NP) are a frequent problem in about 1- 4% of the population and are frequently associated with other diseases, such as aspirin intolerance in 25% or bronchial asthma in about 40%. Other associated diseases are allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Due to increased presence of eosinophil-attracting chemokines such as eotaxin or RANTES, and the key cytokine IL-5, eosinophil granulocytes are a predominant feature in NP tissue. In addition, colonization by microorganisms, mainly staphylococci, plays an important pathogenetic role by releasing superantigens, inducing formation of specific IgE and stimulation of IL-5 production. Diagnosis of NP is established clinically by rhinoscopy, endoscopy and by computed tomography. In addition, an allergological and pulmonary work-up is mandatory. Besides corticosteroids and surgical treatment, the use of antibiotics, leukotriene antagonists and the so-called aspirine-inactivation by giving increasing doses of acetylsalicylic acid have proven to be useful tools in the management of NP.",

We found a positive reaction for gelatine (porcine) which has not been declared on the fizzy multivitamine tablets. Anaphylactic reactions towards gelatine have been described recently for gelatine-containing plasma substitutes and vaccines, especially measles-mumps-rubella-vaccines. Primarily histamine release was suggested to be the main cause of anaphylactoid reactions towards gelatine-containing plasma substitutes but in the following IgE-mediated reactions have been reported for different gelatine-containing vaccines and plasma substitutes. Anaphylactic reactions towards gelatine-containing food seem to be rare. It might be suggested that digestion affects the allergenicity of gelatine. Even ifanaphylactic reactions towards gelatine-containing food seem to be rare, in case of unclear allergic reactions towards food or oral medications an IgE-mediate reaction to gelatine should be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Occupational skin diseases constitute about 30% of all occupational diseases worldwide and also in Germany. Thereby, occupational skin diseases take the leading position of all occupational diseases. About 90% of occupational skin diseases are eczemas which are usually located on the hands. According to estimates of the registers for occupational skin diseases in Northern Bavaria and the Saarland, Germany, which have been effective since 1990 and 1999, the incidence of occupational skin diseases is 6.7 and 6.8 per 10,000 full-time workers and year. Other incidence estimates from Western industrialized countries range between 5 and 19 cases per 10.000 full-time workers and year. Population-based estimates for a 1-year prevalence of hand dermatitis, which rely on an assessment by questionnaire, range between 6.7% in Germany and 8.9% in Norway. Studies, which included a skin examination for outcome assessment, e.g. revealed a point prevalence of 0.5% for cases which should be seen by a physician in a sample of 20,749 US citizens or a 1-year prevalence of 10.6% for a sample of 16,587 subjects from Sweden. According to a cross-sectional study from Denmark, school children in the age of 12 - 16 years exhibited hand eczema in 3.2% at the time of investigation and reported a 1-year prevalence of 7.3%. For the latter, the predominance of female gender was confirmed (10.1% vs. 4.6%). Epidemiological studies on occupational hand dermatitis are for several methodological reasons hardly comparable. This is due to different sample sizes and selection criteria, the use of different measures of frequency and outcome assessment including the fact that no generally accepted and validated diagnostic criteria exist. Population-based as well as studies in different occupational groups revealed a higher prevalence in women. Larger studies in food- and metal-processing industries as well as in hairdressing apprentices showed a marked increase in eczema prevalence during the 3-year period of apprenticeship. For example, prevalence of hand dermatitis increased in apprentices of food industry from East-Thuringia from 17.5% to 27.5%, in hairdressing apprentices from Northwest Germany from 12.9% to 23.9% and in apprentices of metal industry from 0 to 23%, i.e. from 8.6% to 14.1%. The latter study was performed in apprentices of the car industry and allowed to distinguish the increase in hand eczema between metalworkers (9,2% to 15.3%), blue-collar workers (8.8% to 14.1%), and white-collar workers (4.6% to 6.9%). The Prevention of Occupational Skin Disease in Hairdressers Study (POSH) clearly demonstrated that the prevalence estimates largly depend on the chosen outcome definition. For various definitions of hand eczema the prevalence at the end of apprenticeship varied between 2.7% and 23.9%. A high 3-year prevalence of 20.7% was also observed in German office workers and an expected high 1-year prevalence of 46% was reported for female cleaners from Denmark. The overall high and during apprenticeship further increasing prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis calls for intense and specific measures of prevention.",

We report the case of a patient withhypersensitivity to Ficus benjamina without cross-reactivity to Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) or several fruits, like mango, banana and spinach, but with cross-reactivity to fig. The hypersensitivity to Ficus benjamina was investigated by means of the prick test, the determination of specific IgE antibodies, the cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) and Westemblots. A self-produced Ficus benjamina extract, a Ficus benjamina extract from Allergopharma, extract of Hevea brasiliensis and extracts of several fruits were used in the prick tests as well as in the CAP and CAST experiments. CAP inhibition assays were carried out to study a suspected cross-reactivity of Ficus benjamina to NRL and several fruits, respectively. The hypersensitivity to Ficus benjamina was clearly demonstrated. Inhibition assay showed the inhibition of the specific IgE antibody up to 95%, and 82% by the self-produced Ficus benjamina extract and the commercial Ficus benjamina, respectively. Neither sensitization nor cross-reactivity to Hevea brasiliensis and several fruit proteins could be found, apart from cross-reactivity to fig. In our patient, an isolated type I hypersensitivity to Ficus benjamina with cross-reactivity to fig could be found, but without cross-reactivity to NRL. The Ficus benjamina protein seems to become an important indoor allergen with increasing significance.",

To study the levels of allergens to which subjects are exposed, it is necessary to measure allergen levels. Direct measurements are also needed to assess the levels that lead to sensitization in subjects or provoke symptoms in already sensitized subjects, and to evaluate the efficacy of allergen reduction and exposure avoidance strategies. In the occupational setting, airborne dust is often collected on filters using pumps, the filters are eluted and the allergen content in the solution is analyzed by immunoassays. Collecting inhalable dust by personal air sampling may be considered as the gold standard.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the course of the therapy in patients treated with SIT in our department. We evaluated retrospectively medical records of patients receiving SIT from 1989 - 2006. We obtained information whether we were successful in reaching the recommended length of the therapy, the reasons which led to premature stopping of the treatment, rate and severity of adverse reactions etc. The study group consisted of 1,457 patients who underwent 1,593 SIT courses. The representation of genders was almost proportional. Subcutaneous route of administration of vaccines prevailed (86%) over sublingual (14%). The treatment was stopped in 1,074 cases - in 653 cases (61%) properly and in 421 cases (39%) improperly. The most common reason for premature stopping were poor compliance of a patient (n = 227, 54%), less frequently health problems which were not related to treatment (n = 112, 27%) and adverse reactions to treatment (n = 39, 9%). Other reasons were substantially less common. Significant adverse reactions to treatment occurred in 549 cases (35% of all SIT courses) and they were predominantly only local. Systemic reactions occurred in 88 cases (16% of all adverse reactions) and these were in most cases only mild. The best opportunity how to decrease the risk of SIT premature stopping rates and, thus, the risk of poor SIT effectiveness, provides a patient's compliance improvement.",

There is evidence that the increase in such diseases has its origins in early life exposures. Pregnancy or early childhood may, therefore, be critical periods for preventing the onset of allergic disease, and prenatal interventions are an attractive possibility for a population-based preventive approach. Methods: Here we review the data suggesting that prenatal exposures and prenatal immune responses are important in the development of allergic disease, and that interventions during this time might be effective in prevention. We find evidence from both animal and human studies that prenatal interventions can influence the future development of allergic disease. Results: There are a number of mechanisms through which such interventions may act to prevent allergic sensitization. Conclusions: We conclude that prenatal interventions have the potential to reduce the burden of allergic disease, and merit continued investigation. Further research in this area may lead to significant public health initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Apart from the classic complaints related to allergic rhinitis, associated symptoms have received increased attention over the last few years. Above all, daytime fatigue and daytime sleepiness are of particular importance in this context. Although daytime fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with allergic rhinitis are frequently attributed to an impairment of nocturnal sleep, convincing data supporting this relationship are hard to obtain and the alleged link has not been proven conclusively. While increasing evidence is available with regard to subjective complaints, objective measurements are still an exception, especially when it comes to the objective assessment of nocturnal sleep. An analysis of the current literature demonstrates that allergic rhinitis - at least according to epidemiological trials - constitutes a risk factor for sleep-disordered breathing in adults and, even more so, in children. Corresponding clinical trials, using standardized questionnaires, have revealed a statistically significant increase in daytime sleepiness with the start of the pollen season in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Antiallergic medication, and especially the use of topical nasal steroids, also leads to an improvement in the subjective assessment of nocturnal sleep and daytime performance in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Nevertheless, a clinically relevant deterioration in objective sleep measures could not be demonstrated in recent, methodically more rigorous investigations. Allergic rhinitis alone does not seem to be capable of inducing clinically relevant sleep-disordered breathing, at least in otherwise healthy patients with allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus germs constitutively have the possibility to release classical and egc-locus derived enterotoxins (SEs) which have superantigen activity, and effectively modify the functions of T- and B-cells, eosinophils, and other inflammatory and structural cells. The stimulation may lead to a TH 2 -polarized eosinophilic inflammation as well as a multiclonal IgE production, aggravating airway disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Recently, Staphylococcus aureus could be demonstrated to reside intraepithelially, and potentially to release superantigens into the tissue from within the epithelial cells. An immune defect, either in the innate or adaptive immunity, might be responsible for this phenomenon. Follicle-like structures and lymphocyte accumulations, specifically binding enterotoxins, can be found within the mucosal tissue. Interestingly also, IgE antibodies to enterotoxins can be found in the majority of aspirin-sensitive patients, in nasal polyps and severe asthma alike. We here summarize the current evidence from animal and human studies for an active role of SEs in allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, asthma, COPD and finally early childhood wheezing, and discuss the similarities between those disease manifestations. As a principle, the occurrence of IgE antibodies to SEs correlates to disease severity in terms of total IgE formation, inflammatory markers and clinical expression of disease. Preliminary evidence from animal models underlines the high potency of SEs to induce or modulate disease, and a few pilot intervention trials may serve as proof of concept for the impact of SEs on disease severity. However, therapeutic approaches are so far limited and empirical, and need further improvement to tackle this currently underestimated clinical challenge.",

    "abstract": "For patients with a confirmed association between allergic sensitization and disease (allergic rhinitis or asthma), SIT is indicated as the only current treatment option with curative capabilities. However, the application of SIT is limited by the relative high risk for severe side-effects and the possibility of weak or delayed efficacy especially for patients with severe allergic asthma. Therefore a combination of omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, and SIT might be useful for the treatment of allergic diseases. There are now published three clinical studies, which demonstrated consistently that the combination of active immunization with standardised allergen extracts (SIT) and passive immunization with anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab) was superior to SIT alone in reducing symptoms and rescue medication use in patients with allergic rhinitis and in patients with moderate allergic asthma and comorbid allergic rhinitis. Moreover, pre-treatment with omalizumab prior to an intensified rush immunotherapy compared to SIT alone significantly decreased the otherwise high rates of allergic side effects, including anaphylaxis reactions, in patients with ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Combination of omalizumab with SIT for treatment of patients with allergic is safe and reduced symptom load in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner. The clinical implication of these findings is that also patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma pretreated with anti-IgE might prospectively benefit from a SIT as a causal treatment option.",

A dermatologist and allergist had diagnosed multiple food allergies by bioresonance technology, but neglected to perform skin tests. Following the doctor's recommendation, the patient avoided gradually more and more foods. Actually, her diet consisted of a certain kind of spelt bread, bananas, potatoes, pasta, butter, egg and salt. During the diet, she lost more than 10 kg of weight. The skin disease did not improve. The patient refused treatment with topical corticosteroids due to possible side effects. She reported an exacerbation of her dermatitis following the application of prednicarbate. Therefore, oral therapy with prednisolone was done. This improved the dermatitis. After completion, the eczema worsened again. The patient is otherwise healthy with no signs of atopic disposition and no other allergies. We performed patch tests for the first time in this patient. This revealed an allergic contact dermatitis mainly due to her cosmetics with positive reactions to methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), fragrances and prednicarbate.

It is popular in alternative medicine in many, especially German-speaking, countries. Bioresonance is a controversial subject. Scientific studies did not show any effects other than placebo.

The latter group includes enzyme deficiency, histamine intolerance or food-allergic reactions. The study described here gave for the first time information about the point prevalence of both immunological and non-immunological adverse reactions to food. A population study was performed to identify the prevalence of all kinds of adverse reactions to food. In a representative cross-sectional survey performed in 1999 and 2000 in Berlin, 13,300 inhabitants of all ages were addressed by questionnaire. This questionnaire was answered by 4,093 persons. All respondents mentioning any sign of food intolerance or the existence of allergic diseases (n=2,298) were followed up by telephone and, in case food intolerance could not be ruled out by patient history, were invited to attend to the clinic for personal investigation including double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge tests (DBPCFC). The self-reported life time prevalence of any adverse reaction to food in the Berlin population (mean age 41 years) was 34.9%. 814 individuals were personally investigated according to the guidelines. The point prevalence of adverse reactions to food confirmed by DBPCFC tests in the Berlin population as a mean of all age groups was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [3.0 - 4.2%]) and 3.7% in the adult population (18-79 years, 95% confidence interval [3.1 - 4.4.%]). 2.5% were IgE-mediated and 1.1% non-IgE-mediated, females were more frequently affected (60.6%). Based on a statistical comparison with available data of adults from the nation-wide German Health Survey from 1998, adverse reactions to food in the adult population of Germany (age 18 to 79) were calculated with 2.6% [2.1 - 3.2%]).

Furthermore, studies in patients with allergies and asthmatics have suggested a compromised Treg response compared to healthy individuals.

    "abstract": "The development of allergic diseases is dependent on genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors and their influence on immune regulation early in childhood. The rapid increase in recent decades underlines the importance of environmental factors. Different environmental exposures, especially in early childhood, can have distinct effects on the pathogenesis of allergic diseases depending on their type, time, duration and frequency of exposure. Environmental pollutants, aeroallergens and molds as well as delivery by caesarean section, smoking and certain early childhood infections are classified as harmful factors. In contrast, early contact to children, growing up on farms or in rural areas and a balanced diet are associated with a lower prevalence of allergies. The underlying immunological mechanisms include different cell populations and signaling pathways as well as (epi) genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the United States of America or Great Britain nothing is yet known about occurrence of peanut allergy in Germany. During the course of an investigation into nut allergy 12 out of 32 patients were found to be peanuts allergic. Their clinical symptoms were established and in addition serological tests were undertaken. We recruited 12 volunteers with the typical history of peanut allergy aged 12 to 43 years. Symptoms after ingestion of peanuts were reported as oral allergy syndrome in 11, as respiratory tract symptoms in 8, as dermal problems in 9 and, as diarrhea in 4 patients. Shock symptoms occurred in 5 of the volunteers. Respiratory allergies were manifest in 9 of the persons (8 grass pollen, 3 tree pollen, 3 house dust mites), 3 suffered from atopic dermatitis. 9 patients had allergic reactions after eating tree nuts, especially hazelnuts. Despite showing specific antibodies to soy none of the patients had any problem after eating soy products. 8 of the persons had never had contact with an allergist, including one with shock symptoms. None of the patients had a adequate emergency medication even those with a history of shock symptoms . Total serum IgE was measured between 3693 and 58 kU/L. 11 out ofthe 12 persons showed specific IgE-antibodies against peanut protein without any correlation between intensity of symptoms and amount of specific IgE. Western blot experiments showed specific patient's IgE in a range between 10 and 90 kD also without any relationship to reported symptoms. In summary, the problems of peanut allergy also arise in Germany. Symptoms are similar to those reported in American and British patients. Up to now no correlation between amount or binding pattern of specific IgE antibodies and reported symptoms could be established. Further epidemiological studies should be carried out.",

Based on anatomic considerations various aspects of the mutual influence of the lower and upper respiratory tract system concerning the pathogenetic mechanisms are described including neurogenic actions, the aerogenic transmission and overlapping effects of mediators and inflammatory cells. In the clinical point of view special emphasize is laid on different therapeutic options for their effect on rhinitis and asthma symptoms such as rhinitis and sinusitis therapy, specific immunotherapy, leucotriene antagonists, and functional endonasal sinus surgery.",

    "abstract": "Screening tests with the aid of multiallergen combinations facilitate the clarification of a wide range of allergens in the serum. Depending on the test mixture, with this method proof of sensitisation is possible not only for a single allergen, but also for a complete allergen group. These tests are also helpful in doubtful anamnestic situations, and where it is necessary to ascertain results with comparitively small quantities of serum. Comparison of the AllergyScreen concept with the established single system of Pharmacia and the Skin Test has shown that this is a convincing method for determining a comprehensive specific sensitisation pattern in the patient. This can be achieved quickly at low cost, and with minimum material expenditure, which is not possible with single allergen determinations. The sensitivity and specificity of the system is very closely approximate to skin testing, and corresponds to a conventional single allergen system. The data of the mean sensitivity: AllergyScreen/Skin prick test: 95.1%; AllergyScreen/CAP: 84.3%, CAP/Skin prick test: 95.8%; the data of the mean specificity: AllergyScreen/Skin prick test: 80.2%, AllergyScreen/CAP: 95%; CAP/ Skin prick test: 76.1%; the data of the mean concordance: AllergyScreen/Skin-Prick test: 88.3%, AllergyScreen/CAP: 90.6%; CAP/ Skin prick test: 87.5%.",

Different dendritic cell subtypes, such as Langerhans cells (LC), inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDEC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play a key role in AD and impact on the mechanisms underlying AD such as the recruitment of inflammatory cells, T cell-priming and cytokine and chemokine release. Besides combining bacterial and viral stimuli, allergens influence the course and severity of AD. AD shows a homogenous clinical picture, but on the basis of various pathophysiological causes in each individual, it can be divided into several subtypes, predominated by different genetic and immunological mechanisms. In the future, new insights about the complex pathophysiology of AD should help not only to identify severe forms at an early stage in order to implement effective preventive strategies, but also treat each patient individually according to the characteristics of the respective subtype. In this review, we highlight the recent progress made in research studies about AD and focus on the latest research results published in this field.",

Objective: To investigatethe clinical efficacy of SLIT vs SCIT and secondary to compare SLIT and SCIT with placebo and to evaluate the relative clinical efficacy in relation to systemic side effects. Methods: A 3-year randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy study including 71 adult birch pollen, hay fever patients treated for two consecutive years after a baseline year. Allocation to treatment groups was based on disease severity in the baseline season, gender and age. Results: Clinical efficacy was estimated in 58 patients completing the first treatment year by subtracting baseline data, and by calculating the ratio first treatment season vs baseline. SLIT diminished the median disease severity to one half and SCIT to one-third of placebo treatment. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed. Both for symptoms and medication scores, actively treated patients showed statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy compared with placebo. SLIT treatment only resulted in local mild side-effects, while SCIT resulted in few serious systemic side-effects. Conclusion: Based on the limited number of patients, the clinical efficacy of SLIT was not statistically different from SCIT, and both treatments are clinically effective compared with placebo in the treatment of birch pollen rhinoconjunctivitis. The lack of significant difference between the two treatments does not indicate equivalent efficacy, but to detect minor differences necessitates investigation of larger groups. Due to the advantageous safety profile, SLIT may be favored.",

Recurrences may be prevented with education of patients, and using auto-injectable adrenaline may be life-saving. The purpose of the study was to assess physicians knowledge and attitude about these life-threatening events. Methods: A total number of randomly selected 93 physicians were asked to fulfill a questionnaire. A scenario about a patient developing life-threatening symptoms after receiving naproxen sodium tablet was described. The questionnaire consisted of basic treatment procedures about anaphylaxis and about the usage of auto-injectable adrenaline. Results: Only 50.5% of the physicians in our study answered that they would treat their patients with adrenaline in the case of anaphylaxis. Further evaluation revealed that only 23 of the 93 physicians (24.7%) knew the correct dose, correct form and the correct administration route. 89.2% of physicians did not know how to use an adrenaline auto-injector and 95.7% did never prescribe this device. Conclusion: Physicians knowledge about anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions in Turkey is not sufficient. Regular training courses should be advised.",

Since the detection of many of these proteins has proven to bedifficult using conventional techniques such as ELISA or immunohistochemistry, we adapted the ELISPOT assay for the investigation of cells of the nasal mucosa. The ELISPOT is based on a modification of the ELISA enabling the highly sensitive detection of cytokines on the level of individual cells. This allowed us to detect and quantify the synthesis of the Th2-cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, the Th1-cytokines IFN-γ und IL-12, and of IgE in the nasal mucosa of patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyposis. Therefore, this assay offers the possibility to investigate previously difficult to answer questions such as the relevance of Th1-cytokines in the above-mentioned diseases.",

Pestalozzi, who worked for the Allergy Unit of the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Zurich, was the first to describe the syndrome as a febrile group disease in a model carpenters workshop caused by inhalation of humidifier water contaminated with moulds [1]. 6 cases of humidifier disease were diagnosed and clarified in the same hospital in 1969 and 1970. Those cases were compiled in an unpublished medical inaugural doctoral thesis (University of Zurich 1973). Always in the afternoon of a working day, i.e. approximately 6 - 8 hours after they had started work, the patients (5 males and 1 female) suffered from nausea, exhaustion, fever with shivering, sweating, dyspnoa, cough, expectoration and gastrointestinal problems. During the episodes, the blood sedimentation rate was increased, blood count showed a leukocytosis, in 3 cases Roentgen thorax was pathologic. In 2 of these cases, basal on both sides increased markings, and in the 3rd case 3 - 4 mm sized shadow spots in the whole lung could be detected. The diagnosis was confirmed by the fact that the symptoms vanished after the humidifier in the working place was turned off or removed from the working place but returned at once when the humidifier was turned on again. In the humidifier water, several different mould and bacteria species could be cultivated. Intracutaneous and inhalative provocation tests were carried out with extracts from the humidifier water. In 3 patients, the inhalation test (in 1 case with Alcaligenes faecalis, in 2 cases with Pseudomonas fluorescens) provoced a delayed early reaction with an increase in fever, nausea, partially with pains in the limbs and cough. Leukocytosis could be shown in the laboratory. In a 4th patient, the inhalation ofMonilia extract (Hollister-Stier) led to a severe immediate reaction with cough, severe dyspnea, FEV 1 decrease and general nausea, so that an intensive emergency therapy was necessary. Pathogenetically, a Type III hypersensitivity reaction was postulated, although no precipitins could be shown in the immunoelectrophoresis. In 4 cases, the precipitin reaction against hey extracts was, however, positive. In contrast to Pestalozzis initial observations, the fact that only 1 worker diseased under the same exposition conditions speaks against a toxic reaction or an infectious disease. Also, on account of the literature, the humidifier disease was considered to be a syndrome of different etiology but with probably homogeneous pathogenesis.",

It can influence numerous functions of the cells involved in the regulation of immune response and hematopoiesis including macrophages, dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and endothelial cells. These cells express histamine receptors and also secrete histamine, which can selectively recruit the major effector cells into tissue sites and affect their maturation, activation, polarization and effector functions, leading to chronic inflammation. Histamine regulates antigen-specific TH1 and TH2 cells as well as related antibody isotype responses. The diverse effects of histamine on immune regulation are due to differential expression and regulation of four histamine receptors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Staphylococcal enterotoxins have been shown to contribute to cutaneous inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Enterotoxins may both act as superantigens leading to polyclonal T cell activation and as allergens inducing an enterotoxin specific IgE response. The presence of skin-infiltrating enterotoxin-specific T cells in atopic dermatitis has not been shown yet. Since enterotoxins lead to unspecific T cell activation in their function as superantigens, it is not possible to clearly differentiate enterotoxin-(superantigen-) reactive and enterotoxin-specific T cell responses in vitro. Therefore, we have investigated the T cell response to 30 octapeptides spanning the whole amino acid sequence of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Due to their structure, a response to those peptides reflects an SEB-specific T cell response. Methods: PBMC derived from patients with atopic dermatitis sensitized to SEB as determined by CAP FEIA and healthy controls were incubated with SEB peptides. The proliferative response was determined using the Vibrant CFDA SE Cell Tracer Assay. Using limiting dilution cultures, peptide-reactive T cell clones were generated from skin and blood of patients who showed a proliferative response to at least one octapeptide. Results: 70% of the patients sensitized to SEB exhibited a proliferative response to at least one peptide. We could identify two peptides which preferentially induced T cell activation. Frequencies of peptide-reactive T cells in the peripheral blood and the skin were rather low compared to classical allergens and ranged between 0.1 and 0.5% of all T cells. Peptide-specific T cell clones were generated from peripheral blood and lesional skin. Stimulation of these T cell clones resulted in only weak proliferation. The T cell clones were mostly CD4-positive and exhibited a THO- or THI-like cytokine profile. Conclusions: These data suggest that an enterotoxin-specific T cell response is present in the skin and blood of patients with atopic dermatitis sensitized to SEB, but this response is rather weak and probably of minor clinical importance in relation to the superantigen-reactive T cell response.",

The development of a new class of nonsteroidal, immunomodulatory drugs which have been primarily developed for transplantation medicine, has revolutionized the treatment of AD. Since in most of the patients a rapid clinical improvement has been achieved with the help of these drugs, research work has focused on the mode of action of TIMs in the human immune system.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Studies about the prevalence of latex allergies in health care workers (HCW) have been made worldwide and differ in the single studies between 2 and 17%. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the natural rubber latex allergies in health care workers in Rostock and Fremantle. Material/method: In our study we examined 557 people, 276 employees of the University Hospital Rostock and of the hospital Klinikum Slid in Rostock as well as 281 colleagues of the Fremantle Hospital Perth, educational hospital of the University of Western Australia. We developed questionnaire, included a present history, family history, allergy and latex anamnesis. For the prick test we used commercial test solutions made by ALK-Scherax. The in vitro diagnostic contained the determining ofthe latex-specific IgE by the Allergopharma specific IgE ELISA (RV). Results: The 2 groups of test persons from Rostock and Fremantle hospital did not differ in regard to age and sex. In the Fremantle group we found a significantly higher number of atopic persons (R = 25.4%; F = 50.9%). The probands from Rostock were found to have served for a longer period in their jobs (R = 15 ′ 10.7 years; F = 12.4 ′ 10 years). The use of unpowdered and latex-free gloves were more common in Rostock. On average, the wearing time and the number of the daily used gloves were significantly higher in Rostock than in Fremantle. The 2 groups from Rostock and Fremantle did not show any significant differences in the SPT (R = 4.0%; F = 3.9%), in the EAST classes ≥ 2 (R = 2.5%; F = 3.9%), in latex sensitization (R = 4.7%; F = 5.3%) and in natural rubber allergy (R = 3.3%; F = 3.6%). In our study we could prove that probands with atopic disease, as well from Rostock as from Fremantle, are significantly more frequent latex-sensitive than test persons without an atopic disease (p < 0.001). The risk of latex sensitization is within the persons with atopic disease 8 times higher than within those, who don't have any atopic disease. Conclusion: The results of our study, with an allergy rate of 3.3% in Rostock and 3.6% in Fremantle, show a low prevalence of latex allergy in comparison to other in literature published investigations. The risk of latex sensitization was significantly higher under the atopics.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of insect venom allergy in the European population is about 5%. In Germany, 20 - 40 deaths are reported every year. Clinical manifestations of the IgE-mediated disease range from local to systemic reactions to anaphylactic shock. Diagnosis is established based on anamnesis, skin testing and specific IgE antibodies in serum. Systemic reactions require preventive and therapeutic measures, especially an emergency set. Repetitive education is indispensable. Immunotherapy treatment of patients with insect venom allergy is one of the most advantageous uses of VIT (venom immunotherapy) with a reported effectiveness of 80% to nearly 100%. Since the first immunotherapy with pure venom was carried out in 1974, protocols of various duration have been devised in an effort to maximize protection and minimize side-effects. For children, a modified ultrarush immunotherapy protocol is appropriate. In contrast to conventional dose increase, schedules lasting a minimum of 5 days, shorter protocols reduce the patients stay in the hospital and provide an earlier protection towards stings. The risks of insect venom allergy are still underestimated not only in the general population, but also by many physicians.",

Results: The results of the cytological analysis of the induced sputum from the subgroups of patients with allergic rhinitis were compared to those obtained from the patients with allergic bronchial asthma and healthy controls and confirmed presence of the allergic inflammation in subgroups 3 and 4 of the patients. Conclusions: Absence of lower airway complaints in subgroup 4 patients with allergic rhinitis may be explained by still insufficient degree of the allergic inflammation in comparison to the one in patients with allergic bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "Asthma and allergic rhinitis are closely connected by epidemiology and pathophysiology. This article provides an overview of recent results regarding the importance of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) in the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. CysLTs do not only cause bronchoconstriction, mucosal edema and increased mucus production, but also have an important role in eosinophilic airway inflammation and probably early remodeling of the lower airways. In allergic rhinitis, their importance exceeds that of an early-phase mediator, as they are involved in sustaining minimal persistent inflammation in the nasal mucosa. The main symptoms elicited by CysLTs in the nose are long-lasting nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. The cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1 antagonist montelukast is the only antileukotriene available in Germany. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of montelukast in asthma. In combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) it exerts additional clinical effects compared to monotherapy with ICS. Montelukast is effective on all nasal symptoms as well as eye symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). First results indicate that montelukast provides a more marked amelioration of lung function in those asthmatics with concomitant SAR compared to those without SAR. In addition to a systemic antiinflammatory effect, montelukast has been shown to exert local anti-inflammatory effects in the bronchi and, in first studies, also in the nose. Up to 99% of allergic asthmatics suffer from concomitant rhinitis. For this large group of patients montelukast can be a suitable medication.",

    "abstract": "There have only been very limited published data dealing with correlations between skin prick test (SPT), in vitro diagnosis (IVD) (Allergen Dipstick) and nasal provocation (NP). We compared SPT with the results of allergen dipstick Allergodip Mites and More® and NP. The following mites were compared: house dust mites (HM): D. pteronyssinus (D. pter.), D. farinae (D. far.) and storage mites (SM): Acarus siro, Lepidoglyphus destructor, Tyrophagus putrescentiae. 108 patients who visited the ENT clinic complaining about chronic rhinitis were investigated. The SPT and IVD results were compared for both HM and SM and comparisons ofNP with SPT and IVD were made only for HM. SPT was classified in reaction 0 (negative), + (very weak positive), ++ (weak positive), +++ (= histamine positive control)/and ++++ (strong/very strong positive). IVD was classified in classes 0, 1, 2, 3, for comparison with NP. SPT: for the comparison of SPT with IVD the following correspondence was obtained: SPT 0/IVD class 0, D. pteronyssinus: 93.3%, D. farinae: 91.3% SM: Acarus siro: 95.2%, Lepidoglyphus destructor and Tyrophagus putrescentiae: 100%. SPT +++/++++/IVD > 1: HM D. pter.: 89.5% and D. far.: 94.2%. For the evaluation of SM, there were not enough patients. NP: correspondence SPT with positive NP, SPT ++++: 58.3% (D. pter.)/48.0% (D. far.), +++; 37.5%/40% ++: 4.2%/12.0% +: 0%/0%. 0:0%/0%. SPT with negative NP, SPT: ++++: 15.4%/13.0%, +++: 23.1%/ 17.4%, ++: 34.6%/30.4%, +: 11.5%/17.4%, 0: 15.4%/21.7%. NP positive, Allergodip class 4: 29.2% (D. pter.)/ 36.0% (D. far.), 3: 45.8%/36.0%, 2: 25.0%/20.0%, 1: 0%/4.0%, 0: 0%/4.0%.

Conclusion: The stronger the SPT reaction and the higher the classes measured with allergen dipstick the more a positive NP reaction was observed. For a positive NP there, seems to be a cut-off value for SPT of +++/++++ and for IVD of class > 2. The stronger the skin reaction (except SPT 0/IVD 0) the higher is the correspondence with the classes. There is no correlation between the degree of the skin reaction and the level of the classes. Patients with a strong skin reaction (+++/++++) do not necessarily show class 4, they may be lower. The only differentiation can be done in class 0 and ≥ 1. Futhermore, our investigation showed, that D. pter.-allergic patients are also sensitized to D. far. due to cross reactivity between these 2 mites. Some patients were also sensitized to storage mites.",

Hence, it is more likely to represent patient care in Germany. Including data from a number of university hospitals, it is anticipated that sophisticated medical care will be more justly paid for than before. These changes also affect payment for allergy patients. For example, reimbursement for specific immunotherapy in hymenoptera venom allergy has doubled when compared to 2003. When compared to classic dermatological cases like erysipelas or atopic dermatitis on the basis of profitability, care for allergy inpatients appears to be worthwile considering and should not be neglected when defining the portfolio of the department. However, it must not be overlooked that shifts in the political framework will have a pronounced effect on future inpatient care and must be taken into consideration when defining future admission strategies.",

The pancake had to be prepared by addition of 900 ml milk and two eggs to the flour. The following ingredients were noticed on the packet: wheat, buckwheat, oat, barley, E450, E500. The patient had suffered from previous atopies: atopic dermatitis and mixed-type asthma. Diagnosis: A scratch test with pancake flour was positive. Tests of the contents (wheat, oats, barley and buckwheat flour) showed a positive reaction only for buckwheat. The specific IgE was negative for wheat, barley and oats and positive for buckwheat (CAP class 5); IgE 471 U/l. The ingredients E450 and E500 are not known to be a relevant allergen. Organ-specific provocation testing was not conducted, given the clear clinical relevance of the identified sensitization. Conclusion: Buckwheat food allergy so far has been observed mainly in Asian countries, a few case reports have been published in central Europe. With the increasing use of buckwheat especially in so-called whole-grain products and bakery goods, severe allergic reactions could also become more common in central Europe, therefore, buckwheat should be integrated into the diagnostic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Antihistamines are therapeutic options of first choice for SAR and CIU. In this review, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine and mizolastine are compared regarding cardiotoxieity, sedative potential, eventual hepatotoxicity and teratogenity as well as their safety in special patient groups (children, elderly, patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency). The literature was searched for relevant publications and the pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the German regulatory authority were asked for information. Antihistamines' influences on cardiac repolarization are not uniform and their risk of triggering severe ventricular arrhythmias especially in high risk patients differs. Cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine bear the lowest risk. Among the modern antihistamines, cetirizine, levocetirizine and mizolastine are associated with the highest placebo-exceeding incidences of sedative adverse reactions in clinical trials. Some antihistamines already at their therapeutic dosage led to impairments in objective psychomotor and cognitive tests, cetirizine did so even below its therapeutic dosage. Under therapy with desloratadine, ebastine, and fexofenadine, few sedative adverse reactions occur in allergic patients and, to date, these antihistamines have not caused impairments in test batteries in studies with healthy volunteers at therapeutic dosages. It cannot be excluded that antihistamines in single cases cause liver function disorders and hepatitis. However, the risk among the different antihistamines seems to be comparable and not to be different from the background of idiopathic hepatitis. Experiences with exposure to antihistamines during the first trimester of pregnancy are limited. In general, there is no increased risk of teratogenity. Data on a potentially increased risk of hypospadias after exposure to loratadine cannot be definitely judged yet. In Germany, cetirizine and desloratadine are approved for children aged 2 years and older, levocetirizine and loratadine are available for children aged 6 years and older. Cetirizine in some pediatric studies was associated with a higher incidence of somnolence. Antihistamines are suitable for elderly patients. However, dosage adjustments have to be considered in case of hepatic or renal insufficiency.",

Nasal polyps are currentlyunderstood as a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis, characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation and tissue remodeling with edema formation. Nasal polyps are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, which may produce enterotoxins and thus modify the inflammation and induce polyclonal IgE formation. The prevalence of nasal polyps in the general population is 2 to 4%, however, higher in patients with asthma and/or aspirin sensitivity. Diagnosis is based on nasal endoscopy and CT scanning of the sinuses. Therapeutic approaches are evaluated, based on evidence from the literature, and listed. Topical corticosteroids are first-choice drugs for the treatment of nasal polyps before and after surgery, with oral steroids and surgery indicated if topical therapy fails.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate size of drug particles and inhalation devices appropriate to age are decisive for the efficiency of inhalation therapy. In early childhood inhalation is performed by means of jet nebulizers and spacers equipped with face masks which should be adapted to the skin without leak. Dosage of drugs must be adjusted to a potentially high drug loss, especially with respect to inhaled corticosteroids. In pre-school age inhalation should be performed using metered dose inhalers via spacer (with mouthpiece). Thus, a satisfactory bronchial deposition of inhaled corticosteroids is yielded. In older children an optimum inhalation technique is required: deep expiration before deep inspiration and an interruption of breathing at endinspiratory level. Older children prefer the handy drypowder inhalers. However, an elevated oropharyngeal deposition of drugs (and higher risk of systemic effects), must be taken into account, especially in inhaled corticosteroids. Devices for acoustic and/or optic control of a fast and deep inspiration should be mandatory. Breath-actuated metered dose inhalers are appropriate for older school-children and adolescents. In serious chronic lung disease as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dysfunction etc., the manually or electronically flow-actuated inspiratory nebulization (i.e. AKITA) via mouthpiece allows a highly efficient inhalation of expensive drugs such as DNAse and antibiotics. Systemically effective drug levels are possible and may be desirable in some patients, although the risk of adverse reaction increases. Regular checking of inhalation technique is recommended in all patients.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is the most common form of physiologic cell death and a necessary process to maintain cell numbers in multicellular organisms. Eosinophils are constantly produced in the bone marrow and the same numbers die, under normal circumstances, within a relatively short time period. In many eosinophilic inflammatory diseases, reduced eosinophil apoptosis has been described. This mechanism may contribute to increased eosinophil numbers, a phenomenon called eosinophilia. Overexpression ofIL-5 appears to be crucial for delaying eosinophil apoptosis in many allergic disorders. Survival factor withdrawal leads to the induction of apoptosis. Besides survival cytokines, eosinophil apoptosis is also regulated by death factors. Recent observations suggest a role for mitochondria in conducting eosinophil apoptosis, although the mechanisms that trigger mitochondria to release proapoptotic factors remain less clear. Drugs that specifically induce eosinophil apoptosis might be useful for triggering the resolution of unwanted eosinophilic inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent germ in the upper airways, and, under appropriate conditions, may produce enterotoxins with superantigenic activities. The classical enterotoxins SEA-E and TSST-l activate B- and T cells, eosinophils, epithelial and other cells, and are able to induce a polyclonal immune response including IgE synthesis and eosinophilic inflammation. We have shown that nasal polyps frequently are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, inducing a local immune reaction, which aggravates the eosinophilic inflammatory response. IgE antibodies in nasal polyp tissue may be used as diagnostic means for this immune reaction. We consider it probable that enterotoxines from Staphylococcus aureus are crucially contributing to this often difficult to treat disease of the upper airways. Furthermore, recent studies in severe, steroid-dependent asthmatics have shown that IgE-antibodies to enterotoxins are also found in the sera of these patients and similar pathomechanisms as in polyps may apply for the lower airways. To summarize, enterotoxins from Staphylococcus aureus most probably play an at least modulating role in severe upper and lower airway disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: The IL-4/IL-13 pathway plays a critical role in the IgE regulation and the development of asthma. Previous studies have described an association between genetic alterations in single genes of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway and these two phenotypes. In this study, we analyzed the combined effect of different genetic alterations in the genes of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway (IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ra and STAT6) on the regulation of IgE and the development of asthma. Methods: In a large cross-sectional study population (ISAAC II) of 1,120 children, aged 9-11 years, 18 polymorphisms in the respective genes of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway were genotyped. Based on linkage disequilibrium and functional relevance, one polymorphism of each gene (IL-4 C-589T, IL-13 C-1112T, IL-4Ra A148G und STAT6 C2892T) was selected to assess gene by gene interactions using a stepwise haplotype procedure following a Cordell model. Results: Certain combinations of polymorphisms in the IL-4/IL-13 pathway significantly influence IgE regulation. Furthermore, a significant protective effect towards the development of asthma was identified. Compared to single gene effects, the risk to develop elevated serum IgE (> 90th percentile) decreased by 80% while the risk to develop asthma dropped by 60%. Conclusion: These data indicate that only a combined analysis of various genetic alterations within the IL-4/IL-13 pathway reveals the development of atopy and asthma bronchiale.",

In this paper, reports from the allergological literature of the past 3 years are summarized. New allergens, but also new applications, new terms, altered behavioral patterns, occupational allergens, changes in the standard series, changed marketing methods as well as altered indications for patch testing will be mentioned. This article shall document that the search for trigger factors of contact allergy necessitates continuous education regarding the relevant literature, a fair amount of scientific curiosity and a dedicated patch test clinic.",

    "abstract": "Background:The objective was to determine the correlation rate between 2 different instruments measuring quality of life (QoL) of adult asthmatics. Methods:We examined the QoL of 321 asthmatic patients with a disease specific instrument, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and a general QoL instrument, the visual analogue scale (VAS). Data was analysed by using Statistical Programme for Social Sciences statistical software. Stepwise multivariate analyses were conducted. Results: The VAS scores were as follows according to asthma severity: intermittent 76%, mild 69%, moderate 60%, severe 49%, where 100% equates to maximum health. The relationship between spirometry and QoL data was moderate (r = 0.36; p = 0,001). Results of the SGRQ were the following: (in this case higher scores refer to lower level of QoL): Intermittent: symptom 16%, activity 20%, impact 14%, and the total score 16%. Mild: symptom 36%, activity 37%, impact 32%, and the total score 34%. Moderate: symptom 53%, activity 55%, impact 46%, and the total score 50%. Sever: symptom 66%, activity 62%, impact 53%, and the total score 58%. The relationship between spirometry and QoL is not as strong (r = 0.37, p = 0,001) as expected. We found fairly good correlations between the QoL scores measured by the 2 different instruments (r = - 0,619; p = 0,001). Conclusion: Our results indicate that although we have reliable techniques to measure the severity of airflow obstruction, which is the basic symptom of asthma, we cannot predict how patients see their actual health condition, quality of life. This fact gives further perspective to asthma-management, as more emphasis should be taken on the patient's global view of their asthma. Since we found good correlation between the results of the visual analogue scale and the SGRQ, the quality of life of asthmatics can be well assessed even with a very simple instrument, the like the VAS.",

    "abstract": "Many properly controlled well-designed studies have shown unequivocal evidence of the efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy (IT) in selected patient groups. However, it has also become clear that standard injection IT ispotentially dangerous, especially when administred by nonspecialists, inexperienced in treating anaphylaxis. In search of new forms of IT which are more effective, easy to administer and safer, there has been a resurgence of interest in the local administration of high dose of allergen. In the 90s, many new double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) studies demonstrated a clinical benefit of some routes of local allergen vaccine. New techniques in immunology allowed to show some improvement of objective study parameters beside subjective benefit after sublingual allergen administration. It has been advocated that high-dose sublingual-swallow IT for respiratory allergy as well as nasal IT for allergic rhinitis may be viable alternatives to parenteral IT. However, the magnitude of improvements in symptoms and medication requirements after sublingual compared to standard injection IT has not been assessed. Injection IT has been shown to modify the natural course of the allergic disease. It prevents development of new sensitization and reduces incidence of subsequent asthma. This has not been demonstrated for sublingual IT. There are no long-term follow-up studies after discontinuation of sublingual IT and not enough evidence to compare its clinical benefit with the effect of standard injection IT. Furthermore, analysis of studies assessing only children does not suggest that sublingual IT is of benefit for allergic respiratory disease in children. Many questions regarding the optimal dose of allergen administration, immunological changes as well as patient selection for sublingual IT, remain to be answered before this form of IT can be recommended for use in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Modern therapeutic concepts for atopic eczema reflect the multifactorial background by individual, complex and interdisciplinary measures. Aim of the present study was to determine long-term effects in patients who were treated according to the Schwelm concept by taking objective and subjective outcomes into account. The concept of the Schwelm therapeutic model is based on an ambulant group therapy focussing on areas of allergy, nutrition, education and prevention, and psychotherapy. Between 1990 and 1991, a total of 70 patients were treated in Schwelm. Fourty-four of these patients (response 63%, 25 children < 14 years) could be followed for up to 9 years. At all points of examination (TO = inclusion, T1 -3 = after 1, 4 and 9 years), extent as well as severity of typical morphological changes and itching were recorded. In addition, use of the medication for the examination intervals was determined. Relevant blood parameters like total IgE, leukocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes were determined at inclusion and after 1 year. Non-parametric statistics for paired samples were used. In the group of children, the percentage of affected skin surface decreased from 46% in the beginning to 14% after I and 6% after 9 years (p < 0.001 ). Similarly, the results for itching (5.8, 1.4, 1.0), erythema (6.5, 1.8, 1.3), scaling (4.0, 1.5, 0.4), erosion (5.4, 1.8, 1.5) and infiltration (6.0, 1.9, 0.6) were significantly reduced after 1, 4 and 9 years, respectively (p < 0.01). The use of external corticosteroids decreased from 50% to 8.3% over the entire observation period (p = 0.002). Similarly, the use of anthistamines decreased from 16.7% to 12.5%, but without statistical significance. In the group of adults, the affected skin surface decreased from 43% (TO) to 3% (Tl) (p < 0.01) after 1 year and increased slightly thereafter (14%, T3, n.s.). The results for itching (9.8, 1.5, 1.8), erythema (7.1, 1.1. 1, 1.7), scaling (5.9, 3.0, 0.8), erosion (4.7. 0.9, 1.7), and infiltration (4.6, 0.4, 1.5) decreased also significantly after 1, 4 and 9 years, respectively (p < 0. 01). A marked reduction of the use of external (58% vs. 16%, p = 0.02) and internal corticosteroids (21% vs. 5%, n.s.) was reported. The use of antihistamines in adults remained unchanged over the observation period (21%). No significant change was observed for any of the laboratory parameters. The interdisciplinary therapeutic concept yielded a significant and long-lasting reduction of objective and subjective symptoms of atopic eczema and could thereby reduce the need for side medication.",

    "abstract": "Individual protection measures, i.e. the use of barrier creams and protective gloves as well as skin care, are recommended for employees in skin risk occupations like in food industry. We investigated the short- and long-term acceptance, maintenance and efficacy of different prevention strategies (skin protection and care measures (SP), prevocational UV hardening (UV)) in bakery trainees. Demographic profile and atopy criteria were equally distributed in the 2 intervention arms and the control group (C). Skin protection measures were accepted and taken up to a varying amount during the course of training in the groups. Barrier cream and skin care use in the SP group reached 100% and 90%, respectively, at the end of the observation period. The level of acceptance of glove use (43.3%) was considerably lower. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the C (29.1%) followed by the UVB (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7% (95% CI -8.5 - 28.1) and 15.8% (95% CI -2.4 - 33.9), respectively. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95% CI 0.17 - 3.70) and 0.33 (95 % CI 0.09 - 1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. These clinical trends were underpinned by statistically significant differences in basal TEWL levels. Adequate and regular skin protection and care seem to be promising in the prevention of occupational hand dermatitis. The experimental concept of preoccupational UV induced skin hardening did not meet the expectations and cannot be recommended so far.",

It is assumed that the affected individuals react to widely differing types of chemical stimuli in very low concentrations which would not cause any reaction in the general population. The pathophysiology of the disease is unknown, however, several explanations are hypothesized by different clinical disciplines. The role of genetic factors is unknown, however, there is evidence that genetic factors may play a role in the etiology of MCS. With the total sequencing of the human genome and the development of the respective molecular genetic techniques, a fast and low-cost analysis of genetic factors becomes possible and new approaches to identify the pathomechanism of MCS can be performed. In the following, possible molecular-genetic strategies will be illustrated and their application in investigating the MCS etiology will be shown. Actually, the genetic basis of MCS will be investigated at the University Hospital Aachen.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, different test methods measuring the water vapour permeability (breathability) of encasings are described, from which conclusions concerning the resultant sleep comfort are intended to be drawn. In this situation, it is nearly impossible for manufacturers, health insurances, physicians and patients to overview the various techniques and to assess the results of different apparatus. Here, in order to achieve a better understanding, different test methods are compared and physical principles of the test procedures are explained. It is concluded that the quality of the test methods referring to their reproducibility and their validity concerning sleep comfort varies considerably: on the one hand, the standardized according to EN 31092 or ISO 11092 is ideally suitable for the measurement of the encasing's breathability. In particular, results obtained by this technique can be directly correlated to data from sleeping trials with human test subjects by a mathematical regression analysis. Additionally, an assessment scheme for the encasing's breathability based on the Skin Model testing is given. On the other hand, no data relevant to sleep comfort can be obtained by simple cup or dish methods according to, e.g., ASTM E 96 or DIN 53122: these techniques do not only yield no mathematical correlation to sleeping trials, but even the ranking of different materials can be unsafe.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasing prevalence of atopic diseases, we aimed to determine the level of knowledge about the pathogenesis and symptoms of these diseases among teachers in nursery schools. This occupational group has regularcontact with affected children and is ought to give appropriate advice and educate their charges. Nevertheless, we are not aware of comparative investigations regarding this occupational group. The existing surveys mostly dealt with schoolteachers and their knowledge about asthma. In the course of two professional meetings at the end of 2002, a standardized questionnaire was distributed to teachers attending from all nursery schools in Schleswig-Holstein. The instrument covers information on basic socio-demographic characteristics and the personal and family history of atopic diseases. The knowledge about frequency, symptoms, causes, therapeutic and preventive measures was assessed separately for the three major atopic diseases (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, atopic eczema). The data were analyzed descriptively and the influence of age, professional experience, education and personal, i.e. family history of atopic diseases on the overall result was investigated. A total of 177 completed questionnaires were received from female (95.2%) and another 9 questionnaires from male teachers, who had a mean age of 40 years (range 21-64 years). On average the teachers took care of 31 children. Initially, 25% believed to have sufficient knowledge on allergies. At the end of the questionnaire 85% felt not to be sufficiently informed about the subject (p < 0.001). The prevalence of atopic diseases in the general population was generally estimated too high. Only 7.5% of the participants recalled the established fact of a higher frequency of allergies in higher social classes. 91 % believed that environmental influences causally contribute to the manifestation of allergies and 84.4% reported that chemical compounds or food additives are reasons for the development of allergies. Little was known about the pathomechanisms of allergies or typical allergens. 54% supposed wood preservatives and 37% believed asbestos to be among the most common allergens in Germany. Amajority of 76% agreed with the statement that allergies are congenital and 54% believed that an underrather than an overreaction (61%) of the immune system describes the pathomechanism. Almost all subjects (96%) shared the conviction that allergies can be life threatening. Only 7% estimated the significance of a diagnostic allergy test correctly. The crossreactivity between pollen and food allergens as well as the clinical shift from allergic rhinitis to asthma was known to about 60% of the subjects. The typical allergens responsible for a seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were known to most of the teachers (87% - 98%). The knowledge about the pathogenesis of asthma was limited. 54% considered the impairment of inspiration as a typical symptom of an asthma attack. Characteristics of an atopic eczema such as pruritus (93%) and a familial predisposition (62%) were known to most of the teachers. Another 66%, however, believed that atopic eczema often occurs together with psoriasis. Fortunately, only 2.2% would not follow the current recommendations for vaccination in children with atopic eczema. Teachers, who were affected by an atopic eczema themselves, showed better overall results (100% vs. 49.1% with a result above average, p = 0.002). Furthermore, the educational level significantly influenced to the overall result: 17.6% of the participants who graduated after 8 years of school achieved a result above average compared with 55.8% of the participants with a higher graduation (p = 0.004). The level of knowledge of the teachers is limited and they seem to realize this fact. Particularly, with respect to the great willingness of further education (87.1%) and the educational key position of the teachers training on atopic diseases should be enhan",

    "abstract": "Irritant or allergic contact dermatitis of the hands is by far the most common type of occupational skin disease. In clinical studies with eczema patients, both an overrepresentation of subjects with sensitive skin (mostly patients with atopic dermatitis) and an excess of certain high-risk occupations have been noted. A systematic search for population-based epidemiological studies, which are interpretable in terms of analytic epidemiology, addressed hairdressers, nurses and metal workers (car manufacturing) compared to unexposed office workers. A heterogeneous definition of hand eczema, sensitive skin (atopy/atopic dermatitis) and exposure is evident from these studies. Furthermore, various different risk measures have been used, often without adjustment for potential confounders such as age and sex. Despite overall limited comparability resulting from such heterogeneity of study designs, it may be concluded that both previous atopic (hand or flexural) eczema and excessive work (e.g. more than 2 hours per day) are associated with at least a doubling of the risk of occupational contact dermatitis. In occupations where many are exposed to excessive wet work, the attributable risk (AR) associated with this factor is higher than the AR associated with atopic eczema. Primary prevention should thus aim at reducing excessive amounts of wet work, as far as this is possible. Irrespective of wet work, risk group-adapted primary prevention should furthermore be implemented, e.g. intensified skin protection and early (self-) diagnosis of initial irritant skin damage especially in employees with sensitive skin.",

    "abstract": "During antigen-induced immune reactions mature B cells become activated and differentiate into plasma cells which produce antibodies of different isotypes. If mature B cells become activated by their specific antigen and T-helper cells, which also recognize the same antigen, they can alter their original antibody isotype and undergo class-switch recombination. If T-helper-2 cells secrete cytokines such as interleukin-4, class-switch recombination to IgE is induced. This recombination mechanism is due to an AID-dependent rearrangement of the gene segments coding for the constant regions of the antibody molecules, leaving the variable, antibody-binding region unaltered. Allergen-specific antibodies of the IgE isotype bind to granulocytes and mast cells and degranulate upon allergen encounter by releasing mediators such as histamine. Therefore, the expression of IgE antibodies is the key mechanism of IgE-triggered allergies (type I) and their pathology.",

    "abstract": "Wichtigste Voraussetzungen fur eine erfolgreiche Behandlung der physikalen Urtikaria sind die exakte Diagnose des spezifischen Subtyps, eine grundliche Aufklarung des Patienten, damit er auslosende Reize moglichst meidet, und der Ausschlus von behandelbaren, moglicherweise die Symptomatik unterhaltenden anderen Krankheiten. Bei der Kalteurtikaria lohnt sich zudem bei mehr als der Halfte der Patienten eine Behandlung mit Penizillin oder Tetrazyklinen, obwohl deren Wirkung unklar ist. Den meisten Patienten ist auch mit einer symptomatischen Behandlung mit Antihistaminika geholfen, evtl. in hoherer Dosierung, dem Rest zumeist mit anderen Antiphlogistika. Bei ausgepragter cholinergischer Urtikaria kann Cetirizin in Kombination mit Danazol hilfreich sein. Die schwer behandelbare verzogerte Druckurtikaria spricht gelegentlich auf Dapson oder Sulfasalazin an, diatetische Masnahmen konnen aber auch Linderung bringen. Bei der Licht- und Kalteurtikaria kann eine kurzfristig anhaltende Toleranz induziert und bei der cholinergischen Urtikaria die Refraktarzeit gezielt genutzt werden. Mit diesen vielfachen therapeutischen Moglichkeiten gestaltet sich die Behandlung der physikalischen Urtikaria fur Patient und Arzt zumeist gleichermasen zufriedenstellend.",

    "abstract": "Die Urtikaria ist eine häufige und oft stark beeinträchtigende Erkrankung. Sie ist definiert als das Auftreten von juckenden Quaddeln und/oder Angioödemen, im Fall einer chronischen Urtikaria für länger als 6 Wochen. Für die Angioödeme bei Urtikariapatienten sind degranulierende Hautmastzellen und Histamin verantwortlich. Angioödeme können aber auch Bradykinin-vermittelt auftreten, bspw. beim hereditären Angioödem oder beim ACE-Hemmer-induzierten Angioödem. Bei der chronischen Urtikaria wird zwischen spontaner Urtikaria (CSU) und induzierbaren Urtikarien (CIndU) unterschieden. Eine Ursachensuche sollte schweren und/oder lange bestehenden Fällen der CSU vorbehalten bleiben und auf der Anamnese basieren. Bei allen Patienten mit CSU sollten Differenzialdiagnosen ausgeschlossen werden, v. a. autoinflammatorische Erkrankungen, Urtikariavaskulitis und Bradykinin-vermittelte Angioödeme. Ebenso ist es wichtig, eine schwere Entzündung abzuklären (CRP, BSG, DiffBB) und nichtsteroidale Antiphlogistika abzusetzen. Außerdem sollte bei allen CSU-Patienten die Krankheitsaktivität erfasst werden. Bei CIndU-Patienten muss der relevante Auslöser mittels Provokationstestung bestätigt und die minimal notwendige Auslöserstärke bestimmt werden (die sog. Reizschwelle). Die Therapie der chronischen Urtikaria besteht in aller Regel in der prophylaktischen Gabe von Antihistaminika, zunächst in Standarddosierung. Zugelassen für die Behandlung der CSU ist darüber hinaus Omalizumab. Die Diagnostik bei wiederkehrenden Angioödemen anderer Ursache, also Bradykinin-vermittelten Angioödemen, schließt eine ausführliche Anamnese (z. B. Fragen nach ACE-Hemmern, familiärer Häufung, Prodromi) ein sowie die Bestimmung von C4 und C1-Inhibitor im Blut. Bei Vorliegen eines hereditären Angioödems kommen C1-Inhibitorkonzentrate und Icatibant, ein Bradykininrezeptorblocker, zum Einsatz.",

    "abstract": "Farming is the world largest branch of economy. Exposures are very multifaceted. Respiratory diseases in farmers have been described as early as 1550. Asthma, bronchitis, and COPD are more prevalent in farmers than in non-farmers. Repeated episodes of organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) predispose to COPD. Mucous membrane irritation is a frequent phenomenon, particularly in pig farmers. The inflammatory potency of endotoxins is higher compared to, e.g., beta-glucans, peptidoglycans and muraminic acid. Endo toxins may exacerbate and initiate (non-allergic) asthma. Fungal spore concentrations in grain farming are higher than in animal feeding operations. Regarding specifically agricultural allergens, Bos d 2 is important, with high concentrations in stables, but also in living rooms and farmers' beds exceeding thresholds for sensitization. Scientifically valid threshold-limit concepts for agricultural bioaerosols are scarce and non-existent in Germany. The lower prevalence of atopic and slightly less consistent asthmatic diseases in children grown up on farms is predominantly caused by the increased diversity of microbial exposure. Farm animals have a high prevalence of inflammatory respiratory diseases, thus necessitating concepts of integrating animal health into prevention concepts of respiratory health.",

Etwa 5 % der Erwachsenen und 10 % der Kinder in Deutschland sind von Asthma bronchiale betroffen. Asthma zählt neben der COPD zu den obstruktiven Atemwegserkrankungen. Die Verengung der Atemwege (Obstruktion) entsteht durch eine vermehrte Bildung von zähem Schleim (Dyskrinie), Verkrampfung der Bronchialmuskulatur (Bronchospasmus) und Schwellung der Schleimhäute (Ödem). Im Gegensatz zur COPD ist die Obstruktion beim Asthma grundsätzlich reversibel. Die Hyperreagibilität des Bronchialsystems ist in etwa 30 % der Fälle auf eine allergische Reaktion auf inhalierbare Allergene zurückzuführen (sog. extrinsisches oder allergisches Asthma), während beim intrinsischen (nichtallergischen) Asthma Auslöser wie z. B. Infekte oder Medikamentenunverträglichkeiten infrage kommen. Zur Therapie des Asthma bronchiale stehen u. a. Bronchodilatatoren sowie entzündungshemmende Substanzen wie Kortison zur Verfügung.",

Kennzeichnen sind asthmatische Beschwerden, fluktuierende Lungeninfiltrate und Bronchiektasen. Bei jeder therapierefraktären Exazerbation eines Asthma- oder CF-Patienten muss an eine ABPA gedacht werden. Wichtigstes diagnostisches Kriterium ist eine positive Hautreaktion vom Soforttyp auf Aspergillusantigene. Serologische Marker wie die Bestimmung des Gesamt-IgE und der Nachweis rekombinanter Aspergillusantigene werden ergänzend eingesetzt. Durch eine frühzeitige Diagnose und Einleitung einer antientzündlichen Therapie können irreversible Veränderungen mit progredienten Bronchiektasen und Fibrose in vielen Fällen verhindert werden.

Der klinisch relevanten Auslösephase geht eine Sensibilisierungsphase voraus. Auslöser der AKD sind Kontaktallergene. Hierbei handelt es sich um organische Chemikalien oder Metallsalze, die nach Penetration der Haut direkt kovalent oder als Komplexe an Proteine binden. Grundlage für die Auslösung einer Immunantwort ist die starke Aktivierung des natürlichen Immunsystems durch Kontaktallergene. Dem entgegen wirken regulatorische Faktoren von T-Zellen. Diese T-Zell-vermittelte Immunantwort wird durch dendritische Zellen orchestriert. Arbeiten im murinen System legen nahe, dass Langerhans-Zellen eher regulatorische T-Zell-Antworten stimulieren und dermale dendritische Zellen für die Programmierung von proinflammatorischen, ekzemauslösenden T-Zellen verantwortlich sind. Aus den Ergebnissen dieser Arbeiten lassen sich nunmehr wertvolle therapeutische Ansätze ableiten.",

Die Wirksamkeit der verfügbaren Pollen-, Milben-, Tierepithelien- und Schimmelpilzpräparate zur SCIT oder SLIT ist je nach Produkt unterschiedlich dokumentiert und daher nicht pauschal zu bewerten. Indikation und Kontraindikationen werden in Leitlinien zur SIT regelmäßig aktualisiert. Neben Lokalreaktionen können bei der SCIT in seltenen Fällen systemische allergische Reaktionen auftreten, die sofort zu behandeln sind.

    "abstract": "Das natürliche Immunsystem stellt eine erste und rasch einsetzende Immunantwort gegenüber Mikroorganismen bereit. Wie sie funktioniert, wurde in den letzten Jahren immer exakter entschlüsselt, und eine zentrale Rolle für dieses System spielen Pathogenerkennungsrezeptoren (PRR). Dabei kann die natürliche Immunität die Ausbildung der adaptiven Immunität auslösen und entscheidend prägen, somit auch die eine Allergie vermittelnden Immunantworten. Das Zusammenwirken von Zellen des natürlichen und des adaptiven Immunsystems sowie der Einfluss aktivierter PRR erlauben die Ausbildung verschiedener Immunqualitäten. Diese Immunqualitäten drücken sich in den unterschiedlichen T-Helfersubtypen aus und können Entzündungen verstärken (Th1, Th17) oder modulieren und sogar immunologische Toleranz (Treg) bewirken. Im Kontext einer Allergie können ebenfalls allergiefördernde oder tolerogene sowie antiinflammatorisch Immunqualitäten wirksam werden. Die gezielte Beeinflussung der adaptiven Immunantwort durch die natürliche Immunität und deren Aktivatoren eröffnet auch Therapieoptionen bei Allergien. Besonders die Daten aus der Analyse des humanen Mikrobioms und die sich daran anschließenden funktionellen Untersuchungen mit der Identifikation von potenziell tolerogen wirkenden mikrobiellen Substanzen könnten eine ganz neue Klasse von biologischen Präparaten hervorbringen.",

Die Antikörper der Klassen IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA und IgE werden über verschiedene konstante Regionen in ihren schweren Ketten definiert. Sie zeigen eine unterschiedliche Gewebeverteilung und Wirkung auf Pathogene. Der Klassenwechsel entsteht durch einen Austausch der exprimierten schweren Kettencluster, z. B. von C-µ für IgM mit C-γ, C-α oder C-ε, sodass dementsprechend IgG, IgA oder IgE entsteht, wobei die antigenbindende variable Region nicht verändert wird. Die Induktion des Klassenwechsels benötigt primäre und sekundäre Signale. Signale, die einen primären Klassenwechsel induzieren, vermitteln die Expression der »activation induced cytidine deaminase« (AID) und weitere Proteine, die für den Klassenwechsel eine Rolle spielen, wie etwa den Transkriptionsfaktor NF-κΒ. Signale, die sekundär einen Klassenwechsel fördern, können die Expression von AID nicht induzieren, sind jedoch für die Steuerung des Klassenwechsels zu einem bestimmten Isotyp, wie bspw. IgG, IgA oder IgE durch die Auswahl der S-Region über die Induktion der Keimwandtranskripte, wirksam. Für IgE spielen hier die Zytokine IL-4 und IL-13 beim Menschen eine zentrale Rolle.",

Lungenfunktionsanalytische Messungen sind mindestens bis zu 6 h nach Exposition erforderlich, um Spätreaktionen zu detektieren. Bei der Bewertung der Messwerte müssen Einflussfaktoren, die zu falsch-positiven aber auch zu falsch-negative Ergebnissen führen können, beachtet werden.",

Die wichtigsten Allergene pflanzlichen und tierischen Ursprungs können so 8 Proteinsuperfamilien zugeordnet werden. Diese werden in diesem Kapitel vorgestellt. Biochemische, biologische und allergene Eigenschaften sowie Kreuzreaktivitäten ausgewählter Allergene dieser Gruppierungen werden besprochen. Übersichtliche Tabellen zeigen zahlreiche Beispiele allergener Vertreter für jede der 8 Superfamilien. Die hier vorgestellte Klassifizierung liefert eine Grundlage für weitere Überlegungen zur Fähigkeit dieser Proteine, eine allergische Sensibilisierung zu verursachen. Diese scheint u. a. auch mit der Fähigkeit, dass Allergene Liganden binden und mit dem angeborenen Immunsystem interagieren können, verknüpft zu sein, wie in diesem Kapitel abschließend diskutiert wird.",

    "abstract": "Das mukosaassoziierte lymphatische Gewebe (MALT) in der Darmschleimhaut ist für die Infektionsabwehr und die Ausbildung von Immunfunktionen des gesamten Organismus bedeutend. Das MALT besteht aus induktiven Regionen (Peyer's Patches, isolierte Lymphfollikel, Appendix), der IgA-Immunantwort und Effektorstrukturen (Lamina propria, exokrine Drüsen, Oberflächenepithel). Nicht nur Immunzellen (wie Makrophagen, dendritische Zellen, B- und T-Zellen), sondern auch mukosale Epithelzellen (Enterozyten, Becher-Zellen, Paneth-Zellen, M-Zellen) tragen wesentlich zur Funktion des MALT bei. Die humorale Immunantwort wird durch sekretorisches IgA dominiert, obwohl auch IgG, IgM, IgD und IgE im Darm gefunden werden. Zahlreiche angeborene, aber hochadaptive Mechanismen induzieren Klassenwechsel, Plasmazelldifferenzierung und Antikörperproduktion. Jedes Ungleichgewicht zwischen Aktivierung und Toleranz kann zu chronisch-entzündlichen Erkrankungen wie Allergien oder eosinophile Enteritiden führen.",

Die Bedeutung von Kofaktoren wurde erst in den letzten Jahren erkannt und bzgl. der epidemiologischen Relevanz und der zugrunde liegenden pathophysiologischen Mechanismen untersucht. Kofaktoren können in 3 Gruppen eingeteilt werden, in 1) anaphylaktische Reaktionen verstärkende Augmentationsfaktoren, in 2) als Kofaktoren wirkende Begleiterkrankungen und in 3) andere Kofaktoren. Von besonderer Bedeutung sind die echten Augmentationsfaktoren, da sie die immunologische Reaktion direkt modulieren. Die Erfassung möglicher Kofaktoren in der Anamnese ist für die Diagnostik und besonders für Provokationstests von großer Bedeutung. Die Kenntnis zu Kofaktoren und deren Wirkmechanismen ist dann auch Voraussetzung, um das individuelle Patientenrisiko besser einzuschätzen sowie therapeutische und präventive Maßnahmen treffen zu können. Das Kapitel »Kofaktoren bei Soforttypreaktionen« fasst zu diesen Punkten den derzeitigen Kenntnisstand zusammen.",

B. IgE, Eosinophilie, Mastzellen) beschränkt hat, wird dem neuen Begriff der »Heterogenität« ein neues Kapitel im Verständnis der Entzündungsreaktionen aufgeschlagen. Hier hinter verbirgt sich die Erkenntnis, dass das Entzündungsbild bei Patienten mit allergischen Erkrankungen vielschichtig sein kann. Neben dem klassischen Th2-Phänotyp finden sich mindestens genauso viele Patienten, bei denen eine andere Signatur der Entzündung nachgewiesen werden kann, z. B eine Th1-/Th17-Signatur, Mischtypen oder Signaturen, die bisher noch nicht vollständig entschlüsselt sind.

Innerhalb dieses komplexen Netzwerks wirken Keratinozyten als Sensorzellen, die Gefahrenpotenziale erkennen und ihrerseits antigenpräsentierende Zellen mittels Mediatorausschüttung stimulieren können. Zusätzlich sind auch Mastzellen, Granulozyten und Makrophagen in ähnlicher Weise in die Funktionen des SALT eingebunden. Durch die anschließende Aktivierung und Rekrutierung verschiedener T-Zell-Populationen, wie geweberesidenter TRM-Zellen und T-Zellen der lymphatischen Organe, kann die Haut umgehend reagieren und bspw. Infektionen adäquat bekämpfen, aber auch Allergien oder Autoimmunerkrankungen auslösen. In allen genannten Szenarien muss das SALT die Modulation der Immunantwort organisieren und eine Homöostase zwischen (adäquater) Immunreaktion und Toleranzinduktion wahren.",

Fur Patienten mit IgE-vermittelten Erkrankungen (z.B. allergische Rhinokonjunktivitis, allergisches Asthma und Insektengiftallergie) ist die SIT die einzige verfugbare immunmodulierende und als solche „kausale“ Therapieoption. Die den Studien zur SIT zugrunde liegenden Endpunkte sind jedoch klinisch und methodologisch sehr heterogen. Dies gilt sowohl fur die subkutane als auch fur die sublinguale Immuntherapie (SCIT und SLIT). Derzeit gibt es noch keinen allgemein anerkannten und definierten Standard hinsichtlich der optimalen (primaren und sekundaren) Endpunkte in SIT-Studien. \r\n__Methoden:__ Das hier vorliegende Positionspapier wurde von einer Task Force (TF) der European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Immunotherapy Interest Group erarbeitet. Klinische Endpunkte, die derzeit in diversen RCTs zur Anwendung kommen, wurden hierfur evaluiert und Empfehlungen fur die optimalen Endpunkte zukunftiger Studien zur SIT bei allergischer Rhinokonjunktivitis ausgesprochen. \r\n__Ergebnisse:__ Nach sorgfaltiger Literaturrecherche haben die Mitglieder der TF Empfehlungen fur neun Bereiche/ Domanen klinischer Studienendpunkte formuliert.

    "abstract": "Fish is one of the main elicitors for food allergies. For a long time, the clinical picture of fish allergy was reduced to the following features. First, fish-allergic patients suffer from a high IgE cross-reactivity among fishes so that they have to avoid all species. Second, clinically relevant symptoms are linked to the presence of IgE-antibodies recognizing parvalbumin, the fish panallergen. This view was challenged by results from recent studies as follows. 1. Allergic reactions which are limited to single or several fish species (mono-or oligosensitisations) apply not only to single cases but patients with this phenotype constitute an important sub-group among fish-allergic individuals. 2. Newly identified fish allergens, enolases, aldolases, and fish gelatin, are of high relevance as the majority of the fish-allergic individuals seem to develop specific IgE against these proteins. The present review gives an overview on the clinical characteristics of fish allergy and the molecular properties of relevant fish allergens. The advancement of the IgE-based diagnosis using a panel of well-defined fish allergens from different species is in the focus of the discussion. © 2016 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.",

    "abstract": "Drug hypersensitivity reactions are unpredictable adverse drug reactions. They manifest either within 1 - 6 h following drug intake (immediate reactions) with mild-to-life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis, or several hours to days later (delayed reactions), primarily as exanthematous eruptions. It is not always possible to detect involvement of the immune system (allergy). Waiving diagnostic tests can result in severe reactions on renewed exposure on the one hand, and to unjustified treatment restrictions on the other. With this guideline, experts from various specialist societies and institutions have formulated recommendations and an algorithm for the diagnosis of allergies. The key principles of diagnosing allergic/hypersensitivity drug reactions are presented. Where possible, the objective is to perform diagnostics within 4 weeks to 6 months following the reaction. A clinical classification of symptoms based on the morphology and time course of the reaction is required in order to plan a diagnostic work-up. In the case of typical symptoms of a drug hypersensitivity reaction and unequivocal findings from validated skin and/or laboratory tests, a reaction can be attributed to a trigger with sufficient confidence. However, skin and laboratory tests are often negative or insufficiently reliable. In such cases, controlled provocation testing is required to clarify drug reactions. This method is reliable and safe when attention is paid to indications and contraindications and perfouned under appropriate medical supervision. The results of the overall assessment are discussed with the patient and documented in an allergy passport in order to ensure targeted avoidance in the future and allow the use of alternative drugs where possible.",

    "abstract": "Clemens von Pirquet (1874 – 1929) pragt den Begriff „Allergie“ nun seit mehr als 100 Jahren. Das Konzept der Allergie war das Resultat von Forschungen im Bereich von Impfung und Serumkrankheit. Pirquet waren bei wiederholter Impfung schneller auftretende und starkere Reaktionen an der Injektionsstelle aufgefallen. Zur Dokumentation der gesteigerten Reaktion impfte sich Pirquet im Selbstversuch uber 5 Tage wiederholt mit Kuhpocken und lies das Resultat am 27. Juli 1905 durch Dr. Carl Henning (1860 – 1917) in einer Moulage festhalten. Diese Moulage von Pirquets volarem Vorderarm zeigt 12 Stunden nach der Impfung eine Quaddel mit Erythem, eine Nekrose nach 48 Stunden, sowie langsame Abheilung bis zum 5. Tag. Die Moulage wurde auch als Photographie in Pirquets Buch „Klinische Studien uber Vakzination und vakzinale Allergie“ von 1907 und weiteren zeitgenossischen Lehrbuchern abgebildet. Eine Kopie der Moulage wurde zu Unterrichtszwecken von Professor Max Tieche (1878 – 1938), dem Grunder der Stadtischen Poliklinik fur Dermatologie (dem heutigen Dermatologischen Ambulatorium des Stadtspitals Triemli) in Zurich verwendet. Heute stellt die Moulage ein eindrucksvolles Zeitzeugnis aus der Geburtsstunde der Allergologie dar.",

    "abstract": "Allergien und im speziellen hier atopieassoziierte Typ-I-Reaktionen sind klassische Umwelterkrankungen, wobei die auslösenden Substanzen (das sind die Allergene) großteils bereits charakterisiert und in rekombinanter Form erhältlich sind. Neben dieser Kausalkette, Allergen und Sensibilisierung gegenüber diesem Allergen, wirken Umwelteinflüsse unterschiedlichster Art modulierend – verstärkend oder protektiv – auf die Allergieentwicklung ein. Dabei muss zwischen biogenen und anthropogenen Umweltfaktoren unterschieden werden. Unter den allergiefördernden Faktoren kommt im Innenraum dem Tabakrauch, in der Außenluft der Exposition durch Verkehrsbelastung eine entscheidende Rolle zu. In der Außenluft bestehen Interaktionen zwischen den Allergenträgern (z. B. Pollen) und Luftschadstoffen, die u. U. zur weiteren Verstärkung allergischer Reaktionen, insbesondere in der Symptomverschlechterung, eine Rolle spielen.

    "abstract": "Die Spirometrie, die Bodyplethysmographie und die Diffusionstestung sind wesentliche Bestandteile der Lungenfunktionsdiagnostik. Eine obstruktive Ventilationsstörung, charakteristisch für die Erkrankungen Asthma und COPD, wird spirometrisch durch eine Verminderung des Tiffeneau-Index (FEV1/FVC) auf Werte unterhalb des 5. Perzentils (entsprechend dem unteren Grenzwert, »lower limit of normal«, LLN) definiert. Eine verminderte Vitalkapazität kann Ausdruck einer restriktiven Ventilationsstörung sein, die durch eine Verminderung der totalen Lungenkapazität (TLC) auf Werte unterhalb des 5. Perzentils (LLN) definiert ist. Zur Differenzialdiagnose einer Lungenüberblähung ist daher die bodyplethysmographische Messung der TLC notwendig. Eine Einschränkung der Diffusionskapazität besteht bei Patienten mit Lungenemphysem oder mit einer Lungengerüsterkrankung, wie z. B. Lungenfibrose oder Alveolitis.",

Ob die gewünschte Schutzwirkung im Einzelfall eingetreten ist, kann weder durch Labor- noch Hauttests zuverlässig angezeigt werden. Bestehen Risikofaktoren für Therapieversagen oder ist die Lebensqualität des Patienten durch die unsichere Reaktionslage einschränkt, so ist eine Stichprovokation mit dem krankheitsursächlichen Insekt angezeigt. Risikofaktoren für Therapieversagen sind ACE-Hemmer, Mastozytose, Bienengiftallergie und wiederholte Nebenwirkungen der HG-SIT. Bei erhöhter Erhaltungsdosis, Doppel-HG-SIT oder längerer Behandlungsdauer ist die Schutzrate erhöht. Eine Erhöhung der Erhaltungsdosis auf > 100 µg Gift ist sowohl in der Prävention als auch Therapie des Therapieversagens der HG-SIT wirksam.",

    "abstract": "Der Eosinophile ist morphologisch v. a. an seinen eosinaffinen Granula zu erkennen und macht im Gesunden ca. 1–5 % der Leukozytenfraktion aus. Die Zytotoxizität der granulären Proteine und die Fähigkeit zur Produktion von reaktiven Sauerstoffradikalen sind für die Effektorfunktion dieser Zellen hauptsächlich verantwortlich. Der Eosinophile ist weiterhin Quelle diverser Zytokine, welche zu seinen immunregulatorischen, metabolischen und profibrotischen Funktionen beitragen. Die Zahl der Eosinophilen kann sowohl im Blut als auch im Gewebe bei Erkrankungen mit unterschiedlicher Pathogenese erhöht sein. Je nach Ursache unterscheidet man intrinsische (primäre) und extrinsische (sekundäre) eosinophile Erkrankungen. Erstere werden durch genetische Veränderungen verursacht, letztere durch eine erhöhte Produktion von Eosinopoietinen. Diese pathogeneseorientierte Klassifikation eosinophiler Erkrankungen erlaubt eine möglichst zielgerichtete Therapie dieser Patienten.",

    "abstract": "Die AD ist eine chronisch-rezidivierende, meist stark juckende Hauterkrankung altersabhängig unterschiedlicher Ausprägung. In den letzten Jahrzehnten kam es zu einem deutlichen Anstieg der AD um das 4- bis 8-Fache. Sowohl genetische Faktoren (mit der Folge von Hautbarrieredefekten und eines gestörten angeborenen und adaptiven Immunsystems) als auch Auslösefaktoren spielen für die Erstmanifestation und das spätere Auftreten von Erkrankungsschüben eine wichtige Rolle. Das klinische Bild ist je nach Stadium der individuellen Hautläsionen und Lebensalter verschieden. Der Juckreiz bestimmt den Leidensdruck, auch die Stigmatisierung und die hohe Rate von Superinfektionen der Haut mindert bei vielen Patienten die Lebensqualität. Beim Management werden individuelle Triggerfaktoren wie Allergene, Hautirritanzien, mikrobielle Erreger oder psychologische Faktoren und deren Meidung der 1. Stufe zugeordnet. Die nächsten beiden Stufen beinhalten die konsequente antiinflammatorische Behandlung mit topischen Kortikosteroiden oder Calcineurininhibitoren. In der 4. Stufe kommen bei sehr schwer ausgeprägter AD antiinflammatorische Systemtherapien zum Einsatz.",

Wenn immer möglich, sollten orale Nahrungsmittelprovokationen doppelblind und plazebokontrolliert (DBPCFC) durchgeführt werden. Für die praktische Durchführung der titrierten oralen Provokationen wird ein standardisiertes Vorgehen beschrieben. Eine Provokation sollte dann als positiv gewertet werden, wenn die Symptome objektiv (sichtbar oder messbar) sind und/oder schwer und/oder reproduzierbar und/oder persistierend auftreten. Der zeitliche Abstand zur Reprovokation wird entsprechend der Prognose des Allergens gewählt.",

    "abstract": "Unter einem allergischen Kontaktekzem versteht man eine Spättypreaktion der Haut auf meist exogene Allergene oder Haptene. Diese Spättypreaktion ist eine Typ-IV-Immunreaktion und tritt daher verzögert auf. Klinisch imponiert meist ein entweder akutes, subakutes oder chronisches Ekzem, Streuphänomene außerhalb der Applikationsstelle des Allergens werden beobachtet. Die häufigste Lokalisation sind die Hände. Dort ist das allergische Kontaktekzem auch als Berufskrankheit relevant. Diagnostisch ist neben der Klinik v. a. der Epikutantest wichtig, um Typ-IV-Sensibilisierungen zu detektieren. Ein atopisches Ekzem, ein kumulativ-toxisches Ekzem und seltener auch eine Psoriasis stellen die wichtigsten Differenzialdiagnosen dar. Neben einer strikten Allergenkarenz sind topische Glukokortikoide, unterstützt durch eine konsequente Basistherapie, Mittel der ersten Wahl.",

    "abstract": "Das beruflich bedingte Kontaktekzem tritt in 90–95 % im Bereich der Hände auf und resultiert aus einem komplexen Zusammenspiel irritativer und/oder allergischer Faktoren und prädisponierenden endogenen Faktoren wie atopische Disposition mit erhöhter Hautempfindlichkeit. Irritative Einflussfaktoren sind in bis zu 80 % der beruflich bedingten Hauterkrankungen ursächlich beteiligt und umfassen in erster Linie Feuchtbelastungen, aber auch Kontakt zu Lösungsmitteln, anderen Irritanzien, wie z. B. säurehaltige Nahrungsmittel, Stäube und mechanische Belastungen. Um die Diagnose eines rein chronisch-irritativen (»kumulativ-subtoxischen«) Handekzems stellen zu können, ist eine sorgfältige allergologische Diagnostik erforderlich, einschließlich der Bewertung der klinischen und beruflichen Relevanz möglicher positiver Testreaktionen. Die wichtigste präventive Maßnahme ist die Erkennung und Meidung allergischer und irritativer Triggerfaktoren am Arbeitsplatz durch individuelle Hautschutzmaßnahmen und ggf. arbeitsplatzbezogene Risikoverminderung (z. B. Austausch identifizierter Allergene).",

Da Mastzellen die zentralen Effektorzellen der IgE-vermittelten Soforttypallergien und auch von nicht-IgE-vermittelten soforttypähnlichen Reaktionen darstellen, sind diese Erkrankungen von besonderer Bedeutung für die Allergologie. Mit einer Inzidenz von 0,3–0,6/100 000 gehört sie zu den seltenen Erkrankungen. Orientierend lassen sich Mastozytosen in kutane und systemische Mastozytosen einteilen. Im Kindesalter kommen vorwiegend kutane Mastozytosen vor, die meist bis zum Pubertätsalter in Remission gehen. Ein Befall des Knochenmarks oder anderer extrakutaner Organe definiert eine systemische Mastozytose. Diese Form kommt zumeist im Erwachsenenalter vor. Die häufigste Form im Erwachsenenalter ist nach WHO-Klassifikation die indolente systemische Mastozytose. Diese Form hat eine sehr gute Langzeitprognose.",

    "abstract": "Bei Medikamentenallergien kommt es zu Immunreaktionen, die gegen das Medikament gerichtet sind und klinische Symptome verursachen. Man unterscheidet zwischen Hapten- und p-i-bedingten Reaktionen, wobei letztere nur fur T-Zell-Reaktionen nachgewiesen wurden. Die haufigsten Immunmechanismen, welche Medikamentenallergien zugrunde liegen, sind Vermehrung von spezifischen IgE-produzierenden B- und/oder spezifischen T-Zellen. IgG-vermittelte Reaktionen, die z.B. eine hamolytische Anamie verursachen konnen, sind selten. Spezifische IgE konnen mittels CAP-Technologie nachgewiesen werden. Das Medikament muss an eine Tragersubstanz covalent gebunden werden, was den Nachteil mit sich bringt, dass die entsprechende Bindungsstelle im Medikament fur IgE nicht erkennbar ist. Der Basophilenaktivierungstest (BAT) arbeitet meist mit freiem, ungebundenem Medikament. Wie die IgE-Vernetzung stattfindet, ist allerdings unklar. Beide Teste sind nicht genugend sensitiv um den In-vivo-Test (Prick oder i.d.) zu ersetzen. Bei T-Zell-Reaktionen wird in vitro meist die Proliferation der durch das Medikament stimulierten T-Zellen erfasst. Die Blutzellen (antikoaguliertes Blut) sollte innerhalb von 24 h im Labor zur Verarbeitung ankommen, wo die Zellseparation durchgefuhrt wird, um die Zellen mit dem Medikament zu stimulieren. Diese Stimulation kann durch Messung von Aktivierungsmarker (mittels Flow-Zytometrie), sezernierter Zytokine (ELISA) oder 3H-Thymidin Einbau in die sich teilende Zellen (Lymphozytentransformations- Test, LTT) erfasst werden. Am meisten Erfahrung liegt fur den LTT vor. Die Sensitivitat wird bei eindeutigen Fallen auf 50 – 70% geschatzt, hangt aber stark vom Krankheitsbild und Medikament ab. Schwere makulopapulose Reaktionen und DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), AGEP (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) sind meist positiv im LTT, aber schwere bullose Reaktionen (SJS/TEN; Stevens-Johnson Syndrom/toxische epidermale Nekrolyse) werden besser mittels Zytotoxteste und Zytokinsekretion erfasst, da eine T-Zell-Proliferation weniger prominent ist. Trotz der limitierten Sensitivitat sind diese Teste gut geeignet um Kreuzreaktionen zu erfassen, bzw. fur mechanistische Studien. Da Provokationsteste bei verzogerten Medikamentenallergien nicht zur Verfugung stehen (es ist unklar, wie lange und wie hoch dosiert man das Medikament bei verzogerten Reaktionen geben muss), werden diese Teste in Zukunft eher mehr eingesetzt werden. Wichtig ist, dass sie selten falsch positiv sind, und ein positives Resultat als relevant angesehen werden kann. Fur die Abklarung seltener IgG-vermittelter Reaktionen kann man einen modifizierten Coombs-Test versuchen.",

    "abstract": "Bei korrekter Durchfuhrung sind Prickund Patch-Haut-Testungen fur den Patienten ungefahrlich und benotigen keinen grosen apparativen Aufwand. Intradermale Testungen konnen dagegen selten mit generalisierten Reaktionen einhergehen. Bei einer Anamnese mit schwerer Reaktion empfiehlt sich deshalb ein serielles Vorgehen mit erst Prick- und/oder Patch-Testungen; die intradermale Testung kann und soll nur im Falle einer ausbleibenden Reaktion zur weiteren Abklarung eingesetzt werden. Neuere Daten zeigen, dass Hauttestungen selbst bei der Abklarung schwerer oder gefahrlicher Hypersensitivitatsreaktionen mit kleinem und gut vertretbarem Risiko durchgefuhrt werden konnen. In nicht irritativen Konzentrationen ist die Spezifitat von Hauttesten bei vielen Medikamenten recht gut (> 85%). Die Testsensitivitat variiert je nach Medikament, Art der Reaktion, zeitlichem Abstand zur Reaktion und Art des Testes. In der Regel ist sie zu klein, um einen starken klinischen Allergieverdacht entkraften zu konnen. Fur die Diagnose einer Medikamentenallergie gibt es keinen verlasslichen goldenen Standard. Eine Reaktion bei einer doppelblinden Provokationstestung spricht fur eine reproduzierbare substanzspezifische Unvertraglichkeit, besagt aber nichts uber den Pathomechanismus und belegt insbesondere nicht eine Allergie. Provokationstestungen konnen bei Soforttypreaktionen hilfreich sein, um einen unnotigen Verzicht auf wichtige Therapie-Optionen zu vermeiden. Bei Spattyp-Reaktionen sind aussagekraftige Provokationstestungen in der Regel schwierig, oder gar nicht durchfuhrbar. Eine Provokationstestung mit dem mutmaslich auslosenden Medikament sollte nur dann durchgefuhrt werden, wenn die Diagnose nicht mit anderen Methoden gestellt werden kann und es sich um ein fur den betroffenen Patienten sehr wichtiges Medikament handelt.",

    "abstract": "Immunological alterations are discussed as potential pathomechanisms for multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) based on the systemic nature of the symptoms, known complex interactions between the immune system and other organ systems, as well as empirical evidence. However, there are theoretical reservations on immunologic mechanisms in MCS and methodological constraints on human trials. Aim of this paper is a critical presentation of immunological concepts of MCS and resulting future research. Clinical manifestations of allergy, pseudoallergy and MC'S are discussed as similar, closely related disorders where environmental exposure causes inflammation. In the case of allergy, foreign proteins bind to IgE on mast cells, which release inflammatory mediators. In pseudoallergy, initiating substances directly induce liberation of inflammatory mediators without involvement of antibodies. For MCS, low molecular weight chemicals may bind to chemoreceptors on sensory nerve fibers to release inflammatory mediators. Some proponents of these theories hold that this variable pattern can be attributed to various factors, including total body burden, adaptation and biochemical individuality. Both allergic and chemical irritant responses may be subjected to conditioning, so that the response may be triggered by other stimuli. However, the lack of consistency in response patterns both between and within individual MCS patients limits the plausibility of this hypothesis. Therefore, no consistent pattern of immune dysfunction can be identified in MCS patients. It is recommended that clinical evaluation never be based on results of isolated in vitro assessment of quantity and function of immune system cellular components without considering all variables which apply to all different assays and without knowing the patient's complete history and physical examination.",

    "abstract": "Current European coinage is dominated by cupro-nickel coins that have a nickel release up to 100× greater than the 0.5 μg/cm 2 /week limit for objects in direct and prolonged contact with the skin according to the EU Nickel Directive. When the composition of the new generation of coins for the European Union was evaluated, the chance was open to eliminate nickel, being the most prevalent contact allergen in the western world, from coins. A long-lasting request, that, according to the Nickel Directive for products intended to come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin, was overdue for cashiers and bank clerks, to avoid nickel-related occupational skin disease; a common problem. Low- or no-nickel-release coins using nordic gold instead were suggested, to prevent sensitization to nickel, and exacerbation of allergic contact dermatitis in nickel-allergic subjects. But a different decision was made, and economical interests beat consumers and workers interests. Not so much -hopefully - because of ignorance, but due to misinterpreation of scientific data: the Danish expert group concluded that no evidence exists to suggest that exposure to current coinage has been associated with induction of allergic contact dermatitis - but elicitation in sensitized people is both harmful and common.",

In this review, we present basic data with regard to origin and nature of these cells.

Furthermore, new findings regarding molecular events during the production of immunoglobulins of the classes IgE und lgG4 will be presented, specifically the antibody class switch and factors modulating IgE production. Since immunotherapy with specific allergens represents currently the only causal treatment of type I allergic diseases, recent data regarding changes of immunological parameters during this therapy will be discussed critically, including our own findings regarding B-cells. Finally, our data showing inhibitory effects by very low concentrations of vitamin A on B-cells during the initiation of IgE synthesis will be presented. Clinical trials are needed to show whether these molecules are also relevant in a therapeutic setting. Taken together, the findings discussed here will hopefully improve the understanding of B-cell function and provide insights that might lead to innovative new means to modulate IgE-dependent diseases.",

Consuming of raw shiitake causes toxicodermia. Along with this disease papules develop. The polysaccharide lentina probably is the responsible toxin. Within seven months, we found three patients developing skin lesions after eating this mushroom. A 45 years old patient who often prepared and consumed meals containing shiitake, showed recurrent erythematous papules on his face. A prick to prick test with a shiitake mushroom showed an immediate converting into a delayed reaction. Two other patients developed skin eruptions after eating raw shiitake. One of them had eaten fried shiitake before without any problems. Prick to prick tests with Shiitake turned out to be negative in both cases. At the side of testing, 24 hrs later a delayed reaction with severely itching papules developed. The first case is supposed to be an allergic reaction whether the two other cases may rather be a toxicodermia, because of their history and clinical symptoms. However, the positive skin tests in these two cases would suggest other possible mechanisms. Further studies are necessary to clarify theses different phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of allergen-specific IgE represents the most useful diagnostic in-vitro test in food allergy, usually being performed after case history and skin test. Hundreds of single allergens and combinations are offeredby a number of manufacturers. Different allergens, detection and calibration methods lead to a lack of comparibility of test results, which can also differ substantially from case history, skin test and food challenge results. Cellular laboratory tests should be used for food allergy testing only in individual cases or scientific studies. Food allergens: Food proteins of higher stability (predominantly relevant in early infancy) do rarely cause problems in terms of IgE-testing. At present, use of defined proteins for routine diagnosis of allergen-specific IgE has no advantage compared to whole food allergens. Resulting from sensitizations to pollen allergens or natural rubber latex, IgE will be found to cross reactive, mostly labile allergens from various fruit, vegetable or plant species, being clinically relevant only in case of corresponding symptoms. This supports the recommendation of selected in-vitro testing, focussing on suspected foods. Indication for IgE-testing: Reasonable probability of food allergy, but no clear-cut evidence after case history and skin test; sensitization to foods not suitable for skin testing; severe reactions to foods; skin test or its interpretation not possible. Interpretation of in-vitro results: False positive or negative results due to inappropriate reagents or laboratory errors; clinically irrelevant results by strongly elevated total serum IgE, low cut-off levels or cross reactive allergens. Not suitable for diagnosis of food allergy: Allergen-specific IgG, cytotoxic food test, electroacupuncture, bioresonance. Unsolved problems: Optimized quality ofreagents; calibration and comparability of results from different methods; serological cross reactivity. Future studies adressing clinical relevance of in-vitro results will help to improve diagnosis and interpretation of food allergy.",

Even the ingestion of small amounts of cheese and butter produced the same symptoms. Serologic testing showed a sensitization to casein (CAP class 5, 68.2 kU/L). Prick testing showed a strongly positive reaction to cow's milk and cheese. Prick-to-prick testing with feta cheese was negative so an oral challenge test with feta cheese was done, started with 5 g. 15 minutes after ingestion he presented a conjunctivitis and a running nose, followed by edema and a severe asthma attack. The following examination showed highly elevated specific IgE to casein, especially to the fraction of α 1 -casein to cow's, sheep's and goat's milk. The patient was told to follow a milk-free diet. In case of an accidental ingestion of milk the patient was given emergency medicaments (antihistamines, steroids and adrenaline for subcutaneous injection). Cross reactions can explain allergic reactions to other milk species, so goat's, sheep's and horse's milk is definitely no generalized alternative. In any case testing and if uncertainties remain, double blind oral food challenge is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Elevated availability of moisture on indoor surfaces often results in microbial growth on construction materials and furniture. Because of this it is possible that dangers may arise from unusual air exposure with mould spores. Depending on individual disposition, this can result in health hazards. This article describes advantages and disadvantages of applicable mould detection methods and which conclusions can be drawn therefrom. The methods described in this article include techniques for quantifying and qulifying mould in indoor air, materials and on surfaces. Cultivating and noncultivating methods are described. Regarding methods for indoor air sampling, the Andersen principle impaction, Reuters centrifugal sampler and the filtration method are dealt with. Furthermore, particle deposition on sticky surfaces using slit samplers and measuring of microbial volatile organic compound are covered as well. Furthermore, mould detection methods in material and on surfaces are described. These use contact plates, the immersion method, smear tests, dust sampling and mould spore collection with sticky tapes. The choice of measurement methods is of importance in order to draw the right conclusions from the results and to decrease overall cost. Experience has shown that applying a single method only usually does not yield reliable results. The choice of measurement procedures, therefore, is of high importance and depends on the question to be answered as well as on local circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening systemic reaction that can affect all ages. Anaphylaxis may be caused by a variety of triggers, among them drugs, insect venoms, foods. The clinical symptoms may peracutely involve multiple target organs including the skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system. Each age group may be concerned. As anaphylaxis is potentially life-threatening, the essential underlying mechanisms, the effects of biologically higly active chemical mediators released from mast cells or basophils must be blocked or reversed as early as possible. Treatment guidelines focus on interruption of early pathophysiologic mechanisms. Adrenaline is the drug of choice and plays a pivotal role in treatment - for self-administration by patients or voluntary helpers - as well as treatment by physicians. For rapid delivery intramuscular injection is essential. Subcutaneous injections lead to a delay of adrenaline delivery, thus, can be harmful. Obesity is on a distinct rise in industrialized countries and epidemiology displays, so is allergy. The scope of our study was to measure the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissue in 76 randomly selected adults by ultrasound at the recommended sites for adrenaline (auto)injection. Two brands for autoinjection-pens (Epipen (Alk-abello) and Anapen (Fa. Beckmann)) are available on the market in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Their needle length is 1.4 and 1.2 mm, respectively. We observed that despite a correct injection with the autoinjector pen a intramuscular injection may not be expected in 22 -30% of patients. We recommend to reconsider injection sites in obese adults and to adapt needle length in autoinjector pens accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) rank among the drugs most frequently prescribed worldwide. NSAID are commonly used to treat pain, fever or inflammatory processes. In case of a NSAID or prostaglandin synthetase inhibition (PGSI) intolerance, which is characterized by skin and/or respiratory tract symptoms, or even anaphylactic shock, two different forms can be distinguished: exacerbation of an underlying disease such as chronic urticaria or persistent asthma (new term: aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease), and acute episodes of urticaria or bronchospasm in subjects without any preexisting conditions. Pathogenetically it is a non-immune mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Because it resembles true allergies it is referred to as pseudoallergy. True allergies are very rare, and may occur with pyrazolones and diclofenac. It is postulated, that pseudoallergic reactions are based on the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase with consecutively enhanced production of leukotriens, which cause vaso- and bronchoconstriction as well as an increase of permeability and edema. Diagnosis of NSAID/PGSI intolerance generally is based on the history and provocation or challenge In case of a convincing history of a NSAID/PGSI intolerance, or proven by a provocation test, prescription or re-intake of this category of drugs should be omitted strictly. The subject concemed should be informed on all the drugs to avoid and which other drugs may have the potential to evoke the same clinics due to cross-reactive mechanisms. He also needs to know appropriate alternative medications to treat pain and/or inflammatory situations which necessitate tolerance tests. Aspirin desactivation may be a therapeutic option in therapy refractory rhinosinusitis, recurrent nasal polyposis or therapy resistant asthma in NSAID/PGSI intolerance. On the contrary, an effect in case of a NSAID/PGSI induced anaphylaxis or urticaria/angioedema has not been shown. If a continuous treatment with leukotrien antagonists has a protective effect, has not been studied so far.",

From the initial form of specific immunotherapy more than a hundred years have past and several research findings of that time are today still relevant to the current situation. In 1922 experiments with pollen tablets were carried out and then in the 1930's pollen extract was used in the form of drops. Since the beginning of its existence the German Allergy and Asthma Association (DAAB) has carried out patient surveys in order to accumulate more information from the patient's point of view concerning the allergic condition pattern. In the past the patients found the amount of time needed for treatment by specific immunotherapy especially tiresome. This year a scheme has been started for better therapy adherence and a survey will then make more information possible about the positive and the negative facts from the patient's point of view.",

    "abstract": "Originally the specific immunotherapy has been inaugurated by Noon and Freeman supposing that allergens are toxic and this therapy could establish an immunity. After the identification of IgE-antibodies as one important component of the allergic reaction the SIT aimed at the suppression of this antibody type. Indeed it could be shown that this can be achieved - however only after months and years - long after the onset of clinical effects. In recent time the interest therefore is concentrated on effects of T-cells. Beside the important Th2-type there are the so-called regulatory T-cells (Treg) which under certain conditions can induce a Th2→Th1-shift but can inhibit several other effector mechanisms of the allergic reaction, too. One way is the application of rather high doses of allergen - which can be limited by side effects. As the activation of T-cells and IgE-bound effector cells occur via different epitopes this paved the way for modification of allergens by elimination of IgE-binding epitopes by chemical or genetic means. Another possibility is the combination with adjuvants promoting the desired activation of Tregs resp. the Th2→Th1-shift. Finally alternative ways of allergen application can reduce side effects (e.g. sublingual application). The underlying immunologic mechanisms of SIT more and more become clear. Nevertheless very import questions remain without answers, e.g. which are the mechanisms of activation of T-cells in detail and how can they be used for improvement of SIT? Which individual factors are important and can such an optimization be achieved by pharmaceutical production, too? What are the factors responsible for the efficacy of SIT over long time (life span of Treg, persistence of allergen), and finally: which immunological factors can modulate the natural history of allergic diseases?",

Es soll aber kurz erwahnt werden, dass Schimmelpilze als Indoor-Allergene im Allgemeinen uberschatzt werden. Patienten, die z.

T. sehr ahnliche Lebensbedingungen bezuglich Temperaturoptimum und relative Luftfeuchte benotigen. Die Betroffenen sehen und riechen den Schimmelbefalll in den Raumen, die Hausstaubmilbe sehen sie nicht und an das Haustier denken sie nicht . Problematisch ist die Schimmelpilzbelastung aber dennoch. Schimmelpilze setzen Mycotoxine und fluchtige organische Verbindungen frei die das Schleimhautsystem der Atemwege und die Haut unspezifisch reizen konnen. Das Ergebnis sind dann ohne weiteres auch Reizhusten, Niesreiz, Nasenblockade und Konjunktivitis. Bei Messungen in Innenraumen werden uberwiegend die Gattungen Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus und Penicillium nachgewiesen.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of review: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common health problem with impact on general health and significant medical costs. To date, no pan-European epidemiological study has been undertaken and prevalence data for Europe were unavailable. GA(2)LEN network of excellence has developed a questionnaire, the GA(2)LEN survey to assess the presence of CRS and its association with asthma in epidemiological studies using the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and nasal Polyps (EP3OS) diagnostic criteria. Recently, first data were published and the results are summarized in this review. Recent findings: Information was obtained from 57,128 responders living in 19 centers of 12 countries. The overall prevalence of CRS by EP3OS criteria was 10.9%. CRS was more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. The prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed CRS within centers was highly correlated with the prevalence of EP3OS-diagnosed CRS. Symptom-based CRS was significantly associated with positive endoscopy in non-allergic subjects, and with self-reported doctor-diagnosed CRS in all subjects. In all centers, there was a strong association of asthma with CRS at all ages. The association with asthma was stronger in those reporting both CRS and allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Using the GA(2)LEN survey, a mean prevalence of 10% with a considerable geographical variation in adults in Europe could be demonstrated. Smoking was associated with having CRS in all parts of Europe. Symptom-based definition of CRS, according to the epidemiological part of the EP3OS criteria, was suitable for the assessment of geographic variation in prevalence of CRS. The strong and independent associations between asthma and both allergic rhinitis and CRS are important for better understanding of these conditions and their interdependence and may lead to better management in the future.",

    "abstract": "Adjuvants were first utilized in 1938 in solutions for specific immunotherapy (SIT). The use of adjuvants reduces allergenicity and therefore the risks of side effects and anaphylaxis. SIT has been limited by the long course and numerous injections required to achieve the efficacy and safty desired. To come up to these high demands the physical coupling between the allergen and aluminium hydroxid, tyrosin or calcium phosphate are tried but also chemical modification respectively. New adjuvants and trials e.g. mycobacterial antigens, Vitamin D3, CpG motifs, lipopolysaccharides which activates so-called toll-like receptors, parasites and molecules from parasites are under discussion. They are not only focussed on the modulation of the adaptive immune system but also of the influencing of the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "Background and objective: The present work reviews the nutritional options during the first year of life that may affect the development of atopic diseases. The main preventive measures are introduced and their role in allergy prevention is evaluated. Method: Based on previously defined criteria, a total of 18 prospective studies on primary alimentary prevention is included in the review. Their results are summarized and discussed. Results: Apart from partially controversial results, current data supports the protective effect of breastfeeding for at least 4 months. If breastfeeding is insufficient, the use of hydrolyzed formula is recommended. For both measures, preventive effects can particularly be obtained in case of atopic eczema, wheezing, and asthma in early childhood. Apart from that, there is no evidence for any beneficial effect of delayed introduction of solid food after the sixth month of age. Complementary food should be introduced one at a time to detect reactions to specific food components. Discussion: The controversial data results from serious methodological differences. Thus, a direct comparison of the studies results seems not feasible. Even though there is strong evidence that allergy prevention can benefit from exclusive breastfeeding and the use of hydrolyzed formula, the optimal timing for the introduction of complementary foods yet has to be studied in a comprehensive manner. On the basis of available data, detailed recommendations for infant feeding after the sixth month of age cannot be formulated. Moreover, the deficiency of risk cohorts and the fact that available data are almost exclusively from observational studies restrict the studies validity concerning the allergy prevention in children with a genetic predisposition for atopic diseases. Conclusion: Further research on primary alimentary prevention of atopic diseases in children at risk needs to be conducted.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: In epidemiological studies an effect modification occurs if a statistical association between an exposure and an outcome differs depending on the levels of a third variable, which is not a deficiency of the study. However, if an effect modification is not accounted for in the statistical analysis of data, this can lead to wrong conclusions and delusive interpretations of the results. Regarding the occurrence of allergic diseases in children, socio-economic status and familial predisposition are often discussed as potential effect modifiers. Methods: Using the data of a birth cohort study we demonstrate the role of familial predisposition as an effect modifier when analyzing the relationship between pet keeping as well as breastfeeding and the occurrence of allergic diseases in two years old children. A few days after delivery 3,132 mothers of German nationality were asked about education, keeping of domestic animals and family history of allergic diseases. Within the first two years of their children's life more than half of these mothers were interviewed for three more times. Important parts of these follow-up interviews were concerned with the mothers' breastfeeding behaviour as well as with symptoms of allergic diseases of the children. Results: Using stratified logistic regression models it could be shown that children living together with a dog in the same household were at higher risk of disease only if a familial predisposition of allergic diseases was present - without such a familial predisposition a dog in the same household seems to reduce the risk for atopic diseases during the first 2 years of life. A protective effect due to long breastfeeding could be observed in our study in particular in case of a paternal history of allergic diseases, whereas an exclusive maternal history of allergic diseases seems to increase the risk. Conclusion: The results of our analyses show that the influence of pet keeping and breastfeeding on the development of allergic diseases in children should only be assessed by simultaneously accounting for different patterns of family history of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tea is considered a healthy and harmless beverage. However, adverse reactions to several tea species, like chamomile or green tea, have been reported. Case report: We report a 55-year-old woman, who developed palmar and plantar itching, dyspnea, angioedema and dysphagia 10 min after drinking a tea prepared from a TCM granulate. Methods: Skin prick tests with common inhalant allergens, as well as with the tea and its individual components were performed. Total IgE, specific IgE and tryptase were measured. In addition, immunoblotting and CAP inhibition tests were done. Results: Skin prick tests showed moderately positive reactions to various storage mites and a strongly positive reaction to the TCM tea. Subsequent testing with all individual tea components was negative. Specific IgE to storage mites, mugwort and ragweed pollen was negative. Total IgE and tryptase were within normal limits. The immunoblot showed positive reactions to proteins between 15 and > 100 kDa in the TCM tea, but was negative to extracts from Tyrophagus, Lepidoglyphus, Acarus and Blomia, excluding contamination of the granulate with storage mite antigens. A recheck of the patients history revealed a former allergy to silk diagnosed 20 years ago. Subsequent assessment of specific IgE to wild silk by CAP was positive (5.1 kU/l). In a CAP inhibition assay, IgE binding to wild silk was inhibited by the TCM tea by 87%. Conclusion: In the present case, the anaphylactic reaction resulted from the presence of silk allergens in the TCM tea granulate, presumably due to infection of one of its raw materials by insect pests like Plodia interpunctella, Ephestia kuehniella or other related moth species and subsequent contamination of the plant material by silk proteins from pupal cocoons.",

    "abstract": "The development of guidelines is a complex process in which verified findings as well as different points of view and interests must be amalgamated into practical consent. Contact dermatitis is a very common disease that in most cases is not treated by dermatologists. Therefore a guideline for contact dermatitis must offer orientation for physicians of different specialities. For this reason the contact dermatitis guideline covers not only diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of contact dermatitis but also refers to essentials of epidemiology and pathophysiology of the disease in order to allow a better understanding. Such knowledge facilitates appropriate decisions in individual cases. The avoidance of strict algorithms emphasises the advisory function of this guideline. It was developed on S1-level by independent authors related to various working groups and it is endorsed by the German Dermatologic Society.",

    "abstract": "Drug allergies represent nowadays the big imitators of diseases. One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Skin tests and specific immunotherapy (SIT) are regular activites in allergy practice. Despite the high quality of the products utilized, a constant threat for triggering anaphylactic reactions remains. About 50% of anaphylactic reactions with fatal outcome are thought to be iatrogenic. Analysis of generalized allergic reactions associated with skin tests or SIT revealed several risk factors. Among the most important factors are allergic asthma, patients on β-blockers, seasonal exacerbation of symptoms, exquisit sensitivity to particular allergens, rush SIT, and treatment errors both with regard to organization (skin tests) as well as dosing or application (SIT). Careful patient assessment is therefore mandatory to adequately evaluate the risk for diagnostic or therapeutic measures in any given patient. Moreover, the actual physical condition of the patient at the time of performing that measure needs to be checked, since interfering infections, immunizations or physical exercise might make it necessary to postpone the treatment planned. Still, the risk for iatrogenic anaphylactic reactions can only be minimized, not omitted, and should never be neglected. Thus, the ability to provide initial emergency treatment both with regard to available resources as well as personal skills is a prerequisit to practise allergology.",

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous specific immunotherapy is the most important form of therapy for IgE-mediated diseases. However, a danger for local or systemic side effects is present for all allergens used. The mostly harmless local reactions are classified by size. Systemic reactions are classified according to their severity, ranging from e.g. urticaria and flush to severe reactions (bronchospasms, pre-shock, shock) to the point of vital organ failure. While mild systemic reactions occurred in all treatment groups, pronounced systemic reactions were mainly seen in patients with an allergy against bee venom or house dust mite; life-threatening reactions occurred almost exclusively in patients with bee venom allergy. Due to the increased risk of patients with a history of bronchial asthma, a non-specific bronchial provocation test should be carried out in these cases in order to determine the bronchial reactivity and to increase safety. Insufficient anamnestic investigation before each injection is mainly considered to be the reason for the occurrence of side effects despite an adequate indication. Further clinical studies have to be carried out in order to evaluate if a sublingual treatment is equally effective and can improve the safety of specific immunotherapy and thus reduce the risk of severe side effects.",

    "abstract": "Asthma in humans is a complex disorder characterized by reversible airway bronchoconstriction, hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodeling of the airways. The pattern of allergic inheritance is that of complex polygenic disorder. The mapping of the genome has led to the identification of 20 different loci including a particularly interesting locus situated on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31-33). This locus contains the T helper type 2 (T H 2) cytokine gene cluster as well as the gene encoding IL-12p40. In the literature there have been several studies reporting successful treatment of allergic asthma in animal models by repressing the T H 2 type cytokines using local delivery of antibodies against cytokines or their receptors.On the other hand, local administration of T H 1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-y depleted lung eosinophils and reduced AHR. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that mice deficient for the transcription factor T-bet, either heterozygous or homozygous (T-bet -/-), display, in absence of allergen challenge, a T-cell dependent AHR to methacholine challenge, increased airway inflammation and airway remodeling consistent with human asthma. It thus appear that the mucosal balance between GATA3 and T-bet strongly determines the T cell fate of the mucosal surfaces and that the regulation of this balance is a key factor in understanding T cell-mediated mucosal immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Insect venom allergy belongs to the classical IgE-mediated diseases and is in Germany mostly mediated by compounds of the venoms of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and wasp species (Vespula germanica / Vespula vulgaris). Potentially, insect venom allergy manifests in severe and lethal reactions. The prevalence of insect venom allergy depends on the exposure. More than half of the general population receives at least one hymenoptera sting in their life. Corresponding estimates reach from 57% for Italy to 95% for Turkey. There are few population-based studies, which measured the prevalence of sensitisation mostly by the detection of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. According to international investigations 9% - 18% of the adult population are sensitized. In a study of 258 subjects in rural Bavaria 27% exhibited IgE antibodies and similar the prevalence in 821 inhabitants of the City of Hamburg was 25%. The reports on systemic reactions after insect stings range between 0.3% and 3.3%. The latter resulted from the Bavarian study and in Hamburg the corresponding figure was 1.8%. The international comparison reveals a North-South gradient and males and elderly are affected more frequently. Lately an underlying mastocytosis (including occult forms) i.e. elevated tryptase levels were identified as relevant risk factors for severe reactions. Patients with elevated tryptase levels showed more often severe reactions than those without elevated levels (75% vs. 28%). Internationally the mortality is estimated in a range between 0.03 (Italy) and 0.48 (France) per 1.000.000 inhabitants and year. Age (> 40 years), sex (male), comorbidities, sting location (head, neck), and type of insect (bee?) were identified as relevant risk factors. The German statistical board documents fatalities after stings from bees, wasps or hornets under the ICD (10) code X23. Between 1990 and 2006 a total of 335 or 20 cases per year were reported. The corresponding average mortality rate was 0.24/1.000.000/year, whereby men were affected more frequently (68.4%). Within the German federal states the mortality rate increases substantially from West to East. The real population-based prevalence of insect venom allergy and the corresponding mortality rate are not know precisely; a large underestimation can be assumed. Adequate (prospective) studies must be conducted in order to achieve reliable data.",

    "abstract": "Serological tests for immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG 4 ) against foods are persistently promoted for the diagnosis of food-induced hypersensitivity. Since many patients believe that their symptoms are related to food ingestion without diagnostic confirmation of a causal relationship, tests for food-specific IgG 4 represent a growing market. Testing for blood IgG 4 against different foods is performed with large-scale screening for hundreds of food items by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type and radioallergosorbent-type assays in young children, adolescents and adults. However, many serum samples show positive IgG 4 results without corresponding clinical symptoms. These findings, combined with the lack of convincing evidence for histamine-releasing properties of IgG 4 in humans, and lack of any controlled studies on the diagnostic value of Ig G 4 testing in food allergy, do not provide any basis for the hypothesis that food-specific IgG 4 should be attributed with an effector role in food hypersensitivity. In contrast to the disputed beliefs, IgG 4 against foods indicates that the organism has been repeatedly exposed to food components, recognized as foreign proteins by the immune system. Its presence should not be considered as a factor which induces hypersensitivity, but rather as an indicator for immunological tolerance, linked to the activity of regulatory T cells. In conclusion, food-specific IgG 4 does not indicate (imminent) food allergy or intolerance, but rather a physiological response of the immune system after exposure to food components. Therefore, testing of Ig G 4 to foods is considered as irrelevant for the laboratory work-up of food allergy or intolerance and should not be performed in case of food-related complaints.",

    "abstract": "After the implementation of DRGs, it seemed necessary to review the standardized diagnostic procedures with respect to effectiveness in identifying causes for chronic urticaria in order to reduce contents in a medically and economically meaningful manner. The test findings of 567 patients with chronic urticaria or angioedema hospitalized from 1989 - 2000 in the Department of Dermatology in Niimberg were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnostic procedures consisted of anamnesis, search for focal infections, allergy tests and provocation tests of intolerance reactions. The main emphasis of the study was placed on the intolerance test to ASA. By potato-rice diet - carried out as prerequisite for provocation tests - symptoms ceased in 37.1% of patients and an improvement of symptoms was shown in 10.1%. During intolerance tests, 27.0% of the provoked patients reacted to ASA. The remaining intolerance substances indometacin, paracetamol, food additives and natural salicylates rarely produced an intolerance reaction. Also, administering additive and natural salicylates enriched food provoked only a few intolerance reactions. Rational diagnostic procedures of the chronic urticaria consist of several steps. During the provocation test the potato-rice diet should be carried on because many patients expressed a total elimination of signs after a short time. The provocation test with ASA should be retained because of numerous positive reactions. However, the provocation test with food additives and salicylates and the provocation food do not represent a compelling component in routine diagnostics of chronic urticaria any longer. By uncovering intolerance reaction the causative factors of urticaria is found in a few cases. Therefore, the search for focal infections and autoimmune disorders should always be conducted because chronic urticaria can represent a multifactorial occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Dogs can be regarded as an important source of allergens, not only in private, but also in public environments. Several studies revealed the importance of dog allergens in the development of allergic airway diseases which affect not only dog holders, also indirect contact with dogs can cause symptoms. Specific strategies of primary prevention have not yet proven to be effective. Basically, an early diagnostic of a dog allergy seems to be essential in order to initiate specific prevention strategies. Yet, diagnosing dog-related allergies may present problems: in diagnostic tests with commercial dog allergens, some patients showed only slightly positive or negative results, even though they suffered from clearly dog-related symptoms. The results of immunological investigations indicate that a hypo- or hyperallergenic dog breed does not exist. Factors related to individual dogs seem to influence the allergenicity more than breed or gender. The main focus in therapy, therefore, lays on strategies of secondary prevention, in particular a combination of various strategies of allergen avoidance and cleansing. Currently, the best way to treat dog-related allergy is to combine environmental control and medication.",

The correct diagnosis is important since a causal therapy is possible by stopping the administration. A stringent correlation between dose/time of administration and the type of the reaction exists for only a few drugs. Possible hints for an increased risk to develop a drug reaction are known reactions to that specific drug, the patient's history, the type of the underlying disease, genetic poly-morphisms, occupational factors and interactions with other drugs. Still however, the tracing of a certain drug as cause of a pulmonary reaction can be difficult in the individual case and may require great efforts rarely even a biopsy. The pathologist then has to describe the patterns of reactions, exclude other causes and correlate his findings with the clinical data. In most cases however the diagnosis of a drug reaction will be by exclusion. A list of typical drug reactions is included.",

    "abstract": "In 2003 the German health financing system for inpatients was converted from a time-related system to a system of diagnosis-related groups. This constituted a fundamental change in hospital finance management. Since 2004, the catalogue of diagnosis-related groups has been revised on an annual basis. The underlying calculations are based on data sets from all participating hospitals. However, these calculations do not directly base on evidence-based medical data. The current financial situation for hospitals in Germany is greatly influenced by external factors such as rises in value-added tax, wage agreements, and increased energy costs. Cost unit calculations are rarely compiled in German clinics, and most benchmark analyses are based on estimated cost data. As an illuminating example for allergology-related afflictions we present the cost analysis for immunotherapy using hymenoptera venom, drug provocation tests and chronic urticaria. This is compared to dermatological cases such as atopic eczema and erysipela. The daily cost of coverage was calculated. For the cases presented, a comparison of these costs over recent years shows a substantial decline. This development is not only a phenomenon in clinical treatment ofallergological diseases but is also seen in dermatological inpatient treatment. Thus, a course for consequent optimization and rationalization is required. Therefore, a critical appraisal of economic factors, together with medical expertise in daily clinical routine, has to be considered. Furthermore, the health financing system must be consistently oriented around evidence-based medical criteria. These are conditions that must be met in order for funding and costs of good clinical practice to break even.",

Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy of SLIT with mixed extracts in polysensitized patients of an out-patient clinic and to evaluate the relative clinical efficacy in relation to systemic side effects. Methods: A 3 -year prospective open study including 79 polysensitized patients, mean age 33, range 7 - 62,49% male, 51% female, with SARC receiving sublingual-swallow immunotherapy with mixed pollen extracts. During the pollen season patients recorded symptoms (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma and their need for medication (oral antihistaminic, antihistaminic eye drops and nasal spray or corticosteroid nasal spray or inhaled antiasthmatic drugs (β-agonists and/or inhaled corticosteroids)). If rhinoconjunctivitis was uncontrolled, prednisone tablets were allowed. Clinical efficacy was evaluated separately for clinical symptoms (symptom scores) and for use of rescue drugs (medication scores). Improvement of rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma is described by the changes in the individual frequency of symptoms (in 4 stages ranging from than per week to times daily) and in the severity of symptoms (in 5 stages ranging from none to very severe). The frequency of symptoms was classified both at the start of the titration period and the end of the observation phase of the maintenance period into less than per week, several per week, once per day, or several per day. To avoid problems with data not being normally distributed, nonparametric statistics were used on an explorative basis. Demographic data were analyzed by Χ 2 test or Fishers exact test. Within group comparison Wilcoxon tests were applied for the primary outcome parameter, i.e. clinical efficacy and Mann-Whitney for side effects, p values - 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Clinical efficacy was estimated in 79 patients completing 3 years of treatment by subtracting baseline data and by calculating the ratio third treatment year vs. baseline. The monthly dose of 1,200 IR for 1 allergen extract mixture was 150 times higher than the subcutaneous dose administered typically in the same time period. The total cumulative dose varied between 43,200 IR (1 allergen) and 10,800 IR (4 allergen mixtures) for the 3-year treatment period. SLIT diminished the median disease severity of rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma at the start to 1/2 of baseline after 3 years and and marked improve the intraindividual frequency of the three main symptoms. Symptom and medication scores showed statistically significant and clinically relevant effectiveness. SLIT treatment only resulted in local mild side-effects. Conclusion: SLIT with mixed extracts is clinically effective in polysensitized patients with SARC.",

This is performed by the mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance, the latter especially providing for nonreactivity towards innocuous antigens derived from environment. In conditions of allergy, such as allergic contact dermatitis, tolerance is broken. During the last years, insight into the mechanisms relevant for effector functions in allergic reactions as well as cell types and mechanisms involved in keeping tolerance has substantially grown. In this review, the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) is discussed in the context of allergic contact dermatitis, oral tolerance, UV-induced tolerance and low-zone tolerance to allergens. Insight into different means of tolerance induction dependent on the place and characteristic of antigen delivery might contribute to the development of effective strategies for therapeutic treatment of allergic conditions.",

Results: The prevalence of wheeze in 6- to 7-year-old children ranged in from 4.1 - 32.1% in 1994/1995. The frequency of hay fever varied from 0.8 -14.9%, and that of flexural eczema from 1.1 -18.4%. The prevalence of wheeze in 13- to 14-year-old children ranged from 2.1 -32.2%. According to the results of Phase II the fraction of wheeze attributable to atopic sensitisation and the gross national income were strongly correlated (p = 0.74, p < 0.001). Overall, there was a heterogeneous pattern regarding increase and decrease of disease prevalence assessed in Phase Three in 2002/2003. In Munster (Germany) an increase in prevalence rates of all 3 diseases of up to 0.7% points per year could be observed. In a follow-up of the German Phase II children in the age of 16 - 18 years the incidence of wheeze was 13%, of hay fever 27%, and of flexural eczema 6%. Conclusion: The prevalence of asthma, atopic asthma and allergic diseases varied strongly worldwide. Despite a heterogeneous pattern an increase of disease was more often recorded. Even in adolescent a relevant incidence rate of wheeze must be assumed.",

    "abstract": "Damage to the epidermal barrier is the most important mechanism causing irritant contact eczema. In many cases, this process is accelerated by a predisposition. Contact sensitizers induce allergic contact dermatitis following specific sensitization of the immune system. Employees in construction industries, processing of resins and plastic material and metal workers as well as hairdressers and dental technicians, are at a higher risk to develop occupational contact sensitization. Rubber and fragrance allergens are important sensitizers in numerous occupations. Substantial progress has been made in the secondary and tertiary prevention of occupational skin diseases. Concepts and quality standards were developed and established proving for the high level of quality management in clinical dermatology. Future scientific work on the pathophysiology of contact eczema should not only uncover further molecular details but has to contribute to the development of new therapies in this field. This includes new strategies for a better control of atopic dermatitis as well as protocols for tolerance induction to contact sensitizers in man.",

In contrast, in IgG subclass deficiencies more than 1 IgG subgroups are lowered. In this study we investigated whether diagnosis of CVID or IgG subclass deficiency could be deduced based on clinical manifestation and whether the extent of IgG immunoglobulin diminution could give hints for the clinics. Methods: In this retrospective study all clinical and laboratory findings of 116 patients, who have been examined during a 10-year period (1995 -2004) at our outpatient clinic for allergy and clinical immunology because of suspicion of an immunodeficiency, have been collected. Results: 23 out of 116 (14.6%) patients were diagnosed as having a probable CVID and 11 (7.0%) a possible CVID. 82 (51.9%) patients had an IgG subclass deficiency. The most prevalent clinical manifestation were recurrent or prolonged upper respiratory infections in 91 (78.5%) patients. 73 (62.9%) of them suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis. Prolonged bronchitis and pneumonias were disclosed in 49 (42.2%) and 45 (38.8%), respectively. Granulomatous disorders were found in 4 (3.5%) and neoplasia in 3 subjects (2.6%). Patients with a probable CVID had significantly more (p = 0.03) upper respiratory infections than those with a possible CVID or IgG subclass deficiency. In contrast, subjects with an IgG subclass deficiency had more frequently a respiratory allergy than those with a CVID. Conclusion: This investigation showed that with marked IgG deficiency persisting and repeating infections, as well as their complications, like bronchiectasia, were the determinating characteristics. On the other hand, clinical manifestations were not characteristic in mild or moderate IgG deficiency. A CVID could not be distinguished from an IgG subclass defect by the clinical manifestation, but by laboratory analysis only. In case of suspicion for immunoglobulin deficiency IgG subclasses should also be determined.",

A total of 40 samples were investigated from different public and private places. Primarily, the fungal spectra of both matrices consisted of the genera Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Wallemia, Acremonium und Fusarium (at least 25% of samples positive, each). Cladosporium species were found to be the most prevalent fungi in hydroponics (14/20 samples positive, 24.2% of fungal CFUs) whereas potting soils were dominated by Penicillium species (19/20 samples positive, 33.4% of fungal CFUs). Aspergillus species came in second in both matrices (13/20 and 11/20 samples positive, 21.3% and 16.5% of fungal CFUs, respectively). We conclude that hydroponics should be considered as a potential source of fungal contaminants when checking for indoor allergic health complaints.

    "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases develop when the physiologic mechanisms fail to maintain self-tolerance. The immune system has developed a number of strategies to prevent autoimmune reactions. During T cell development in the thymus, clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells is the most important mechanism of shaping the T cell repertoire, a process called negative selection. Importantly, T cells with no affinity towards self-peptide MHC also die in a process called positive selection. Thus, developing T cells must at least have some specificity towards self-peptide MHC complexes in the thymus. As a consequence, potentially self-reactive T cells persist after thymic selection and additional regulatory mechanisms in the periphery are necessary to maintain immune tolerance against self. The discovery of regulatory T cell populations, especially of the CD4 + CD25 + Tregs have highlighted the role of active immune suppression for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. The discovery that humans and animals with mutations in the FOXP3 gene, an essential molecule for the development of Tregs, develop multiorgan autoimmunity has highlighted a role of these cells for self-tolerance. It is an attractive concept, that peripheral tolerance is maintained by a delicate balance between potentially autoreactive T cells and regulatory T cells, and recent experimental evidence has been suggested that many autoimmune diseases may develop when this equilibrium fails. Several reasons may be the cause of an inappropriate immune regulation by Tregs. Regulatory T cells may be deficient in number or regulatory function. Alternatively, the cells to be regulated may be resistant towards Tregs or may outnumber Tregs. This article reviews recent findings on the role of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells in autoimmune diseases and discusses their potential role for future cell therapies of autoimmune diseases.",

In patients with concomitant atopic eczema (AE) and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, it is still applied restrainedly. A 44-year-old man working in a sheltered workshop had been suffering from AE since childhood, and seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis experiencing frequent bouts of eczema also during adulthood, which after several years of working were increasingly dominating as severe hand eczema. Various therapies such as medical rehabilitation, various topical therapies and implementation of protective measures on the job reduced the severity of hand eczema, but complete absence of eczema, however, could not be achieved. At the same time, seasonal rhinoconjunctival symptoms severely exacerbated, particularly pronounced during spring as well as during the summer months. By application of a short-time SIT (grasses-rye) with the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (Pollinex Quattro), almost complete absence of symptoms of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis could be achieved during the following summer. Interestingly, the patient had a 1-time eczema response at the injection site after the first application which disappeared after 14 days. During the following months, a distinct improvement of the hand eczema occurred and, to date, the patient is free of eczema lesions except ofxerosis cutis primarily of the hands, occurring mainly during winter. Until now, the patient has remained in his job without any sick leave. In the meantime, SIT with the same adjuvant preparation was also applied against the pollen of trees (birch, hazel, alder). This case report demonstrates that SIT containing the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A is well-tolerated and is able to positively affect the course of eczema in AE patients including severe form of atopic hand eczema.",

A 73-year-old woman had been suffering from coughing and dyspnea for six months. Due to a chronic infection of the bladder she had taken 100 mg of nitrofurantoin daily for one year. Fine endinspiratory crackles on both sides of her lungs could be heard, the lung function showed a restrictive lung disorder and a serious respiratory insufficiency. Transaminases and ANA were increased. On the conventional chest X-ray and the CT-thorax infiltrates on both sides and also small pleural effusions appeared. In a transbronchial lung biopsy a BOOP-reaction was histologically confirmed, the BAL showed 37% lymphocytes. Under treatment with steroids the patient's condition, the respiratory insufficiency, the X-ray findings and the transaminases improved. After administration of steroids for ten months, a complete reconstitution was achieved. Twelve months later, even without steroids, no symptoms occurred. Because of the history and the other findings a hypersensitive pneumonitis in combination with a drug-induced hepatitis is the most likely diagnosis, a drug-induced lupus erythematosus, however, is also possible.",

    "abstract": "IgE-mediated cross-reactivity is frequently observed in clinical practice and results from sharing of IgE-binding B cell epitopes by phylogenetically conserved proteins. Cyclophilin, manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin are clinically tested, cross-reactive pan-allergens. Remarkably, some patients with severe, long-lasting atopic diseases also show cross-reactivity to human homologs of these proteins, indicating that IgE-mediated autoreactivity might play a role in the exacerbation of chronic allergic diseases. The three-dimensional structures of an increasing number of allergens have been solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. These structures cover a wide variety of different folds and combinations therefore, but no common structural feature determining the allergenicity of a protein could be derived so far from structural information. Although crystal structures do not yet answer the question, why some proteins are allergenic and some others are not, they have strongly contributed to our understanding of cross-reactivity at molecular level. Co-crystallization of an allergen with a bound monoclonal antibody Fab fragment and subsequent solution of the X-ray structure of the complex is the only method allowing the complete definition of a B cell epitope. Alternatively cross-reactive B cell epitopes can be predicted fast and reliably by determining shared features of cross-reactive allergens on sequence and structure level. This knowledge will contribute to reduce the number of molecular structures needed for diagnosis and perhaps immunotherapy of allergic diseases based on recombinant allergens and will help to develop safe and patient-tailored vaccination concepts.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown that the inhabitants of indoor environments with moisture damage are subjected to an increased health risk. The ascertained complaints are probably caused by microorganisms which have developed in the affected material. Apart from moulds, which have been sufficiently studied in this context, a large number of bacteria are also found, their exact differentiation is, however, still insufficient due either to the lack or complexity of analytical methods. The bacteria group of actinomycetes today systematically grouped as filamentous, grampositive bacteria within the actinomycetales is of particular interest in this connection, since among them there are pathogens, causative agents of allergic symptoms, as well as many species which can produce secondary metabolites that are irritating or even toxic for humans. The most important allergic disease caused by actinomycetes spores is the allergic alveolitis, which occurs mainly in microbiologically highly polluted working areas. Potent allergens are conidia from Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, Thermoactinomyces sacchari and Saccharomonospora viridis. Further species which cause allergic reactions are Streptomyces album and S. olivaceus. Among the species which can cause infections and live on moist building materials Nocardia are of particular interest. These species can lead to Nocardioses in patients with a weakened immune system. Some species are able to produce metabolites with antibacterial activity. Some metabolites function as enzyme inhibitors or immunomodulators, while others are used in tumor therapy. Besides, some of the metabolites can be useful while others are toxic. Toxins of Steptomyces spp. have already been detected in the air and dust of moist indoor environment. The differentiation of unknown Actinomycetes species often requires a combination of morphological, chemical (e.g. fatty acid analysis) and molecular-biological methods (e.g. DNA analysis). While the numerical registration of Actinomycetes colonies is possible as a matter of routine, the differentiation of species can only be carried out by specialists due to the insufficiency of morphological differences and/or insufficient fatty acid or DNA sequence data banks. Even among those Actinomycetes which are often registered in areas of indoor moisture damage, unknown species have been found. Although our studies are still in the initial stages, it can be seen that the appearance and distribution of Actinomycetes depend on the material, the humidity and the age of damage. On the basis of the results obtained so far, background concentrations of living Actinomycetes in unpolluted indoor environments are generally under 1,000 CFU/g material and under 50 CFU/m 3 air. In those cases where Actinomycetes were found in the air, they often belonged to the spore-producing genera Streptomyces, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis or Pseudonocardia.",

These antibiotics are often used to treat bacterial infection and to prevent endocarditis. Unlike allergic determinants derived from penicillin, the cephalosporin determinants have not been clearly identified yet. The question of a group allergy to β-lactams versus cross reactivity to single or all cephalosporins rises after IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to a β-lactam antibiotic, so further investigations are needed. We present an immediate-type hypersensitivity confirmed by positive in vitro diagnostic and skin tests in an 18-year-old woman who suffered from severe intraoperative anaphylaxis and generalized urticaria and angioedema within few minutes after intravenous administration of cefazolin. For premedication the patient had received amoxicillin before the elective surgery of talocrural join but hypersensitivity to this drug, in addition to latex, could be excluded. Prior to this anaphylaxis, cefazolin was well-tolerated, it was given several times during several heart catheterizations due to congenital atrioventricular septal defect. Allergologic investigations demonstrated additional sensitizations to cefotiam, cefuroxim and cefuroximaxetil, but tolerance to penicillin and amoxicillin in skin tests as well as in the oral challenge test. This case nicely demonstrates the complexity and need of a detailed allergologic work-up in suspected β-lactam hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "We report about a 51-year-old man presented to our outpatient department with infiltrated, oozing and crusting erythema, papulovesicles and tiny scattering eczematous lesions on his buttocks that had begun a few days ago. In the course of treatment he developed similar skin lesions on his thigh and his chest. After a few weeks of treatment he told us that skin lesions started a few days after he had become a new black leather purse and a matching key case. Patch testing revealed strong positive reactions to nickel and to the patients purse and key case (leather inside and outside and the metal label). The dimethylglyxim test showed nickel in the metal label and in other metal components of the purse and the key case. However, no nickel was detected in the leather. After allergen avoidance and transient treatment with local steroids our patient resolved quickly. Due to the severe contact dermatitis in spite of no direct skin contact (the patient wore clothes) the possibility of an additional sensitization to ingredients of the black purse, e.g. leather dyes or tannins that were not included in the commercially available patch test series should be considered.",

    "abstract": "More than 70% of birch pollen-allergic patients develop hypersensitivity reactions to certain foods which are mainly caused by IgE antibodies specific for the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, which crossreact with structurally related proteins in these foods. However, at present, there is no efficient specific immunotherapy available for this form of food allergy. This fact may partly be due to the lack of knowledge on the immune response underlying pollen-associated food allergies. Allergen-specific T lymphocytes play a pivotal role for the induction and maintenance of allergic diseases. Using the birch-fruit-vegetable-hazelnut syndrome as disease model we investigated the role of allergen-specific T cells in the pathophysiology of pollen-associated food allergies and during specific immunotherapy with birch pollen extract. We found that T cells reactive with pollen-related food allergens were activated after consumption of the respective foods and caused IgE-independent late phase reactions. In contrast to the pollen-specific response, the T cell response to pollen-related food allergens was not altered during specific immunotherapy with pollen extracts. The lack of peripheral tolerance induction in food-reactive T lymphocytes might be one explanation for the clinical inefficacy of pollen immunotherapy on pollen-related food allergies.",

    "abstract": "Various inflammatory dermatologic diseases (e.g. psoriasis vulgaris or atopic dermatitis) are to a large degree inherited and several immunologic factors may be involved. Both diseases are T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions of the skin against autoantigens or allergens. Psoriasis is known as Th1-mediated immune responses, whereas the infiltrate of early lesions of atopic dermatitis are dominated by Th2 cells. Antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells may be responsible for the genetically determined disposition to develop one of the above-mentioned diseases (Th1 or Th2) since they critically contribute to the sensitization process. Cytokines (e.g. IL-1) secreted by DC during T cell priming are important for the direction of resulting immune responses in both infectious and allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) analysis has taken an increasing importance in diagnosing allergic asthma and monitoring its treatment. Several studies have shown a good correlation with different parameters of eosinophilic inflammation in atopic asthmatics, whereas the correlation with lung function parameters is rather poor. However, multiple factors influence exhaled nitric oxide concentrations such as viral infection, allergen exposure, air pollution, tobacco smoke exposure or spirometry. Nevertheless, several scenarios could be identified in recent years where exhaled NO might add to the information derived from conventional assessments such as pulmonary function testing. These include monitoring steroid therapy and therapy compliance in allergic asthmatics, and assessing the risk of asthma exacerbation after interruption of steroid therapy. Exhaled NO analysis has also proven helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with asthma-like symptoms. For instance, nasal NO concentration is very low in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. A further possible field of application might become the analysis of infants and toddlers, however, more methodological studies are needed for a standardised and reproducible measurement procedure. Hundreds of papers have been published on exhaled NO. Nonetheless, many questions remain open, especially concerning interindividual variation of NO concentrations and the relevance of exhaled NO analysis for the optimization of long-term asthma therapy.",

    "abstract": "Patients with atopic dermatitis are often influenced by the psychosocial consequences of their disease. Not only the quality of life might be impaired, but also they often feel stigmatized. This feeling of stigmatization might be caused by their primary visible skin symptoms, but also by skin symptoms which are only relevant in personal relationships such as skin lesions in the anogenital area. This can lead to a vicious circle of fear, rejection and following avoidance. The feeling of stigmatization can be discovered with the Questionnaire on Experience with Skin Complaints. Looking at a sample of patients with either atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, the experience of stigmatization and the impairment of the quality of life were not significantly different in both subgroups with comparable sociodemographic characteristics. To minimize the consequences of stigmatization in patients with atopic dermatitis, psychological interventions may be valuable in addition to an equal dermatological treatment. Structured educational programs for the management of atopic dermatitis show positive results. In special cases an individual psychotherapy can be helpful. Therefore, different interventions such as behavioral treatment, psychodynamic therapies and relaxation training are available.",

This report reviews extrinsic allergic alveolitis (bird fanciers lung/bird breeders lung/pigeon breeders lung) and allergic asthma caused by exposure and describes the bird-egg syndrome. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis is mostly caused by budgerigars, nymph parakeets or pigeons. The exposure group are fanciers or breeders (pigeon breeders). Even bed feathers (duck and goose) or indirect contact are possible antigen sources. Allergic asthma caused by birds is rare. Specific IgE antibodies against feathers, droppings and serum of the birds are detectable. The bird-egg syndrome is characterized by primarily respiratory symptoms (rhinitis and asthma) following exposure to birds, and secondarily of allergy symptoms (urticaria, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma) after the ingestion of eggs. In summary, the fanciers lung or breeders lung is the most frequent bird allergy. Allergic asthma is rare but possible. A crossreactivity after inhalative and ingestive antigen exposure is called bird-egg syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells are well-recognized effector cells in Type-I-allergic reactions that contribute to the pathology of many allergic diseases. In addition, mast cells have been shown to induce and modulate inflammatory reactions in the context of autoimmune processes. From a teleologic point of view, the question has to be raised whether there are also beneficial effects of mast cell-induced inflammatory reactions. In the past two decades, mast cells have been identified in a number of interesting studies in the murine system as critical effector cells not only in host defense against bacteria and parasitic infections, but also in many additional protective reactions to other exogenous and endogenous challenges. In contrast to allergic reactions, the proinflammatory response induced by mast cells in these settings helps to control the exogenous threats. As of yet it remains largely unclear whether these observations can be transferred to the human system. For the future, we have to keep in mind that novel and potent mast cell-stabilizing and -inhibitory agents will not only display antiallergic effects but may also cause defects in host defense against infections and in other protective responses driven by mast cells.",

The objective of this clinical study was to show equivalent efficacy and safety ofbeclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) delivered via MAGhaler ® or via CFC-containing pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in children with mild to moderate bronchial asthma. Usability and acceptance of the two devices were also compared. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomised, reference-controlled, 12-week trial in 38 children with mild to moderate asthma receiving BDP (2 x 250 μg/day) delivered via either the MAGhaler ® (N = 19) or the pMDI (N = 19). Equivalence of the devices was assessed on the basis of the ratio (MAG/pMDI) of the mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) measured during therapy. In addition, the two-sided 90% Fieller confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of means was calculated. Lung function parameters, clinical symptoms, concomitant intake of salbutamol or fenoterol, adverse events, and laboratory values were recorded. Results: In the per-protocol analysis (N = 35), the ratio (MAG/ pMDI) of mean FEV 1 during therapy was 1.07 [90% CI (0.93; 1.24)] indicating that the two devices were comparable. Mean FEV 1 increased from 2.00 ± 0.45 1 (baseline) to 2.16 ± 0.53 1 (week 12; MAG) and from 1.88 ± 0.54 1 to 2.01 ± 0.56 1 (pMDI). A total of 28 (80%) children preferred the MAGhaler ® to the pMDI. The safety profile of BDP was similar in both groups. Conclusion: BDP administered via the MAGhaler ® was as safe and efficacious as that delivered via the pMDI. The MAGhaler ® was very well accepted.",

The aim of the present study was to determine mite allergen exposure in German dwellings and to improve the data basis for recommendations concerning measures for allergene reduction. Altogether, 292 dust samples from carpets, mattresses and upholstered furniture from 48 dwellings and 2 hotels were taken using Dustscreen™ tubes connected to a standard vacuum cleaner. Dust samples were analyzed for house dust mite allergens Der fl and Der p1 by sandwich ELISA (Indoor Biotechnologies). Both allergens were detected in all 48 dwellings. On average, Der fl concentrations were higher compared to Der p1. Increased values for Der fl and Der p1 were not correlated. There was an obvious difference in the spatial distribution ofDer fl and Der p1 concerning the carpets in dwellings. While Der p concentrations in living and sleeping rooms were in the same range, Der fl concentrations were significantly reduced for living rooms compared to sleeping rooms. Mattresses contained higher amounts ofboth Der fl and Der p1 than carpets. Additionally, the predominance of Der fl over Der p1 was more pronounced in mattresses than in carpets. These observations indicate a preference of D.farinae for mattresses with a stronger tendency compared to D. pteronyssinus.",

    "abstract": "In Germany, specific immunotherapy of patients with allergy against rye pollens (Secale cereale) is frequently done with different grass pollen extracts. We reassess the practice of applying rye allergens as single extract or in an individual allergen mixture in the context of the availability of a 5-grass tablet vaccine as speciality based on Anthoxanthum odoratum, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, Poa pratensis, Phleum pratense. Phylogenetically, Secale cereale shows a strong similarity to the most frequent grasses in Northern and Middle Europe. This similarity applies also to the allergen profile. In 3 studies with 256 grass pollen-allergic patients, the sensitization against rye as well as against other in Northern or Middle Europe frequently found grasses could be shown in all patients. Using sera from 15 grass pollen-allergic patients, it could be shown by immunoblot and ELISA inhibition studies that a 5-grass extract inhibits > 90% of IgE binding to rye allergens. The high cross-immunogenicity between Secale cereale and common grasses is reflected in medical practice in many European countries. Patients with rye allergy are treated with grass pollen extracts. According to the high cross-reactivity between grasses and rye-specific immunotherapy of rye allergy seems to be feasible also with a grass pollen extract. Related to existing data this is independent whether the therapeutic extract includes a single grass, a mixture of 5 grasses or other mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Background: In some diseases, penicillin G is still a treatment of choice like in sclerosing diseases of the connective tissue or in persistent scleredema of Buschke. But, suspected allergy to penicillin may limit this helpful therapy option and even leed to the exclusion of other antibiotics like cephalosporins that possibly may crossreact. Skin testing and in vitro diagnostic to detect specific sensitization to penicillin and its derivates have always to be performed but must not be conclusive. In some cases an exposition test is necessary. In single cases of medical demand a tolerance induction is needed to perform penicillin therapy for a period of time. Patients and methods: We present two patients with sclerosing diseases of the connective tissue like circumscribed sclerosis and one patient with persistent scleredema of Buschke with a positive history for penicillin. Although routine allergy testing including intracoutaneous skin testing and in vitro tests were negative, they were treated as allergic to penicillin. Penicillin was decided to be the treatment of choice so that tolerance induction with penicillin was necessary. The administration of pencillin G was achieved by performing a new scheme of tolerance induction. We started with oral doses of penicillin V and finished off with high doses of intravenously applied penicillin G. Results: In each case penicillin G was well-tolerated until the high dose of 3 × 10 7 IU/day, administered over a period of 3 weeks. In all demonstrated cases substantial clinical improvement was achieved without any complication. Conclusions: Suspected allergy to penicillin is widespread and leads to tendency to avoid all penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins as a possible way of treatment. In certain cases there is only a positive history for penicillin allergy and the diagnostic procedure remains negative. Nevertheless, these patients are suspected to be allergic to penicillin. In cases where penicillin seems to be a treatment of choice it might be necessary to perform a tolerance induction with penicillin. Here, we present a new scheme how to treat initially with penicillin V and to continue with penicillin G, and to switch from an oral to an intravenious way to manage a high-dose penicillin therapy.",

Urticaria, however, actually comprises 12 distinct conditions and it is important and often difficult, to determine which urticaria subform(s) individual patients are afflicted with. The most challenging task in diagnosing urticaria is to identify the underlying causes in chronic urticaria. Yet, this is important as many patients with chronic urticaria can be successfully treated by eliminating the reason for their condition. In contrast, the treatment of virtually all other urticarias is primarily aimed at achieving symptom control, e.g. by avoiding accountable triggers and/or by using symptomatic treatment.",

Its indications and contraindications are given. If the occupational history reveals a pneumoconiosis risk, chest X-ray examinations are required. A definitive diagnosis is obligatory due to legal aspects with regard to insurance (is there evidence for an occupational disease?) and for the initiation of aimed preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Background: Environmental factors are discussed as possible causes and/or triggers of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), fragrance allergies (FA) and polyposis nasi (PN). Ajoint effect organ of MCS, FA and PN is the respiratory tract. Therefore, aim of the present study was to characterize and compare living conditions and living factors of persons with self-reported MCS (sMCS), FA or PN. Material and methods: Dependence of variable distribution of a standardized questionnaire of living conditions and living factors was investigated between the patient groups using Pearsons Χ 2 test. In case of significance, pairwise comparisons were done with Fisher's exact test and were Bonferroni adjusted. Results: The sMCS-group consisted of 14 men and 45 women, the FA group of 19 men and 25 women and the PN group of 42 men and 27 women. Questionnaire variables with a significantly different distribution between the patient groups were: chemicals as suspected cause of health disturbances (p < 0.001), use of perfume (p < 0.001), mould exposure at home (p = 0.035), age of furniture at home (p = 0.001), use of disinfections (p = 0.006), insecticides (p = 0.004), daily time spent at home (p = 0.032), exposures to photocopying machines (p < 0.001) and to odors (p < 0.001) at workplace. Mainly, the questionnaire variables investigated were significantly different distributed between the sMCS- and the FA-/PN groups. Conclusions: The different distribution of the questionnaire variables investigated between the sMCS-, FA- and PN group regarded environmental factors with odorous components. Reactions to these factors were lesser pronounced in the FA- than in the sMCS group. In the PN group no environmental association was observed.",

    "abstract": "The role of rodents as a possible source of allergens should not be underestimated, especially because this group of mammals comprises a great number of subspecies, people may come into contact with both at work and in the home environment. The causative allergens can be found in the fur, saliva, urine and epithelia. Few, and in part, contradictory data on the sensitization with rodent allergens prompted us to perform our own clinical and laboratory tests for guinea-pig allergy. 9% of our patients with suspected inhalation allergy proved to be sensitive to guinea-pig allergens, with 6% showing an established allergy; the proportion of patients who developed an asthma bronchiale being distinctly higher than that with other allergies. It was possible to isolate and characterize 2 main allergens (Cav p 1 and Cav p 2) which both belong to the group oflipocalines. In this way, the basis was created for an allergen standardization and further investigations of dusts regarding the presence of guinea-pig allergens.",

    "abstract": "Roasted lupine seeds have been a snack food in mediterranean countries for years. Since the 1990s, lupine flour has been used as a substitute for or additive to other flours, mostly wheat flower, in countries of the European Union. In 1994, the first case of immediate-type allergy after ingestion of lupine seed flour-containing pasta has been published. Since then, the number of incidents including anaphylaxis as a sequel of ingestion or inhalation of lupine flour-containing products is rising. Particularly peanut allergic patients are at risk to develop anaphylaxis to lupine as hidden allergen in food due to cross reactivity between peanut and lupine, both belonging to the group of legumes, the frequency and the degree of cross reactivity being unknown. It was only very recently that lupine flour was listed in Annex IIIA of directive 2000/13/EG, which contains all ingredients that should be named on food products because of the risk they represent for sensitive individuals. Since 2007, lupine flour allergy has also been reported in Germany. Apart from cross reactivity to legumes, particularly peanut, allergy against lupine seeds may also develop de novo.",

    "abstract": "Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. In order to activate the T cell response, the innate immune system has to generate an inflammation that activates skin cells and triggers allergen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) to migrate to the local lymph nodes. There, DC confer the information about their tissue of origin and the site of antigen encounter to T cells which are induced to upregulate skin-specific homing receptors. This enables the recruitment of allergen-specific effector T cells to the skin following allergen contact. Similar findings were made for the small intestine. Our recent studies in the mouse model show a crucial role for the tissue microenvironment both for the inflammatory response and for the transfer of the topographical information from the DC to the T cells. Thus, we have found that Toll-like receptors and the IL-12/IL-12R system are important for DC activation by contact allergens and imply a role for endogenous TLR ligands generated during ACD. Moreover, cells of the peripheral tissue microenvironment provide information via soluble factors and cell-cell contact which license DC emigrating from skin but also DC emigrating from the small intestine to confer topographical information to T cells by imprinting tissue-specific homing receptors on the T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Our results illustrate the crucial role of the tissue context and of the communication between tissue-specific cell types for the shaping of immune responses. These findings underline the necessity to take into account the unique tissue microenvironments upon analysis of immune responses.",

Regulatory T cells (Treg) as key regulators of immunological processes are able to induce peripheral tolerance to allergens. Recent data suggest that the ratio between allergen-specific Th2 cells and Treg determines the development of an allergic or a healthy immune response against allergens. Similarly, skewing of allergen-specific effector T cells to a Treg phenotype appears to be the key event in successful allergen-specific immunotherapy. In this review, the role of both Treg populations, CD4 + CD25 naturally occurring regulatory T cells and IL-10- and TGFp-producing Type 1 T-regulatory (Tr1 ) cells in the control of allergic immune responses and the mediation of immunologic tolerance are summarized.",

    "abstract": "A 23-year-old patient has suffered from meteorism and occasional diarrhea for 8 years. Specific IgG antibodies directed towards multiple foods had been determined elsewhere. A concordant elimination diet had led to loss of body weight of 10 kg (remaining body weight 40 kg) without any improvement of the symptoms. At the time of first presentation in our Allergy Unit, a concise allergological work-up had not been performed. The skin prick testing of inhalant allergens, foods, spices, flour, preservatives and latex-associated foods showed 3+-positive reactions to grass pollen, rye pollen, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, pepper, wheat flour and rye flour; 2+-positive reactions to curry, sodium proprionate and sorbic acid. Determination of specific IgE antibodies to rye flour, wheat flour, pepper and curry were negative, as well as serology for celiac disease. After dramatic weight loss due to elimination diet of 87 foods according to IgG antibodies identified elsewhere, positive prick test results were found to the above mentioned foods and food additives (pepper, wheat- and rye flour, curry as well as sodium proprionate and sorbic acid). A clinically relevant IgE-mediated allergy could be ruled out by an elimination diet to these positive tested foods that did not lead to any improvement of the clinical symptoms. A double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) to wheat and rye flour was refused by the patient. A Pillcam endoscopy revealed an inflammatory alteration of the mucous membran of the terminal ileum. Due to a suspected early stage of Crohn's disease, a coloscopy and a double-ballon endoscopy is scheduled. As in the presented case, determination of IgG antibodies raised against foods is not a feasible measure for diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders and may lead to a significant delay in correct diagnosis and therapy of the underlying disease.",

The skin prick tests with routine inhalant allergens were positive for grass-, rye-, hazel- and ash pollen. A scratch test was positive for Ph. bipennifolium leaves and Ficus benjamina. Specific IgE (CAP-FEIA) was elevated for Ph. bipennifolium, Ph. scandens, Ficus benjamina and natural rubber latex. A nasal provocation (NPT) with fresh extract from Ph. bipennifolium leaves resulted in rhinorrhea, itching of the throat and increased resistance of the nasal airways. This is the first report on immediate-type allergic reaction to Ph. bipennifolium and detection of specific IgE. The clinical relevance was shown by NPT. Philodendron spp. therefore have allergen(s) potent enough to cause allergic disease in an indoor environment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tissue eosinophilia is a striking finding in nasal polyposis. CC-chemokines RANTES, eotaxin and eotaxins-2, -3 play an important role in activation and attraction of eosinophils to the site of inflammation. In order to investigate a possible role of eotaxin, eotaxin-2, eotaxin-3 and RANTES in the development of tissue eosinophilia and nasal polyps, this study was performed. Methods: Eosinophilic nasal polyps (non-allergic n = 8, allergic n = 8, ASS-intolerant n = 8) and mucosa of inferior turbinates of 8 controls were obtained during endonasal surgery. Paraffin sections were stained to determine the extent of eosinophilia. Chemokine protein contents (eotaxin, eotaxin-2,-3 and RANTES) of tissue homogenates were measured by ELISA (quantitative Sandwich ELISA). Results: Protein expression of eotaxin, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 was significantly higher in nasal polyps than in controls and there was a significant correlation between the protein values of all 3 eotaxins. The protein levels of all eotaxins were significantly correlated to the amount of eosinophilia. In contrast, RANTES levels did not show significant differences between patients and controls and there was no correlation to the protein levels of the other chemokines or the amount of eosinophilia. The number of eosinophils was significantly higher in polyps ofASS-sensitive patients than in the other patient groups. Polyps of ASS-sensitive patients had significantly higher eotaxin, eotaxin-2, -3 protein levels than non-allergic patients and significantly higher amounts of eotaxin-3 compared with allergic patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that all members of the eotaxin family are implicated in the underlying mechanisms ofeosinophilic attraction in eosinophilia-associated nasal polyposis. Simultaneous expression of these CCR3-ligands or reaching a certain concentration threshold could possibly be prerequisites for stronger eosinophil migration.",

    "abstract": "Coughing is the most frequent symptom which prompts children with their families to consult a physician. Coughing lasting longer than 3 4 weeks requires a careful differential diagnosis. Lung sounds and accompanying symptoms such as atopic markers of the skin, stridor, wheezing, rales, dyspnea, pain, consistency and color of the mucus, mouth breathing during the night, dystrophia etc. are important signs that necessitate the initiation of a rational and adequate diagnostic procedure. The scope of laboratory examinations depends on severity and duration of the disease and comprises the patients history, various lung function tests and, if necessary, invasive procedures. During the last years, new non-invasive methods have been developed which support the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (electrophysiologic examination at the nasal mucosa to evaluate the transepithelial chloride transport, complete mutation analysis of the cystic fibrosis gene), primary ciliary dyskinesia (measuring nasal (NO)) and obstructive sleep apnea (polysomnography). Modern lung function tests for infants based on improved baby plethysmography allow to separate obstructive from restrictive impairments of the lung in a more reliable manner than before.",

    "abstract": "The threshold of activation as well as the life span of a cell are tuned by genetic predisposition and environmental instructions. Allergic patients show a difference in T cell activation and peripheral tolerance comparedto healthy individuals as well as a dysregulated balance in T cell subpopulations (like T helper-1(Thl)-, T helper-2(Th2)-, T helper-0 (ThO)- and T-regulatory(Treg)-cells). Defects in apoptosis and peripheral tolerance in T cells define three different allergic phenotypes such as atopic, non-atopic and monoallergic types. Although there are overlaps and redundancies, the clinical outcome can manifest itself as dermatitis, asthma, rhinitis or without a target organ as it can be in venom allergy. Upon allergic recognition, IFN-γ-producing, activated and allergen-specific Th1 cells in the circulation predominantly undergo apoptosis, skewing the immune response towards the surviving Th2 cells. These Th2 cells infiltrate allergic organs and secrete cytokines, which leads to local inflammation. In the atopic dermatitis skin, it has been demostrated that IL-12 and IL-18 upregulate the Th1 cytokine IFN-y and induce both activation and apoptosis of epithelial cells. In the non-atopic form, AICD of Th1 cells and immunedeviation to Th2 cells leading to IgE production is not observed; whereas epithelial apoptosis remains the main tissue injury event in both asthma and atopic dermatitis. On the other hand, in monoallergic diseases, the T cell response is characterized by a shift in balance towards allergen-specific Th2 cells rather than Treg cells.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The success rate of hyposensitization with mugwort pollen allergen in patients with late-onset seasonal allergic rhinitis is about 70%. Based on measurements over the last 3 years in the Dresden area using the Burkard pollen trap, it was found that during the main blossom season of mugwort, the nettle pollen pollution is high as well. With regard to the total amount of measured pollen, nettle pollen amounted to 78% compared to only 7% mugwort pollen. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the high nettle pollen exposure for patients with late-onset seasonal allergic rhinitis in the Dresden area. Methods: Thirty-six patients (17 female, 19 male, mean age 29.4 years) with a seasonal late summer allergic rhinitis were examined. All patients were sensitized to mugwort pollen. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and skin prick testing (SPT) for nettle pollen were performed on all patients. A nasal provocation test (NPT) with nettle pollen was performed in 17 patients sensitized to nettle pollen. Results of the provocation were investigated through rhinomanometry after 10, 20 and 30 minutes, respectively. Results: Twenty-four of the 36 patients exhibited a positive SPT and RAST for nettle pollen, showing the sensitization to nettle pollen. Of the 17 patients mentioned above, 8 patients had a positive NPT to nettle pollen. Conclusion: Results of this study indicated that a sensitization for mugwort pollen often coincides with sensitization for nettle pollen. The high nettle pollen exposure in the Dresden area is of clinical importance in the diagnosis of patients with late-onset seasonal allergic rhinitis. Therefore, we recommend that testing for nettle pollen (RAST, SPT and NPT) in patients with late summer allergies shall be included into standard diagnostic procedures. Patients with a positive NPT for nettle pollen may also qualify for hyposensitization therapy for nettle pollen.",

    "abstract": "CD8+-cytotoxic T cells play an important, often dominant role as effector cells in chemical or metal ion-induced contact dermatitis. The reason for the dominance of this T cell subset was unclear, especially since reactive chemicals simultaneously generate immunogenic structures for the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Now, we have shown in vitro that the dominance of CD8+ T cells is caused by cytolysis of CD4+ T cells via a fas-dependent mechanism. Moreover, it was unknown how the CD8+ T cells differentiate to become tissue-specific effectors which migrate selectively to inflamed skin. Our studies have revealed that activation of naive T cells by tissue-specific dendritic cells in the microenvironment of skin-draining lymphnodes selectively induces the expression of skin-specific migration receptors. We could demonstrate, for the first time, that Langerhans cells induce these migration receptors on T cells in vitro. This identifies a previously unknown role for Langerhans cells which, besides presenting antigens from the skin to T cells in lymph nodes, also direct T cells selectively to the skin for efficient immunedefense or induction of allergy.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) presents as a chronic relapsing skin disease with a characteristic phenotype and typically distributed skin lesions, which make the diagnosis of AD very simple and clear-cut. In contrast, the underlying pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms leading to the manifestation of AD are not obvious. Challenged by this puzzle, scientific approaches of the last years have made considerable progress in gaining insights into the complexity of the mechanisms which cause AD. AD is a biphasic inflammatory skin disease characterized by an initial phase predominated by Th2 cytokines which switches into a second and more chronic Thl-dominated eczematous phase. Two different, the high affinity receptor for IgE(FceRI)-bearing dendritic cell subtypes have been identified in the skin of AD patients: FceRI + Langerhans cells (LC) and FceRI + inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDEC). These dendritic cell subtypes are supposed to contribute distinctly to the biphasic nature and the outcome of T cell responses in AD. In contrast, plasmacytoid dendritic cells which have been shown to bear the high affinity receptor for IgE very recently and which play an important role in the defense against viral infections, are nearly absent from the skin lesions of AD patients. In the light of recent developments, a picture emerges that different IgE receptor-bearing DC subtypes in the blood and the skin of AD patients play a pivotal role in the complex pathophysiological network of AD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Specific immunotherapy (SIT) represents the only causal treatment that can be offered to allergic patients apart from allergen avoidance. In classic SIT, gradually increasing dosages of the allergen extract are injected subcutaneously. Several dosage schedules for subcutaneous SIT can be applied. The classic approach involves single injections at each therapy visit. In Cluster-SIT, two to three injections per day of treatment are given once a week during initial treatment. Patients: In this trial, we investigated 46 patients (17 female, 29 male) from 11 - 71 years (40.7 ′ 13 years) with regard to side effects of a Cluster regime during induction treatment with Novo-Helisen Depot. Four patients were treated with two different extracts, so that a total of 50 initial therapies were observed; 19 patients (41%) suffered from bronchial asthma. Results: We performed 34 treatments with mite extracts, eight treatments with grass pollen extracts and eight treatments with tree pollen extracts with 744 injections in total. The total number of enlarged local reactions (≥ grade 1) was 23, or 3.1% of all injections. Of these, 22 (3.0%) were classified as immediate reactions and one (0.1%) was a late-phase reaction. Of all enlarged local reactions, 22 (3.0%) were grade 1 reactions (5 - 8 cm) and one (0.1%) was a grade 2 reaction (8 - 12 cm). Grades 3 and 4 reactions were not observed. Only one systemic reaction was observed (0.1% of all injections). This reaction was a delayed phase reaction grade 1 (urticaria). Grades 2, 3, or 4 reactions did not occur. There were no differences in gender or age regarding the occurence of side effects (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: Frequency and severity of adverse side effects in Cluster-SIT with Novo-Helisen Depot show an excellent tolerability corresponding to the occurrence of side-effects with other dosage schedules.",

    "abstract": "Ranitidine is an H 2 -receptor antagonist which is generally well tolerated. Since the 1970s, it is used for the treatment of peptic ulcers, esophageal reflux, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In dermatology, ranitidine is recommended as a second-line therapy for chronic urticaria that is not responsive to anti-H 1 monotherapy. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with urticaria, facial edema and dyspnea after simultaneous ingestion of Sostril (ranitidine) tablets and diclofenac. Scratch testing with Sostril (ranitidine) resulted in a strongly positive reaction in this patient whereas the same test remained negative in a control patient. The scratch test as well as an oral challenge with diclofenac were negative. Because of anaphylactic risk, ranitidine was not tested by oral challenge. A basophil degranulation test was carried out with the suspected drug Sostril, with pure ranitidine, and separately with each constituent of Sostril tablets (microcristalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypomellose, titane dioxyd and triacetine) in different concentrations. Significant basophil activation was detected only in aliquots with Sostril or with pure ranitidine, whereas stimulation with the different nonactive constituents produced no basophil degranulation. The results of cutaneous scratch test and in vitro basophil degranulation test suggest immediate-type hypersensitivity to ranitidine to be responsible for the anaphylactic reaction in this patient. Diclofenac may have amplified this reaction by nonimmunologic pathways. Considering the extensive use of H 2 -receptor antagonists, real type I hypersensitivities to these molecules remain exceptional with only few well-documented cases in literature.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of stinging insect allergy is based upon history, skin test and the detection of specific (s)IgE and IgG4 to the hymenoptera venoms. However, in vivo- and in vitro diagnostic tests are not 100% specific and sensitive, the stinging insects are sometimes unidentified. The westemblot allows the detection of sIgE and sIgG4 to single allergens and is currently considered as being of mainly supportive value. Therefore, a semiquantitative westemblot method was evaluated with sera of 47 patients with suspected hymenoptera venom allergy. sIgE and sIgG4 were detected using CAP-FEIA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany) and westemblot (DPC Biermann Bad Nauheim, Germany). The intensity of the specific westernblot reactions was determined semi-quantitatively by the software Quantiscan. Before IT, higher concentrations of sIgE and sIgG4 in westernblot were correlated with the severity of the clinical reaction. The correlation factor for the comparison between both in vitro procedures was statistically significant with 0.691 for sIgE and 0.598 for sIgG4, with the calculation being based upon the respective highest peak. Skin test and westernblot showed a correlation for sIgE but not sIgG4. During immunotherapy (IT), sIgE initially increased in 56% of the patients and decreased shortly afterwards, whereas sIgG4 increased during the first 3 years of IT and decreased after more than 2 years after IT discontinuation. According to this investigation, westemblot should be performed at certain intervals during the IT course: before IT, after IT initiation, once during IT, at discontinuation and, additionally, several years after treatment discontinuation.",

The enduring exposure with environmental allergens leads in the case of asthma to chronic inflammation which, in turn, mobilizes repair processes and irreversible airway remodeling. The cytokine TGF-β as well as activin βA play an important role in the systemic and local processes. However, the role of these cytokines has a Janus-faced character: the immunosuppressive function is clearly welcome, whereas the TGF-β/activin βA promoted airway remodeling is a serious complication of allergic disease. The relative contribution of activin βA and TGF-β is discussed and set into relation of both immunologic and remodeling processes.",

This paper aims at describing relevant rhinologic differential diagnoses occurring with more or less similar symptoms. Methods: 9,923 patients complaining about persisting nasal problems were characterized by symptoms and nasal ECP, according to their diagnosis, such as chronic rhinosinusitis, non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), nasal polyposis and persisting allergic rhinitis. Atopy screen based on patients history, SX1 (Phadiatop) and total IgE. Non-atopic individuals without sings of a chronic nasal inflammation served as controls. Results: Nasal obstruction was the most bothering symptom for our patients, followed by post-nasal drip and nasal secretion. Post-nasal drip could be extracted as a specific symptom for paranasal sinus involvement. Eosinophils could be demonstrated in all studied chronic inflammatory conditions by nasal ECP with excessive values in NARES patients. NARES was found in 34.9% of all cases with persisting rhinitis. Discussion: Determination of certain in vivo and in vitro parameter enriches the differential diagnosis of persisting rhinitis and constitutes an essential part of modem rhinologic diagnostics, besides nasal endoscopy and X-rays of paranasal sinuses. Although the majority of patients complain about similar symptoms, we could characterize disease-specific impairments. Consequently, diagnostics of persisting rhinitis constitutes a domain for rhinologists.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disease, caused by a genetic predisposition and a variety of environmental triggers. In most cases, AD is linked to a specific IgE immune response to commoninhalants or food allergens and therefore classified as an atopic subtype, the so-called atopic eczema (AE). However, in up to 30% of patients with AD, there are normal serum IgE levels and negative skin tests; as a result, the term non-atopic eczema (NAE) has been proposed to replace the otherwise used terms intrinsic or non-IgE-associated form of AD. Facing this constellation, solely atopy patch tests, which elicit eczematous skin reactions after epidermal application of common aeroallergens, may indicate a putative role of local T cell response in the skin and, thus, are highly important in NAE. Next to a certain genetic disposition, infectious triggers and autoreactivity in patients with NAE have been observed. In the following, we will present a short overview to highlight typical characteristics in NAE and possible pathogenic factors in this AD subtype.",

    "abstract": "The number of allergic patients in industrialized countries has increased over the last 30 years. At present, approximately 30% of the European inhabitants have been affected. According to estimations, only a fraction of patients with respiratory allergy is diagnosed at an early stage and treated correctly. The European Academy for Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) has, therefore, initiated a campaign focusing on the early diagnosis of allergy. Early diagnosis needs easy screening instruments. Thus, an easy visual allergy test for the fast detection of specific IgE in capillary blood has been developed. This test is based on the ELISAtechnique (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and adapted to be carried out at room temperature with a result within 30 minutes using only 2 -3 drops of whole blood (75 100 μl). Specific IgE for either 12 separate food allergens or 12 separate inhalation allergens can be tested in parallel in one test. The current allergen panel covers approximately 90% of the relevant inhalant allergens or food allergens for northern and middle Europe. Allergens on the membrane give a visible sign in the shape of a + for positive reactions and a - for negative reactions. Correlation of results of the fast allergy test with results of the Pharmacia CAP was shown. In 313 patients the test showed 96% positive and 98% negative correlation in average.

    "abstract": "In Lower Saxony there has been ongoing discussion on potential health effects caused by emissions (bioaerosols) of livestock production facilities. We investigated the relationship between intensive livestock facilities in the neighborhood and respiratory, cutaneous or allergic diseases in 5- to 6-year-old children. Within a cross-sectional epidemiological study in 2001 a standardized questionnaire about respiratory and allergic symptoms and corresponding risk factors was used (n = 7,943). In addition, we examined flexural eczema. Individual exposition to bioaerosols coming from livestock facilities, for example endotoxin, was estimated on the basis of a Lagrangian simulation model of aerosol transport. For the investigation on overreporting with respect to dermatitis symptoms 3,374 observations were used. A probable overreporting was identified for the group of parents who did not live near livestock production facilities, but complained about agricultural odor annoyance. They reported twice as much skin symptoms (itchy skin condition during the last year 50.7% vs. 21.5 - 26.1% for the other groups), whereas the prevalence rate for visible signs of dermatitis hardly varies between the different strata of exposition (overall 5.8%). The homogeneity of odds ratios between.reported itchy skin condition and examined flexural eczema for the different strata is not fulfilled (p value < 0.05). Taking into account the odor annoyance, we have a strong hint for an overreporting of skin symptoms by a small study population group (3.2% of all), so that a general overreporting of allergic symptoms in this group can be assumed. Complementary objective medical examinations seem to be necessary to identify potential sources of bias even in case standardized questionnaires are used, particularly when issues of environmental health are dealt with.",

These effects have not been evaluated systematically up to know.Aim of this study was to assess the impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on daytime sleepiness measured with a validated questionnaire (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS). Twenty-five patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were compared to 25 healthy volunteers in a prospective controlled clinical trial. Daytime sleepiness and symptoms of allergic rhinitis (nasal obstruction and nasal itching. sneezing, conjunctivitis, and itching of the palate) were assessed with the ESS and a questionnaire before and during the pollen season 2002 and the severity of the disease was evaluated. Daytime sleepiness increased in the allergy group during the season (extrascasonal score: 6.8 ′ 2.7, intraseasonal score: 8.2 ′ 3.4) and remained unchanged in the controll group (extrascasonal score: 5.4 ′ 2.4, intraseasonal score: 5.3 ′ 2.4), leading to statistically significant between group differences (p < 0.05). The increase in daytime sleepiness was depending on the severity of the disease and was more pronounced in those patients with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis. Seasonal allergic rhinitis leads to an increased daytime sleepiness during the pollen season. Stasticially significant differences in daytime sleepiness can be assessed when comparing patients with healthy controls. The changes in daytime sleepiness were depending on the severity of the disease.",

Only a very small number ofstudies have been able to find differences between allergic and intrinsic asthma. Intrinsic asthma, which differs markedly from allergic asthma of children and adolescence, might be related to a chronic T lymphocyte activation possibly due to an endogenous antigen. In addition, cytotoxic mechanisms similar to other autoimmune diseases might play a role. Understanding intrinsic asthma might hold the key to the understanding of chronic allergic asthma and its underlying inflammation leading to persistent airflow limitation and airway remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Background: The position of the tonsils which belong to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), implies a key role as secondary lymphoid organ in initiating immune responses against various antigens. While the IgE antibody-mediated release of mediators constitutes the immunopathological basis for immediate symptoms, much less is known concerning the role of allergen-specific responses of isotypes other than IgE. In order to investigate the impact of an allergen-specific immune reaction on the local immune response in palatine tonsils, the expression of IgA + plasma cells and the distribution of proliferating cells in Bet v 1-(Betula verrucosa 1) allergic and non-allergic patients were detected. Methods: Using immunohistological methods, IgA + plasma cells and K167 + cells were stained in cryosections of tonsils from 20 patients according to chronic tonsillitis (Bet v 1-allergic/non-allergic patients, n = 10). The distribution of IgA + plasma- and Ki67 + -proliferating cells was analyzed. Results: Our analyses showed a differential distribution and a significantly (p < 0.01) diminished expression of IgA + plasma cells in tonsils of Bet v 1-allergic patients compared to non-allergic patients. Further, tonsils of allergic and non-allergic patients did not show differences in the distribution of proliferating cells. However, tonsils of both investigated groups were comparable concerning their number and size of secondary lymphoid follicles and their morphologic structures. Conclusions: Altogether, these data may lead to the assumption that the reduction of IgA + plasma cells within the epithelial microenvironment of the crypts and the extrafollicular areas in allergic individuals results in a reduced ability to mount a protective immune response against allergens. The comparable number and size of follicles and the distribution of proliferating cells in the tonsillar germinal centers may reflect the ongoing germinal center reaction.",

    "abstract": "Cold urticaria is a disease which after contact to cold objects, fluids and air can lead to wheals in lighter and shock reactions in more severe cases. Diagnostically, many different clinical and serological tests have been reported to secure the diagnosis and possible causes. Therapeutical approaches include antihistamines and cold tolerance induction baths amongst other options. The main objectives of the present study were to evaluate a wide range of diagnostic data, to compare different treatment measures and to follow-up clinical symptoms and therapeutic success within a large group of patients. 82 patients, 46 with an isolated cold urticaria and 36 with other additional factors of wheal formation were examined and followed-up 1 - 20 years later by questionnaire. With a median age of onset at 20 years, the disease duration was 1 year in spontaneously healed and 15 years in still affected patients. The mean border temperature below which wheals developed was 22 °C before and 17 °C after therapy. No statistically relevant abnormalities were discovered in serological and hematological examinations. Isolated infectious hearths were rarely found, particularly in consiliary ear-nose-throat examinations. Whereas 52% of patients treated with cetirizine (12 out of 23 patients) reported a significant improvement of their symptoms, no patient who had undergone a therapy with cold water baths continued this for longer than 1 year due to limited effects and gross inconvenience. This study underlines the clinical dilemma of cold urticaria that, despite a defined physical provocation factor, the etiopathogenic as well as therapeutic knowledge are still limited until today. Furthermore, the results of these examinations of diverse parameters in a large and well-characterized patient group show that elaborate diagnostic testing makes sense only if individually fitted and after thorough history taking. Intensive and long-term care of these patients is mandatory.",

Other authors quote fungi to cause CRS in only upto 10%. In Germany, data concerning fungal rhinosinusitis in CRS patients are rare. Therefore, a study on 51 patients with CRS and 10 controls was conducted. Nasal mucus was collected by cotton sponges (group A, n = 39) or by flushing the nose (group B, n = 12), the controls were treated respectively. Nasal secretions were processed for microbiology, fungal cultivation and cytology. Fungi and eosinophiles were visualised by microscopic study of smears in Pappenheim and Grocott. Skin prick tests and specific IgE measurements were done to evaluate an atopy. Five (12%) patients in group A and 1 patient (8%) in group B had positive fungal cultures. Altogether, from 6 (12%) patients with CRS and 2 controls fungi were cultivated. The species identified were Aspergillus, Alternaria, Aureobasidium, Candida, Cladosporium, Penicillium. Fourteen (36%) patients in group A and 2 (16%) in group B showed fungi on microscopic examination. So, in 16 (31%) patients with CRS fungi were found in the cytological preparations, 1 control was positive. In 3 patients, skin prick tests and specific antigen against fungi correlated with the microscopic and mycological findings. Our data indicate that allergic fungal rhinosinusitis can occur in 6% of CRS. In 31% of CRS fungi were found in nasal mucus. If in such patients conventional treatment fails, new therapeutic strategies could be of relevance.",

    "abstract": "Objective and design: Etiology and classification of chronic rhinosinusitis still remain unclear. Chronic rhinosinusitis can be differentiated clinically according to the presence or absence of nasal polyps in the nasal cavity. Knowledge of infiltrating leukocytes in these 2 sinusitis entities is still limited. Therefore, based on quantification of inflammatory cells in biopsies from patients with nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, we tried to answer the question if there is need for further subclassification of chronic rhinosinusitis into different disease entities. Patients and methods: Nasal polyps (n = 37) and tissue from patients suffering from chronic sinusitis without polyps (n=41) were examined by light microscopy after immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies against eosinophilic cationic protein (eosinophilic granulocytes), neutrophilic elastase (neutrophilic granulocytes) and CD38 antigen which is expressed by a variety of cells including plasma cells and activated T lymphocytes. All data were tested using a Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: In nasal polyposis, we found a significant increase of eosinophils and neutrophils (p < 0,05) compared to chronic nonpolypous rhinosinusitis. Samples of chronic nonpolypous rhinosinusitis were dominated by neutrophils. In addition, a considerable infiltration of CD38-positive cells around mucosal gland cells was observed in chronic rhinosinusitis but not in nasal polyposis. Conclusions: Different types and quantities of inflammatory cells support our hypothesis that there is need for further subclassification of chronic rhinosinusitis according to polypous and nonpolypous.",

    "abstract": "Nasal polyposis affects nearly 4% of the overall population in western countries, and presents a real challenge to the physician due to its severity, chronicity and recurrence rate. Characteristic histomorphological features of polyps are an eosinophilic inflammation and the destruction of connective tissue, and recent research focused on cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and metalloproteinases to explain these features, as the etiology of nasal polyposis remains largely unclear. Currently, topical and systemic glucocorticosteroids are first-choice drug therapy approaches, and good evidence from controlled trials is available for topical, but not for systemic steroid therapy. Surgery is indicated if adequate drug treatment fails, which often needs to be maintained for months or years after surgery. Limited experience exists for other drugs, such as antihistamines, antileucotrienes and furosemid, which may be added in selected cases. Aspirin desensitization may be a therapeutic option for patients who do not respond to corticosteroids nor surgery. Recently, antibiotics such as macrolides have been suggested to have therapeutic activity based on their anti-inflammatory properties, but large-scale controlled trials are lacking. New approaches have currently evolved, specifically targeting eosinophilic recruitment (anti-CCR3, anti-eotaxin) and inflammation (anti-lL-4,5,13), IgE antibodies (anti-IgE) or tissue remodeling, reducing the activity of metalloproteinases. This review summarizes current knowledge on pathomechanisms as well as established and future approaches in the pharmacological management of bilateral eosinophilic nasal polyposis.",

The aim of our study was to measure zinc and copper levels in serum and induced sputum in patients with allergic rhinitis and patients with allergic asthma. Methods: We measured concentrations of zinc and copper in serum and in supernatant of induced sputum in 21 patients with allergic asthma, in 13 patients with allergic rhinitis and in 10 control subjects. Results: We have found decreased levels of zinc in serum of patients with allergic asthma and in patients with allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, levels of zinc in serum in patients with allergic asthma were lower than in patients with allergic rhinitis. Concentrations of zinc in supernatant of induced sputum were lower in asthmatics than in control subjects and rhinitics, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in concentrations of copper in serum and in sputum between asthmatics, rhinitics and control subjects. We have also found a positive linear correlation between zinc concentrations in serum and sputum in the group of control subjects, in patients with allergic asthma and in male patients with allergic rhinitis.

    "abstract": "Atopic eczema is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood with a cumulative prevalence of 20%. As a complex genetic disease, it is characterized by altered epidermal keratinization pathways, impairment of skin barrier function, and immunoregulatory imbalance resulting in acute or chronic skin inflammation. Affected patients and their families are severely restricted in their quality of life because of a chronic relapsing illness and high costs of therapy. They depend upon an efficient, stage-adapted treatment with the lowest possible rate of unwanted side effects. This review summarizes topical and systemic options in the management of atopic eczema. In particular, local antiinflammatory treatment with topical corticosteroids is reviewed with a special emphasis on preparations possessing a high therapeutic index. Additionally, the role of topical immunomodulators (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) is critically evaluated with regard to the safety profile and therapeutic efficacy of these substances in the pediatric age group. Systemic treatment options comprising antihistamines, antibiotics, corticosteorids, UV therapy and cyclosporin A are also extensively discussed.",

    "abstract": "Intolerance reactions to local anesthetics are frequent complications in medical and dental offices, but true allergy to local anesthetics is very rare (< 1%). In this study, we aimed to characterize patients with recurrent - at least 2 - intolerance reactions to local anesthetics. All patients had negative skin tests to local anesthetics of the immediate (IgE-mediated) as well as of the delayed type (T cell-mediated), and all have been subcutaneously challenged with a local anesthetic. During the last 10 years, out of 477 patients with a history of intolerance reactions to local anaesthetics referred to us, 275 of them have been thoroughly tested for allergy, particularly to local anesthetics. Of 43 eligible patients, 36 could be interviewed and 23 of them agreed to new tests. Although many of the study patients experienced symptoms suggestive for a vagovasal reaction, they seemed not to have an overall higher tendency for psychovegetative dispositions. The clinical reaction of intolerance following local anesthetics was always of the same pattern. There was no evidence of an enhanced mast-cell releasability or tissue reactivity to specific and non-specific mast-cell stimulants, respectively, and basal serum tryptase level was within the normal range. Moreover, a negative challenge test with local anesthetics is no guarantee for recurrence of intolerance reactions to local anesthetics. Nevertheless, we are in agreement with the recommendation of other groups to do challenge tests in the diagnostic of intolerance reactions to local anesthetics. Based on our results, we consider pharmacological effects as the most likely explanation in subjects with recurrent episodes to local anesthetics resembling allergy. In contrast to allergy to local anesthetics, all patients recovered spontaneously within 30 minutes without any therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and therefore also play a key role in the initiation of allergic immune responses underlying atopic/allergic diseases like allergic bronchial asthma, allergic rhinokonjunctivits and atopic eczema. Due to their potency in presentation of antigens to T cells, they also are appealing candidates for antigen-specific immunotherapeutical approaches. Exposure of immature DC derived from peripheral blood monocytes of allergic donors to allergen proteins leads to early activation, i.e. phosphorylation, of STAT6 followed by (low) production of IL-13. IL-13 enhances STAT6 phosphorylation in autologous T cells and the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, but not of the Th 1 cytokine IFN-γ in vitro. The inducible costimulatory molecule ICOS which is induced after T cell activation and its ligand (ICOSL) being expressed on monocytes and DC, also plays an important role in the regulation of Th2 effector cells. Immature DC pulsed with allergen and arrested in their immature state by IL-10 induce anergy in cocultured autologous T cells associated with production of IL-10. These T cells also exhibit regulatory functions inhibiting the proliferation and cytokine production of other T cells. DC can also be transfected very efficiently with allergen DNA using adenoviral vectors. These transfected DC activate predominantly CD8 + T cells and induce IFN-γ production also in CD4 + T cells, together with enhanced IL-10 production. These data support the key importance of DC for the development of atopic/allergic diseases and indicate that DC may be useful tools for antigen-specific immunointervention.",

    "abstract": "Chronic urticaria is a frequent dermatological disease. Food allergy or intolerance are often suspected as the cause of urticaria symptoms. IgE-mediated food allergies are normally not relevant but pseudoallergic reactions to food additives and possibly biogenic amines may be crucial. Therefore, lots of patients presenting in an outpatient clinic kept diets that were worthless and that could lead to nutritional defiency in the long run. A structured schedule in the diagnostic procedure might be helpful and necessary in respecting the relationship to foods. This article especially focuses on additives in nutrition, clinical relevance of elimination diets and the importance of that dietary measure. Hereby, the procedure of dietary diagnostics and advice by the specialist in trophology is presented in detail on the base of national and international position papers and our own experiences of investigations, collected from our specialized outpatient clinic for chronic urticaria at the unit of allergy and environment, department of dermatology at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. Besides, the results demonstrate that a close cooperation between allergologists and a specialist in trophology is constructive to rule out or confirm food allergy, respectively, intolerance and to avoid keeping unnecessary diets.",

We compared the effects of oral cetirizine versus fluticasone propionate nasal spray on symptoms and concentrations of inflammatory mediators in nasal secretions of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis during the pollen season. In a randomized double-blind study, 30 patients with birch and grass allergy received either 10 mg cetirizine p.o. (CET) and a placebo nasal spray or 200 μg fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FP) and a placebo tablet OD for ca. 4.5 months covering the birch and grass pollen season. Daily nasal and eye symptoms were registered using a diary card and were analyzed under consideration of daily pollen load. Nasal secretion was collected by the filter paper-disc method and concentrations of histamine and ECP were measured by ELISA. Regarding the total symptom score made up of nasal and eye symptoms throughout the study, no significant difference between the 2 patient groups was found. In contrast, the analysis of the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) showed significantly better results for the FP group in the course of the season, if only days with a pollen count > 20/m 3 were evaluated (p = 0.0197). Cetirizine, on the other hand, showed a clear tendency to stronger effects on eye symptoms using the same method of evaluation (p = 0.0584). Concentrations of histamine and ECP in nasal secretions were significantly lower under medication with FP. The study demonstrates that by separately analyzing nasal and ocular symptoms under consideration of the intensity of the pollen flight a more differentiated assessment of the effects of anti-SAR medications is possible. Especially in regions characterized by a rather fluctuating pollen flight, evaluation only of those days with high pollen load may yield an essential gain of information. The results on liberation of inflammatory mediators confirmed the greater anti-inflammatory effect of the topical glucocorticosteroid. It can be suggested that a combination of the 2 therapeutic principles is reasonable for subjects with moderate to severe nasal and ocular symptoms.",

These particles, which come in a wide range of sizes (fine particles are less than 2.5 μm in diameter and coarser-size particles are larger than 2.5 μm), originating from many different stationary and mobile sources as well as from natural sources. Fine particles result from fuel combustion from motor vehicles, power generation and industrial facilities as well as from residential fireplaces and wood stoves. Coarse particles (PM10) are generally emitted from sources, such as vehicles traveling on unpaved roads, materials handling and crushing and grinding operations, as well as windblown dust. Inhalable PM includes both fine and coarse particles. These particles can accumulate in the respiratory system and are associated with numerous health effects. Exposure to coarse particles is primarily associated with the aggravation of respiratory conditions, such as asthma. Fine particles are most closely associated with such health effects like increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for heart and lung disease, increased respiratory symptoms and disease, decreased lung function, and even premature death. Sensitive groups that appear to be at greatest risk to such effects include the elderly, individuals with cardiopulmonary disease such as asthma, and children. This study investigates PM10 and airborne pollen during different years and shows connections between weather conditions in winter time and these particles.",

    "abstract": "Apart from nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, itching and sneezing are main symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Apparently, activation of the central nervous system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of this process. It is known that itching and sneezing are primarily mediated by the trigeminal system. The afferent trigeminal fibers are composed of myelated Aδ fibers and thin, non-myelated C fibers which are activated by polymodal nociceptors. Furthermore, there is strong evidence in animal-experimental studies showing that afferent trigeminal C fibers participate in the local by liberating neuropeptides, e.g. substance P (SP) or calcitonine gene-related peptide (CGRP) (concept of the neurogenic inflammation). These neurotransmitters themselves have a potential effect on the allergic cascade and may modulate the immunologic response. The knowledge of these interactions could explain the role of the psychological impact in the inflammatory process of allergic rhinitis and asthma. The present paper describes the (micro-) anatomy and the nasal innervation under normal conditions and shows an overview about the activation of itching and sneezing via the trigeminal system. In addition, the possible effects of this trigeminal activation on the local process via neuropeptides, e.g. SP and CGRP, are discussed. It might be hypothesized that in the future the modulation of these neuropeptides due to the neurogenic inflammation might become one possible clue in treatment of atopy diseases.",

By means of modern diagnostic tools including immunologic and molecular methods, 2 main subgroups of HES, the myeloproliferative and lymphocytic variants, have been identified in the last decade. In addition, HES include the familial variant, the episodic type, the benign asymptomatic blood eosinophilia as well as disorders with blood eosinophilia and single organ involvement. Several complex disorders although fulfilling the criteria of HES, e.g. Churg-Strauss syndrome, are still considered as separate entities. Therapeutic options are corticosteroids, but also immunomodulators, cytostatic agents, monoclonal antibodies as well as bone marrow transplantation. Recently, the description of the HES-causing fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA coding a tyrosine kinase gained attention because these patients respond to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. In this review, we discuss current concepts of the classification, diagnostic procedures and therapy of HES.",

    "abstract": "Background: Putative and symptomatic allergies towards dental materials are an issue of increasing relevance in the context of dental-prosthetic treatments. Allergy passport information enables dentists to decide about certain dental materials; however, this decision process calls for sensitive consideration of validity and clinical relevance of the information provided by the allergy passport and the underlying epicutaneous tests. Materials and methods: In order to evaluate dentists' recommendations for individual dental materials when the results of epicutaneous tests are involved, the data of 83 patients were analyzed whose cost-funding applications were based on epicutaneous test results. Furthermore, the performance quality and the validity of interpretations concerning the choice of dental materials based on these tests were evaluated both from a clinical and a health-economic point of view. An interdisciplinary expert panel rated the validity of the test and its suitability for the decision process at hand. Based on the clinical data, the panel derived a recommendation for an appropriate and cost-efficient dental supplementation. The cost estimates for these recommendations were compared to the dentists' treatment and cost proposals in order to characterize the financial damage of material recommendations based on incorrect applications or interpretations of epicutaneous tests. Results: Epicutaneous testing is indicated only for manifest symptoms which were present in 8% of the analyzed cases. 66 of 83 cases could present an allergy passport; however, the results of the epicutaneous tests were stated correctly in these allergy passports for only 70% of these 66 cases. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of the test results was only documented in 3 of these 66 allergy passports. Only 10 of the 83 suggested material changes could be confirmed by the expert panel, for 42 patients (51%) a more suitable and cost-efficient supplementation was suggested. The submitted cost-funding applications exceeded the recalculation of the expert panel in median by 680 Euro (interquartile range: 297 - 1,966 Euro). The total cost deviation for the 83 patients amounted to 113,186 Euro, mainly due to the rather large fraction (65%) of applications intending a prosthetic restoration made of gold. Conclusion: The results of the present examination demonstrate the limited suitability of allergy passports as a tool in dental decision making with respect to the selection of dental materials. Nevertheless, allergy passports are often used rather uncritically by dentists as a legitimation for material changes, which may result in both clinically and economically relevant consequences.",

Methods: We performed a survey in a representative sample of the Belgian population (n = 4,959) with an overall prevalence of self-declared recent rhinitis symptoms of 39.3%. Detailed information on patients having experienced nasal symptoms over the past year was then obtained from a random sample of respondents (n = 743). Results: The adjusted prevalence was 29.8% for AR and 9.6% for NINA, respectively. According to the ARIA classification, there was significantly more persistent symptomatology in the AR group (40.8%) than in NINA (23.5%) (p < 0.001), and more moderate/severe symptom intensity in AR (75.4%) than in NINA (5 3.1%) (p < 0.001). AR patients suffered from a greater number of symptoms than did NINA patients (p < 0.001). Asthma, skin and food allergy as comorbidities were all found to be significantly more prevalent in the AR vs. the NINA group (p < 0.05 for all). The percentage of consulting patients (total: 66.8%) who subjectively perceived their rhinitis as moderate/severe, was 94.0%, whereas 75.6% of these patients were classified accordingly based on ARIA criteria. Conclusions: We found a high prevalence of self-declared rhinitis symptoms in the Belgian population, AR being about 3 times more prevalent than NINA. In addition, AR patients suffered from a greater number of symptoms and displayed a more persistent and moderate-severe ARIA profile than NINA. About 75% of patients in total, and about 82% seeking medical help, suffer from moderate to severe forms of allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) has a life prevalence of about 24% and, thereby, AR is the most common immune disease and one of the most common chronic diseases. It often develops in childhood or adolescence and there is a continuing trend towards increasing numbers in most industrialized countries in this age group, thus, diagnosis and therapy are of major importance. AR has a high impact on social living, school performance and mental and physical development of those children. In addition, it is accompanied by comorbidities such as conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, sinusitis and others. E.g., the risk to develop bronchial asthma is approximately 4 times higher in children with AR if compared with a matched control group. In the drug treatment of AR, α-sympathomimetics, anticholinergic agents, nasal rinsing methods, topical and systemic antihistamines, topical glucocorticosteroids, and leukotrien rezeptorantagonists are used. Spezific immuntherapy (hyposensitization) is the only causal treatment option in AR besides allergen avoidance and should be used early in disease. Efficacy of subcutaneous immuntherapy is well-documented. Besides therapy, the efficiacy of specific immunotherapy to prevent new sensitizations and to avoid the allergic march should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Background: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is an effective treatment for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) with or without asthma. It is important to note that due to the complex interaction between patient, allergy triggers, symptomatology and vaccines used for AIT, some patients do not respond optimally to the treatment. Furthermore, there are no validated or generally accepted candidate biomarkers that are predictive of the clinical response to AIT. Clinical management of patients receiving AIT and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for drug development could be enhanced by predictive biomarkers. Method: The EAACI taskforce reviewed all candidate biomarkers used in clinical trials of AR patients with and without asthma in a literature review. Biomarkers were grouped into seven domains: (i) IgE (total IgE, specific IgE, and sIgE/Total IgE ratio), (ii) IgG-subclasses (sIgG1, sIgG4 including SIgE/ IgG4 ratio), (iii) Serum inhibitory activity for IgE (IgE-FAB and IgE-BF), (iv) Basophil activation, (v) Cytokines and Chemokines, (vi) Cellular markers (T regulatory cells, B regulatory cells, and dendritic cells) and (vii) In vivo biomarkers (including provocation tests). Results: All biomarkers were reviewed in the light of their potential advantages as well as their respective drawbacks. Unmet needs and specific recommendations on all seven domains were addressed. Conclusions: It is recommended to explore the use of allergen-specific IgG4 as a biomarker for compliance. sIgE/tIgE and IgE-FAB are considered as potential surrogate candidate biomarkers. Cytokine/chemokines and cellular reponses provided insight into the mechanisms of AIT. More studies for confirmation and interpretation of the possible association with the clinical response to AIT are needed.",

    "abstract": "In 2006 to 2017, a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on the use of monoclonal antibodies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps were published. They were the first to demonstrate that these innovative therapies are in principle effective in the treatment of nasal polyps. The target proteins, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as immunoglobulin (Ig) E had been identified as key proteins in previous basic studies. The studies are characterized by small numbers of cases, but have paved the way for phase 3 studies, which are currently underway and which could lead to the market introduction of the first drug with this indication as early as next year. They already provide some hints of the effects to be expected from biologics; however, phase 3 studies with more patients and a more homogeneous patient population will be crucial for indications, patient selection, and stop rules for each of these biologics. For those patients with severe polyposis whose disease could previously not be controlled by pharmacotherapy and/or surgery, there will undoubtedly be new therapeutic options that will put an end to the risks and shortcomings of previous therapies.",

    "abstract": "Berufliche Allergie und beruflich erworbenes Asthma stellen schwerwiegende Erkrankungen dar und konnen auch Beschaftigte in der Fisch- und Meeresfruchte-Industrie betreffen. Zu unterscheiden sind dabei zwei Hauptgruppen von Allergieauslosern: Fisch und Schalentiere (Krustentiere (Crustecea) und Weichtiere (Mollusken)). Fur beide Gruppen wurden bereits einige allergene Proteine identifiziert, aber nur wenige wurden auf molekularer Ebene charakterisiert. Das Majorallergen der Fische scheint Parvalbumin zu sein, das der Krustentiere Tropomyosin. Neben weiteren IgE-bindenden Proteinen, die identifiziert wurden, fanden sich auch andere mit Meeresfruchten bzw. Fischen assoziierte Bestandteile (z.B. Parasiten), deren molekularen Eigenschaften aber noch nicht im Detail beschrieben wurden. Luftgetragene Allergene von Fischen bzw. Meeresfruchten konnen mit immunologischen und chemischen Methoden identifiziert werden, wobei eine Quantifizierung ab 10 ng/m³ moglich ist. Der folgende Artikel gibt einen Uberblick uber die industriellen Verarbeitungsprozesse von Fischen und Meeresfruchten, die Tatigkeiten mit hohem Risiko sowie uber personliche und umweltbedingte Risikofaktoren fur berufsbezogene Atemwegs- und Hautallergien in diesem Arbeitsbereich. Weiterhin werden die allergenen Proteine und die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen genauer beschrieben und daruber hinaus diagnostische und praventive Ansatze zum Management von arbeitsbedingten Allergien bei der Verarbeitung von Fisch und Meeresfruchten vorgestellt. \r\n\r\nOccupational allergy and asthma are serious adverse health consequence affecting seafood-processing workers. Allergic reactions are directed to two major seafood groups: fish and shellfish, with the latter group comprising crustaceans and mollusks. Several allergenic proteins have been identified in these different groups, but few have been characterized on a molecular level. Parvalbumin appears to be the major fish allergen, while tropomyosin is the major crustacean allergen. Other IgE binding proteins have also been identified as well as other seafood-associated agents (e.q., parasites), although their molecular nature have not been characterized in detail. Aerosolized allergens can be identified and quantified using immunological and chemical approaches, detecting levels as low as 10 ng/m³. This review outlines the high-risk working populations, work processes, as well as host and environmental exposure risk factors for occupational respiratory and skin allergies. It also provides insights into the allergenic proteins as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated. Diagnostic and preventive approaches are outlined in managing work-related allergy associated with seafood processing.",

    "abstract": "Die Anzahl der von Allergien betroffenen Patienten nimmt weltweit zu. Hiermit gehen erhebliche Kosten fur die Gesundheits- und Sozialsysteme durch allergische Erkrankungen einher. Integrierte Versorgungskonzepte sind erforderlich, die innerhalb der nationalen Gesundheitssysteme eine umfassende Versorgung ermoglichen. Die ARIA-Initiative entwickelt international gultige Leitlinien fur allergische Atemwegserkrankungen. ARIA dient der verbesserten Versorgung von Patienten mit Allergien und chronischen Atemwegserkrankungen. In Zusammenarbeit mit anderen internationalen Initiativen, nationalen Fachgesellschaften und Patientenorganisationen im Bereich Allergien und Atemwegserkrankungen wurde eine realitatsnahe, integrative Versorgungsleitlinie („integrated care pathways“, ICPs) fur eine digital unterstutzte, integrative, individualisierte Behandlung von allergischer Rhinitis (AR) mit komorbidem Asthma entwickelt, die in der vorliegenden Arbeit auf das deutsche Gesundheitssystem ubertragen wird. Die vorliegende ICP-Versorgungsleitlinie umfasst wesentliche Bereiche der Versorgung von Patienten mit AR mit und ohne Asthma einschlieslich der Sicht von Patienten und weiterer versorgungsnaher Gesundheitsdienstleister. Eine umfassende ICP-Leitlinie kann die Versorgungsrealitat wesentlich besser abbilden als herkommliche Leitlinienmodelle.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is one of the most frequent chronic diseases during childhood, and the prevalence of the disease is still rising in western societies. Based on recent progress in the understanding of asthma, it seems most likely that immunological alterations important for the development of the disease take place during the very first years of life. Thus, it seems reasonable that any intervention aiming to prevent asthma or to alter its progress, should start during this vulnerable phase in a child's development. Paediatricians specialized in pulmology and allergology are needed to care for these very young patients. From early on, prevention measurements and guidance for parents of children who are at high risk to develop asthma are of great importance. Pediatrics specially trained in diagnosis and therapy of childhood asthma are necessary to provide a concept of asthma treatment, taking special issues of childhood development and growth into account. Furthermore, asthma training and counselling specially tailored for children must be provided to increase understanding of the disease by patients and their families and to address problems of social development in children affected by asthma.",

Objective findings include a restrictive ventilation pattern and a marked hypoxemia on exertion. Radiographic findings suggest ground glass-like attenuations and acinar/interstitial infiltrates (with tree in bud phenomena) in cases 1, 2 and 4, whereas case 3 does not show these characteristics. The history in regard to allergic events is at first uneventful in cases 1 - 3, only case 4 presents with the clinical suspicion of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. BAL cytology shows marked lymphocytosis in all cases, the CD4/CD8 ratio is lowered in 3 ofthe 4 patients. Serologic studies are conclusive first only in case 4. In cases 1 - 2, additional tests display also marked IgG antibodies against goose and duck feathers. Diagnosis is ascertained by repeated histories with more details on living and working habits, especially when using feather beddings. Avoiding the feathers results in a complete remission of the symptoms in all cases.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophil granulocytes play an important role in inflammation of the nasal mucosa. The eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) is a specific eosinophil granule protein. It is released upon activation of these cells. ECP concentration in nasal secretions has been demonstrated to be a good marker for the activity of eosinophilic nasal mucosal inflammation in patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis. However, the natural course of ECP concentration in nasal secretions under natural allergen exposure has never been investigated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the course of ECP concentration in nasal secretions under natural allergen exposure. We investigated the natural course of ECP levels in nasal secretions of 179 patients with grass or birch pollen-allergic rhinitis at the beginning, during and after (111 patients) the pollen season. Within the first 2 weeks of the season, we noted a significant increase in the ECP concentration and this concentration continued to increase significantly throughout the rest of the season. In contrast, symptom scores significantly increased within the first 3 days of the season without any further significant increase thereafter. Post-seasonally, ECP concentrations decreased significantly within 4 weeks. In conclusion, our investigation provides information about the natural course of ECP in nasal secretions of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis suggesting that ECP levels reflect the late phase of allergic reaction and confirming other studies which recommend using ECP levels in nasal secretions for monitoring disease activity or therapy control in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "The perinatal period is assumed to be of special relevance for allergy manifestation. The presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) reactivity to various allergens in neonatal blood in both atopic and non-atopic individuals has been demonstrated by several investigators. These findings were reported from around 20th week of gestation, indicating intrauterine exposure to allergens with subsequent development of memory function. Allergen exposure in utero has been shown to occur both via transfer of allergens in the amniotic fluid and via transfer across placental tissue. By analyzing factors influencing cord blood, cellular reactivity to allergens, maternal smoking and parental atopy were defined as individual risk factors, both of which are also individual risk factors for the development of asthma and allergic diseases. Animal models in mice have shown that the offspring can be actively primed by sensitizing the mother. Offsprings of a sensitized mother mount an enhanced cellular antigen-specific reactivity after postnatal antigen challenge. Furthermore, maternal sensitization to an allergen A primed the offspring to mount a more pronounced reactivity to a new allergen B. Such observations could not be demonstrated in humans, thus questioning a common mechanism in mice and humans leading to a prenatal allergen immunity. Recent data show that perinatally applied measures, such as exposure to infectious agents (endotoxins), exposure to some probiotic strains and nutritional factors may prevent primary allergic disease development. It is too early to recommend specific strategies, but further studies on that research area should be encouraged.",

A total of 123 compost workers from 42 composting plants and 48 control subjects were examined in 1996/1997 and 2001. The compost workers suffered more frequently from complaints of the conjunctivae and the upper airways compared to the control subjects. The forced vital capacity of the compost workers decreased significantly during the follow-up. Three suspected cases of occupational diseases were observed. Compared with control subjects, levels of specific IgG antibodies of the compost workers were significantly higher at both times of examination; for the actinomycetes, a significant decrease was observed in the compost workers within the 5 years of follow-up. A significant association of the course of specific IgG antibodies with the health complaints or the decrease of forced vital capacity was not observed.",

A previous atypical pneumonia had taken a prolonged course in spite of antibiotic therapy. Main symptoms were tachypnea, cyanosis and inspiratory crackles. The chest X-ray showed interstitial pneumonia, and lung function testing showed a severe hypoxemia and a reduced diffusing capacity. In the bronchoalvealar lavage, performed within the first 24 hours after exacerbation, an neutrophilic alveolitis was found. The CT thorax showed a diffuse groundglass shadow with partial fibrotic changes. Serologically, specific IgG against moulds were found, particularly against Aspergillus fumigatus. Although the patient showed the clinical findings of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and serological evidence sensitization against Aspergilli, there was no visible mould infestation in the patient's environment. The diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the hidden causative allergen, could be confirmed when measurements in the patient's environment revealed a hidden focus of Aspergillus fumigatus.",

    "abstract": "If the physician or dentist before injection of a local anesthetic (LA) hears from the patient, then medical treatment is done either without LA, in general anesthesia, or not at all. Therefore, after an adverse reaction, should not be certified uncritically but carefully examined in a stepwise diagnostic work-up. Up to the proof of the opposite, the suspicion of a humoral or cellular-mediated allergy exists apart from psychovegetative reactions and pharmakologic side effects (toxicity and intolerance reactions/pseudoallergy). In 201 patients we evaluated the diagnostic work-up and the results of a later LA injection. The diagnostic work-up demonstrated that in 99% of all patients either pharmakologic side effects or psychovegetative reactions were responsible for the symptoms. Only in 2 patients objective symptoms were seen, which possibly correspond to IgG- or cell-mediated allergic late-type reactions. In view of the fact that only 15% of the patients had again subjective symptoms after LA injection, the complex diagnostic procedure seems to be justified. A safe LA injection in the medical everyday practice can be ensured by a tolerated subcutaneous provocation test. The provocation test demonstrates the compatibility of the LA to the patient and contributes to the reduction of fear. It is important to convince patients that the symptoms can result alone from fear and stress and that an allergy is not present. Therefore, the value of skin tests and provocation tests lies mainly to place the patients with psychovegetative symptoms and the treating physicians in security before renewed application of LA.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Eosinophils and their granule proteins, e.g. ECP, are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases such as allergic rhinitis. Methods: Forty-one bakers were diagnosedfor job-related allergic rhinitis. We measured ECP in nasal lavages (n = 38 bakers) obtained before and after nasal provocation with aqueous solution of flours from the bakers' workeplace. Serum ECP (n = 39) and blood eosinophils (n = 41) were determined 5 hours after provocation. Nasal lavages were performed before, 1 h (n = 11) and 5 h (n = 27) after provocation. Results: For 11 nasal lavages ECP was averaged 3.4 μg/l before provocation and 4.4 μg/l 1 h after provocation. For 27 nasal lavages ECP was averaged 8.3 μg/l before provocation and 15 μg/5 h after provocation. In total there was an increase by 0.3 to 10-fold in 14 nasal lavages after provocation. The increase in ECP level was more determined 5h after provocation than 1 h later. In comparison to healthy controls, serum ECP and blood eosinophils were increased in bakers: 32.47 μg/l vs. 8.16 μg/l (n = 11) and 225 × 10 6 cells/l vs. 64 × 10 6 cells/l (n = 15) (both statistical significant vs. controls). Discussion: In nasal lavages from bakers with job-related allergic rhinitis, eosinophil ECP could be measured. An increase in ECP after provocation could be measured in the late phase of the allergic reaction and could be used as additional diagnostic parameter under definite circumstances. For serum ECP there is a good correlation to the degree of allergic airway disease with or without bronchial involvement. Conclusion: Serum ECP and blood eosinophils could be used as good additional parameter for diagnosis of allergic airway disease and as a predictive parameter concerning bronchial involvement in bakers, lavage ECP might be useful under definite circumstances.",

The knowledge about the roles of different cell types in allergic skin reactions has been considerably grown during the last years. This review describes functions both of keratinocytes, dermal endothelial cells and antigen-presenting cells of the skin and of skin-infiltrating T-lymphocytes. A focus is laid on skin-infiltrating T-cells since allergic eczematous skin diseases are associated with an infiltration of this cell type into the inflamed organ. The work also contains some thoughts about futural perspectives in the treatment of allergic skin diseases using immunomodulatory principles.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is an eosinophil differentiation factor. Therefore, increased levels of IL-5 in the bone marrow is associated with increased eosinophil numbers in blood. In addition, IL-5 increases the sensitivity ofeosinophils towards other stimuli and delays their cell death. In contrast to other cytokines, IL-5 acts on a limited number of cells only. In fact, high-affinity IL-5 receptors are exclusively expressed by eosinophils and basophils, but no other human cells. Therefore, neutralization of IL-5 appears to be an obvious approach to treat eosinophilic disorders, since no major side effects due to effects on other cells are expected. Results from animal experiments suggested that anti-IL-5 antibodies may have anti-asthmatic activities. In this article, I summarize our current knowledge regarding anti-IL-5 therapy and speculate on the potential use of these drugs in the future.",

    "abstract": "Allergic illnesses are an ever-increasing problem, not only for those affected, but also for the health care system. Correct diagnosis and the early initiation of an individually tailored therapy, taking into account the intensity of the illness, is critical if one wants to avoid later complications. The European Guidelines for drug therapy of allergic rhinitis have recently been published. An international consensus conference on the treatment of allergic rhinitis in childhood was also held. A new common international basis for the appropriate treatment of children was thereby created. Within the stepwise therapy of allergic rhinitis, the local nasal antihistaminic agents, such as Dimethindene maleate, have a growing importance. In the work at hand, pharmacological and clinical data about Dimethindene maleate nasal spray (umbrella brand: Fenistil), an H 1 -antihistamine without preservatives, will be presented. Data is available from preclinical investigations and 4 prospective clinical studies. The clinical investigations were performed mainly in a cross-over design to reduce interindividual variability. In conclusion a significant and relevant superiority is seen compared to placebo. For use in children a considerable clinical multicentre study in children was also performed, which attests to the fact that the efficacy of the Dimethindene maleate nasal spray is equivalent to that of levocabastine. The studies documented a good tolerability. Due to the local application of the active substance, systemic body effects can be reduced so that no systemic side effects like e.g. sedation occur. With Dimethindene maleate nasal spray the physician and the patient have access to an antiallergy product, that can be individually dosed and has a wide therapeutic range.",

Objective: To evaluate seasonal effects of the in-vitro CysLT release. Population and methods: Blood samples were taken monthly from 9 children and young adults (7 - 18 years; 3 without allergic sensitization, 2 with sensitization to house dust mite and 4 with grasspollen sensitization) from February to June. Leukocytes were separated using Dextran sedimentation and stimulated either with medium alone (negative control), or with an Anti-IgE-receptor-antibody (Anti-IgE-rAK; 0.5 μg/mL; positive control) or with grass-pollen allergen (Six-Gras-MIX, GX1, 20 ng/ml). The CysLT release (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) was quantified using ELISA technique (CAST-ELISA, Buhlmann Laboratory AG, Schonenbuch, Switzerland). Results: After stimulation with Anti-IgE-rAK in-vitro CysLT-production increased from March (range: 1163 und 6187 pg/ml) to May (range: 2048 and 7620 pg/ml; median increase 63%; range: 35% -114%; p = 0.012). In response to grasspollen allergen we observed a similar increase from March (158 und 208 pg/ml) to May (337 und 7057 pg/ml; median increase 49.9%; range: 38 - 133%; p = 0.004). The median in-vitro CysLT-concentrations after stimulation with grasspollen was 6137 pg/ml (range: 4249-7620) in grass-pollen sensitized persons and 2130 pg/ml (2048 - 5421) in persons, who are not allergic to grasspollen. Conclusion: We observed a significant higher in-vitro CysLT production in May compared to March. Seasonal effects of the CysLT release must be considered performing longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Urticaria is caused by a release of many inflammatory mediators of bone marrow-derived mast cells and basophils. The release is modulated by different histamine-releasing factors, which result in a network of interactionsbetween many different cells. Following examples for interactions between the skin and systemic reactions which play a role in the precipitation of different forms of urticaria are presented: histological differences between the experimentel hive and erythema induced by histamine and the signs and symptoms of urticaria; examples of relationships between urticaria and autoimmune diseases; autoimmune urticaria; allergic reactions leading to acute urticaria and anaphylaxis; latex allergy. Latex allergy is an example in which the sensitization is caused by transdermal absorption and may lead afterwards to food allergy as a result of cross reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic polypous sinusitis often shows a marked eosinophilic tissue infiltration. Although this fact is well investigated, the reason for this selective eosinophilic infiltration is still not understood. Till now RANTES, MCP-4 and eotaxin have been isolated in nasal tissue, which have a structural and functional relationship with a recently discovered new CC-chemokine, called eotaxin-3. Aim of this study was to investigate whether the respiratory mucosa is able to express eotaxin-3-mRNA. Fibroblasts from nasal turbinates and epithelial cells from the bronchial epithelial tumor cell-line A 549 were cultivated. Cells were stimulated with various concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-4 for different time periods. Total RNA of these cells was isolated, reverse transcribed and amplified with eotaxin-3-specific primers in SQRT-PCR. The eotaxin-3-mRNA gene expression was evaluated by densitometric analysis. We found a dose- and time-dependent expression of eotaxin-3 after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. IL-4 showed the strongest effect. Conclusively nasal fibroblasts and respiratory epithelial cells may be a possible source for eotaxin-3-expression. Our findings suggests a possible role of eotaxin-3 in the eosinophilic tissue infiltration process for chronic polypous sinusitis.",

Apart from an increase of infectious illnesses there are also hints to effects on allergies and asthma. The current study investigates such effects in central Europe in case of Switzerland as an alpine region. From the climate point of view an increase of the air temperature is most prominent. This factor supports in its consequences the production and distribution of pollen and hence may explain the observed increase of allergies. This observation allows to understand the known increase of allergies without taking into account the genetic disposition or human behaviour as known critical factors. The IPCC report indicates that a further increase of allergies has to be expected in the coming centuries.",

    "abstract": "- Spores of the basidiomycete Pleurotus pulmonarius a species of the oyster mushrooms are widespread components in the air and established as causes of respiratory allergies. Recent reports indicate that aeroallergens such as mite allergens, pollen or animal dander may play an important role triggering atopic eczema in a subgroup of subjects with atopic dermatitis. The aim of the study was to investigate whether spores of P. pulmonarius may elicit delayed-type skin reactions in atopic subjects particularly in those with an atopic dermatitis. Sixty-five study subjects were categorized prospectively in 4 groups having atopic dermatitis or respiratory allergy with regard to the skin prick test reactivity to P. pulmonarius spore extract. Twenty nonatopic individuals served as control subjects. Atopy patch test performed with P. pulmonarius spore extract at a concentration of 1.35 mg protein per gram of petrolatum were evaluated after 48 and 72 hours. Of the subjects with atopic dermatitis, 12 of 37 (32%) showed a positive atopy patch test reaction with 7/13 (54%) also having a positive skin prick test response to the P. pulmonarius spore extract. In the study group with respiratory allergy and positive skin prick test to the Pleurotus extract 1 subject with a well-known asthma had a positive atopy patch test. No positive test reaction was observed in the nonatopic control subjects or in subjects with respiratory allergy but negative skin prick test responses to the P. pulmonarius spore extract. Our results demonstrate that spores of the oyster mushroom P. pulmonarius can induce delayed-type reactions consistent with an acute eczema in atopic individuals, particularly in those with atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, it could be shown that individuals with an air-exposed pattern of the atopic dermatitis were most reactive to the atopy patch tests with these spore extract.",

    "abstract": "Allergic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is possibly underestimated regarding its frequency in untreated status recurrent disease of the stomach or intestine, that has to be considered in patients with unclear abdominal complaints. The illness is defined as immunologically mediated hypersensitivity reaction against exogenous antigens such as food antigens. In addition, other antigens such as pollen etc. should be considered as etiologic factors. Food intolerances without immunological background (e.g. malfermentation, enzyme deficiencies) and other gastro-enterologic diseases (e. g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis) have to be ruled out. There are no laboratory parameters, which permit such a discrimination between gastrointestinal allergy and intolerance. Therefore, on the one hand the patients' history, on the other hand a global exclusion diagnostics is essential for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Classical allergologic tests (Prick, RAST/CAP etc.) have high false negative as well as false positive rates. The ,,golden standard for the verification of food allergies is the double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC). However, the significance of this approach is limited in case of gastrointestinal complaints, because validated methods to assess the induced symptoms are lacking. New test procedures such as local endoscopic provocation in the intestinal mucosa are tested at present. First line therapy is the elimination diet. Medical therapy is only necessary if the elimination diet fails to relief from symptoms. Other new therapeutic approaches (oral desensitization, probiotics etc.) are currently under investigation. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and an improvement of the diagnostic means should allow a more accurate assessment of the clinical significance of gastrointestinal allergies, which is of particular importance for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other GI diseases of unclear etiology that may be related to allergy.",

Furthermore, the German speaking literature from the first half of the 20th century is underrepresented. Methods: Therefore, we investigated ancient greek and roman literature as well as german literature from the period 1900 until 1950. Also, reviews listed in Medline were considered. Results: In ancient times, Hippokrates, Galen, Celsus and Pliny the Older mentioned untoward effects of dust on the skin and on the mucous membranes. In the german speaking literature from the first half of the 20th century, there was a discussion whether dust allergens could be a relevant provocation factor of atopic dermatitis. However, the interest into this topic diminished in the following years. But in the 1960s, with the discovery of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus as major allergenic house dust mite, researchers began again to investigate the indoor environment as triggering factor of asthma. With respect to atopic dermatitis, the first description of the atopy patch test in 1982 renewed the interest in dust mites as pathogenetically relevant factor for the skin manifestation of atopy. Conclusion: Dust is known for hundreds of years as provocation factor of skin and respiratory disease. However, the interest into this topic varied with time.",

    "abstract": "Although environmental medicine has been established in Germany about 10 years ago, only a few systematic studies on the quality assessment of outdoor consultation services in this field have been published. Therefore, a quality survey was conducted in 68 patients of the outpatient Unit of Environmental Medicine (UEM) at the University Hospital of Aachen. Patients were invited by mail to take part in the study. A standardized phone interview was performed. Afterwards, the following validated psychometric questionnaires were posted to the patients: Fragebogen zur Erfassung der Aufmerksamkeit (FEDA), Body Sensation Index (BSI) as short version of the Symptom Checklist 90 - Items revised, and Screening fur somatoforme Storungen (SOMS-7T). Sixty-three of 68 patients could be reached by mail, of these, 61 (97%) participated in the phone interview. Of all eligible patients, 56(92%) were willing to fill in the psychometric questionnaires which they already knew from their first consultation. Although 89%) of all interviewed patients felt that their health problems were understood by the physician, 21% reported a benefit from the clinical examinations and 18% judged their health status to have improved. Of all patients interviewed, 48% accepted the final diagnosis, but 59% proceeded in consulting other physicians for further aid. Nevertheless, 79% of the interviewees would recommend the UEM. It is concluded that patients with environment-related disorders have expectations in diagnosis and therapy which environmental medicine cannot meet yet.

    "abstract": "Allergies to rubber parts, especially to natural rubber latex gloves, are a widespread phenomenon and are frequently described in the literature. The presented investigation is based on 6 NR latex gloves and reveals a whole string of extractable rubber chemicals which can irritate the human skin when these gloves are used. On the one hand conventional qualitative and quantitative methods for the analysis ofrubber chemicals present in the gloves via methanol extraction followed by HPLC were applied. On the other hand special emphasis was layed on the question, how much of these chemicals can be absorbed by human skin in ordinary use of gloves. This includes also possible chemical reactions in the presence of sweat and the influence of a hand disinfectant which is commonly used e.g. in hospitals. Various approaches were investigated for the laboratory simulation of a hand wearing a glove. As a result, it could be shown that the desinfectant increases the concentration of irritating chemicals and components were able to permeate through the elastomer. The extraction of zincdimethyldithio-carbamate (ZDMC) and mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) was monitored as a function of time, temperature and pH value similar to a BGA method. In addition, a rough estimation of the quantities of these chemicals, which can permeate to the skin while wearing the gloves, was done. For ZDMC an exposition of 0,7 mg, for MBT of 2 mg per hand and day was found. The combination of sweat and extractable chemicals can obviously produce chemicals as for example tetramethylthiuramedisulfide (TMTD). This hazardous substance could be detected in small amounts although the methanol extract was apparently free of TMTD. A profound toxicological evaluation of the indicated compounds is not part of this paper. The investigation also shows that it is possible to produce rubber gloves which are approximately free of polar and thus water soluble pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Immunological alterations are discussed as potential pathomechanisms for multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) based on the systemic nature of the symptoms, known complex interactions between the immune system and other organ systems, as well as empirical evidence. However, there are theoretical reservations on immunologic mechanisms in MCS and methodological constraints on human trials. Aim of this paper is a critical presentation of immunological concepts of MCS and resulting future research. Clinical manifestations of allergy, pseudoallergy and MCS are discussed as similar, closely related disorders where environmental exposure causes inflammation. In the case of allergy, foreign proteins bind to IgE on mast cells, which release inflammatory mediators. In pseudoallergy, initiating substances directly induce liberation of inflammatory mediators without involvement of antibodies. For MCS, low molecular weight chemicals may bind to chemoreceptors on sensory nerve fibers to release inflammatory mediators. Some proponents of these theories hold that this variable pattern can be attributed to various factors, including total body burden, adaptation and biochemical individuality. Both allergic and chemical irritant responses may be subjected to conditioning, so that the response may be triggered by other stimuli. However, the lack of consistency in response patterns both between and within individual MCS patients limits the plausibility of this hypothesis. Therefore, no consistent pattern of immune dysfunction can be identified in MCS patients. It is recommended that clinical evaluation never be based on results of isolated in vitro assessment of quantity and function of immune system cellular components without considering all variables which apply to all different assays and without knowing the patient's complete history and physical examination.",

    "abstract": "Mit den Biologika stehen zunehmend mehr Therapeutika zur Verfugung, die zielgerichtet bestimmte Schaltstellen im Pathomechanismus immunologisch dominierter Erkrankungen adressieren Damit steht mehr die individuelle Krankheitsauspragung des einzelnen Patienten im Fokus der Diagnostik und Therapie (Prazisionsmedizin) Bezuglich der unterschiedlichen Phanotypen atopischer Erkrankungen war das schwere Asthma die erste Entitat, fur die Biologika zugelassen wurde, gefolgt von Urtikaria, und schlieslich der atopischen Dermatitis und der chronischen Rhinosinusitis mit nasalen Polypen Die Erfahrungen in der Therapie des schweren Asthma bronchiale machten deutlich, dass die Intensitat des Ansprechens auf eine Biologikatherapie entscheidend von der Qualitat der klinischen und immunologischen Phanotypisierung der Patienten abhangt, wobei diese Unterscheidung z T schwierig sein kann und sich verschiedene Phanotypen durchaus uberlagern konnen Das gilt auch fur unterschiedliche Erkrankungen des atopischen Formenkreises, da Patienten in jeweils entsprechend unterschiedlicher Auspragung unter mehreren atopischen Krankheiten gleichzeitig leiden konnen Es bilden sich bereits Biologika heraus, die eine geeignete Therapie fur das allergische Asthma bronchiale, das haufig gemeinsam mit einer schweren Neurodermitis auftritt, sowie die chronische Rhinosinusitis mit nasalen Polypen darstellen konnen In der Praxis stellt sich dennoch zunehmend die Frage nach moglichen Biologika-Kombinationen zur Therapie komplexer Krankheitsbilder einzelner Patienten Dabei gilt es, das Nebenwirkungsprofil zu beachten, zu denen auch Hypersensitivitatsreaktionen gehoren, deren diagnostisches und logistisches Management eine sichere und effiziente Therapie der Grunderkrankung zum Ziel haben muss Erhohte Aufmerksamkeit gilt auch fur eine Biologikatherapie bei Schwangerschaften und geplanten (planbaren) Impfungen sowie bestehenden Infektionen, wie zum Beispiel die SARS-CoV-2-Infektion Vor dem Start einer Biologikatherapie sollten der Immunstatus in Bezug auf chronische Virusund bakterielle Infektionen gepruft und gegebenenfalls vor Therapieeinleitung der Impfstatus aufgefrischt bzw fehlende Impfungen nachgeholt werden Derzeit liegen verlassliche Daten zum Effekt von Biologika auf die immunologische Situation der SARS-CoV-2-Infektion und COVID-19 nicht vor Daher ist die Erforschung und Entwicklung geeigneter Diagnostikverfahren zur Erfassung immunologisch bedingter Nebenwirkungen sowie der Erfassung potenzieller Therapie-Responder und -Non-Responder von groser BedeutungAlternate abstract:With the advent of biologicals, more and more therapeutics are available that specifically address specific switch points in the pathomechanism of immunologically dominated diseases Thus, the focus of diagnostics and therapy (precision medicine) is more on the individual disease characteristics of the individual patient Regarding the different phenotypes of atopic diseases, severe asthma was the first entity for which biologicals were approved, followed by urticaria, and finally atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps Experience in the treatment of severe bronchial asthma has shown that the intensity of the response to biological therapy depends on the quality of clinical and immunological phenotyping of the patients This also applies to different diseases of the atopic form, as patients can suffer from several atopic diseases at the same time, each with different characteristics Biologics are already emerging that may represent a suitable therapy for allergic bronchial asthma, which often occurs together with severe neurodermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps In practice, however, the question of possible combinations of biologicals for the therapy of complex clinical pictures of individual patients is increasingly arising In doing so, the side effect profile must be taken into account, including hypersensitivity reactions, whose diagnostic and logistical management must aim at a safe and e ficient therapy of the underlying disease Increased attention must also be paid to biological therapy in pregnancy and planned (predictable) vaccinations as well as existing infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection Before starting a biological therapy, the immune status should be checked with regard to chronic viral and bacterial infections and, if necessary, the vaccination status should be refreshed or missing vaccinations should be made up for before starting therapy Currently, reliable data on the effect of biologicals on the immunological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 are not available Therefore, research and development of suitable diagnostic methods for detection of immunologically caused side effects as well as detection of potential therapy responders and non-responders is of great importance",

    "abstract": "Background: Vaccinations against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are intended to induce an immune response in the sense of protection against infection/disease. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is also thought to induce a (different) immune response in the sense of tolerance to allergens. There is uncertainty among patients and physicians regarding the use of vaccination and AIT in temporal relation, which this position paper aims to clarify. The four vaccines currently approved in Germany for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are described and possible immunological interactions with AIT are highlighted, as well as practical recommendations for action. Methods: Based on the current internationally published literature, this position paper provides specific recommendations for action regarding the use of AIT in temporal relation to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Results: The present recommendations for action relate to the following conditions for which AIT is used i) allergic rhinitis, ii) allergic bronchial asthma, iii) insect venom allergy, iiii) food allergy (peanut). Conclusions: If vaccination is imminent, initiation of subcutaneous (SCIT), sublingual (SLIT), or oral (OIT) AIT should be delayed until 1 week after the 2nd vaccination date. Thus, there should generally be an interval of approximately 1 week between SCIT and COVID-19 vaccination. For the continuation of an ongoing AIT, we recommend an interval of 1 week before and after vaccination for SCIT. For SLIT and OIT, we recommend taking them up to the day before vaccination and taking a break from SLIT and OIT for 2 – 7 days after vaccination.",

Da die Entzündung durch das Allergen verursacht wird, stellen Allergenkarenz und Elimination die eigentliche Kausaltherapie dar. Ihr Erfolg wird entscheidend von der Art des vorliegenden Allergens bestimmt. Grundprinzipien der Allergenkarenz sind die Primär-, Sekundär- und Tertiärprävention. Primärprävention: Elimination potentieller Allergene zur Verhinderung einer Sensibilisierung. Sekundärprävention: Meiden der Allergenexposition bei vorhandener Sensibilisierung zur Verhinderung des Krankheitsausbruchs. Tertiärprävention: Allergenkarenz bei manifester allergischer Erkrankung zur Verhinderung des Fortschreitens.",

    "abstract": "Die Entwicklung und der Einsatz neuer Techniken in der Zellbiologie, Immunologie und Genetik hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten zu einer erheblichen Kenntniszunahme geführt, die jetzt in einem besseren Verständnis der zellulären und molekularen Mechanismen immunologischer Erkrankungen ihren Niederschlag findet. Die Anwendung dieser Erkenntnisse auf die Erkrankung des atopischen Formenkreises führen zu einem besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Prozesse, die im Rahmen der Sensibilisierung und der Ausbildung der akuten und chronischen Entzündungsreaktionen ablaufen. Auch die Mechanismen der Früh- und Spätphase der Typ-I-Reaktionen sind heute zu einem großen Teil entschlüsselt. Das folgende Kapitel soll einen Überblick über die wichtigsten Mitspieler in diesem komplexen und dynamischen Geflecht geben. In den Folgeabschnitten werden die wichtigsten Einzelkomponenten im Detail charakterisiert.",
