    "abstract": "This article traces multiple directions in the evolution of agroecology, from its early emphasis on ecological processes in agricultural systems, to its emergence as a multidimensional approach focusing on broader agro-food systems. This review is timely, as agroecology is being increasingly applied within a diversity of scientific-, policy-, and farmer-based initiatives. We contrast different agroecological perspectives or \"agroecologies\" and discuss the characteristics of an agroecology characterized by a transdisciplinary, participatory and action-oriented approach. Our final discussion describes the contents of the special issue, and states our goal for this compilation, which is to encourage future work that embraces an agroecological approach grounded in transdisciplinarity, participation, and transformative action.",

    "abstract": "Agroecology as a transformative movement has gained momentum in many countries worldwide. In several cases, the implementation of agroecological practices has grown beyond isolated, local experiences to be employed by ever-greater numbers of families and communities over ever-larger territories and to engage more people in the processing, distribution, and consumption of agroecologically produced food. To understand the nonlinear, multidimensional processes that have enabled and impelled the bringing to scale of agroecology, we review and analyze emblematic cases that include the farmer-to-farmer movement in Central America; the national peasant agroecology movement in Cuba; the organic coffee boom in Chiapas, Mexico; the spread of Zero Budget Natural Farming in Karnataka, India; and the agroecological farmer–consumer marketing network \"Rede Ecovida,\" in Brazil. On the basis of our analysis, we identify eight key drivers of the process of taking agroecology to scale: (1) recognition of a crisis that motivates the search for alternatives, (2) social organization, (3) constructivist learning processes, (4) effective agroecological practices, (5) mobilizing discourses, (6) external allies, (7) favorable markets, and (8) favorable policies. This initial analysis shows that organization and social fabric are the growth media on which agroecology advances, with the help of the other drivers. A more detailed understanding is needed on how these multiple dimensions interact with, reinforce, and generate positive feedback with each other to make agroecology's territorial expansion possible.",

Their integration has provided a collective-action mode for contesting the dominant agro-food regime and creating alternatives, especially through a linkage with food sovereignty. At the same time, agroecology has been recently adopted by some actors who also promote conventional agriculture. Agroecology can play different roles—either conforming to the dominant regime, or else helping to transform it—contingent on specific empowerment strategies. Tensions between \"conform versus transform\" roles can be identified in European agroecological research, especially in three areas: farm-level agroecosystems development; participatory plant breeding; and short food-supply chains remunerating agroecological methods. To play a transformative role, collaborative strategies need to go beyond the linear stereotype whereby scientists \"transfer\" technology or farmers \"apply\" scientific research results. To the extent that farmer–scientist alliances co-create and exchange knowledge, such gains can transform the research system.",

If agroecology has such great potential to feeding the world, why it is not adopted more widely by farmers? Most research analyzing factors needed for scaling up agroecology focuses on the social and policy dimensions. Herein we argue that a key challenge for the amplification of agroecology lies in the translation of agroecological principles into practical strategies for soil, water, and biodiversity management to enhance production and resilience. We use old and recent case studies to understand how amplification of agroecology has happened, both in numbers of farmers and at a larger geographical scale. We focus on two main strategies that have proven effective in the past: (a) the revival of traditional agricultural systems which offer promising models of sustainability and resilience and (b) the creation of “agroecological lighthouses” from which principles radiate out to local communities, helping them to build the basis of an agricultural strategy that promotes efficiency, diversity, synergy, and resiliency. Such agroecological strategies must be complemented by policies and solidarity market arrangements to provide economic viability to the amplification of agroecology.",

    "abstract": "Soil health practices—such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and conservation tillage—provide synergistic environmental and economic benefits, both on and beyond the farms that utilize them. Given these benefits, researchers are puzzled by the persistent adoption gap for these practices. This narrative review synthesizes the insights of the soil health practices adoption literature, with a focus on U.S. commodity agriculture. While farms, farmers, and farm communities are too heterogeneous to represent with a single model, this review finds five emergent themes: 1) differences in perspective along the adoption continuum; 2) interaction among soil health practices; 3) qualitatively different pathways to incremental and transformative change; 4) noneconomic farmer motives; and 5) the key role of larger farm and food system context. This study finds rational actor models inadequate to explain farmer decision making, suggesting that researchers would do well to utilize interpretive frames that elucidate interactions among groups of people and take account of multiple forms of capital. Reviewing recommendations for increasing the adoption of soil health practices, this study finds that a complementary approach—combining education, research, policy, measures to overcome equipment barriers, and efforts to address farm and food system context—holds the most promise.",

For this, it is imperative to consider not only quantitative production issues, but also environmental issues such as water pollution, biodiversity loss, and land degradation as well as social and economic issues such as organization of supply chains and communication and coordination among stakeholders. However, the development of sustainable agricultural and food systems is so far almost exclusively proposed either at the scale of specific agricultural systems or for selected supply chains. Still strongly neglected is the development of sustainable systems at a territorial scale. We, therefore, present here the concept of agroecology territories. We define agroecology territories as places where a transition process toward sustainable agriculture and food systems is engaged. Three major domains must to be considered for the transition to take place: adaptation of agricultural practices; conservation of biodiversity and natural resources; and development of embedded food systems. Stakeholder group strategies, developed by those who actively engage in these three domains and are themselves actors in the transition, are integral to agroecology territories.",

The PMAR of the mulches did not differ between high tunnel and open field systems at any location, and PMAR of cellulose mulch was 0% within 12 months but >90% for experimental spunbond at 24 months. The PMAR of the two starch-based products did vary by location and was lowest at Lubbock (˜2%) compared to Knoxville (49%) or Mount Vernon (89%). Relative to the other two locations, Lubbock had the greatest soil diurnal temperature range, maximum daily soil temperature, an alkaline soil pH, and a microbial community structure characterized by a relatively high abundance of fungi. Mulch type and geographic location exerted a greater influence on PMAR than did production system, and abiotic and biotic variables influenced degradation.",

This article also looks at how these relate both to the evolving ways in which farmers are informed and learn, and to the role of the technical agricultural advisory services. Our methodology for analyzing the trajectories of 50 field crop farmers from two French field crop study areas combined an agronomical and a sociological approach, and applied a common framework to classify the strategies of change in practices. Our findings show that farmers' trajectories are mostly a series of changes that are the result of a mix of various technical practices, and of ongoing adjustments to the political, social, and economic context. The transition toward more sustainable practices requires the use of a variety of sources of information, and a diversification of the ways of learning. Some implications of the progressiveness of the processes of change for agricultural policies, for agronomists and for advisory services, are highlighted.",

Agribio is a grain cooperative, and Les Grosses Légumes is a network of consumers, farmers, and the members of an association set up to organize the production and distribution of vegetable boxes. Semi-directed interviews of the various actors linked to these organizations were conducted and then analyzed through an approach inspired by the convention theory in order to reveal the principles that the stakeholders have adopted. The main findings are then made explicit by analysis of four strong agreements (which concern the two organizations' marketing schemes, a Participatory Guarantee System set up by Les Grosses Légumes and Agribio's flour mill). The two case studies show the gap that exists between the principles that describe the horizon of agroecology and the principles that are actually put into practice by the parties in the field through various transition pathways.",

Building on complexity and incorporating greater systems integration, 6. Contextuality, 7. Equity and, 8. Nourishment.

Agroecological food systems are widely diverse, shaped by context, and achieved through multi-actor planning in rural, peri-urban and urban areas. Application of agroecological food systems in rural–urban contexts emphasize the necessity of diversification, zoning rural–urban landscapes, planning for seasonality in a food systems context, and producing at scale. Rural–urban food systems are a relevant and challenging entry point that provides opportunities for learning how food systems can be shaped for significant positive change. Social organization, community building, common learning, and knowledge creation are crucial for agroecological contextualized food systems, as are the supports from appropriate governing and institutional structures.",

We focus this literature review on farm management strategies that tighten nutrient cycles and maintain yields. We examined six metrics for efficient nutrient cycling in agroecosystems: reduced runoff and erosion, reduced leaching, improved soil carbon storage, enhanced microbial biomass, low greenhouse gas emissions, improved water holding capacity, and high yields. We evaluated these metrics in six farm management practices: intercrops, agroforestry, cover crops, organic amendments, integrated crop-livestock, and conservation tillage. Agroforestry and cover crops consistently reduced runoff and erosion and improved carbon sequestration compared to conventional systems. Agroforestry was the only practice that consistently reduced nutrient leaching over conventional practices. Organic amendments and conservation tillage improve water holding capacity. There exists uncertainty in the effectiveness of these practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Finally, although agroforestry tends to suppress yields, all of the practices had either a neutral or positive effect on yields. Evaluating cropping systems in terms of multiple services gives us insight into how to match practices to environmental goals, where the uncertainties lie, and where opportunities exist for improved agroecosystem management.",

Through a lexicometric analysis of policy documents from different political actors (civil society, governments, and intergovernmental organizations) which self-claim to promote agroecology, I identify five narratives in the political arena, which put different emphasis on the different dimensions of agroecology and on different scales (from farm to the food system).",

    "abstract": "In this article we use a food sovereignty frame to analyze the role of the State in favoring agroecological scaling, particularly in Cuba and in the Latin American countries that elected leftist governments in the first years of the 21st century and currently face an upsurge of right-wing political forces. As with social movement participation in international governance structures, at the national level social movements face risks when they allow themselves to become absorbed in collaborations with the State in order to build public policy for taking agroecology to scale. By participating in the institutionalization of agroecology, movements become part of the established rules of the game, having to move within limits defined by a system that exists to preserve the interests of the dominant class. On the other hand, by boycotting the arena of governance, agroecological movements allow resurgent political and economic elites to grab land, territories and resources needed for agroecological food systems to ever become a global substitute for industrial agriculture. At the heart of the matter is the political character of agroecology: shall we continue betting on reform, in times of (counter) revolution?",

We contend that agroecology, subjects, and territories are articulated in these processes, making up a powerful dispositive or device for agroecological transformation and scaling up. We also introduce a discussion on the emergence of a historical-political subject, the \"agroecological peasantry,\" within the larger territorial dispute concerning the transformation of the agri-food system and living conditions in the countryside.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, CGIAR researchers have investigated the effectiveness of using agrobiodiversity, and more particularly crop and crop varietal diversity, as an adaptive practice to mitigate climate-change impacts on agriculture and to contribute to rural household and community resilience. The hypothesis informing this research is that the sustained practice of crop diversification leads to ecological redundancy, which allows farmer households and their communities to produce multiple positive livelihood benefits. The validity of this hypothesis is investigated by means of an extensive literature review (covering 2015–2020). Findings reveal ample evidence of positive outcomes, including increased yields and household incomes, improved nutrition and food security, new marketing opportunities, reduced poverty, and strengthened adaptive and innovative capacity. However, the evidence is far less convincing about the last part of the hypothetical impact pathway, i.e. the link between positive livelihood benefits and (increased) resilience. This shortcoming is addressed through the elaboration of a more clearly articulated theory of change for crop diversification and a refined methodology to support farmers in making appropriate diversification decisions. At the same time, the critical review opens a window on an important, novel perspective, which is to look at the role that crop diversification could play in a wider societal transition toward a more sustainable future.",

    "abstract": "Alternative food systems and networks, which have emerged around the world, are often fragmentary, reduced in size and frequently unfold in parallel, hardly linked to each other. Agroecology faces the challenge of scaling up these initiatives to gain size and a significant impact on food production and consumption. Within the agroecological movement, however, diverse conceptions exist of what a sustainable food system should be. It is thus necessary to reach an extensive consensus, from the perspective of agroecology, on the principles guiding the construction of such a system. This paper discusses the principles that would best steer the building of Agroecology-based Local Agri-food Systems (ALAS). To this end, a critical review of the scientific literature on alternative food networks and systems was performed. In so doing, we highlighted the aspects that one could consider as purely agroecological in nature and sought to bring them together to form a coherent proposal. Consequently, the present paper systematizes the main contributions of literature on alternative food networks and systems, taking into account the characteristics of sustainability from an agroecology viewpoint, and identifies the issues requiring further development. Several principles are proposed to define local food systems, based on the four dimensions of sustainability: environmental health, economic viability, social equity and the right to decide what, how and for whom food is produced.",

    "abstract": "Conventional agriculture in the Midwest US lacks diversity, relies heavily on external inputs to maintain crop yields, and contributes to soil and water quality degradation. Using diverse crop rotations and incorporating livestock are promising solutions to these and other problems linked to current cropping systems dominated by maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). To better understand how agricultural diversification comprehensively affects soil health and function, we compared 20 soil health parameters linked to critical soil ecosystem services in 1) a conventional 2-year maize-soybean rotation, and 2) a diverse 4-year maize-soybean-oat (Avena sativa L.)+alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa rotation that periodically received cattle manure. The strongest and most salient improvements in soil health from the diversified, 4-year cropping system included: 8% reduction in soil resistance to root growth (p = .006), 16% increase in cation exchange capacity (p = .001), 157% increase in salt-extractable soil carbon (p = .024), and 62% increase in soil microbial biomass (p = .017). These comprehensive improvements in general soil functioning coincided with enhanced crop yields, reduced requirement for agricultural inputs, and decreased environmental impacts – all while maintaining profitability. Despite declines in cropping system diversity globally, but especially in the Midwest US, these results provide strong evidence for the benefits of diversification.",

Agroecological farming practices, as well as the broader paradigm of agroecology to transform food systems, are considered important solutions to address the challenges and drivers of land degradation. This paper aims to explore the potential of future agroecology transformations in the country as well as institutional factors hindering such transformations. We build on the six domains of transformations by Anderson et al. (2021) and institutional analysis literature, and use soil governance as an example. Building on primary and secondary data, we find that the current institutional landscape in Tunisia is largely disabling of effective soil protection and broader agroecology transformations. The analysis provides insights into formal and informal institutions that can be targeted to build a more enabling environment for agroecology transformations.",

But there is also a larger focus on the social, economic, and political “drivers” that move food systems beyond the conditions that have created un-sustainability in modern industrial agriculture. With its ecosystem foundation, the science of agroecology has become a powerful tool for food system change when coupled with an understanding of how change occurs in society. In this article, I trace the roots of agroecology to its emergence as Agroecologia in Mexico in the 1970s as a form of resistance to the Green Revolution. Agroecology has become much more than a science for developing better, safer, and more environmentally sound food production technologies. Agroecology is more than a way to practice agriculture, such as organic or ecological production.

Despite the growing scholarship on food systems education, there is a paucity of critical perspectives on its pedagogical methods, learning outcomes, and overarching objectives. This article addresses this gap by integrating insights from critical pedagogy, food justice, food sovereignty, and agroecology, developing a new synthetic area of study and research entitled critical food systems education (CFSE). CFSE is composed of a tripartite perspective, consisting of praxis, policy, and pedagogy. This framework is guided by the following overarching question: How can food systems education prepare individuals and teachers to transform the food system, and help communities attain food sovereignty? Following a review of the food systems education literature, we highlight the constraints of the depoliticized approach by drawing attention to its race and class-based assumptions. We then construct a definition of CFSE, and articulate the theoretical and practical cornerstones of this perspective, which are drawn from critical pedagogy, food justice, food sovereignty, and agroecology. A case study of a seed sovereignty project at a vocational high school associated with Brazil's Landless Workers Movement is used to exemplify how CFSE can contribute to educating for food sovereignty.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rooftop vegetable gardening is a production system in urban agriculture based on green roof technology. To broaden the scope of this practice, the use of relatively shallow substrate depths must be explored, since most existing flat roofs are unable to support much added weight. Three growing systems—a green roof, raised green roof platforms, and in-ground—were evaluated for vegetable and herb production over three growing seasons (2009–2011). Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), peppers (Capsicum annuum), basil (Ocimum basilicum), and chives (Allium schoenoprasum) were studied because of their common use in home gardens. All plants, except pepper, survived and produced biomass in all growing systems and yielded crops large enough for analysis in 2009 and 2010. Overall, yields and basil biomass were higher and of better quality in-ground during 2009, the only year irrigation was applied, and similar on the roof and platforms. Variability in success was partially due to annual weather variation with the greatest impact on cucumber. Yields of chive, a perennial crop, were not affected by growing system after the first year. Results suggest that, with proper management, vegetable and herb production in an extensive green roof system is possible and productive.

    "abstract": "In recent years, urban contexts and urban-rural linkages have become central for scholars and activists engaged in agrarian questions, agroecological transitions and food system transformation. Grassroots experimentations in urban agroecology and farmers' engagement with urban policies have marked the rise of a new agenda aiming to bridge urban and agrarian movements.Departing from the work of Eric Holt-Gimenez and Annie Shattuck, this paper argues that the way urban-rural links have been conceptualized is occasionally progressive, and that an agroecology-informed food system transformation needs radical approaches. Acknowledging that processes of urbanization are dynamic, driven by specific lifestyles, consumption patterns, and value orientations – producing ongoing suburbanization, land enclosures, farmers displacement and food-knowledge loss – the paper argues that thinking transitions through new rural-urban links is unfit to tackle the evolving nature of these geographies, and reproduces the distinction between consumers and producers, living on either side of what Mindi Schneider and Philip McMichael have described as an epistemic and ecological rift.Building on insights from four case-studies across global north and south, the paper reframes agroecological transitions as a paradigmatic change in biopolitical spatial relations, economic values and planning agency – what we call an 'agroecological urbanism'. The paper articulates a transformation agenda addressing urban nutrients, peri-urban landuse, community food pedagogies and farmers' infrastructure.",

As a response to these changes, the number of community supported agriculture (CSA) farms, has grown rapidly in Norway. This article reveals, in depth, why Norwegian producers and consumers engage in CSA and how CSA can be seen as a transformational act toward food system changes. The study reveals that the Norwegian CSA producers, and consumers in general, have distinct values and are motivated by a desire of a production and food system, that safeguards aspects of environment, justice, health, participation, and communication. For them, the farms are an arena for converting societal values into practical actions. The sustainable production methods practiced—and the reallocation of power back to the producers, consumers, and local community—are indicative of the transformational power CSA has had upon the current agri-food system regime. However, the challenge is to upscale these actions, as well as prevent dilution of the core values and agroecological practices seen in the Norwegian CSAs.",

We review how agroecology has contributed to our understanding of the effects of local and landscape level drivers on beneficial insects, as well as on the ecosystem services they provide. Several syntheses from agroecosystem research indicate that both populations and biodiversity of pollinator and natural enemies decline with increases in local agricultural intensification and that landscape composition and configuration may mediate these local scale effects. Changes in agricultural management may affect predation and pollination services by altering the resource base for natural enemies and pollinators, by altering their species pool, and by modifying their interactions. The effects of these drivers depend on taxonomical or functional groups and landscape context. Studies that directly measure the cascading effects of landscape drivers on pest control and pollination services and plant level benefits are sparse. We propose five research themes to improve our understanding of the interface of agroecology, conservation, and ecosystem service research.",

They should also provide information about structural and functional changes in the agroecosystem which might affect the maintenance of the ecosystem services which the agroecosystem provides. With this aim, a methodological proposal has been developed to add agroecological EROIs (energy return on the investment) to the existing economic EROIs. This proposal has been applied to an agroecosystem which is representative of Mediterranean agro-climatic conditions at three key moments: one of balanced organic agriculture (1752), at the beginning of the use of chemical inputs (1904), and a time of agricultural production decoupled from its territory (1997). The results demonstrate the usefulness of the combination of both types of EROI in the detection of processes (agriculturalization vs. livestock farming, reforestation, generation of spatial heterogeneity, or the maintenance of biodiversity), which affect the \"fund\" elements of agroecosystems and their capacity to generate \"flows\" of ecosystem services.",

Applied agroecological research and the development of regional and community food systems are key means through which pressing ecological and social externalities may be mitigated. However, progress in both of these areas has been limited, particularly in the USA, with constraints in each likely holding the other back. In this article, we first review and explore how public investment in agroecology research and development has been limited in the USA. We then discuss how agricultural research funds could be shifted to better support the development of more resilient and equitable food systems. Finally, we explore a broader set of structural obstacles to food system change and identify key policies that could work jointly to strengthen a positive feedback cycle of research, policy, education and practice. Such a feedback cycle could work to accelerate a transition to ecological farming and food system norms that enhance natural resources sustainability, equity and resilience.",

Uncertified organic food (from farmers' market or self-production) is considered to be more \"organic\" than certified organic food. While consumers are strongly oriented toward organic food (certified or uncertified) and driven by health concerns and taste, they are primarily deterred by price and lack of availability. Results show that, to develop a sustainable market, consumers' extended and positive evaluations of uncertified organics represent the link to initiate the behavioral transition from conventional to certified organic food.",

Coffee production is dominated by the cultivation of Arabica and Robusta coffee, species that represent 99% of production, but both will be affected by climate change. Sustainable management practices that can enhance the resilience of production and livelihoods to climate change are urgently needed as production supports the livelihoods of over 25 million people globally, the majority of whom are smallholder farmers located in the coffee belt spanning the tropics. These communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. We conducted a systematic review, identifying 80 studies that describe the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on coffee agroecosystems, or that identify agroecological practices with the potential to enhance climate resilience. Adverse environmental impacts include a reduction in area suitable for production, lower yields, increased intensity and frequency of extreme climate events, and greater incidence of pests and diseases. Potential environmental solutions include altitudinal shifts, new, resilient cultivars, altering agrochemical inputs, and agroforestry. However, financial, environmental and technical constraints limit the availability of many of these approaches to farmers, particularly smallholder producers. There is therefore an urgent need to address these barriers through policy and market mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement to continue meeting the growing demand for coffee.",

We found 138 papers, authored by researchers from 64 countries, with a particular emphasis on European and American countries. The publications were mainly concentrated in research areas such as Environmental Sciences and Ecology, Agriculture and Science and Technology, and there was a significant increase in publications over the twenty-year period. Brazil stands out as a leader in publications (n = 25) among the 10 countries with the highest number of articles. The studies conducted by Brazilian researchers focused mostly on the \"governance and institutions\" dimension. The main topics identified in the articles were \"strategies,\" \"climate change,\" \"agroecology,\" \"food security,\" and COVID-19. Factors contributing to the resilience of family farming included mainly diversification of agricultural activities, property management, farmers' traditional knowledge, and agricultural public policies. The increasing number of publications indicates a shift in the approach to family farming, prompted by the need to tackle challenges such as economic shocks and climate change.",

Sustainability was highest for the agroecological scale (59/100), intermediate for the socioterritorial scale (53/100), and lowest on the economic scale (43/100). The sustainability of a farm is the lowest score of the three scales. In most farms, the lowest was the economic scale. A cluster analysis led to the identification of five distinct groups: Cluster 1 defined two farms not related to others, cluster 2 farms (4) were those with high agroecological scores, cluster 3 farms (8) were most representative of the area, cluster 4 included two farms with low socioterritorial and economic sustainability scores, and cluster 5 was made up of the remaining six farms with the highest economic sustainability score, but limited by the agroecological and socioterritorial scales. In all farms, there is a high reliance on bought-in inputs. Therefore, given the limited resources of these systems, the better option is to limit the number of cows to those that can be fed mostly with the production of the farm, which increases the economic sustainability. The IDEA method is a useful tool for sustainability assessment of small-scale dairy systems.",

We facilitated workshops in the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which groups of small farmers described how they had adapted to and prepared for past climate challenges. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers' climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers also identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-scale indicators to be improved. This outcome suggests that climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.",

Irrigation significantly increased quinoa yield compared to dry land production. The fescue/clover intercrop produced higher biomass compared to clover/medic intercrop. Neither intercrop affected quinoa yield. The cultivar \"Oro de Valle\" had higher mineral concentration than \"Cherry Vanilla\" for Cu, Fe, and P concentration, but lower seed yield each year. An interaction was found between Mn seed concentration and intercrop treatment; however, different intercrop treatments did not seem to greatly affect other seed mineral concentrations. The intercrop provided cover in the field during the winter months, thus, decreasing soil erosion and providing green manure the following season. The fescue grass clover mix created more winter cover compared to the clover/medic intercrop whereas the clover and medic mixture increased quinoa seed protein.",

These crops are commonly being labeled as “poor people's food” by South African consumers. The question that arises is whether this categorization is justified and what interventions are needed to unlock the potential of these crops in improving household food security levels. Survey data of 600 African households in the North West Province of South Africa was used for the analysis of the consumption patterns of several traditional and indigenous food crops. The results show that the link between income and the consumption of these food crops is more nuanced. Keywords: South Africaindigenous and traditional food cropsconsumption patternsfood security Notes 1. Indigenous and traditional food crops are defined in this study as vegetables, fruits, nuts and grains that are native to the region and / or that are consumed linked to culture and heritage. 2. Rural is defined as an area with formal and informal housing settlements that fall outside legally proclaimed urban areas, and include commercial farms, small settlements, and rural villages. 3. Urban is defined as an area with formal and informal housing settlements within the boundaries of a city or town and that has been legally proclaimed as such. 4. This random selection was assured by instructing the fieldworkers to survey no more than four households per street and to subsequently survey the third house on the left-hand side of the street and then the third house on the right-hand side of the street. 5. The Levene's test for equality of variances was performed to determine whether the conventional Independent T test or the Welch's T test was appropriate. 6.

However, there are some reports of little, or even negative, effect of biochar on crop yield, depending on the type of biochar feedstock, pyrolysis process, soil nutrient status, and crop species. Biochar is known to adsorb ammonia and phosphates in soil and facilitate growth and activities of phosphorus (P) solubilizing microbes (PSM), which mobilize P for uptake by plant roots. Using slow-pyrolyzed wood biochar and PSM in different soil conditions in three countries, our experiements show that soil nutrient status is more determinant of beneficial agronomic effect of biochar than the feedstock species and the type of crop. Treatments with biochar and PSM entail significant yield increase in P-deficient soil, whereas in soils with high P content, biochar has no significant effect on crop yield, regardless of addition of PSM. Based on published empirical data as well as our own findings, we also present a mathematical model of plant uptake of bioavailable P at different soil P concentrations, which explains that biochar is ineffective to enhance PSM activity for P mobilization in phosphate-rich soil, but significantly improves crop productivity in P-deficient soil.",

This research found that Fair Trade price premiums were inconsequential in providing support for smallholder resistance to land-use change out of coffee production. In contrast, the adoption of agroecological practices such as shade-tree diversification reduced reliance on costly external inputs, which allowed adopting producers to keep land in coffee production at a significantly higher rate than non-adopters. One conclusion drawn is that when addressing agricultural development crises, the promotion of agroecological practices that cut costs may be as good a strategy or better than one that focuses on enhancing yields or establishing price supports.",

I show that an Indigenous \"food security policy framework\" underpinned by a set of cultural and environmental indicators of wellbeing resonates with conceptualizations of food sovereignty, whereas the dominant food security approaches do not. I argue that such a framework enacts practices of food sovereignty and represents a tool of Indigenous resurgence and social change in food politics for the revitalization of Indigenous food sovereignty as an alternative sustainable food system.",

MLP analysis is used to explore the extent to which agroecology's growth has transformed the national agri-food regime. We find that although the term 'agroecology' is used widely by government, incentives for transitions to agroecology are only weakly implemented. This stems partly from the co-optation of the agroecological niche's discourse by regime actors. Currently, it seems the transition process is not a reconfiguration of the agri-food system, but rather that agroecology has been added to the regime without deeper changes.",

    "abstract": "While an increasing number of large food companies commit themselves to source only certified cocoa, research on the impacts of certification on cocoa farmers is falling behind. We investigate how Rainforest Alliance (RA) certification of small-scale cocoa farmers in Ghana has affected both the financial and the natural capitals of the farmers. Across two villages, certified farmers were compared to conventional farmers, using both qualitative and quantitative data collected through farmer and key informant interviews and participatory rural appraisals. A combination of the Sustainable Livelihood Framework and the Input-Output-Outcome-Impact Framework was used for the analysis. Results indicate that the RA certification scheme has a positive influence on the certified farmers in terms of cocoa production, yield, income and farmers’ perception of changes in their natural and financial capitals. The positive influence is a result of inputs from the RA certification, including financial support, information and knowledge, technical assistance, and increased access to farm inputs and credit. However, these positive impacts are conditioned by the presence of active farmer organizations and access to agricultural inputs and credit through associations and government institutions, and may be undermined by certified farmers who sell their produce outside the premium value chain.",

In Nicaragua, an agroecological transition is occurring, with three decades of building a groundswell based on the farmer-to-farmer movement and the recent institutionalization of agroecology in national law. Yet, problems remain with agroecology's diffusion. We introduce the Technological Innovation Systems approach to examine systemic barriers to the agroecological transition and cycles of blockages caused by barriers' interactions. Based on qualitative data from north-central Nicaragua, we find the main barriers hindering the agroecological transition include weak guidance of the search for agroecology, insufficient capacities and quantities of resources, and lacking market development. Beyond the Nicaragua case, the analysis points at the importance of using socio-technical systems analysis to better understand and address the root causes behind issues blocking national agroecological transitions.",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing civic movement to create spaces for urban agriculture (UA) in U.S. cities, public investment remains both inequitable and inadequate to support the diverse practices and practitioners growing food locally. As a result, outcomes of UA initiatives are uneven, ad hoc, and often the result of resistance and concerted advocacy. This is due, in part, to agriculture not being a standard urban land use designation or central focus of urban policymaking, despite decades of research demonstrating health, food, environmental and educational benefits of growing food in cities. Agroecology is a robust framework for urban food justice advocates and policymakers in the U.S. to identify synergistic ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits of UA. In this paper, we analyze survey responses from 35 East Bay urban farms through an agroecology lens, documenting how the diverse farms form part of a fragile system that produces important spaces of food, community, health, and culture. With land use and affordability challenges rising in contexts like San Francisco Bay Area, we contend that urban agroecology as both scientific mode of inquiry and set of agricultural practices can improve urban food research-action projects aiming to protect urban farms as vital city infrastructure.",

Ethno-ecological studies conducted in recent decades, clearly demonstrate that the experience these cultures have accumulated can be defined as wisdom, formed as a complex integrating a set of beliefs that lead to a worldview (an ontological dimension), a repertoire of knowledge (an epistemological dimension), and a series of practices (a productive dimension). So far, agroecology has addressed two of these three dimensions interacting with traditional producers (the epistemological and productive dimensions) and, with few exceptions, has neglected the ontological dimension. This paper sets forth the thesis that the ontological perspective leads to spirituality, a theme that has been excluded. Recognizing and integrating spirituality into agroecological practice would reinforce agroecology as a socially and environmentally liberating activity, since it embraces key concepts such as Mother Earth and Harmonious Living (buen vivir, the indigenous principle of harmonizing with the whole of nature).",

    "abstract": "In the face of myriad environmental challenges associated with industrial agriculture, some farmers and researchers have looked to diversified farming systems as a promising alternative. Despite well-documented ecological benefits, diversification practices remain rare in many regions of the U.S, even amongst organic farmers. Our study focuses on organic farmers in the Central Coast region of California, an area that has played a crucial role in the rise of organic agriculture over the last several decades. Through 20 interviews with farmers who all grow lettuce and 8 interviews with technical assistance providers, we investigate the persistent barriers that growers in this region face in adopting diversification practices including cover cropping, compost application, crop rotation, insectary strips, and hedgerows. We find that high land rents, the predominance of short-term leases, stringent food safety standards, and other supply chain pressures significantly hamper the adoption of diversification practices. In order to surmount these barriers and increase adoption, solutions must be pursued at three interconnected levels: innovation at the farm level, and policy change at the technical and structural levels. Locally-informed, integrated, and innovative policies across these three levels must be explored to support the creation of a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food system.",

The overall aim of the study was to conduct an agroecological characterization of the farms by using the Agroecology Criteria Tool and focusing on the role of knowledge (co-)creation and sharing. We conducted walking interviews with ten farmers and applied participatory research techniques. We found that, first, the farmers either have already transformed the farm into an advanced agroecological model (level 3) or are transitioning from organic to agroecological (level 2–3). Second, the interactions between the farms and regional agri-food system actors foster the reconnection between eaters and regional growers (level 4). The actors of this transformation belong, thus, to grassroots self-organized and solidarity-based initiatives, which have built an agroecology-based regional agri-food network. And third, the diversity of activities and formats identified for engaging a broad range of stakeholders provides resources for redefining power relationships and co-creating knowledge. However, there are important barriers that must be addressed to scale this network, such as the lack of structures, platforms and collaborations fostering the knowledge (co-)creation and sharing, access to affordable and secure land, and the lack of governmental support.",

Four key indicators of farmers' food security – enset stock, land sharing, agricultural biodiversity, and fodder production – were assessed before and after the project implementation. The findings reveal that the agroecological transition initiated by the project positively impacted all indicators, with longer-term beneficiaries experiencing more significant improvements. The transition resulted in breaking the vicious circle of food insecurity and in establishing a virtuous circle of improved livelihoods and resilience through enhanced productivity, reintroduction of livestock, and the production and marketing of fodder into local markets. The study also highlights the crucial role of traditional indigenous organizations, in identifying context-specific needs and in creating and sharing knowledge for successful agroecological transitions. Millions of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia are trapped in a vicious circle of food insecurity and vulnerability due to soil degradation, high population density, and depletion of natural resources. This research serves as a compelling call to prioritize and invest in agroecology as a key solution to sustainably intensify smallholder agriculture, conserve natural resources, protect biodiversity, and improve the livelihoods of vulnerable farmers in similar contexts.KEYWORDS: EthiopiaAgroecological transitionVulnerabilityFood securityRural poverty AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to Inter Aide and all its staff in Ethiopia for their exceptional work and dedication in supporting local food and agricultural systems.

This study uses institutional analysis to analyze this program from the perspective of a state-wide farmer-led oversight campaign led by advocates of sustainable agriculture.

This review aims to gain insight into the current state of the art of research at the cusp of these two fields. Relevant scientific literature from two standpoints, that of the water and agricultural research communities, was analyzed. Thirty-eight papers queried from the Clarivate Web of Science were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Most papers were confined to water budget analyses of cropping systems and practices or to experimental manipulations. Only a small number of papers were found to acknowledge the co-existence of irrigation and agroecology practices or highlight that irrigation offers an opportunity for agroecological systems. Links between agroecology and irrigation at higher levels (farm, territorial, food system) were analyzed in a scant number of papers. We suggest that these oversights could be due to the fact that these two research fields – in addition to the associated policies and realities – have different narratives, goals, approaches, scales, and involved actors. Research needs to delve much deeper by designing agroecological systems in which irrigation is tailored to the complexity of agroecological systems, while striving to enhance ecological processes for the provision of multiple ecosystem services.",

At present, approximately 70% of the area in this study region is sown to irrigated cotton and winter wheat under the so-called state mandate. We present evidence of the benefits of moving away from this approach toward more diversified farming with an increasing area of alternative crops in the selected region. We report on a series of studies that included a) crop suitability screening based on secondary data, b) joint farmer experiments, and c) a mathematical simulation model with the overarching objective to assess potential benefits and constraints for crop diversification. The findings of this long-term, multiyear, and multidisciplinary approach show that greater crop diversity can increase water use efficiency, and secure farm income in dryland areas prone to water scarcity and soil salinity. In addition, the findings of the simulation model confirmed that crop diversification could secure income of downstream farmers during the climate-driven decline in water availability. Overall, the findings indicate that greater crop diversity and improved access to markets can lead to a sustainable development path in the region.",

    "abstract": "Alternative farming systems are challenging classical agronomic frameworks because their aim is to promote human and ecosystems welfare rather than profit maximization. The objective of our work was to understand how alternative farmers build their strategic choices. Through a multiple-case qualitative study of 14 organic market gardening microfarms in the northern half of France, we developed a systemic conceptual framework in which strategic decision making is integrated with a wide range of social and environmental aspirations. As these various aspirations can be in tension, it is relevant to consider tradeoffs between them to study the viability of alternative farms.",

In particular, this article reveals that the adoption of agroecology as a form of resistance by indigenous and peasant movements played a key role in its development. Furthermore, articulation between organizations, academia, and public institutions helped agroecology grow in conceptual depth, national reach, and political influence.

The monitoring, mapping, and analysis of agricultural land use change, especially in areas where urban change has been high, is crucial. The collision between traditional economic activities related to agriculture in tourist areas such as the Algarve and current demand for tourism infrastructures in urban regions is also leading to loss of economic activity. This article uses a combined geographical information system approach with CORINE land cover datasets to perform a Shannon's diversity index quantifying changes in agricultural areas. The article then expands on the nature of the agricultural changes observed, and offers a multi-temporal assessment by means of landscape metrics in order to understand the shifting land use patterns for the Algarve in land use planning and regional economic equilibrium: a) forest regions become transformed into agricultural areas and agricultural areas become urban; b) areas that are initially agricultural become scattered residential regions created by economic investors; and c) agricultural land use changes have a cyclical nature in which—in the course of the economic recession—such dynamic effects brought about a decrease in tourism and focus on traditional sectors.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary society is characterized by faith in the technological paradigm as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges. This has led to a lack of critical analysis toward the contradictions inherent to production systems. In the primary sector, this phenomenon is expressed by the creation of a productivist ideology in which \"producing more is better.\" The negative aspects of the production techniques are hidden or classified as necessary evils to be solved with more technology. A case study compared three corn production systems on family farming: a) organic agroecological maize with open-pollinated variety (OAM), b) conventional hybrid maize (CHM), and c) transgenic hybrid maize (THM). The CHM and THM had greater production costs and productivity driven primarily by high dosages of fertilizer and the price of GM seeds. The high doses of nitrogenous fertilizer contaminate water and food with nitrates and nitrites. Economic viability of CHM and THM depends on large-scale production and public subsidies to purchase inputs and outsource risks through crop insurance. This article demonstrates that increasing agricultural productivity through the intensive use of inputs contrasts with the diminishing return on invested capital, and increases the environmental impacts without changing the economic performance of the activity.",

Can a second \"Green Revolution\" be more \"climate smart\" and inclusive than the first one, through driving a process of genuinely sustainable intensification? Using a livelihoods framework, we assess evidence on the adoption of agroecological practices in the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania, through a meta-analysis of four empirical studies, and conclude that the supported adoption of agroecological practice in conjunction with suitable market access has considerable potential for creating inclusive sustainable agricultural livelihoods.",

Taking a systemic perspective, the paper identifies spatialized urban food system components and their linkages and interactions with the aim of fostering integrated and multidimensional intervention approaches for urbanizing regions. This paper contributes to an understanding of the relation between the urban system and the food system focusing on the spatial dimension of urban food systems. It illustrates geographies of urban food systems. The first part poses the questions: How is an urban food system described? How do the components relate and manifest? A systemic approach helps to describe connections between components with regard to related places, practices and actors: What are the drivers that transform food systems toward functioning systems that produce healthy food, provide income for (urban) farmers, accessibility to food for all income classes, and allows valorization of food waste. The second part expands on actual cases of urban food systems in the context of two research projects. Selected results of the transdisciplinary research project “Urban Agriculture Casablanca” (UAC) illustrate the contribution of urban agriculture to the urban food system in the urbanizing region of Greater Casablanca. The urban food system components are spatialized using the examples of Kigali (Rwanda) and Da Nang (Vietnam), case cities of the trans-sectoral research project “Rapid Planning” (RP). It perceives food systems as part of urban infrastructure including trans-sectoral synergies between resource flows within an urban metabolism.",

As vast proportions of African countries' populations rely on agriculture for livelihood and food security, there is a need to adapt current practices and develop new climate-resilient strategies and farming systems. Here, we inventory and review which agroecological practices currently implemented in semiarid and subhumid Africa can promote adaptation to climate change. This work was carried out through extensive literature research, plus interviews with 24 experts from different African and French NGOs active in agricultural development programs in Africa. We found that: (1) some inventoried practices may not specifically be implemented in response to climate change impacts, yet they aid in adapting to reduced or more variable rainfall and increased temperature, and/or enhance carbon sequestration; (2) other practices promote indirect adaptation by increasing resilience of cropping or livestock systems; (3) many farmers use combinations of different practices to increase overall farming system resilience and through this strategy can achieve efficient adaptation to climate changes, as single practices normally are not sufficient. Our review and evaluation show that a broad variety of agroecological practices provides high potential to adapt to climate change effects in semiarid and subhumid African farming systems.",

However, little is known about how these programs work in practice from the perspective of smallholder cocoa producers. Furthermore, we do not know if third-party cocoa certification programs work the same way, even within common countries/contexts. Therefore, we examine three different smallholder cocoa certification schemes operating in Ghana to understand how smallholder cocoa farmers perceive the certification program requirements, price premium arrangements, and inspection regimes, among other things. While we find that smallholder cocoa farmers/stakeholders have a positive view of certification programs and their requirements, the results reveal that smallholder cocoa farmers are inadequately informed about the certification programs, disconnected from price premium management, and not participating in the compliance verification regimes required by the various standards. Our findings suggest improvements to the structures and procedures for certification participation, price premium management, and smallholder-level verification may increase the likelihood that third-party certification schemes sustainably improve livelihoods and agroecological systems.",

    "abstract": "It has been widely argued that agroecological science, which originally developed as the application of ecological principles to agricultural systems, should engage with the social and political issues that affect production agriculture, and incorporate knowledge from a variety of sources. In this paper, we use techniques from network science and bibliometrics to evaluate the degree to which this transformation has taken place. By creating networks based on over 3,000 agroecology papers and the roughly 160,000 references they cite, we distinguish the sub-fields (\"research fronts\") that made up agroecology in three time intervals: 1982–2004, 2005–2013, and 2014–2018. We also identify the main disciplines from which the research fronts in 2014–2018 drew their supporting knowledge. We suggest that, very broadly, themes in agroecological research include: Ecosystem services; (agro)biodiversity; approaches to agricultural intensification; tropical agroecosystems (particularly coffee); pest and weed management; organic agriculture; cropping systems; system transitions, modeling, and design; climate change adaptation; food sovereignty; education; and the nature and purpose of agroecology itself. Some research fronts mainly cite papers in natural science fields such as ecology, environmental science, agriculture, and entomology. However, others draw upon work in social science areas including development studies, environmental studies, and anthropology. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that agroecology has indeed evolved to possess many of the characteristics of an \"ecology of [the entire] food system.\" We anticipate that this work will also be of use to those wishing to gain an overview of the field or identify key papers, knowledge gaps, and potential collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Over centuries, ethnic minority communities in the north of Vietnam have developed complex farming systems well-adapted to their environments. Much of this is based on indigenous knowledge concerned with adapting to locally-available resources and more recently enhancing resiliency to climatic risk. This article draws from data gathered with mixed qualitative methods in ten villages in rural Bac Kan Province in the north of the country. It documents specific examples in the production of banana and medicinal plants; maize and red peanut; taro, pachyrhizus, and maize; and green bean as systems that incorporate native crops in ways that provide resistance to drought, improve water-use efficiency, benefit the soil, minimize agrochemical use, preserve culinary traditions, support gender equality, and increase the incomes of farm families living near the poverty line. Overall, this study illustrates unique ways that indigenous knowledge and agroecological farming practices can increase social, economic, and environmental resiliency, mitigate risk, and strengthen livelihoods in marginalized communities. As communities across the Global South seek answers to ever-increasing challenges brought by changes in climate, this paper argues that policymakers should revisit, support, and promote the indigenous knowledge already present in these communities to advance more sustainable futures.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological models have the potential to contribute to both the fight against climate change and a shift away from the dominant food system. In this article, I discuss the challenges that ecological farmers in Canada are facing in terms of scaling out agricultural systems that will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon. I draw on Gramscian theories to argue that alliance-building is required in order to advance a counter-hegemonic agroecology in Canada, with those alliances going beyond narrowly conceived class-based interests. I suggest that the challenges farmers are facing highlight the need for a just transition in agriculture, and that the social transformation that this would entail means that proponents of agroecology must consider the positionalities of environmentalists, scholars, farmers and farm workers, and Indigenous peoples across the country.",

    "abstract": "The role of agroecological practices in addressing food security has had limited investigation, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Quasi-experimental methods were used to assess the role of agroecological practices in reducing food insecurity in smallholder households in Malawi. Two key practices – crop diversification and the incorporation of organic matter into soil – were examined. The quasi-experimental study of an agroecological intervention included survey data from 303 households and in-depth interviews with 33 households. The survey sampled 210 intervention households participating in the agroecological intervention, and 93 control households in neighboring villages. Regression analysis of food security indicators found that both agroecological practices significantly predicted higher food security and dietary diversity for smallholder households: the one-third of farming households who incorporated legume residue soon after harvest were almost three times more likely to be food secure than those who had not incorporated crop residue. Qualitative semi-structured interviews with 33 households identified several pathways through which crop diversification and crop residue incorporation contributed to household food security: direct consumption, agricultural income, and changes in underlying production relations. These findings provide evidence of agroecology's potential to address food insecurity while supporting sustainable food systems.",

Its provisioning services include food for humans, feed for livestock, and medicines, as well as fuelwood and feedstock for bioenergy. As for supporting ecosystem services, this cactus benefits biodiversity by providing wildlife with food, pollen, habitat, and shelter. Also, it can be used for phytoremediation of contaminated soil and water. In terms of regulating services, it can be used to control soil erosion, it provides raw material for mulching and composting, it has fire breaking properties, and it sequesters carbon. It also provides cultural services; it is used as an ornamental plant, acts as a live fence, and can be used to delineate boundaries between adjacent plots. Also, in certain occasions, the species’ durability has made it a symbol of hope for refugees wishing to return to their expropriated lands. These ecosystem services can be fulfilled as long as the prickly pear is cultivated in home-gardens or in sustainable agroforestry and silvopasture systems. However, establishment of commercial monoculture plantations may accelerate environmental degradation. Further, the species invasiveness may lead to land infestation. The potential risks to natural ecosystems necessitate careful planting of prickly pears in the future, to ensure environmental sustainability.",

Promoting sustainable agriculture in the region requires a holistic understanding of complex agroecosystems. This study identifies and analyzes the main challenges for agriculture and possibilities for agroecological transition of small-scale farms in Guachetá, Colombia. Using the Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE), 10 elements of agroecology and core performance criteria were evaluated on seven farms. Several key actors were then interviewed, to triangulate data and understand current challenges and possible future pathways. It was found that drier climate and variations in rainfall patterns pose major challenges to current production systems. Limited possibilities for participation in land governance, lack of interest in agriculture among young people, and lack of access to markets hinder the development of sustainable agriculture. Current specialized practices in dairy and potato production are associated with reduced agricultural biodiversity and dependency on agrochemicals, leading to weak synergies and low profitability within agroecosystems. Implementation of agroecological principles and practices such as crop and income diversification and promoting joint action in agricultural development could help overcome sustainability issues in Guachetá.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, global demand for medicinal plants has surged due to their recognized therapeutic capacities in both traditional and modern medicine. The COVID-19 epidemic, skepticism regarding synthetic medications, and a desire for a natural supplement to address dietary deficiencies have collectively intensified demand. The therapeutic properties and commercial prospects of this group of plants are significant; nonetheless, the demand for wild species poses considerable risks to the integrity and sustainability of natural ecosystems. This commentary will address the necessity for sustainable harvesting of medicinal plants while preserving biodiversity and ecological balance. Overexploitation, habitat degradation, and insufficient management strategies increasingly threaten numerous medicinal plants, which are often keystone species fulfilling critical ecological functions. Unsustainable harvesting practices harm plant populations and ecological systems, especially slow-growing or region-specific species. Overexploitation and lack of information in local communities increase the risk of species extinction. A holistic approach that integrates scientific research, policy formulation, and community engagement is necessary to address these challenges. Promoting cultivation standards, biotechnological advancements, and traditional knowledge is crucial. Successful conservation initiatives necessitate the transdisciplinary collaboration of conservation scientists, policymakers, local people, and industry stakeholders. This strategy will assist in safeguarding ecological integrity and preserving these vital resources for future generations.",

The shocks induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with increased energy prices and shortages of fertilizers and agricultural inputs, have affected farmers everywhere. By applying inductive, qualitative, and comparative research approaches, we investigate the impact of shocks and crises on diverse food systems. Using mixed qualitative methods, we integrate the voices of (n = 25) farmers belonging to agroecology-based local food systems in Peru, Germany, and the United States with the aims of: (i) understanding the different crisis scenarios; (ii) determining the vulnerabilities induced in farmers; and (iii) identifying the responses and coping mechanisms that farmers deploy in response to shocks. The results illustrate how farmers are affected by the combined effects of labor shortages, rising input costs, high energy prices, and climate change. Farmers' responses to stressors are then analyzed and compared using attributes of food system resilience. Based on our results, we argue that resilience-building is determined not only by the environment in which agroecology is embedded, but also by the responsive capacities of farmers. We emphasize the need for more proactive policies aimed at promoting agroecological and localized production to enhance the resilience of food systems against recurrent shocks and crises.",

This aimed to identify high yielding, adaptable, and acceptable rice cultivars for sodic soils through farmers' participation. Typically, plant breeders develop varieties isolated from active farmers and release varieties that are most productive under ideal conditions; often they are not suitable for marginal farm conditions, like sodic lands. Therefore, PVS facilitates development of varieties suitable for marginal soils and farmers' interests. A collection of modern rice varieties/genotypes was screened and evaluated under researcher-managed trials during 2001. From 2002 to 2008, farmers became a part of the variety/genotype selection and testing process in order to incorporate their preferences, which were crucial for the large-scale adoption of the selected variety/genotype. With farmer support, genotype CSR-89IR-8 was identified as superior and not only performed better in different locations in the state of Uttar Pradesh, but was also readily adopted by many farmers in sodic areas. This genotype is tolerant to sodicity (up to pH2 ˜9.9) and yields more grain in sodic soil than other varieties/genotypes tested. In view of the successful testing and large scale adoption of CSR-89IR-8 in the target sodic areas of Indo-Gangetic plains, this genotype was officially released as variety CSR 43 by Uttar Pradesh State Variety Release Committee in 2011for widespread cultivation. The successful use of PVS in these sodic environments convinced researchers, stakeholders, and partner organizations to more broadly adopt this approach for new rice variety development, particularly for other salt affected areas.",

    "abstract": "In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), increasing food security remains a challenge since smallholder agricultural systems, which are the main source of food production, are under serious threat due to poor soil fertility and climate variability. This study was undertaken in Lao PDR to investigate the impacts of organic and clay-based soil amendments on maize yield, total nutrient uptake, and soil properties. Structured field experiments were established over two consecutive years (2011 and 2012) with maize as the test crop at the Veunkham and Naphok sites. Ten treatments were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments were control, rice husk biochar (applied at a rate of 10 t ha−1), bentonite clay (10 t ha−1), compost (4 t ha−1), clay-manure compost (10 t ha−1), rice husk biochar compost (10 t ha−1), and their combinations. All treatments were applied in 2011. Significant (p < 0.05) treatment effects in maize grain yields, total nutrient uptake, and soil properties were observed. At Veunkham, differences between the control and amended soils in yield ranged from 0.9 to 3.3 t ha−1 in 2011 and from 0.2 to 1.3 t ha−1 in 2012, whereas differences at Naphok varied between 0.2 and 2.2 t ha−1 in 2011 and from 0.2 to 1.7 t ha−1 in 2012. At both sites, in most of the treatments, yields in 2012 were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than 2011; this was attributed to a late season drought. Differences between the control and amended soils in yield can be attributed to the improvements in total N and P uptake, soil pH, exchangeable Ca++ and Mg++, and cation-exchange capacity following the application of soil amendments. The results of this study confirm that the soil amendments under consideration can be effective in improving agricultural productivity, while improving key soil properties indicating that soil amendments could be an option for intensification of agricultural productivity.",

This study predicted key factors influencing rancher engagement in a conservation easement (CE) agreement. Specifically, theory of planned behavior, trust, environmental identity, past behavior, perceptions of specific CE characteristics and selected participant demographics were used as predictors. A mixed-methods approach was applied involving interviews, a two-phase pilot study, and a statewide mail-administered questionnaire. Final interview domains guided the quantitative survey instrument, which was administered to 1,000 Florida cattle ranchers. A 60% response rate was received. Multiple linear regression demonstrated ranchers were more likely to enter into a CE agreement if they 1) had a positive attitude about the outcomes associated with CEs; 2) felt influential others would positively support CEs; 3) indicated higher trust in conservation organizations and agencies; 4) believed their land had significant conservation value; 5) supported sale or donation of certain property rights; and 6) were positively influenced by financial incentives, primarily estate tax deductions. These six variables explained over 50% of intent to engage in a CE agreement. Understanding these influences will aid land conservationists in their future communication efforts with farmers and ranchers.

Based on mixed-effects linear models to estimate differences (if any) in employment between organic farms and countywide farm averages, our analysis indicated that organic farms employed more workers per acre (95% CI: 2–12% more). Further, a greater proportion (95% CI: 13–43% more) of hired labor on organic farms worked 150 days or more compared to the average farm, suggesting increased labor requirements—and potentially more secure employment—on organic farms.

In this study, five different cover crops (hairy vetch, Austrian winter peas, winter rye, winter barley, and winter triticale) were planted in the fall and terminated in the spring in preparation for no-till organic row crop production. This study compared the cover crops through measurements of: a) the amount of biomass produced by the cover crops before termination; b) the weed suppression potential of the cover crops terminated with either a roller-crimper or sickle-bar mower; and c) volumetric soil water content throughout the row crop production season. Biomass production of each of the cover crops differed significantly by variety and by year, ranging from 3.67 to 14.56 Mg DM ha−1. Significant differences in weed densities and weed biomass were also found, with almost complete elimination of weed establishment in the rye treatment in 2011. Roll-crimping and sickle-bar mowing treatments demonstrated similar weed suppression and soil moisture from May through October during 2010 and 2011.KEYWORDS: no-tillorganic agriculturecover cropsroller-crimper ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author would like to thank the North Central Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program for funding this project.",

In his review, Smaje argues that society in general, and the research community in particular should question whether to invest substantially in the development of perennial grains because a) ecological theory suggests that perennial grains may yield less than annual grains; b) strong criticisms of annual agriculture are unfounded, both socially and ecologically; and c) focus on perennial grains detracts from more important strategies for achieving agricultural sustainability. We counter these three arguments by showing a) that Grime's C-S-R theory employed by Smaje is not meaningful when used to predict the \"evolvability\" of perennial species under selection in agricultural environments; b) that annual grain ecosystems have not broadly achieved an acceptable level of ecosystem function or resilience; and c) that perennial grain research is not currently attracting the attention or resources that other, less promising and less transformative research efforts garner.KEYWORDS: perennialgrainC-S-R theoryagroecology ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to think David Van Tassel for his insights, conversations, and generous contributions to the ideas presented in this article.

    "abstract": "While the opportunities of modern agroforestry systems are increasingly recognized by policymakers, consultants, researchers, and educators, the response of farmers to the recent subsidy program for alley cropping systems in Flanders is relatively low. Therefore, in this study, a mixed method technique, including a survey (n = 86), interviews (n = 33), and a GIS analysis, is used to better understand the reasons behind this implementation gap. The study showed that 55% of the Flemish farmers are not familiar with agroforestry and that the intention to engage in agroforestry is very low. As a result, alley cropping in Flanders remains sparse with only around 30 farmers known to be consciously engaged in the practice. In the last couple of years, these pioneers have installed one or more agroforestry plots (average surface area of 2.3 ha) that often combine a variety of trees with grassland. Whereas negative perceptions of Flemish farmers are mainly related to compatibility and profitability of such a farming system, pioneers consider legal issues, such as land tenure, the most pertaining drawback. Therefore, future research and policy and extension efforts should target these aspects in order to enhance further diffusion.",

Some suggest mitigating social and ecological impacts of modern industrial farming while others advocate for local adaptation to changes in socioecological systems, such as climate change, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. This article investigates effective pathways of fundamental transformations in technologies, livelihoods, and lifestyles referred to as \"agricultural sustainability transitions\" in the Karnali Mountains, the most impoverished region of Nepal. Findings suggest that neither management of change referred to as transition management nor adaptation to change referred to as adaptive management effectively leads to agricultural sustainability transitions in this region of the country. An integration of these two approaches, which this article theorizes as \"adaptive transition management,\" can help charter transition pathways through system innovation making new and improved technologies more accessible and adaptable to smallholders while developing local capacity to adapt to changes in agroecological systems.KEYWORDS: agricultureagricultural biodiversitysocioecotechnical systemsadaptive transition managementfood securityNepal",

Based on the discussion in a workshop that was part of the 2015 conference on The Agroecological Imagination, we argue that an agroecological approach to food systems might provide an appropriate framework for understanding food systems transitions. We address three central questions. (1) Can agroecological practices add value to food, and what process of certification and labeling would help consumers understand the added value that certain practices provide? (2) How can agroecology introduce ecological concepts into decisions on food systems, especially at the scale of food systems rather than the scale of specific products? (3) What approaches to research and action-research are most appropriate – or remain to be developed – in order to favor such processes of reconnection between agriculture, environment and food? We conclude by arguing that an agroecological approach to food systems should favor processes which allow relational reflexivity – the capacity to take into account one's own interdependencies to others but also interdependencies between other actors.",

Sample area of the same size, placed on each farm, was used for the biodiversity assessments and on-farm landscape heterogeneity studies. On-farm landscape heterogeneity was classified with the Shannon–Wiener diversity index. Linear regression was applied to analyze relationships between on-farm landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity indicators. Multivariate regression was used to analyze relations between single bird species and specific on-farm habitats. Small farms had significantly higher on-farm landscape heterogeneity than large farms. Strong positive relations between on-farm landscape heterogeneity and number of breeding birds, butterflies, and herbaceous plant species were found. Total on-farm landscape heterogeneity seems to be more important for bird diversity than do specific landscape elements. The study indicates that, to increase biodiversity, farm size should be taken into consideration.",

Further, increased rainfall variability exposes agricultural systems to impacts from flood and drought events. In many regions, water limitations are overcome through technological approaches such as irrigation and tile drainage, which may not be sustainable in the long term. A more sustainable approach to combat episodes of floods and droughts is to increase soil water storage and the overall green water efficiency of agroecosystems. Agricultural practices that promote \"continuous living cover,\" such as perennial grasses, agroforestry and cover crops, can improve water management relative to annual crop systems. Such practices ensure living roots in agricultural systems throughout the year and offer an approach to agroecosystem design that mimics ecological dynamics of native perennial vegetation. We review how these practices have been shown to improve elements of the water balance in a range of environments, with an emphasis on increased soil hydrologic function. A specific focus on the agriculturally intensive state of Iowa provides insight into how land use centered on agroecological principles affords greater water resilience, for individual farms as well as for broader community and ecosystem health.",

In this study, we investigated tree diversity, carbon stocks, and major soil nutrients in cocoa-dominated and mixed food crops agroforests compared to a natural forest in southern Ghana. Significant decreases in tree species diversity and dominance and carbon stocks in the agroforestry systems compared to natural forest were recorded. The magnitude of carbon stocks declined from natural forest through cocoa-dominated agroforest to mixed food crops agroforest. Soil nitrogen content was greatest in cocoa-dominated agroforest and least in natural forest whereas phosphorus was greatest in natural forest and least in cocoa-dominated agroforest. However, potassium in soil did not vary significantly with land use. The results suggest that, though a poor substitute for natural forest, both cocoa-dominated agroforest and mixed food crops agroforest contained significant levels of tree diversity, carbon stocks and soil nutrients but their value as potential replacements for the natural forest differ. There are implications of the findings of the study for sustainable management of tropical agricultural production landscapes as well as planning carbon projects for mitigation of global climate change.",

This is largely a function of poverty, which is particularly pervasive in the rural areas. While the government's largely unsuccessful agricultural development programs have focused on large-scale commercial crops, such as wheat and maize, indigenous and traditional food crops could play a significant role. In this article, multiple criteria analysis is used to identify indigenous and traditional food crops that have the greatest potential to enhance food security in South Africa. The different indigenous and traditional food crops options were rank according to set criteria that were derived from the definition for food security as adopted in the article. Accessibility, affordability and nutrition formed the basis of the definition as subsequently the criteria used to rank the alternatives. Results from the analysis revealed that sorghum, sweet potatoes, and amaranth are among the indigenous and traditional food crops with the greatest potential.Abbreviations: AgriSETA: Agricultural Sector Education and Training Authority; CAM: conflict analysis method; DAFF: Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; IFSS: integrated food security strategy; ITFCs: indigenous and traditional food crops; FAO: Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; MCA: multiple criteria analysis; NWP: North West Province; PIR-sensitivity test: preference, indifference, and incomparability test; PSPPD: Programme to Support Pro-Poor Policy Development",

The first step is to identify and calculate the indicators of systems and sub-systems to assess the agro-ecological and socioeconomic dimensions of sustainability. The second step is the selection, weighting and integration of indicators that permit the calculation of the ISS ranging from 0 to 1. The farm sustainability score is categorized into three levels: weak, intermediate and strong. This methodology has been verified on a stockless organic farming system case study of 12 farms in Italy. Results show that most of the farms reached intermediate levels of sustainability but there are significant differences on ISS scores within the study group. Agro-ecological and socioeconomic dimension play a different role in highlighting the coexistence of different models of sustainability. A further development of the present methodology should include an in-depth analysis of the social dimension of sustainability and integrate an assessment procedure to formulate improved management practices that will help farmers to find win-win solutions that decrease the contrast between environmental and economic sustainability.",

The first is a horizontal or scaling out effect, given that these activities involve the adoption of agroecological practices which allow for spreading knowledge, principles, and practices among seed custodians, their local communities and organizations, and the networks of these organizations. The second is a deepening effect, given that: 1) seed custodianship reaffirms and/or generates new peasant and indigenous identities and ways of life; 2) seed recovery, conservation, and defense conform a multi-dimensional process that is material, political, and symbolic, which provides cultural and territorial rootedness, and 3) strengthening of the social-organizational fabric through collective actions and strategies by seed custodians in their territories in defense of native and creole seeds. These processes propitiate fertile conditions for scaling peasant agroecology and contribute to the construction of seed sovereignty, which is an essential aspect of struggles to preserve and reproduce and native and creole seeds.",

The study shows how all the four aspects of food security – availability, access, stability, and utilization – have improved after the transition to agroecology, while positive impacts are also registered in soil quality, environmental sustainability, and resilience. From the point of view of economic sustainability, the transition has had high costs at the beginning but, after three years, agroecological production is resulting in increased income and better living conditions.

These agricultural practices can potentially both contribute to climate change mitigation and increase the soil’s resilience to physical and biological stresses. The paper draws on research findings from five regions across Europe to identify regionally-specific barriers to and opportunities for the adoption of soil carbon management practices. Data were derived from 50 interviews with policy-makers and advisers and 5 stakeholder workshops in Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Spain. Several barriers to the uptake of soil carbon management practices were common across all regions, however, regional variations were also identified highlighting the importance of understanding the context into which these practices are introduced. Key barriers related to existing biophysical conditions, lack of financial support, farmer knowledge and experience, and the quality of the advisory service. Opportunities included providing economic incentives, harmonizing regulation, supporting long term thinking and planning for resilience and providing good quality advice. We conclude that in addition to persuasive mechanisms for encouraging the adoption of these practices, what is required is a more process-oriented approach that focuses on a series of experiential changes and fosters farmer learning through interactive models of communicative intervention.",

In this article, we explore how Sikkim's organic policies are affecting agroecology transitions. Drawing upon 47 interviews with Sikkimese farmers, consumers, and government officials, we explore how questions of scale are central to the Sikkimese state's organic vision. Our four-part analysis reveals how the state's move to scale up organics reflects: 1) the state's perception that areal scale and low yield are the major constraints to their organic vision. To address this perceived constraint, the state is attempting to: 2) re-scale farm production to increase yield in single commodity crops, and 3) re-scale social processes to collectivize production and marketing. 4) Education is a primary pathway through which the state seeks to reorient farmers to engage in scaled up production and a yield oriented vision of cooperation. Our results show how these different scalar processes intersect, shedding new light on debates about the role of the state in agroecology transitions.List of Acronyms: APEDA: Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority; ATMA: Agricultural Technical Management Authority; CEO: Chief Executive Officer; FPO: Farmer Producer Organization; MOVCD: Mission Organic Value Chain Development",

    "abstract": "We pose that Agroecology, which is already a hybrid science, is further overcoming disciplinary isolation and stagnation through explicit processes of interdisciplinary recombination, in what might be termed \"second generation hybridization\". We refer to the intellectual contact zone of Agroecology – mainly with Cultural Geography, Historical Ecology, Archeology, Ecological Anthropology, and Ethnoecology – as \"Historical Agroecology\". We discuss the following five theoretical methodological foundations of our proposal toward an Historical Agroecology: (1) regional agroecological histories, (2) agroecological landscapes as palimpsests: human-mediated disturbances and their cumulative effects, (3) alpha and beta as agrobiodiversity on the table: manifestations of human niche construction, (4) agroecological ethos as landscapes of knowledge, and (5) infrapolitics and collective action as other forms of agroecological resistance aside from social movements. We illustrate these points through case studies based on our research in peasant communities of the Maya lowlands in the Mexican states of Yucatan, Chiapas, and Campeche. We conclude by reflecting on the need to further develop historical agroecological perspectives in those regions with agricultural systems that have resulted from profound diachronic legacies that are spatially rooted in broad geographical areas.",

Feasibility of integrating four local marketing initiatives to traditional hill farming, i) promoting community-supported organic/biodynamic agriculture (CSA), ii) linking traditional farming with school meal (MDM) programs, iii) enhanced market access and value chain development for local plant food resources, and iv) creating off-farm employment opportunity at community level for rural youths, among others, are explored in the present study. The need of re-assessing existing food and nutrition-related health and agriculture policy, and developing cross-sectoral implementation strategies on food and livelihood security, nutrition, and health was also addressed. The outcomes are expected to set priorities for state policy for a more profitable local level agriculture and regenerative food system.",

Despite their potential to improve the well-being of arable cropping systems, sufficient production of high-protein legume grains in Europe has not been achieved due to multiple barriers. The reasons are multiple and span economic, agronomic, research, and extension services, as well as aspects of culture and traditional dietary habits. Given the well-documented advantages of legume-supported production systems and diets, that include ecosystem and health provisions, acknowledging and promoting legumes as cornerstone species for more sustainable agri-food systems is a necessary and logical step. This paper provides an integrated analysis of case studies and current policies that shape the production and consumption of legumes in Europe. This study identified three key pathways, which can be integrated into sustainable farming systems to support current and future food security challenges via the use of legumes and legume-based products. At each pathway, we identified several enablers that support the sustainability transformation of legume production and consumption in Europe.",

A comparison was made between conventional and the system of rice intensification (SRI) methods of rice cultivation by conducting two experiments. One field experiment was conducted from 2013 to 2017 at 25 locations across India under the All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Project and another experiment was conducted in 2017 using surveys by collecting data from 262 randomly selected SRI farmers using a personal interview method in the Telangana state of India. The 5-year experimental data revealed that the SRI method of cultivation produced higher rice grain yield (up to 55%) compared to the conventional transplanting method. Survey data revealed that total costs of rice production reduced by 22.71% under SRI. Break even output under SRI was reduced by 58.1%. Adoption of SRI saved total energy inputs by 4350 MJ/ha. The energy productivities were 0.16 kg/MJ and 0.21 kg/MJ for conventional and SRI methods, respectively. Also, SRI resulted the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of 0.280 kg CO2e/kg rice grain. Therefore, for ensuring higher productivity, net returns, energy efficiency and sustainable rice production it is recommended to adopt an environmentally friendly SRI method of crop establishment in the Telangana region of India.",

The visions are based on focus group discussions with agroecological farmers and pastoralists, and a multi-stakeholder workshop with farmer and pastoralist representatives, innovative food system actors, and researchers. We find that the envisioned transformation of the food system would lead to positive effects on farmers' and pastoralists' income, autonomy, long-term planning, and producers' and consumers' health. We conclude that new policies and financial support systems are needed to enable the expansion of agroecological farming and food systems, by increasing the availability of organic markets, supporting domestic botanicals production, and by creating more inclusive and just food value chains.",

    "abstract": "Transformation to sustainable agriculture in the Netherlands is increasingly called for. Agroecology is acknowledged as a sustainable – potentially transformative – alternative for conventional methods of agriculture. However, few farmers adopt agroecological practices. Recent literature suggests failure to achieve sustained and transformational change may be due to neglectance of personal, nonmaterial aspects of such processes, also referred to as \"inner\" dimensions of sustainability. Aiming for empirical underpinning, individual transition pathways of nine agroecological farmers were explored, and processes of change were analyzed using a conceptual framework of \"zones of friction and traction\" across three interconnected and embedded spheres of transformation: the personal, the practical and the political. The chosen framework allows for seeing the role of the personal aspects of transformation, without losing sight of pressures and influences from the \"outside.\" Identification of zones of friction and traction revealed where and why transformation was happening, as well as the drivers behind farmers' choice and passion for agroecology. We argue that focus on the \"inner\" dimension or personal sphere is foundational to sustained transformational change in the practical and political spheres, i.e. the outside world. The presented findings have implications for strategies targeting envisioned transition toward a sustainable food system.",

Whilst farmers' self-organization represents a core process in the development of Agroecology-based Local Agri-food Systems (ALAS), the development of collective, economic structures among agroecology-oriented farmers' is still weak. In an attempt to understand why and how agroecology-oriented farmers are constructing their own position within ALAS, and the challenges they are facing in this sense, we conducted a qualitative study on the self-organizational processes and structures of five Agroecology-Oriented Farmers' Groups in Spain. Based on 27 interviews and six online, participatory workshops, our results reveal different reasons for joining and setting up farmers' groups as non-mixed collective spaces, with instrumental and social factors constituting the principal motivations. Politics and advocacy aroused controversy and were only observed in the biggest, most powerful and well-structured organizations. The main challenges identified refer to the precariousness and isolation of farmers, as well as of the different local groups. The weakness of the Agroecology-Oriented Farmers' Groups highlights the need for further action-oriented research and accompaniment",

We reviewed more than 100 papers and selected those that reported the advantages of these systems. Oil palm-cattle integration has been implemented in some Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, but it is not widely adopted by oil palm plantations. These systems are mainly driven by policies to enhance food security and reduce environmental impacts. Oil palm-cattle integration can contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals, such as (SDG 1 and 2) no poverty and zero hunger, because it allows for more and diverse food production on the same land, and it increases the income per hectare by up to 15% due to higher oil palm yield (up to 4 t FFB/ha) and lower weed control costs (up to 60%) with rotational grazing. It can also support (SDG 6, 12, 13) responsible production and consumption, clean water and sanitation, and climate action, because it can decrease herbicide use, enhance biodiversity (understory and beneficial species), and improve soil quality. Moreover, it can mitigate the risk of indirect land use change associated with deforestation.",

Yet achieving such agroecological transitions presents enormous challenges in industrial agricultural landscapes dominated by consolidation and overproduction. We examine both the challenges and the opportunities for agroecological transition in one particular industrial agricultural context: the fumigant-dependent strawberry production of California's Central Coast. We do so by exploring adoption of Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation (ASD), an agroecological alternative to fumigation which has shown considerable promise but has been historically underutilized. Building on previously identified \"domains of agroecological transformation,\" we characterize the enabling and disabling conditions for agroecological transitions in California's agricultural landscape. Through semi-structured interviews with farmers, extensionists, and industry stakeholders we uncover significant regime lock-ins: most prominently insecure land tenure and unequal access to land, unequal systems of exchange, and a culture that favors silver bullet narratives and top-down knowledge transfer; as well as drivers of change. The case of ASD, we conclude, reveals that technology-led agroecological transitions will have difficulty succeeding unless they are embedded in broader efforts to transform the social and political relationships of industrial agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Agroforestry is a widely proposed solution for climate change adaptation and resilience in agriculture due to the multiplicity of socio-ecological benefits. However, agroforestry as a practice exists on a dynamic scale of ecological complexity, which may cause different management regimes to respond distinctively to climate change. Due to the limited literature on climate change impacts on agroforestry in the temperate region, this paper reviews disturbance regimes and the observed and predicted responses of forests and farms using the US Northeast as an example. We also reference scholarship from tropical regions, where agroforestry adoption/study is more advanced, to enhance understanding of the growing field of agroforestry in temperate systems. We view transitions to and from agroforestry from a complex systems lens by identifying the disturbance, complexity, resilience, and adaptive capacity of systems to drive and respond to rapid change via human management, focusing on invasive species, phenological changes and range shifts in plants, pests, and pathogens of agroforestry systems. Management considerations including structural diversity, species selection and the intentional/non-intentional incorporation of introduced species can promote community ecological resilience to build systems that have adaptive capacity to withstand changing conditions.",

Croplands lost significantly more carbon (110 g Cm−2) than managed grasslands (29.9 g Cm−2) and there was little statistical influence of climate, soil, or management practice on annual NEP.

Despite extensive research on cover crop benefits, relatively few studies focus on regions with hot and dry climates. We evaluated the impact of cover crops on soil carbon and nitrogen and the associated net benefits, using data from a randomized experiment on two organic vegetable farms in the arid subtropical Rio Grande Valley of deep South Texas. Our cover crop treatments included sunn hemp, cowpea, sudangrass, and a mixture of the three. We found higher soil carbon and nitrogen additions in the second year of implementing cover crops, with greater nitrogen benefits from legumes in wetter conditions. The economic value from improved soil carbon ranged from $320 to $4,364 per hectare and from added soil nitrogen ranged from $69 to $2,047. The per-hectare cost of cover crop ranges from $387 to $539. When comparing the benefits with costs, we observed a positive return in most cases. Our results indicate the long-term rate of return from implementing cover crops in irrigated organic vegetable systems can potentially be as high as 709% for carbon sequestration and 280% for soil nitrogen enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urban areas are expanding into the countryside, changing the rural landscape and lifestyle of rural communities, and forming an urban-rural interface at these peri-urban areas. New developments brought about by urbanization have important implications for the livelihoods and socioeconomic conditions of local communities. At the peri-urban area, the future of agriculture, farmland, and farmers, especially in the face of massive urbanization, has become a topic of increasing global debate. Concerns have been polarized between two camps: a pessimistic view that peri-urban agriculture is in danger and an optimistic view that, despite the challenges, agriculture is still in practice and in some cases even growing. Several studies have addressed the current trajectories of agriculture in peri-urban areas; however, most of these studies were undertaken in Western nations. In the context of Asian countries, like Malaysia, agricultural adaptation and persistence at peri-urban areas have not been examined. It has been taken for granted that urbanization always leads to the abandonment of agricultural land. The role of urbanization in generating alternative agricultural enterprises that benefit from nearby urban markets has largely been ignored. This article aims to investigate the challenges and opportunities generated by urbanization and recent developments that have taken place in Malaysia. Using the Seberang Perai region of Penang State as a case study, our analysis reveals that farmers have adopted a range of strategies that could be explained using both positive and negative adaptation of Johnston and Bryant's (1987) model. This study moves forward the literature on the future of agriculture in peri-urban areas, particularly in developing countries.

The components of the package include Pseudomonas-enriched mycostraw, Azospirillum, and cyanobacteria for different niches. Enriched mycostraw had thrice the amount of nitrogen and sulfur, twice the amount of phosphorus and 1.3–1.9 times potash and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn) than rice straw and showed a 17.3 C:N ratio. Such bionutrient package application for four consecutive years resulted in an increase in fertilizer use efficiency (5–10%), ARA activity, Azospirillum preponderance, and soil nutrients like total nitrogen (4–5%), total phosphorus (0.7–1%), organic carbon (14–16%) compared to the initial value. Improvement in all the above parameters was reflected in augmentation of grain yield (17%) and straw yield (14.1%). The bionutreint package, when tested at farmers' sites, showed an increase of 6–20% and 10–35% rice grain yield in resource rich and resource poor farmers, respectively, over the farmers' conventional practice. Varietal difference did not have any influence on benefit derived from the bionutrient package. A novel approach for the conversion of rice straw into mycostraw (organic manure) and its enrichment with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is also proposed.",

Through farmer resilience workshops based on plausible disturbance scenarios of climate change, seasonal flooding, energy price spikes, and rapid urbanization, farmers identified further threats to farm systems, possible thresholds of undesirable change in farm systems, and adaptive strategies useful in addressing the examined threats. It is clear that adaptive strategies become more complex at scales beyond the farm level. Further, individual commitment to a rural, farm lifestyle was an important component of whether a farm operation would thrive within larger nested systems. At the same time, farmers in the study recognized the need to re-frame agricultural policy in the United States away from emphasis on the stabilization of prices, and more towards farmer autonomy within agreed-upon guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer in crop production in China leads to environmental problems, and farmers' lack of knowledge is the primary constraint. The public extension system, however, lacks the accountability and capability to deliver ecoagricultural extension services to farmers. Previous studies show that extension staff had little incentive to deliver extension services because they were overwhelmed by assigned non-extension activities. By applying a combined incentive scheme of cash rewards and political motivation on extension agents from 2009 to 2010, we found that knowledge training effectively reduced nitrogen use by 7% with no impact on yields in wheat production in two locations in Shandong Province, a major grain production region in north China. As such, improving nitrogen management has a great potential for a low-carbon agriculture in China and should be included into the extension program. However, the effectiveness of the training depends largely on the institutional capacity of the local extension system, which varies by region. In counties where extension employees were overwhelmed by assisting township administrations, a pure economic incentive without a long-term commitment was not effective. In the future, China faces challenges with delivering low carbon technologies through the existing agricultural extension system.",

A case study was conducted to assess food plant and livestock diversity and to identify the biophysical and socioeconomic factors influencing food plant diversity in 30 smallholder farms in Western Kenya. The survey identified six livestock species and 59 food plant species. Higher food plant species richness was found on farms managed by wealthier households and older household heads. However, households with high on-farm food plant richness and diversity were not more food secure than households managing species-poor farms. The nonsignificant relationship between food security and agrobiodiversity during the time of this case study may have resulted from the fact that the surveyed 30 families sourced significant proportions of their food from markets and did not fully depend on their farms for food, particularly for spices and condiments, fruits, and animal source foods. Therefore, we suggest a diversification of farms through livestock and fruit tree farming for improving dietary diversity and incomes of the surveyed households.",

    "abstract": "Palm heart from juçara palm (Euterpe edulis) has been one of the most important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) from the Brazilian Atlantic forest since 1960s, but overharvesting, among other factors, drove the species near to extinction. However, the recent conversion from extraction of hearts of palm to berries harvesting for pulp production, a nondestructive use, had a remarkable effect on species conservation and its potential for cash provision and forest landscape restoration. Pulp production from E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest is strongly benefiting from the traditional and expanding market of açaí pulp produced from Euterpe oleraceae in the Amazon Basin. In this article, we assess the current status of this new NTFP from E. edulis in the State of Santa Catarina, tracing a parallel with the açaí production chain in the Amazon. In addition to a literature review, we surveyed the production chain and interviewed key stakeholders. Production of juçara pulp soared from 5 tons in 2010 to 97.76 tons in 2011, but production is clearly far from fulfilling the fast growing demand. With 115 fruit collectors, management in backyard agroforestry represents 80% of production, with the secondary forests providing the remainder. Two types of producers in Santa Catarina—industrial and family farmers—are distinguished by their form of processing, production scale and sales. Familiarity of farmers with juçara palm as well as the better infrastructure of the region compared to the Amazon gives juçara pulp good condition for the development of the production chain. Nonetheless, it is clearly important to define strategies under public and private policies for research, development, and dissemination of sustainable production models, based on the ecology of the species, landscape structure, and sociocultural values.",

The aim of the study is to characterize strategies that periurban farmers adopt to contribute to local food provision through ALFSCs. We surveyed a sample of 55 farmers in the urban region of Pisa, Tuscany (Italy). By combining qualitative and quantitative analysis of on-farm surveys, this study characterized three farmers' strategies, depending on the percentage of production they allotted to local markets: few/passive, intermediate/opportunistic, entire/active. The main factors influencing each strategy were personal and professional bonds, diversification of the commercial network, and the number and the diversification of products sold in ALFSCs. Even though farmers can allocate 100% of their production to ALFSCs, most farmers combine ALFSCs with conventional food chains, suggesting that hybridization has advantages for the sustainability of these farms. Farmers who adopt an opportunistic strategy appeared more dynamic and adaptable to local opportunities and constraints. This analysis will offer empirical evidence about the participation of farmers in ALFSCs and especially about the hybridization between conventional and alternative food chains, contributing to the characterization of the local supply of produce, with benefits for community food security.",

A multivariate statistical analysis was conducted to analyze and group the case farms and assess the scores of each component of sustainability. Results show that agroecological sustainability of a farm depends on its autonomy in using resources and the extent to which its production system is diversified. Farm structure and the choice of production system affect economic sustainability. The farmers' preferences and social values influence socio-territorial sustainability. No farm is able to obtain a high total sustainability value (max 55/100), with the economic dimension varying in opposite directions to the agroecological and socio-territorial dimensions. The implications of the choice of the assessment method on the sustainability results are discussed, as are the consequences of agricultural policies on the farms' sustainability.",

A study was therefore conducted to improve understanding of rainfall variability management using the farm typology, and snowball and focus group discussion approaches. Farmers across all categories highlighted experiencing changing climate patterns. Resource-constrained farmers utilized non-finance demanding strategies like mulch. Mixed farming households utilized crop and livestock-based strategies such as manure. All farmers highlighted inadequate funding as a challenge. Enterprising pensioners and horticulture-dependent farmers cited lack of climate information as an impediment. Combining this knowledge with seasonal forecast information potentially results in improved climate variability management.",

This study investigated the impact of the public agricultural extension activities in enhancing the transition to agroecological approaches, in particular organic farming, in south-eastern Nigeria. Data were collected from 30 farmers and 20 extension personnel using in-depth interviews. The respondents were selected using a purposeful random sampling technique. The results show that extension and advisory activities are influenced by current agricultural policy. Extension personnel currently focus almost exclusively on intensive agricultural practices because of the agricultural transformation agenda which surprisingly ignores the principles of organic farming. Factors such as policy, social, environmental, research, and extension management were observed to impede organic farming transition. It is concluded that there is need for a clearly enunciated organic agriculture policy that supports farmers, organic agricultural research, and information dissemination. A participatory approach in policy formulation and information dissemination that incorporates farmers' traditional knowledge with capacity to strengthen the agricultural information dissemination structure is recommended to improve agroecological transition.",

The results of logit transformation models suggest that crop diversification is generally constrained by technological factors (land and labor), and mitigating income and production risks are key motivations among poorer farmers.

First, I elaborate the notion of lock-ins that impede systemic change.Looking at Australia reveals an array of socio-ecological lock-ins that matter alongside the more familiar political economy lock-ins. These include settler colonialism, climate/environmental change, and scientific & technological priorities. Second, I add 'massification' (or the growth of a movement supporting change toward agroecology) as one possible process for overcoming these lock-ins. I work through several key drivers of the process of taking agroecology to scale to show how agroecological transition might happen.",

Alternative food networks are initiatives related to food provision that operate at a local level and are concerned with both environmental stewardship and social justice. This paper presents a case study of alternative food networks operating in Brisbane and Melbourne in order to analyze: i) their socio-economic and environmental contributions to the resilience and sustainability of urban food systems; and, ii) the limitations that alternative food networks are facing. The cases researched include examples of urban agriculture, food hubs, buyers' groups, and specialist retailers. The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation. The limitations to the expansion of alternative food networks are also discussed, including the restricted access to land for growing food, low public engagement, and the dependence on volunteer labor. The paper concludes by summarizing the contribution of alternative food networks to urban food systems and identifies issues for future research.",

Our results show that state policy toward agroecology can be described as ambivalent. On the one hand the ministry of agriculture has found instruments to promote further existence of small farmers, for example by a special support program and the promotion of short distribution channels. On the other hand, neoliberalism and the associated agri-export model present major barriers for a scaling up of agroecology. Finally, we argue that for effectively supporting agroecology, state actors would need to orientate toward feminist theory perspectives and create conditions for peasant organization to bloom.",

However, there is not a unanimous understanding of these approaches and few studies investigate its implementation. Transdisciplinarity is defined lato sensu as the practices of collaboration and knowledge integration between non-academic actors and scientists. This approach is at stake in Europe, especially in the field of food systems. Our aim is to analyze the magnitude, conceptions and praxis of works from European agroecologists claiming transdisciplinarity. Based upon a content analysis of publications and interviews with some of their authors, our results show that, although there is a growing literature on transdisciplinarity in Europe, the proportion of publications is low compared to the overall publications in agroecology. Despite the global aspiration of using it as an approach to achieve cognitive justice and horizontal knowledge construction, our typology of transdisciplinarity in practice shows a diversity of patterns. Four clusters were identified, ranging from genuine co-creation of knowledge to uneven collaborations between scientists and stakeholders, thus questioning scholars' responsibility As a nascent and promising domain, transdisciplinarity in agroecology should be encouraged in European research and experiences capitalized.",

In response, in this article we conceptualize a co-inquiry approach for agroecology research adopted from participatory action research and explore its operationalization and outcomes with a group of organic horticultural farmers in Argentina. We assess how co-inquiry considers farmers' experience in the knowledge co-creation process to achieve contextualized research questions and actionable results, and reflect on potentials and constraints of extended roles attributed to farmers and their increased control over inquiry process and contents. We found that co-inquiry facilitates extended roles of farmers as co-researchers and thereby encourages horizontal learning based on systems thinking, through a joint explorative assessment of the systems operators' purposes, context, and experience, and through joint choice of methodology, experimentation and reflection.",

Our team and coffee cooperative staff conducted a participatory action research mixed methods study, including 171 surveys and 50 interviews. Over 70% of the farmers reported self-initiated diversification activities. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation between crop diversity and dietary diversity, while controlling for farm size and income. To assess gender relations females responded to 41% of the surveys, and we separated focus groups by sex. Average male-owned farms were 1.8 ha larger than women-owned farms, yet we found no significant differences in household food security or dietary diversity. Additional disparities included male vs. female perceptions about who does additional diversification work and who decides about strategies. Although the co-op has a strong gender equity and technical assistance program, our analysis of extension training documents identified useful content and a smaller percent of female participants in diversification vs. gender sessions. Suggested strategic actions for co-op planning include supporting: (1) female land ownership, (2) diversification focused farmer-led experimentation, and (3) more training for men on gender, women on diversification, and all participants in feminist agroecology.KEYWORDS: AgroecologygenderCentral Americadiversificationfood sovereigntyparticipatory action researchClimate adptation AcknowledgmentWe are grateful to PRODECOOP staff and families, the facilitators and promoters of each cooperative, and the members of our project team as well as support from Raul Diaz, Rosario Herrera, and the team at ASDENIC in Nicaragua as well as Universidad Nacional Agraria (UNA).

As general management strategies, agroecology proposes the promotion of soil health, the diversification of vegetation, and a greater landscape heterogeneity. To prevent diseases, it is also necessary to consider specific practices for these organisms, (i.e. genetic resistance, seed treatments, crop microclimate management). In this article, we review the main contributions to agroecological management of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses, including the literature on ecology of plant pathogens and holistic approaches that consider social processes. We start from a critique of integrated management and propose to broaden the disease triangle considering the biological interactions with plants, animals, microorganisms and the holobiont (plant and its microbiomes). We review how general strategies and specific disease management practices affect the different functional groups of plant pathogens, understood as a community. Finally, we emphasize that the objective from an agroecological viewpoint is to promote healthy crops. For this it is essential a holistic approach that considers the socio-economic context of farmers, values local knowledge and promotes collaborative social networks.",

SLSI as a composite index of its three components of ecological security index (ESI), economic efficiency index (EEI), and social equity index (SEI) works as a powerful policy tool for identifying the necessary conditions for sustainable development of agriculture in planning and development units of Vaishali district, Bihar. SLSI-based spatiotemporal analysis revealed that there is wide variation in agricultural sustainability and its three aspects (ESI, EEI, and SEI) within blocks during 2000–2003 and 2007–2010. SLSI has also proved to be effective planning instrument for analyzing the performance and changing status of three aspects of sustainable development of agriculture in different blocks of the district. SLSI identified blocks which require immediate attention for sustainable development of agriculture (SDA) and helped to focus the priorities for attaining livelihood security. Thus, SLSI approach can best be utilized for assessing sustainable development of agriculture and creating holistic perspective of environment and socioeconomic development of the region.",

Using this data we assessed livelihood diversity and performed a cluster analysis to develop a preliminary typology of U.S. permaculture farms. Farms were predominantly small in scale, with a high proportion of young farmers, new farmers, and new farms, when compared with national figures. Diversity of farm-based income was high for enterprises and across seasons. Cluster analysis based on sources of income produced a preliminary typology with five categories: small mixed annual and perennial cropping (N = 10), integrated production (perennial and animal crops, N = 5), a mix of production and services (N = 9), animal base (N = 5), and service base (cultural services and material products and services, N = 5).

This article uses interlinked social, ecological and technical systems theory to investigate why agricultural biodiversity-rich developing countries fail to utilize \"agroecological competence,\" particularly natural resource-based competitive advantage, to achieve food security despite substantial investments in \"technological competence\" development. Empirical study involves a critical examination of two food security strategies: improving subsistence agriculture to contribute to Nepal's national food security strategies, and promoting high value agriculture integrating Indian farmers into global commodity supply chains. Findings from these countries at very different stages of economic agricultural development suggest that low and middle-income countries, irrespective of their economic growth, cannot succeed unless technological competences are complemented by critical systems of \"learning competence.\" Keywords: socio-ecotechnical systemscritical systems of learning competencecomplexityagricultural biodiversityIndiaNepal Notes Color versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online at www.tandfonline.com/wjsa 1.

Unless these research results—technology and theory—are put into practice—policy, programs, and projects—it will be impossible to generate development impacts at scale. In response to this challenge of the dominant scientific practice, it has been increasingly recognized that there is a need of engaging potential users of the research results in scientific research through processes such as participatory action research, community-based participatory research and development and a range of other experiential learning opportunities. 3. The eight centers of crop diversity are as follows: 1) Southern Mexico and Central America, 2) South America, 3) Mediterranean, 4) Middle East, 5) Ethiopia, 6) Central Asia, 7) South Asia, and 8) China. 4. Top five countries with highest mango yield are Cape Verde, Samoa, Cook Islands, Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Puerto Rico. 5. While LI-BIRD researchers were mostly safe and sound because of their extraordinary research and development work, most nongovernmental organizations abandoned their research and development interventions in rural communities, and public sector scientists and extension agents remained vigilant about security situations due to the increasing civil unrest in the country during the decade-long war between Maoist insurgents and the government forces. 6. The initial form of Vijaya existed only until 1999. Then from 1999 to 2002, the Vijaya was renamed as the Vijaya Sun Gold Agri Farms and Exports Ltd., a public limited company. The Vijaya was again restructured as the Association of Fruit and Vegetable Growers representing 217 individual members in order to revitalize collective action in mango export. In 2006, one of the key actors of the Vijaya, who ran a family business of agricultural input sales since 1975, called Vijaya Laxmi Agro Service Centre, diversified its activities to include marketing of agricultural produce in response to the failure of Vijaya to serve its members (CitationPant et al. 2012). 7. Local classifications of small, medium and large holdings respectively refers to mango orchards of 5 acres or less, 6–10 acres, and more than 10 acres.",

    "abstract": "Managing carbon storage at the landscape level through emission reduction and carbon sequestration is emerging as a viable local response to atmospheric carbon loading from anthropogenic activities. The conversion of uncultivated land uses and land covers (LULCs) to arable or perennial cropping systems is widely recognized as resulting in significant decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). Minimizing conversion and advocating alternative management of these cultivated land uses have been identified as having the potential to minimize this loss and potentially sequester atmospheric carbon. However, effective landscape management requires a more rigorous understanding to inform local decision-making. This review of published studies within diverse Mediterranean landscapes found that cultivated areas contained roughly half of the SOC of uncultivated LULCs, with vineyards often containing the lowest observed SOC levels in a landscape. Mitigation through alternative management can result in higher SOC levels than conventional management, but the latter is likely to be a fraction of the C loss from initial cultivation. However, the majority of relevant studies relied on shallow standardized sampling depths and other protocols that have been demonstrated to lead to miscalculations of existing SOC stocks. Novel sampling techniques and emerging research opportunities have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of this question and support scientifically sound carbon-based landscape management.",

However, data from living standards and demographic health surveys, and studies of poverty trends in various African countries show that urban agriculture—typically carried out on small parcels of land in urban areas using urban resources—contributes substantially to a) food production and b) farmers' incomes and livelihoods. On this basis, this article argues that urban agriculture empowers rather than limits. However, this article contends that for urban agriculture to realize its full potential of being a motor to power food security in cities in Africa, it must be understood and be considered as part of a broader socioeconomic and political reality. In turn, factors such as food safety, access, and distribution ought to be given careful attention by advocates of urban agriculture.",

The grassland is sour veld and only provides palatable material during the 6-month growing season. The experiment was conducted to assess the effect of intercropping maize with lablab on maize fodder, grain yield, and quality, social and economic aspects. The results indicated superiority of intercropping over sole cropping, with intercropping treatments showing consistent superiority across 4 years of the experiment. Maize grain and fodder yields were positively influenced by intercropping with lablab. The maize fodder and total fodder yields were higher in intercropped than in sole maize plots. The maize grain DM yield of the first harvest in maize-only treatment was not significantly higher than in M + L treatment. Intercropping significantly increased crude protein of maize leaves and reduced the leaves' fiber content. Crude protein contents were lower and fiber contents higher in maize stalks and leaves than in lablab. The field trial demonstrated that diverse plant communities in the form of intercropping provide sustainable production, positive environmental, and social impacts through reduced agrochemicals and are economically viable through cost avoidance and savings. The results of this study suggest that including lablab in traditional maize cropping systems can be beneficial when entanglement of maize is avoided by delayed under sowing of lablab.",

But rather than understanding theory as universalistic generalized explanation, we argue that agroecological theory focuses on the consequences of context. Such a focus leads agroecologists to offer contextually sensitive principles of general relevance but not universal outcomes, and thus generalizing without universalizing. We conclude by arguing that a contextual approach leads agroecologists to think in terms of the philosophical triad of ontology, epistemology, and axiology, taking seriously a wide range of perspectives as well as questions of justice.",

In recent decades, efforts have been made to repeat this success in 'orphan crops' through a network of regional and national organizations largely composed of public and not-for-profit institutions. Adapting to climate change is a key challenge for these networks. Here we seek to analyze the particular challenges that characterize efforts to develop climate-smart varieties in minor crops, using the example of cocoa. Cocoa is a high-value commodity with a global research network; however, to date it has not received sustained attention from major global research centers. We estimate that globally <100 new cocoa varieties have been released since 2000, and our analysis suggests that this low number is constrained not by a limited availability of germplasm, but by limitations in the infrastructure focused on the final stages of breeding. We conclude that selecting minor crops for a future climate requires a long-term, regional approach that exploits modern technologies, integrates participatory selection, and is managed through a centrally funded network.",

Four treatments in triplicates were used to investigate the growth of rice and green bean varieties under different combinations of inorganic fertilizer and water from the river and a striped catfish pond culture. The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cultured at low density without feeding in a canal adjacent to the rice field. Rice yields ranged from 3,514 to 4,023 kg ha−1 with no significant differences between treatments (p > 0.05). The yield of green bean ranged from 2,671 to 3,282 kg ha−1 (p < 0.05), with the highest yields for beans only receiving water from the striped catfish pond. The water quality concentrations decreased significantly when passing through the rice plots for almost all treatments (p < 0.05). Total phosphorus and nitrogen levels in the outflowing water were reduced by almost 50% compared to the inflowing water from the striped catfish pond. Overall, the results indicated that an integrated system generates both economic and environmental benefits as compared to monocultures.",

Sixteen goat grazing farms in southern Spain were monitored monthly from January to December 2011, including 42 quantitative and 9 social variables. A multivariate two-step analysis was followed (principal component and cluster analysis) and three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 grouped small herd-size and low-productivity farms with medium dependence on external inputs for animal feeding; Cluster 2 grouped medium herd-size and high-medium productivity farms which depended most on external inputs for animal feeding; Cluster 3 grouped large herd-size, high-medium productivity farms with low dependence on external inputs. There was no difference between Clusters 2 and 3 regarding milk productivity and there were few differences in terms of labor, economic, or technical indicators. According to these results, it is possible to obtain a satisfactory level of productivity and profitability, minimizing the amount of feed purchased. In general, farmers' job satisfaction was high and no differences were observed between groups.",

Recent publications and the results of an informal survey presented here confirm that growers now confront rising temperatures, distorted rain patterns, and increased problems with pests and disease – all of which threaten production and possibly even current coffee lands' suitability for future harvests. The industry's response has been to fund and promote new varieties designed to contend with the challenges, involving a plant breeding scheme that will undoubtedly take years to put into effect and be fully realized. Yet, the extant cultural practice of producing coffee within an agroforestry setting provides a ready-made and widely known land use that could help defend coffee from much of the onslaught that climate change brings to producers. Review of relevant literature and responses from the survey – \"voices at origin\" – allow for an argument to be made in favor of promoting agroforestry. It stands as a potential countermeasure against the direct threats of changing rainfall and temperature regimes and indirect challenges from pests, diseases and landslides, demonstrating how science-based evidence and local knowledge of the benefits of agroforestry are aligned.",

For example, to what degree do improvements in soil structural stability and the number and type of plant species contribute to yield variability with extremes of weather? The role that soil aggregation and carbon play in the resilience of soil, and thus plant growth in extremes of moisture availability, is not well interpreted. Ultimately, improving soil organic carbon (SOC) also improves soil water retention and availability, which extends the limits of environmental variation for optimum plant growth. Not only is a significant amount of organic carbon a major element in soil resilience, but there may be interaction with the diversity of plants, which becomes evident with cover crop and crop rotation systems in agriculture. More diverse rotations including cover crops are being tested to explore the mechanisms and benefits of multispecies crop mixes. This review will explore the role of SOC and plant diversity for cropping system resilience with lessons from the temperate North American climate.",

A framework addressing seven dimensions known to impact farmers' working conditions was used to interview 22 French cattle farmers adopting agroecological practices. Improving working conditions was rarely the main motivation of farmers to adopt agroecological practices. Although never completely anticipated, all farmers experienced an impact of the adoption of agroecological practices on their working conditions (e.g. changes in work organization, health or pleasure derived from work). Across farms, all dimensions were impacted but consequences on working conditions were situation specific. The framework allowed a comprehensive understanding, from farmers' point of view, on how working conditions are constituted and showed that farmers make trade-offs between different dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing practices have been debated based on production, environmental and workload impacts, but farmer wellbeing is only beginning to be explored. A panel-based online survey of 200 Canadian beef producers was undertaken in early 2020 with a descriptive aim to explore the uptake, management, mindsets, and wellbeing implications associated with AMP grazing. AMP practices were more common than expected (29%) as well as distinct in grazing regime, featuring fast rotation, and long rests. AMP ranchers reported high physical wellbeing, as well as systems thinking, nontraditional values, a priority for enjoying life and tendency to use a wide range of modes to learn about grazing. Other dimensions of wellbeing, environmental motivations, and gender dimensions suggested by smaller-n studies were not associated with AMP grazing in this work. These insights are important as the federal government begins to promote AMP grazing and its variants as strategies to combat climate change. More nuanced understanding of adaptive grazing and its trajectory would be possible via consistent, longitudinal surveys with improved operationalization of wellbeing concepts, more detailed exploration of educational background, inclusion of religious beliefs, and elucidation of management characteristics beyond grazing regime variables.",

It aims to identify opportunities for supporting RA as a viable pathway for sustainable food production. A mental model approach involving semi-structured interviews was used to recognize the important interconnected causal mechanisms at play within this grassroots agricultural system, as perceived by the study participants who have an interest in RA in the southeast Queensland context. It revealed two key interrelated themes driving uptake of RA in the region: economic viability of the approach and shifting values and priorities of consumers and producers. Inhibiting factors identified include limited access to local mentoring and advice, financial risk, and lack of supportive policies. We conclude that adopting RA in a given region provides an opportunity to explore its benefits and challenges in building resilient and sustainable food systems. Hence, facilitating grassroots experimentation should be seized as an opportunity for driving society's sustainability agenda.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of Covid-19 led to travel and market restrictions that impacted Guatemala's rural food systems. This distinct economic shock directly affected campesinos, or small-scale farmers who depend on subsistence and commercial food production. Some Guatemalan farmer organizations have been promoting agroecology for decades in efforts to strengthen rural livelihoods and food sovereignty, defend Indigenous rights, and adapt to climate change, and agroecology is positioned as a tool for resilience to various shocks. We consider the neoliberal cooptation of the concept of resilience, and its usefulness in preserving alternative and previous (Indigenous) practices. Data from surveys and semi-structured interviews with farmers and leaders at eight organizations that promote agroecology suggests that prior engagement with a farmer organization, enacted through both agroecological practices and social networks, contributes to campesino resilience to the pandemic's economic shock at the farm level, with regards to production and consumption. This study illustrates the range and diversity of strategies taken up by campesinos during the pandemic, and considers the importance of social networks for collective actions that increase current and future economic solidarity in campesino communities.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the correlations between the agroecological status of farms and their viability in agro-sylvo-pastoral systems located in the savannah areas of West Africa. The methodology is based on farm surveys (to assess agroecological farm status) and on farmers' focus group discussions (to assess viability at the farm level). Agroecological farm status was established by considering 15 agricultural practices: 4 on by-products recycling; 4 on soil protection; 4 on industrial inputs limitation; 2 on smart use of natural resources; 1 on cropping diversification; An agroecological (Ae) scoring system was used to establish an Ae ranking by farm type. Farm level viability was established by men and women farmers' focus group discussions: Inventory of viability enhancing and viability-weakening factors; Rating intensity of each viability factor. A scoring system was used to establish Viability ranking by farm type. Four iconic farm types were considered: Small crop-oriented (T1); Medium-size crop-oriented (T2); Large crop-livestock oriented (T3); Livestock-oriented (T4). The findings demonstrate that the viability of agro-sylvo-pastoral systems is not solely dependent on their agroecological status. The ranking of the four farm types, from the first to the last position, is T4, T2, T3, and T1 for agroecology; and T2, T3, T4 and T1 for viability. Our study reveals that T1 farms in Koumbia are not highly agroecological or highly viable. Similarly, farms with the largest cultivated areas (T3) and herds (T4) are not the most agroecological or viable. The best balance between agroecology and viability is struck by T2 farms. We recommend promoting the development of T2 farms that demonstrate the best congruence between agroecology and viability as a model for T1, T3, and T4 farmers. Depending on the agroecological status, one farm could be more or less viable.",

This is contributing significantly to the degradation of planetary systems and the vulnerability of food systems. The discourse coalition that has formed around the storyline of regenerative agriculture (RA) promises to address these issues by transforming food production and repairing ecosystems. The coalition has diverse contributors that interpret RA differently. This diversity will be difficult to retain as RA moves toward discursive structuration and institutionalization. There is a risk that discursive institutionalization might be achieved by shedding the more transformative RA discourses. This paper examines a volunteer-led co-operative, the Institute of Ecological Agriculture (IEA), as a case study on how accreditation systems might be designed to expand RA's discourse coalition and increase the capacity of those discourses advocating transformation to institutionalize.",

Farmer-managed experiments were established in two communities in the region during 2006 and 2007 using randomized split-plot designs. Maize monocrops and maize-roselle intercrops grown with different sources of nutrients were intercropped with both legume species, sown 4–6 weeks after maize. Neither the legumes decreased yields of maize nor roselle, whereas they caused a reduction of the weed biomass by 24–55%. Total aboveground biomass returned to the soil increased up to 36% and total N, P, and K uptake was increased on average by 52%, 24%, and 30%, respectively. Legumes acted not only as a N-fixing crop, but also as a \"catch\" crop, preventing N and K leaching. With its prostrate growth habit and adaptation to poor soil conditions, canavalia demonstrated agronomic advantages in comparison to mucuna.",

We randomly selected and conducted semistructural interviews with 61 dairy family farmers from four cooperatives in the Encosta da Serra Geral Region of the Atlantic rainforest in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The goal was to analyze their production and viewpoints about environmental variables after adopting management-intensive grazing (MIG). The overall results showed that when farmers changed from semi-confinement and continuous grazing to MIG they perceived improvements in production, livelihoods, and ecosystem services. Moreover, according to farmers’ insights, MIG could be a tool to increase water and soil quality, animal health, alleviate poverty, and complement Brazilian conservation efforts.",

This article characterizes the local technical knowledge on organic fertilizer and the diversity of practices, and analyzes the efficiency of these practices. An agricultural survey was carried out in 2006 for villages in southern Mali. Farmers' local technical knowledge was characterized beforehand by an original method. Crop residues and animal waste management practices, as well as the production and use of organic fertilizer, were followed and measured. The efficiency of each practice was evaluated considering the output/input ratio for biomass, carbon and nitrogen. Farmers identified five types of organic fertilizers with different characteristics, uses, and types of risks. The use rate of crop residues and animal waste into organic fertilizer and the nitrogen and carbon efficiency were correlated with the development of diversified and innovative practices of crop residues and animal waste management. The nitrogen efficiency depended on the use rate of animal waste, but efficiencies remained low (<0.15 for C and <0.37 for N) and significant losses persisted.

Known quantities of early blight inoculum (Alternaria brassicinae) and giant crab grass (Digitaria sanguinalis) seed were enclosed in bags and inserted into manure-based compost containing different sources of C: 1) manure–silage, 2) hay, 3) softwood, and 4) hardwood. Except for the manure–silage control, treatments represented C:N ratios prescribed by NOS. Bags were removed at five times during the compost process. Both pathogenicity and seed germination were reduced to zero by following NOS guidelines. Patterns of microbial enzyme activity illustrated that labile substrates were abundant in manure–silage and hay, but limited in softwood and hardwood treatments. For Objective 2, field trials were conducted at two farms. Compost treatments were applied after the first cultivation as mulch as follows: 1) manure–silage, 2) hay, and 3) hardwood. Non-mulched plots were used as bare controls. When compost was applied at a rate of 54.8 ton/ha (20 ton/acre), compost made with hardwood bark suppressed severity of early blight disease more than compost made with softwood, hay or manure–silage.",

Chili production was selected as the target intervention topic because of its importance in Aceh's economy. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess impacts of FFS; 270 FFS-graduate farmers were interviewed and eight farmer groups were surveyed. By integrating descriptive and simple statistical analyses, we measure immediate impacts of FFS, which also makes this study's methods and findings different from others in the literature. The results show that farmers' knowledge on agricultural practices increased significantly due to FFS. In addition, in the future, farmers expected that their chili yields would increase and their pesticide use would decrease. FFS improved farmer cohesiveness and information sharing. Farmers' knowledge of insect pests, diseases and natural enemies increased considerably, as did their awareness of pesticide-related hazards. In sum, FFS successfully delivered improved technology and enhanced knowledge to enable farmers to grow chili with sustainable practices and higher profits.

However, the roles of duck activities on rice physiological characteristics are unknown. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate mechanical stimulations of duck activities on rice physiological characteristics, and hence on morphology and anatomy. Here, we found that there were substantial variations in anatomical structure of the rice culm internodes and in lodging resistance of rice plants with and without the duck activities. Anatomical analysis showed a distinct difference between the RD and rice-no-duck (RND) treatments in culm wall thickness of the rice internodes. For internode N4, the culm wall from the RD treatment was more than 35% thicker than that from the RND treatment. In general, the epidermal layer of the rice culm was significantly denser for the internodes and the thickness of the culm walls increased from N1 to N4 under the RD farming system. Additionally, the areas of vascular bundles were larger and were better organized and structured in the RD treatment. Our results further revealed that the breaking-resistant strength increased whereas the lodging index of the rice culm decreased with duck activities.",

The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumaré Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumaré and Americana, São Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers' organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumaré, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture.",

Emerging legal frameworks later favored the institutionalization of agroecology. Currently, agroecology has both academic and institutional structures and is widely promoted by urban and rural movements. Nevertheless, tensions with the industrial agriculture paradigm are notorious in the public policies of national food and agricultural programs, representing a real challenge for those fighting to achieve sustainable agriculture.",

The paper utilises qualitative research methods. Primary data for the study have been collected and processed with the use of document analysis. Our findings suggest that the radical shift of agriculture in early 1990s was mainly driven by negative experience of the socialist model of industrial agriculture. However, the organic sector lost momentum in the later period of economic transformation (1993–1998), due to the underdeveloped institutional framework. This historical setting resulted in a strongly competitive relationship between the conventional and organic sectors in Czech agriculture. The study undermines the general notion that organic agriculture in post-socialist countries represents an outcome of policy-based measures, rather than the activities of a social (organic) movement. The conclusions of the study confirm the thesis that the organic sector cannot achieve a breakthrough in the absence of certain elements of the institutional environment (i.e. civil society, policy, consumers).",

The indexes of biodiversity showed, in general, higher values on organic in comparison with conventional management, but the differences were strongly affected by the crops. An index specifically designed to select the Carabid species, which benefit from organic versus conventional, was calculated in order to understand faunistic data on this group. Our data demonstrated that the spray intensity adversely affects the Carabid species richness, as proved by the lowest diversity values recorded in the conventional plots. The experiment, planned by following a \"system approach research,\" was suitable to understand the ecological sustainability in organic farming in comparison with conventional. The better conservation of arthropod fauna in the organic seems to be coherent also with the enhancement of organic matter in this system. For this reason, a holistic effect of the organic system can provide a reasonable interpretation of the better conservation of the living component and, in particular, of Carabid beetle biodiversity, during the four-year period.",

We examined the effect of indigenous (the traditional use of rotating fallow-based systems (toss) for livestock herding and soil enrichment) and non-indigenous farming patterns (the use of fertilizer input or no-inputs (non-toss)) on millet yields and soil characteristics in six villages in west-central Senegal. Soil samples were collected in 60 fields in six villages at 0–10 cm depth in 5 random locations in each field. Total yield was measured as head weight per m2 and head weight per plant. The use of toss systems and hybrid farming (toss + fertilizer input) provided higher millet yields than conventional and low-input systems, and the effects of chemical fertilizer were modest in the small amounts applied by the farmers (7 kg/ha of 15–10-10 N-P-K). Soil carbon and pH and the number of trees were the best predictors of millet yield, but the overall predictive power was modest (R2 < 0.34). This research sheds new light on the evolving role of local techniques and knowledge in the struggle to maintain agricultural productivity, as Sahelian communities confront soil fertility depletion and food insecurity.",

With a focus on Swedish farm production systems, farmers' views on the potential risks and possibilities of cultivating perennial cereals are discussed in light of the available knowledge regarding plant traits and ecological implications of perennial systems. Farmer interviews showed that potential changes in agricultural sustainability, if perennial cereals were to be introduced, are highly complex, and context specific. Perennial cereals could be part of a transition toward a more sustainable agriculture depending on how they are used in the local farming system and in the larger landscape. Efforts to increase the use of perennial crops require linking specific plant traits of the perennial crop to the properties of the farming systems where these crops would be employed.",

    "abstract": "Although the organic conversion process has been much studied, farm-level transitions to agroecosystems are less well understood. What transition pathways do they take? How can (or does) farmers' learning help to make such changes? What support measures can (or do) facilitate such learning? To answer such questions, a UK study identified farmers undergoing an agroecological transition and compared their practices with two prevalent models. As regards the Efficiency – Substitution – Redesign (ESR) model, our case-study farms had all three changes, but they were rarely sequential; agroecosystem redesign did not follow from Efficiency or Substitution measures, which readily provide endpoints rather than transitional stages. As regards the 'trigger events' model – Trigger, Active Assessment and Implementation – the three stages were often overlapping; triggers arose only when farmers' interpreted difficulties or opportunities as grounds to implement changes, which they had generally considered beforehand. More fundamentally, case-study farmers were unlearning conventional expectations by undergoing cognitive and affective shifts. Together those two models (ESR and trigger events) can provide heuristic devices for identifying farmers' agroecological trajectories in their diverse forms. Going further, better models of farmers' learning and action will be necessary for facilitating agroecological transitions and guiding relevant support measures.",

    "abstract": "Input-driven agriculture has led to an epidemic of impoverishment, farmer suicides, and environmental degradation in India, but has also shown consistent staying power in Indian politics. We examine the case of organic farming policy adoption to explore this paradox. Specifically, our objective was to evaluate how the state-wide Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) program (now formally known as Community Managed Natural Farming) in Andhra Pradesh, India came to be. Evidence was drawn from government documents, field notes from a ZBNF workshop and farmer interactions, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Results suggest that advocacy of civil society networks, champions within the bureaucracy, emphasis on rural livelihoods, and the 20-year history of consensus building around agroecology all played a key role in the adoption of the ZBNF program in this state. Given the possibility of scaling up ZBNF at the national level, our analysis of the enabling environment is especially timely.",

This problem is so wide and complex that it does not admit a short-term solution; rather, it must be addressed through measures in a process with long-term results. One of these measures may come from the urban agriculture, applied under the principles of agroecology. Urban agriculture is a complex activity that is currently associated with the idea of multifunctionality, placing emphasis on the various ecosystem services that it generates. However, urban agriculture continues to lack sufficient consideration in urban planning and management.

    "abstract": "Urban food policies are increasingly considered central instruments for the promotion of food systems sustainability. As for their social sustainability, justice and equity are expected to play a central role, but gender equity remains not fully developed. In order to explore how gender relations can be addressed in the context of urban food policies in global North settings, in this paper we analyze the drafting process of the Urban Food Strategy of Zaragoza (Spain), self-identified as agroecology-oriented and which aimed at introducing a gender-sensitive approach. Based on empirical insights from this case study, we show that a lack of reflection and empirical development exists on the food policy-gender equity nexus, while at the same time there is an emergent body of specific proposals to be obtained from feminist and agroecological reflections on urban lifestyles. Indeed, our paper shows that agroecological and feminist approaches converge in claiming for the visibilization of food-related care work, and in its de-privatization through community-based infrastructures. The paper also unveils limiting conditions which may hinder the transformative potential of agroecology and feminism in urban food policy co-production processes, such as top-down approaches to food policy production, weak participatory processes, and gender-blind decisions among city officers.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of salts in soils is one of the major challenges for food production in vast areas, and reclamation of these soils is too expensive for marginal farmers. We evaluated the existing practice (EP; gypsum application at 50% gypsum requirement (GR) followed by the cultivation of traditional varieties of rice and wheat) and the improved practice (IP; gypsum application at 25%GR+10 Mg ha−1 pressmud followedby the cultivation of salt-tolerant varieties of rice and wheat) at farmers' fields in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Effects of these treatments on rice productivity and profitability were evaluated over 3 years from 2011 to 2014. The soils at the study site were sodic (pH 9.2 to 10.4, EC 0.67 to 2.21 dSm−1) with an estimated GR of 8.5 to 13.6 Mg ha−1. All growth parameters recorded at 30-day intervals were significantly higher for IP than for EP, with 36.5% and 39.3% higher straw and grain yields, respectively. Significant interactions between sodicity levels × reclamation practices for grain and straw yields were observed. The use of IP on farmers' fields with pH values of 9.2, 9.6, 10.0, and 10.4 reduced reclamation costs by 258, 309, 376, and 413 US $ ha−1, respectively. The combination of reduced costs and increased yields in the IP reclamation treatment led to higher returns from rice farming. Because IP effects on yield became better at higher sodicity, only IP led to net profits ≥0 on all sodicity levels within three rice seasons, whereas under EP, this was achieved only for pH levels of 9.2 and 9.6. Soil properties such as pH, EC, organic carbon, and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and contents of cations and anions were improved significantly under IP than under EP. Thus, the improved practice of sodic soil reclamation has contributed substantially to improve the soil health, crop productivity, and farm income. Farm income losses reduced substantially after reclamation of soil and improved the livelihood security of resource poor farmers having salt-affected soils. This study suggested that a large part of agricultural land is being abandoned worldwide due to salinity or sodicity and need to be reclaimed on priority basis to improve the land productivity and farm income of resource-poor farmers.",

Self-defined criteria, transparency, trust, and accessibility have made PGS an attractive alternative to exogenous certification in local markets in over 70 countries. There is also increasing interest in the possibilities for participatory certification in international trade for family farm-based products such as cocoa or coffee. Bolivia's PGS was established in 2012. By 2017, the country ranked second (after India) in number of PGS farmers. Since 2019, however, its numbers are declining. Visiting six PGS initiatives, we interviewed 38 persons from production, processing, distribution, support networks, and policymaking on the current situation of PGS in Bolivia; its challenges; its prospects in local, national, and international trade; and the role of Bolivia's governmental PGS support. While PGS certification in Bolivia faces challenges – including high fees, weak consumer demand, and insufficient links to broader value chains – it displays strong potential to make locally managed sustainability certification more accessible. We recommend that decision-makers ensure accessibility and help promote PGS with consumers. Importing countries could support PGS, in particular by incentivizing access of PGS-certified products to their national markets by recognizing them as organic via peer-to-peer certification.",

This review collected and analyzed the policy landscape for AF and MF in 19 European countries. The results show that while the policy landscape in Europe has been growing for AF, with support found within the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy and Green Deal, as well as European state polices, direct MF support is largely missing. No country assessed supports AF in its entirety (traditional, establishment, yearly maintenance) although, there are countries like Portugal, which show robust policies for at least one of these aspects. This paper also assessed the degree to which policies found can be considered agroecological, or contributing to an agroecological transition. Our analysis indicates that while agroecological elements do exist in some of the policies, it is currently primarily on plot, field, and farm level, involving input substitution or the change of one practice for another. We conclude that policies are currently not designed in a cohesive manner, and at times work against one another. We therefore recommend that all future policies center themselves on the High-Level Panel of Expert's 13 Principles of Agroecology, as well as on transformative and inclusive policy design frameworks.KEYWORDS: Agroforestrymixed farmingagroecologypolicy analysisEU CAPenvironmental land managementsilvopasturesilvoarableforest farmingecologyeco-schemesecosystem services AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank all members of the AGROMIX consortium, which have contributed to this research.

    "abstract": "Agroecology is gaining increased attention by experts and global organizations; however, it's practical application in the field remains understudied, particularly in developing countries. Here, we aimed to evaluate common agroecological practices at three sites in Tanzania, including organic soil amendments, intercropping, and biological pest control – individually, in pairs, or in three-way combinations at each site. Information Communication Technology tools – the AgroEco Research and AgroEco Analysis application – were used for data gathering & storage and data visualization & statistical analysis, respectively. We found that high maize kernel weights (as proxy for yield) can be obtained from nutrient-poor soils specifically when grown with a combination of organic soil amendments and intercropped with legumes – ranging from 3 to 4.5 t/ha (with a maximum of 7 t/ha on one occasion) and exceeding national maize yields of 1–2 t/ha in Tanzania. However, intercropping and biological pest control individually and in combination did not affect maize yield. Under flood or drought conditions, only plots with soil fertility amendments produced some harvestable maize kernels. Our results provide a substantial reference for recommending and advocating agroecological methods to smallholder farmers, farmer training organizations, and policy makers.",

    "abstract": "Arthropods play vital roles in ecosystem functions, yet their distribution is subjected to environmental factors. Hence, this study investigates the impact of habitat features on arthropod communities within cocoa smallholdings under different farming practices: agroforestry and monoculture systems. We conducted arthropod sampling using yellow sticky traps and assessed the habitat features at each plantation twice to capture temporal variations in arthropod populations. The study recorded 2945 individual arthropods belonging to eight different functional groups. The most abundant functional group was saprophagous, followed by phytophagous, parasitoid, predator, mycetophagous, frugivorous, palynivore, and nectarivorous group. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), we found that the abundance of phytophagous and predatory arthropods increases with leaf litter, while it decreases with saprophagous arthropods. Our findings suggest that tree-crop diversification within cocoa smallholdings can play a significant role in preserving higher arthropod biodiversity, particularly when these smallholdings remain free from chemical insecticide use. Canopy cover was also found to positively affect the variability of arthropods indicating that it is a crucial factor affecting arthropod biodiversity. This study underscores the significance of integrating agroforestry systems into cocoa production landscapes, particularly those utilizing agrochemicals, to support diverse arthropod communities and promote sustainable cocoa production.",

While research has long focused on the manure contribution to soil fertility at the plot level, little has been done concerning livelihood conditions. The present paper aims to assess the contribution of manure use and exchange on the livelihoods of rural communities using an original dataset collected in 2021 among 150 farmers in Central Tunisia. This analysis is carried out within the analytical agroecology framework combined with factor analysis methods. Results showed that manure use and valorization differ along the watershed, from a socioeconomic perspective in small farms operating under rainfed tree-pastoral systems, to an environmental and agronomic perspective in the mixed rainfed-irrigated systems downstream. Manure flow analysis confirmed that on-farm manure balance is positively correlated to economic wealth. However, the manure fluxes questioned the environmental sustainability of the vulnerable zones. Its use and management could significantly impact livelihood discrepancies in the future, with the increasing of demand and use of manure in more favorable zones such as irrigated lands at the detriment of the rainfed zones.",

It was observed that integrating soil remediation practices with suitable irrigation techniques and scheduling can improve crop yield, conserve water, and enhance the long-term health of marginal soils, addressing the challenges of climate change, hunger, and environmental sustainability. The study also advocates for incorporating indigenous knowledge with physical, chemical, and biological soil remediation techniques, integrated with irrigation practices. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, offering insights and paving the way for future research and development in sustainable agriculture.

Looking at a range of current initiatives related to food system change, we suggest potential solutions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the food system and strategic priorities for firms, nongovernmental organizations, and policymakers. We conclude that focusing on food system localization, transport, and modal issues alone will not generate significant GHG reductions relative to other opportunities. Our analysis shows a potential for emissions reductions in various food system subsectors, particularly sustainable production, cooling and refrigeration, and food waste minimization. Localization savings will be modest unless combined with other changes in these sub-sectors. On the transportation front, only modal shifts from truck to rail or truck to ship, and improving trucking load efficiencies, appear promising, although potentially challenging. Notably, results highlight a possible differentiated strategy: Locally sourced seasonal fruits and vegetables show greater GHG reduction possibilities than do locally sourced animal products. Organic production appears to generate sufficient reductions to warrant strategic attention, but integrated pest management does not sufficiently reduce agrichemical use, while the heating requirements of greenhouses do not make them energy-competitive with long-distance field production imports.",

Intercropping systems had higher baby corn equivalent yield, land use efficiency (28.9–47.2%), area-time efficiency (2.7–15.3%), and monetary advantages, especially in 2:2 row ratios. Baby corn + pea (2:2) followed by baby corn + chickpea (2:2) seemed to be the best intercropping systems in terms of yield advantages and economic returns. Weeding increased yields by reducing competition and yield losses thereby increasing land efficiency and productivity. Intercropping improved soil health measured in terms of NPK, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, soil enzymes, microbial respiration, and microbial biomass carbon.",

Four distinct farm types were identified as follows: large integrated agro-silvopastoral (17%), small agro-silvopastoral (28%), pastoral (30%), and silvopastoral (25%). Irrespective of farm type, low availability, and difficult access to pasture due to increased crop/vegetable farming, climate variability and urbanization were commonly reported by all herders. Current coping strategies included the use of lowlands pastoral resources and exploring new grazing routes. Future strategies included moving animals towards rural locations and significantly (p < 0.001) depended on farm type and its proximity to urban centers.",

Soil nitrification rates were inversely related to soybean nodule production at the 1-m tree-crop interface (r = −0.64; p = 0.0260). However, regardless of inhibited nodule production, soybeans at the 1-m tree-crop interface were fixing N at high rates as compared to monocropped soybeans, possibly stimulated by belowground interspecies competition; nitrogen derived from atmosphere (Ndfa) in soybeans was highest when intercropped with spruce (75% Ndfa) and poplar (65% Ndfa) at the 1- and 4-m tree-crop interface, respectively. We show a shift in crop N acquisition strategies, as modified by tree species and distance.

Canopy arthropods and main olive pests were classified and aggregated upon functionality. Comparison between management systems was performed. Multivariate analysis was conducted with farming practices, climate conditions and landscape complexity as explanatory variables. Significant differences were not found between management systems, due to high variability of farming practices applied within the same management system. Factors linked to farm management, climate, and landscape explained arthropod variability better than management systems.

    "abstract": "Declining soil fertility is a major constraint limiting African agriculture. In a four-year (2007–2011) on-farm study in Malawi, we compared the effects of compost (bokash and liquid manure) and compost (bokash) in combination with low doses of inorganic fertilizer with recommended inorganic fertilizer rates on the performance of three maize genotypes. Compost use resulted in increases in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil pH. Chemical analysis of both bokash and liquid manure indicated the need to improve compost quality. In low rainfall areas and sites characterized by poor soils but with good quality compost, maize yields did not show significant differences between chemical fertilizer and bokash plus urea. Although it was not possible to quantify soil-water balance studies in these on-farm trials, it can be assumed that bokash helped in soil-water conservation in low rainfall areas, thereby, improving the ability of maize to withstand conditions of water stress compared with the effects of NPK fertilizer. While SC627 gave 29% higher yields under chemical fertilizer compared with bokash and urea, yields of both local and ZM621 were similar between the two treatments, suggesting that local and ZM621 are less responsive to fertility inputs. Our study showed that for maize hybrid variety, SC627, lower vulnerability to low yields is obtained from the application of chemical fertilizer. For both local maize and OPV variety ZM621, less risk of a lower yield is obtained when the plots received applications of a combination of bokash and urea rather than a total reliance on chemical fertilizer. The results of this study call for a more nuanced approach than the current recommendation permits.",

In the 12 years since the termination of the program in 1999, Indonesia has undergone profound changes as the country enters a new era of democratic reform. Government support for the national IPM program—and the farmer field school model it spawned—has wavered during this period, contributing to a resurgence of the very pesticide-induced resurgent pest problems that led to its establishment in the first place.

Diversity did not present a constant pattern or significant differences among management systems. Hilly orchards showed significantly higher seasonal total arthropod diversity and evenness. Abundance of functional arthropods followed a similar trend as total abundance and was seasonally significantly higher in hilly orchards.

This article analyzes the land use change and its impacts through the zaï farming practice in the northern part of Burkina Faso from a socioeconomic perspective, based on data gathered through two surveys in the Ouahigouya region. A survey among 101 farmers concentrated mainly on adoption rates and household characteristics. Later, 16 farmers from the first survey were interviewed with respect to their adoption of the zaï technique for soil restoration. Farm data was collected to cover the farms' and households' expenses and revenues for the year 2011. Material and labor input, as well as the obtained yields, were analyzed using the economic farm model OLYMPE. The results reflect the positive economic benefits of zaï cereal production at field and farm level when compared to conventional cultivation, but also point out the constraints to its further expansion. Despite higher input costs mostly related to external labor, the increased yields led to a more than three times higher gross margin per hectare for zaï millet (101,085 FCFA) than the conventional system (23,030 FCFA). Yet, the physically demanding intensive labor requirements during land preparation and implementation of the planting pits (+117 % man days/ha) challenge a broader adoption of the zaï practice. Nonetheless, in a mostly subsistence-oriented farming context the zaï practice proved to reverse severe land degradation and improve households' livelihood and food security.",

Drawing data from the Census of Agriculture, the organic index indicates that organic farming is primarily located in New England, along the Pacific Coast, the Northern Great Lakes, and the Western Mountains. Although neighborhood effects did play an important role in organic conversion, a small number of organic intensive counties are expanding in areas that are dominated by conventional agriculture. The regional differences of organic agriculture are associated with ecological factors such as climate and topography. Organic intensive areas tend to have more diverse farm operations, with more women operators and direct sales to people and the community. However, the results show mixed support linking organic production with better socioeconomic settings. Generally, the agroecology approach, which views agriculture and the food systems as being embedded in landscapes and a broader socio-institutional system, helps interpret the regional variation of organic agriculture. To capture organic heterogeneity, this study suggests that more analytical attention be paid to local socioeconomic contexts and the corresponding community-embedded relations.",

In total, 77 woody and herbaceous species have been recorded. The selective felling of trees and shrubs in the agroforestry system to favor coffee growth through enhanced light penetration also favors grass and herb diversity. A Factor Analysis based on the soil characteristics shows a gradient in soil fertility from both forests and agroforestry to croplands. The bulk density, pH, organic C, total N, available P, cation exchange capacity and base cations saturation of the forest soil are equivalent with that of agroforestry. However, forests and agroforestry are significantly different from croplands regarding those soil characteristics.

Meanwhile, agricultural and food systems associated with agroecological principles are progressively institutionalized in various countries. Whereas a dominant research production by agronomists consists in deduction of \"agroecological practices\" from fundamental agroecological principles, a gap remains between those principles and the specific management actions on farms that allow to build new agroecological framing systems. In this study, we stem from an analysis of management actions in eight different case studies corresponding to farmers' collectives engaged in an evolution of their practices towards agroecology. We review the agroecological scientific literature to identify shared principles and system properties deduced from them, that we iteratively compared to the practices implemented by farmers, making the transition in our case studies. Our proposal is then to describe agroecology \"in the making\" as 4 interconnected ways of acting, each corresponding to specific relations between management actions and the systems' properties. Lastly, the analysis of agroecology from the actors' management practices allows us to support a new viewpoint about a research agenda for agronomists, giving reflexive benchmarks to relocate research activities within the institutionalization dynamics of agroecology.",

The objective of this research is to analyse how perceptions and traditional knowledge influence the resilience of farmers in the Colombian Andes, in the face of climate variability, through a set of qualitative methods. The main identified perceived causes of climate variability were deforestation and pollution, while greater solar radiation intensity was the most mentioned effect, linked to crops and biodiversity loss. The most extended adaptation strategies consisted of on-farm, short-term agricultural measures, which favour a certain degree of adaptation but are limited in their potential to build up resilience. This research provides insights on the feedback between the perceptions and traditional ecological knowledge of peasant communities and the social-ecological factors that enhance or hamper their resilience towards climate variability. It is argued that successful strategies must respond not only to climatic conditions, but to the transformation of unequal economic and political factors that hinder resilience. Including these factors in research and policy-making is fundamental if resilience is to be achieved.",

Farmer training events, access to green manure and cover crop information, social participation, technical assistance (extension), and using chemical fertilizer significantly influenced, albeit weakly, farmers' adoption of conservation agriculture practices. The results support further research to effectively refine agricultural adoption modeling.",

    "abstract": "Substrate nutrient and moisture management are two major concerns in green roof agriculture, especially when using extensive systems, but there are currently no recommendations or best management practices. The purpose of this study was to explore three mulching strategies (pine bark, living sedum, and no mulch) and three fertilization regimens (25, 50, and 100 g∙m−2 of 14-14-14 N-P-K slow release fertilizer applied twice each growing season) over two growing seasons to determine their benefits to rooftop agriculture. Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), peppers (Capsicum annuum), basil (Ocimum basilicum), and chives (Allium schoenoprasum) were grown. The 2010 crops outperformed those grown in 2011, likely because of the more extreme temperature and precipitation variations during 2011. When there were differences among mulch treatments, pine bark usually resulted in higher productivity than live sedum mulch. The effects of live sedum mulch on crop production were mixed, consistent with previous literature on the use of live mulches in agriculture. With the exception of whole plot, tomato, and cucumber grades, there was a positive dose response to fertilizer. Further research into more types of mulch, their effects on the green roof microclimate, and fertilizer composition and release rates is required.",

We found examples of similar agroecosystems in different Mediterranean regions, such as the masseira in Portugal and the mawasi in the Middle East. The navazo system of farming has been used throughout southwestern Spain for centuries and particularly at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River, the subregion that is the focus of our study. It is an ingenious system in which interconnected cultivated areas are established between dunes. Crops are planted in areas where the water table is close to the surface, meaning water is supplied by capillary action and tidal forces. The energy efficiency of this system and the way it is integrated into the natural environment makes it an interesting example of an inherited agroecosystem and a sustainable agriculture model. Since the continued use of the navazo is threatened by agricultural intensification and urban development pressures, this work aims to characterize this endangered agroecosystem. This study also seeks to preserve related local biocultural knowledge, and to better understand the system's sustainability.",

In the context of increased interest for agroecological approaches, this study questions why and how farmers undertake such associations, in the case of smallholder irrigated agriculture in Tunisia. The objectives were to characterize the physical structure of existing olive-summer vegetable associations and describe the rationales of farmers implementing them. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data from 132 olive groves and 31 semi-directive interviews in the Merguellil plain, Central Tunisia. Dual crop input-intensive agroforestry systems were predominant, although agroforestry structures with a high species' diversity also existed. Adoption reasons and implementation of agroforestry systems varied. The latter were often perceived as an economically viable solution in a context of difficult access to productive resources. Particularly, limited and fragmented access to land or water was a strong driver of adoption, inducing contractual arrangements between farmers to share resources. Farmers implemented agroforestry systems mainly to maximize income, reduce production costs or reduce risks through a crop diversification strategy. Most characterized agroforestry olive-summer vegetable associations may fail to meet the principles of agroecology. Being already adopted by farmers, they may however serve as a base to conceive improved cropping systems.",

Organic agriculture began as a movement to counter industrial farming, and organic certification has played a significant role in expanding organic agriculture worldwide. Regenerative agriculture is a fast-developing industry that also offers an alternative to industrial farming. It has been dubbed as going 'beyond organic' to take a more holistic view of agricultural production and practices.

Despite their significant role, the evidence shows that women are not only structurally disadvantaged in the food system, but also their contributions are often undervalued. Unraveling the gender dynamics in food systems is necessary to address gender inequalities and develop efficient, inclusive, and resilient food systems. Some positive actions toward inclusion are being integrated, however, more efforts are needed. To achieve sustainable food systems, gender equity, and women's empowerment are needed across different nodes of the food systems. Men and women have different experiences and different strategies throughout the food system. Therefore, understanding such gender differences could facilitate the development of gender-sensitive policies and programs that could help achieve sustainable, nutrition-sensitive, and inclusive food systems. We have used the most recent food systems framework developed by the High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) and examined the perspective on how gender dynamics shape men's and women's participation in food systems and to identify the entry points for improved gender equity and inclusion to attain sustainable food systems for healthy diets in low and middle-income countries.",

To evaluate soil health, farmers in this study cited using a range of indicators, including soil structure, crop health, growth habits of weeds, and soil biology. We found that these organic farmers possess extensive place-based knowledge of their local farming systems, and that this knowledge base represents an important source for innovation and adaptive management in scientific and policy-making contexts.",

In this paper, we review a number of global labeling and certification programs that could add value for coffee farms in India through the promotion of conservation and environmental protection. We provide results from a survey conducted on a sample of coffee farms in Coorg district, India, to assess their awareness and perceptions related toward certified coffee and environmental conservation in general. Survey results illustrate strong positive associations with the environment by coffee planters, particularly among certified and organic producers. However, price premiums for certified and organic coffee are relatively small. While the potential of conservation-oriented certification for coffee in Coorg could be relatively limited outside of a few individual-level niches, branding Coorg more generally as a conservation-oriented region could hold promise, leveraging and personalizing the uniqueness of the natural offerings from Coorg and tapping into burgeoning associations with place and region in India.",

Such efforts have recently targeted the production and consumption of these crops. The orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) is one of the most known nutritionally enhanced crops. However, access to quality planting materials of OFSP and most vegetatively propagated crops by farmers remains a major constraint. This study used discrete and count data regression models and data collected from 732 farm households in Tanzania to test the effect of participation on a project designed to break this quality \"seed\" bottleneck (via technology awareness and targeted access to clean planting materials) on a) the decision to conserve planting materials during dry periods for future planting and b) the number of conservation strategies used by farmers. The study found that participation in such a project increases both the likelihood of conserving quality planting materials and also the number of conservation strategies employed by the farmers. It also found that varietal attributes and the agroecology of the area affect conservation of OFSP planting materials. It concludes that awareness and access to clean sweetpotato planting materials of nutritionally enhanced crops promote farmers' conservation of own planting materials. The study discusses the policy implications of the findings.",

Four case studies were used to examine the results in depth and clarify the relationships between the three components of sustainability of dairy farms and between these components and the indicators. Case studies results demonstrate that the aggregation of indicators into a single score could remove information necessary for the comprehension. The visual integration through radar diagrams leaves the flexibility for the farmer to understand his scores and compare himself to peers.

This makes it difficult to identify systemic policy levers and potential unintended consequences of policies. Our research took a systemic approach to sustainability assessment and explored relationships between indicators and drivers within the small scale farming systems of Hoa Binh Province, Vietnam. Our results highlight rather poor sustainability performance. Crop yield and net farm income were low. Food self-sufficiency was a problem. Households were dependent on high rates of chemical fertilizers and pesticides while pest and disease occurrence was reportedly increasing. Irrigation water shortages were also an issue. We also found many interrelationships among drivers and indicators of agricultural sustainability. Household location, education level, labor availability, and ethnic minority membership were highly connected drivers that influenced several other drivers and indicators directly or indirectly. Policies targeted at these are likely to have broad systemic effects on sustainability performance. However, due to the connected nature of the system, there is potential for unintended consequences from well-intended policies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis article examines the process of agroecological research on beekeeping systems, developed jointly by the Temperate Agriculture Program of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Company (EMBRAPA), and the Institute of Sociology and Peasant Studies (ISEC), of the University of Córdoba. The investigation was carried out on different beekeeping experiences in southern Brazil: peasant family farms, settlements of agrarian reform, and Afro-descent quilombola and Guarani indigenous villages. The systems are managed in the contexts of agroecological farming and include \"Africanized honeybees\" and native \"stingless bees,\" integrated among trees and crops. We show that the dynamics of investigation that follows the guidelines presented by family farmers and traditional people contribute to their empowerment and to changing their own reality, favoring endogenous development and the dialogue of knowledge. The participatory experiences by ISEC and EMBRAPA Temperate Agriculture through the organization and mobilization of farmers and traditional people generated organizational structures that build local food systems. This joint initiative contributes to peasants' search for autonomy and food sovereignty, and strengthens the reproduction of this work toward the political dimension of agroecology.KEYWORDS: Africanized honeybeestingless beesfamily farmingagrarian reformquilombolasindigenous people ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research is inserted into the doctoral work of an Embrapa researcher in the Doctoral Program of the ISEC/UCO, Spain, and has the support of Embrapa Temperate Agriculture, Brazil, being part of activities in different projects related to agroecological transition and participatory construction of knowledge, led locally by teams of researchers from Embrapa and collaborators, technicians, farmers, agrarian reform settlers, quilombolas, and indigenous people.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the irreparable damage caused by conventional agriculture and its industry, a shift to sustainable agriculture is a more strategic and essential need now than ever before. To boost the transition, this study presents a new and comprehensive tool for assessing agricultural sustainability of paddy fields in Guilan Province, Iran. Based on relevant literature review, an investigation was made into the sustainability indicators which had theoretically been adopted by researchers in recent years. Then a set of indicators was introduced for examination and prioritization. The proposed structural model included three factors (social, economic, and environmental) and 62 indicators. All of the 62 indicators were developed into a valid and reliable questionnaire, and agricultural experts and researchers familiar with agricultural sustainability concepts and the situation of Guilan's paddy fields were surveyed about the feasibility of these factors as agricultural sustainability indicators. After that, based on the respondents' points of view, the weight for each of the selected indicators was measured using Minkowski fuzzy screening and Shannon's entropy method, and then final priority of indicators was determined by aggregating methods. Results show that the high priority sustainability indicators included social indicators: farmers' satisfaction and hope for farming jobs; economic indicators: income situation, ability of supply and competition; and ecological factors: cultivation pattern and conservation of natural resources.",

    "abstract": "Agroecology is a transdisciplinary approach focused initially on agroecosystems and then on broader agro-food systems, which responds to the growing problems arising from an increasingly globalized and industrialized agro-food system. Given that these problems are not homogeneously distributed worldwide, the emergence of agroecology could not be homogenous either. In fact, it is linked to regions, such as Latin America, which have suffered early and serious socio-environmental problems caused by industrialized agriculture. This explains why agroecology in Europe emerged first in Andalusia where, owing to a series of circumstances, there was a certain similarity with social processes unraveling in Latin America. The first part of the paper provides an account of the emergence of agroecology in Andalusia (and Spain), offering explanations about the context that made it possible and the actors involved. It also justifies the strong social and political content that agroecology had in Andalusia from the very beginning. This strong sociopolitical orientation made a very significant contribution to agroecological thought, becoming one of the fundamental pillars of its very definition as a scientific approach. The second section analyzes the circumstances that facilitated the realization of planned government action and sets out the consequences of its implementation. The final section draws certain conclusions about the specificity of agroecology in Andalusia and its contribution to the development of agroecological theory and practice on a global scale.",

This paper investigates energy flows and economic profits of two rice production agroecosystems in China. Results suggest that total energy input in rice-turtle-fish co-culture (RTF) was 18,889.63 MJ ha−1, less than that of rice monoculture (RM) (20,289.44 MJ ha−1). Total energy output in RTF was 82,836.57 MJ ha−1, higher than that of RM (77,221.21 MJ ha−1). The product safety index (PSI) in RTF and RM were −0.23 and −0.77, respectively, which indicated the products safety potential in RTF was higher than that of RM. The energy sustainable development index (ESI) in RTF and RM were 9.03 and 0.66, respectively, which illustrated RTF has abundant developmental potential, while RM is more of a consuming-type ecosystem. The output/input, gross profits, and net profits in RTF were 5.17, 99,531.30 CNY, and 98,729.96 CNY, respectively, all higher than that of RM (4.58, 11,335.67 CNY and 11,034.33 CNY, respectively). Consequently, RTF has greater potential to reduce agro-chemicals, improve energy use efficiency, and increase economic profits compared to RM.",

In Pakistan, there is a gap in cereal-based wheat–maize–wheat cropping systems that lasts between 70–80 days. This \"summer gap\" can be used for growing short duration legume crops, which can provide valuable grain, fodder, or green manure and can provide a sustainable input of N into agricultural systems. We have used a field-based study to determine the effect of biochar application to an alkaline, nutrient poor, soil on the productivity of legume crops grown during the summer gap. Overall, biochar application (50 t ha−1) increased the productivity and yield of cowpea, mungbean and Sesbania over two cropping seasons compared to unamended non-biochar controls. The integration of biochar and legumes could be a useful strategy for improving the overall farm productivity of cereal-based cropping systems in Pakistan, by delivering a sustainable input of N to soil and providing increased yields from this additional summer gap crop.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Mediterranean Basin is a climate change and biological invasion hotspot where recent warming is facilitating the establishment and spread of invasive species, one of which is the highly destructive South American tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta). This pest recently invaded the Mediterranean Basin where it threatens Solanaceous crops. Holistic approaches are required to project the potential geographic distribution and relative abundance of invasive species and hence are pivotal to developing sound policy for their management. This need is increasing dramatically in the face of a surge in biological invasions and climate change. However, while holistic analyses of invasive species are often advocated, they are rarely implemented. We propose that physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) in the context of a geographic information system (GIS) can provide the appropriate level of synthesis required to capture the complex interactions basic to manage invasive species such as T. absoluta. We review the PBDMs for two invasive flies, and use them as a basis for assessing the biological data available for the development of a PBDM for T. absoluta, and in the process identify large data gaps that using the PBDM as a guide can be easily filled. Other components for an ecologically based management program for this pest (habitat modification, natural and classical biocontrol, pheromones, and others) are also reviewed. The development of a PBDM for T. absoluta would provide the basis for an interdisciplinary agroecological synthesis of the problem and the role different control tactics would play in region-specific control of the pest.

Most assessments of cover crop adoption treat adoption as a binary variable, rather than as a continuum of practices, and do not use regression analysis to identify the drivers of adoption. In 2014, we surveyed organic vegetable farmers in Wisconsin to assess their use of cover crops in terms of cover crop acreage, species diversity, and complexity of management practices. We also used regression analysis to identify key drivers of cover crop use and assessed farmer and farm characteristics and perceptions of cover crops. Survey results and regression analysis show that cover crops are widely used by Wisconsin's organic vegetable farmers, but acreage, diversity, and complexity of cover crop use varied and have different explanatory factors. Cover cropping extent is negatively correlated with dependence on vegetable revenue, while cover crop species diversity and complexity are positively linked to more educated and experimental farmers. By using different measures of adoption and regression analysis, we can better understand how and why farmers are using cover crops, providing opportunities for improved adoption through research and policy interventions.",

The use of buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, as a living mulch intercropped with squash has been shown to reduce insect pests and diseases while increasing the abundance of beneficial insects; however, how to best implement buckwheat in squash fields has not been determined. Several arrangements of intercropping buckwheat and squash were evaluated, with and without the introduction of a natural enemy, Delphastus catalinae (Horn), to find a tactic that reduces insect pests and disease incidence while increasing marketable yield. Intercropping treatments included planting strips of buckwheat alternating on either side of the squash with and without D. catalinae (arrangement A), planting buckwheat in the middle of squash planted on both sides of the bed with and without D. catalinae (arrangement B), buckwheat planted on both sides of squash (arrangement C), and a bare ground treatment. Aphid densities and insect-transmitted viruses were reduced, while natural enemies were more abundant, in buckwheat treatments compared with bare ground treatments.

Specifically, in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, increased exposure to droughts and floods are expected. Local traditional knowledge in agriculture (LTKA) is proposed in this article as valid knowledge to ensure food availability under climate change, given its long experience in dealing with climate variability. Focused on water strategies, we have conducted a literature review on LTKA practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains complemented with a questionnaire of experts to identify LTKA-based practices that might be useful in climate-change driven water scenarios. The practices identified are categorized as a) water harvesting and recycling; b) local irrigation systems; and c) and maintenance, conservation, and water allocation. We found that a) despite acknowledging the potential of LTKA to face floods and droughts, very few studies explicitly make the link between LTKA and climate change; and b) LTKA in water management heavily relays on social norms and local institutions and, thus, any attempts to replicate it need to consider this. We conclude that agroecology can help to promote these practices since it emphasizes the collective management from below as the main approach for the design of sustainable agroecosystems and, thus, include local institutions as an essential strategy for adaptation.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between agroecological scaling and the agrarian question, based on Puerto Rico's contradictory agricultural and demographic tendencies in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We find that labor-based intensification, literally rebuilding and recovering the diversity of farms devastated by the hurricanes, is a necessary step toward scaling out agroecology in Puerto Rico. The rebuilding of farms requires both ample manual labor and accumulated local knowledge, two elements which are difficult to bring together in Puerto Rico due to a complex interplay of historical and social factors. Decades of public policy based on the belief that the small farmer is not essential to Puerto Rico have produced a series of obstacles for farmers who wish to recover their farms. The peasant economy, a field of study that recognizes peasant farmers as capable subjects of their own historical resistance – within and against economies of empire – can be a powerful tool in the effort to recover local food systems and (re)create a vibrant small farmer sector. Here, we explore peasant balances, a capacity to aggregate daily farm management decisions into coherent, multifunctional economic strategies that allow for dynamic responses to changing environmental, social and market conditions, and how these balances relate to Puerto Rican coffee farmers' capacity to stay on the land and transition toward agroecological production. Fieldwork included qualitative interviews with leaders of small farmers' organizations, Puerto Rican government officials and farmers in the mountainous central region between August 2017 and March 2018.",

Livestock production, in particular, receives criticism due to the land, water, and energy use, as well as the GHG emissions associated with these production systems. While acknowledging sustainability concerns regarding livestock production and consumption practices, we argue that livestock themselves form an integral part of sustainable agri-food systems. Livestock can act as a \"battery of nutrients,\" storing nutrients that would otherwise be inaccessible or lost to the agri-food system and making them nutritionally-accessible to humans. Thus, we propose three agronomically-viable feed provision strategies that improve the efficiency and sustainability of current arable land-based production systems, including maximizing forages as feed, integrating crop and livestock systems, and using co-product feeds as well as wasted food. We conceptually apply these strategies to an Ontario context, using province-based land productivity estimates to approximate a 41% reduction in arable land use for feed production while maintaining sufficient animal protein output to satisfy an adequate diet.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this work was analyzing how an innovation platform can foster and provide a basis for multi-actor collaboration in order to enable climate-smart agriculture (CSA) implementation at the local level. Using a mix of social (interactions between stakeholders, knowledge changes, adoption of practices) and technical indicators (income, fulfillment of caloric requirements of the household, farm resource use, planned biodiversity or greenhouse gas emission changes), we monitored the collaboration between an NGO, local civil authorities, associations, and farmers that aimed to achieve a common goal linked to the participatory and contextualized development of CSA in Colombia. We found that multiple stakeholder engagements led to improved interactions between members of the platform and their local environment, a proactive participation in the platform meetings and a significant increase in farmer knowledge levels on the challenges posed by climate change and the resultant extreme events. The platform also facilitated the adoption of best-bet practices that contribute towards CSA when farmers both diversify their production and decrease the use of mineral fertilizers. Our findings suggest that innovation platforms can facilitate the collective understanding and use of CSA options corresponding to local conditions and priorities.",

    "abstract": "References to 'the Green Revolution' in the development literature over the last decade or two are nearly always selective. The revolution is seen as having taken place from the 1960 s in Asia; almost no one refers to the green revolution programs in Latin America during the 1940 s and '50 s. Remarkably, this silence extends even to the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Agricultural Program whose importance – not least for the subsequent programs in Asia – was widely recognized by the 1960 s. It is unlikely that the development community is ignorant of the Green Revolution's history. Instead I argue that the Mexican program has been conveniently forgotten because, despite its very substantial impact upon wheat production, it failed utterly to alleviate rural poverty and malnutrition. For those who regard a 'new Green Revolution' as the only viable way to secure future food supplies, therefore, the Mexican episode is an embarrassment which is best left unmentioned.",

At present, discourses like food democracy are often isolated from food sovereignty and agroecology in the urban context, potentially resulting in missed opportunities for creating holistic, inclusive, and scalable transformation in the urban food system. This study used data from existing municipal food policy in Seattle, U.S.A. and interviews with Seattle community gardeners to probe resident practices and policy recommendations in relation to the conceptual frameworks of food sovereignty and food democracy. The findings identify two key dimensions of food democracy as notably absent from the food sovereignty framework within this contextualized landscape, including mechanisms that enable vertical deliberation between food system stakeholders and opportunities for strengthened self and community efficacy – thus, exposing a potential gap in the ongoing development of an actionable agroecological urbanism. Working in tandem within the frame of agroecological urbanism, the food sovereignty and food democracy frameworks may support transition from unsustainable growth patterns and enable agroecological massification in an urban Global North context.",

Less well described are the factors that support and/or hinder women's participation in agroecology; we addressed this gap through a feminist analysis of women's motivations and barriers to participation in agroecological production in Costa Rica. We found that women derive multiple benefits from agroecology. These benefits included: sharing knowledge, creating community, income generation, independence (financial and having their own identity that goes beyond that of a man's), cultural identity, health (human and land), biodiversity conservation, self-confidence, and leadership opportunities within agroecological networks. Our results also illustrated how there are multiple barriers to women's participation including: access to leadership positions, government support, access to capital, technology, land access, high costs of agriculture, a lack of understanding of Indigenous culture, triple burdens, and machismo and microaggressions. Although women experienced some common barriers to participation, women experience agroecology differently, based on age, ethnicity, and geographic location, and their unique context. The common barriers reported by women (machismo and triple burdens) illustrate how agroecology cannot be isolated from 1) the wider culture of discrimination against women in agriculture and 2) women's disproportionate roles in the care economy.",

Interviews with 34 farmers in Maritime Canada revealed their perceptions about soil health, their methods for assessing their own soils, and their reactions to a comprehensive soil health assessment based on the Cornell Soil Health Assessment (CSHA). Farmers primarily assessed soils using aboveground indicators such as plant health and yield, as well as physical indicators such as texture or water-holding capacity. Most farmers (91%) had heard of soil health, and their definitions focused on biological and productivity aspects of the soil. Organic farmers tended to be more open to the CSHA results and were more likely to give a holistic definition of soil health than conventional farmers. Depending on what frame is invoked about soil, farmers think of soil health differently. Despite differences between farmers' perceptions and CSHA results, most farmers found CSHA results useful (71%) and planned to undertake management changes (74%) based on them. Soil health could be an 'inclusive' common ground for farmers and soil scientists to think about and manage soils.",

This article explores how social–ecological relations shift in agricultural practices following the introduction of modern seed varieties, including hybrid and genetically modified (GM) seeds and their co-technologies. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic work in smallholder maize farms in South Africa, we introduce the concept of ecological deskilling in agriculture and describe three dimensions related to it: loss of ecologically based practices, loss of relational knowledge, and loss of socio-ecological agency. Our findings suggest that the introduction of modern seed varieties may contribute to the process of ecological deskilling due to the disruption of the co-evolution of knowledge between smallholder farmers and agroecological environments. We argue that this form of deskilling can undermine food sovereignty and farmers' agency. It can also narrow future possibilities and pathways for sustainable agricultural development.",

PGS schemes for promoting organic agriculture can be especially important for the vegetable sector of Costa Rica given the historically large use of agrochemicals in conventional (fruits and vegetables) production and its environmental and public health consequences. In this article, we use transition theory and the Multi-Level Perspective to analyze PGS for organic vegetables as a niche with a potential for but facing barriers to scaling out. Our literature review, supported by field surveys and observations, revealed different social and institutional barriers characterizing the niche–regime interactions which foster, or at times hamper, the scalability of PGS. Examples from other countries like Brazil and Mexico helped shed light on potential future paths for PGS in Costa Rica. Our results suggest that current institutional recognition of PGS might support scaling out if a more flexible legislative framework is implemented and political and technical support provided to participatory certification initiatives is increased.",

The methods used to analyze this policy process (2014–2021), through the policy cycle framework, are a content analysis of key documents, interviews with key stakeholders and the analysis of lived experiences. The research highlights key information on the agenda setting, the policy formulation, the policy adoption, and the policy implementation, trying to break down the process, understand drivers, strengths, and challenges. The study highlights that institutionalization of the food policy has been the key to its success. Main results show that the engagement of international stakeholders and private funders have been important drivers of the agenda setting and formulation of the policy, while the presence of institutionalized policy entrepreneurs, as a permanent staff dedicated to food policies, was pivotal in the adoption of the policy and implementation of projects. The research also shows that the institutionalization, however, caused a lack of participative and cooperative policy development spaces, both with other departments of the Municipality and external local stakeholders, which resulted in their involvement for project design and consultation only.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological techniques (AET) have been recognized by many farmers, NGOs, and farmers' organizations (FOs) as a promising solution for slowing down the persistent soil fertility degradation in West African drylands. In the context of Burkina, the promotion of AET is the result of the interactions between NGOs and farmers' knowledge through the intermediation of FOs. Although numerous studies have highlighted the instrumental role of FOs in the dissemination of AET in Burkina, there are limited studies focusing on the historical dynamic of FOs' involvement in the promotion of agroecology. To address this gap, this study aims to answer the following questions: why and how do FOs get involved in the promotion of agroecological techniques, and how do they define the term agroecology or agroecological techniques? A multiple case study approach was used to provide the answer to these questions. The results from the case studies reveal that the FOs' promotion of AET is largely connected to their aim of fulfilling one of the following three goals: enhancing the productivity of commercial crops; improving the resilience of subsistence farmers; enhancing both the productivity of commercial crops and the resilience of subsistence farmers. The quest to achieve these goals explained their constant interaction with external partners to get the necessary assistance for the provision of agroecological support services to their farmers. Furthermore, the results of the study also reveal that the Farmers' Organizations' definitions of agroecology or agroecological terms are mostly associated with the interpretation of agroecology as a collective practice encompassing both economic and ecological aspects of Burkinabè agriculture. A broader insight is that while FOs can fulfill important roles in agroecology transitions this comes with diverse interpretations of agroecology, in which FOs facilitate the hybridization of existing farmers 'practices with those proposed by external actors. The study hence shows the complexity related to the local actors' definitions of agroecological terms and the broader implication is that in the debate on agroecology transitions, these blended or hybrid forms of agroecology should receive more attention. Areas for future research include drivers of FOs choice making processes in how they approach agroecology, and subsequently the influence of FOs on the drivers of farmers' decisions toward AET.",

    "abstract": "Self-organization is prevalent in local agri-food systems (LAFS), which must often adapt rapidly to both internal and external pressures. This was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, which required rapid self-organization in LAFS due to increased demand for smaller-scale and localized food producers and distributors. Previous research has explored drivers of self-organization in LAFS, often as an artifact of slow-boil socioeconomic or environmental crises. However, there is less research investigating the ingredients required for self-organization to successfully materialize. This paper argues that there is a gap in both the literature and practice that overlooks three core elements required for effective self-organization, or ideas that can transition from thought into action. These fundamental elements – agency, demand, and resource – must all be present and work in harmony for effective self-organization to occur and must be understood as a package. From evidence collected through “patchwork ethnographic” research in Oxford, UK and Freiburg, Germany this paper details how these elements impact decisions and actions taken by LAFS actors. Understanding these core elements can have practical ramifications for practitioners, facilitating better understanding of why ideas or actions may be (in)effective and how to foster effective self-organization, as well as highlighting avenues for self-organization research.",

Here, a study was undertaken to evaluate the role of different wheat-pea intercropping patterns in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cereal aphids in agroecosystems. Wheat-pea intercropping in an 8–2 row pattern of wheat and pea, respectively, preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of wheat. The highest abundance of ladybeetles in 2008 and 2009 occurred in the 8–2 row pattern, whereas the highest densities of aphid parasitoids were found in the 4-2 row pattern in 2008 and the 8-2 row pattern in 2009. The distribution of aphid populations in the peak stage was spatially heterogeneous, and the highest density of aphids was shown visually in wheat monoculture fields. The land equivalent ratio of 1.121:1.187 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2008 and 1.114:1.174 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2009 showed that intercropping of wheat and pea has potential to improve the utilization of plant growth resources as compared to sole crops. Wheat-pea intercropping has potential to control English grain aphids effectively by enhancing the abundance of natural enemies, especially with an 8-2 row pattern of wheat-pea, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work analyzes the energy performance of organic livestock farming in Andalusia (Spain), both as an industry and by type of livestock, through the application of the energy analysis methodology adapted in this article to the study of the organic livestock farming. From this perspective, it is possible to observe that organic livestock farming has a great capacity to use resources and generate outputs in the form of products of animal origin and, especially, manure, which is an important resource for agricultural fertilization. The energy efficiency of organic livestock farming in Andalusia is estimated at 0.08. If the manure reused by agriculture is considered an output, the efficiency of the industry reaches 0.32. Also, 28% of the energy consumed by the industry is nonrenewable and the energy efficiency in relation to the use of nonrenewable energy is estimated at 1.38. By type of livestock, the energy efficiency in relation to the use of nonrenewable energy is estimated at 1.78, 1.62, 0.84, 0.57, 0.22 for goats, cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry. These results show the capacity of extensive organic livestock farming to reduce energy costs and improve its energy efficiency.

Research project financed by the Department of Agriculture of the Andalusian Regional Government. The energy analysis is based on the data of this previous project (CitationPérez Neira 2010). 2. Noncultivated pasture has been excluded from the energy accounting due to two reasons: 1) to prevent double accounting, since pasture is both an output and an input in extensive livestock farms, and 2) because noncultivated pasture has no opportunity cost in relation to human food. The indirect energy associated to the management of pasture has been taken into consideration in the rest of input entries. 3. The livestock standard unit (LSU) is a measure that allows homogenising the different livestocks with the purpose of comparing them.

We used the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX) model to study the effects of: four rates of corn residue removals, 0%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, across site-specific conditions of two land types, highly erodible land (HEL) and non-HEL; three soil textural classes, clayey, loamy, and sandy; and the four soil hydrologic groups, A, B, C, and D, on soybean yield and nitrogen (N) dynamics, for 3703 farm fields within the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Overall, residue removal reduced soybean yield, N fixation, uptake, losses, and soil storage by 8%, 6%, 7%, and 5%, respectively. There is a positive tradeoff of residue removal, that is, it reduces the pool of nutrients available for loss, which resulted in a 9% decline in N losses when compared to no residue removal. Corn residue removal-induced reduction in soil organic N storage could affect the magnitude of the soybean N credit, implying that increased fertilization rates could be needed to sustain corn productivity in corn/soybean rotation systems. Responses were however subject to site-specific conditions, key considerations when determining residue removal thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Using scaled up data from an experimental farm platform in Scotland, we examined the relative economics of a conventional and a low-carbon integrated management system for two (otherwise identical) farms. By employing a novel market-based approach, we factored the market costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the relative economics of both systems. Specifically, farmers are considered to be awarded emission credits in accordance with Scotland's agricultural emissions reduction targets. Farmers are then considered to trade their net GHG emissions in an emissions trading scheme, with the integrated system expected to benefit from this arrangement due to its lower emissions. In further sensitivity analyses, we also considered the effect of premium pricing of integrated system crops on the relative economics of both systems. We find that in both the status quo and emissions trading scenarios, the conventional system is significantly more profitable. In the emissions trading scenario, an emissions price roughly three times the reported median prices over the last five years is required for the integrated system's profitability to break-even with the conventional system. However, even at prevailing emissions prices, a 20% premium pricing of the integrated system crops enables near parity in the profitability of both systems. We conclude that in order to facilitate greater adoption of low-carbon systems, policies may be needed to encourage farmers' realization of the cost of their externalities, in particular GHG emissions. At the same time, support should be given to a market system that recognizes premium prices for low-carbon system products.",

In this study, a qualitative approach using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) four constructs (performance, ease of use, social influence and enablers) was used to assess behavioral intention to accept and use ecological intensification options. A total of 97 smallholder farmers from diverse farm types in rural Limpopo and Eastern Cape, South Africa participated in focus group discussions to assess behavioral intention to accept and use ecological intensification options. Smallholder farmers revealed that they were exposed to a plethora of ecological intensification options. However, acceptance and utilization of these options were low, mainly due to lack of awareness, germplasm, and technical support. The four constructs of the UTAUT framework revealed locally relevant knowledge that must be considered for effective acceptance and use of ecological intensification options.Abbreviations: ACCESS: Alliance for Collaboration for Climate and Earth System Sciences; ADCI: African Climate Development Initiative; NRF: National Research Foundation; SSA: Sub Saharan Africa; UTAUT: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; WRC: Water Research Commission; FAO: Food and Agriculture Organisation; CA: Conservation Agriculture",

In this paper I examine the ways in which the GR's advocates responded to criticism during the 1970s. Of particular interest is their defense that they were unprepared for the adverse effects of the new technology because these effects could not have been anticipated. I argue, however, that this claim is untenable because the negative effects of the technology had been pointed out from an early stage but were largely ignored. That experts reacted in this way derived in part from the narrow scope of their training and experience but also from a professional tendency to oversimplify the nature of development problems.",

This article presents a basic and multi-objective linear programming (LP) model to determine enterprise combinations of crop and livestock activities that maximize total gross margin (TGM) among small farms in the Eastern Cape Province. Optimization modeling results and trade-off analysis showed 122.61% increase and 58% decreases, respectively, compared with the average TGM per livestock unit (LU). Smallholder CLI farmers can optimally maximized profit, but fail to optimally maximize home consumption with profit maximization objectives at present resource level.

A double-hurdle model was used. Here, consumers could choose either to be organic or nonorganic consumers and/or how much tomatoes they consume. Instead of concentrating on willingness to pay (WTP) for a premium (as is customary for many studies), our respondents were faced with a given premium and were asked about their preferences for organic tomatoes. Results reveal that price premium was not an important component in the decision to be or not to be an organic tomatoes consumer. However, it did prove important with respect to how many tomatoes to consume. While previous studies point to health benefits as the main motive for buying organic food, with concern for the environment and taste mentioned as secondary reasons, our study found that environmental concerns were the primary factor influencing whether or not to buy organic, while price and taste were factors in determining how much organic food to purchase.KEYWORDS: organic tomatoesIsraelconsumption decisions",

This article provides an overview of the evolution of collective private retail standards (in particular international ones), outlining: how and why these standards have come to play an increasingly dominant role on the agri-food chain; their implications on their sustainability; the opportunities and threats for the agri-food chain, with a focus on developing countries. As a result, we conclude that the growing power of retailers along the agri-food chain produces ambivalent effects, especially in terms of sustainability, that merit further study.

In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted in two contrasting, but representative, villages, where traditional mixed-crop farming was being replaced by cash crops such as coffee, maize, and cotton. Access to state-subsidized food supply and increase in cash income through wage labor, coupled with increasing depredation of food crops by wild animals, were some causes for the shift to cash crops. Declining supply of non-timber forest produce (NTFP) and the subsistence cash it provided has also impacted farmer livelihoods and indirectly contributed to this shift. The changing aspirations of younger Soligas and inadequate state support for mixed-crop farming also could be contributing factors. Soligas consistently maintained that increased wildlife depredation of food crops, reduction in supplies of wild foods, and the decline in NTFP was due to poor forest health. The transition to cash crops improved cash flows but exposed the Soligas to market risks. While food security also improved, the nutritional quality of diet declined. Soligas are adopting new farming practices, diets, and livelihood strategies, and importantly, leveraging rights historically denied to them, all a reflection of their social resilience.",

Although agroecological production experiences have spread throughout settlements, MST has not yet succeeded in making agroecology the dominant paradigm within its settlements. Thus, the main purpose of this article is to understand the challenges faced by the MST in promoting the adoption of agroecological practices by its settlers. A framework consisting of eight drivers identified as crucial to bring agroecology to scale was used to analyze and discuss the advances achieved and the challenges faced by the MST. Our findings suggest that some structural characteristics of the MST and the Brazilian State impose unique and complex challenges for the project of scaling agroecology in rural settlements. Therefore, we suggest that some drivers must be better applied in a coordinated way, for example, a) investing in less hierarchical processes of rural extension such as campesino-a-campesino (peasant-to-peasant) methodology and participatory certification; b) implementing more demonstrative areas of agroecological production in settlements, and c) advancing actions and partnerships that bring farmers and consumers closer.",

    "abstract": "When public administrations promote agroecological transition processes there is a risk that these be conventionalized and co-opted. However there is a notable lack of research on the adoption of participatory approaches to processes of agroecological transition, especially in larger territories. This article analyzes two case studies in which territorial Action Plans for agroecological transition have been co-produced through participatory processes in metropolitan areas of the Spanish State. Analysis of these two cases leads us to outline a series of significant factors that may serve to adapt the methodological approach of Local Agroecological Dynamization to different contexts. We also point out some contradictions inherent to participatory processes for agroecological transitions promoted by the administration, in regards to the conflictive dialectics among top-down and bottom-up processes, and to the weakness of agroecology-oriented farmers in metropolitan environments. Finally, we propose some efforts to overcome these contradictions.",

Buckwheat grows quickly and is utilized as a cover crop for weed suppression, a nectar source for native pollinators, and for soil nutrient enrichment, primarily phosphorus. Even though buckwheat is not commonly grown in Florida's subtropical zone, it has the potential to be grown as a cover crop supporting sustainable agroecosystem. The purpose of this research was to analyze the suitability of buckwheat as a cover crop in Florida in conjunction with a comprehensive assessment of its response to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation, soil types, and its effect on soil nutrient enrichment. Buckwheat was planted at the Florida International University organic garden (Miami, FL, USA) in early November and harvested in mid-December. After incorporation of buckwheat residues, soil analyses indicated the ability of buckwheat to enrich soil with major nutrients, in particular, phosphorus and nitrogen. Correlation analysis on aboveground buckwheat biomass and soil characteristics showed that high soil pH was the major limiting factor that affected buckwheat growth. Results also showed that buckwheat forms symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; buckwheat root colonization ranges from low to medium. Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased inorganic phosphorus uptake and overall buckwheat growth.KEYWORDS: buckwheatarbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)available phosphorustotal nitrogensoil characteristicsFlorida",

    "abstract": "Conservation agriculture (CA) is often quoted as a beneficial resource-saving technique for dryland agriculture, but its large-scale implementation is frequently hindered by the lack of farmers' acceptance. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of spatial factors, costs and benefits and regional agroecosystem differentiation on adoption of CA. This study, therefore, aims to assess the impact of these factors through a case study in the North Ethiopian Highlands. One hundred eight farmers of 11 villages surrounding an experimental plot were interviewed in order to identify their knowledge and acceptance of the technique. The results show that several spatial factors play a role in CA acceptance. The lack of knowledge on the resource-saving technique proved primarily dependent (R = –0.73) on spatial impedance with the innovation source and on the strength of sociospatial networks. Next, a consumer model showed that perceived costs and benefits seem to balance each other. Finally, some agronomic traditions were identified that are related to the regional agroecosystem, which are not favoring the implementation of zero-tillage practices. Since this study identified acceptance problems related to several spatial and regional factors, future CA adoption schemes must allow better regional differentiation optimized to local contexts and conditions.",

Belo Horizonte, through its Secretariat of Food and Nutrition Security (SMASAN), has generated increased food security in the city, in part by economically supporting local small farmers. Farmers' economic security has been previously linked to their agricultural practices and sustainability; thus, SMASAN's programs potentially affect biodiversity in the region's agricultural matrix and rainforest fragments through their work with farmers. In order to examine this dynamic, we compared ground-foraging ant diversity on four SMASAN and three non-SMASAN farms and adjoining forest fragments. Supported by data from farmer interviews, sampling in 2005 and 2006 indicated SMASAN farms had: a) higher alpha and beta diversity and b) potentially greater overlap between species found on-farm and in adjacent forest fragments. This case study may be the first directly linking biodiversity conservation with food security and changes in local food policy institutions, emphasizing the importance of an approach integrating politics and ecology, and the potential for human wellbeing and conservation to go hand-in-hand.",

For this study, Modified Sustainable Livelihood Framework (MSLF) and Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework identified major driving forces in Kiangan social-ecological system (SES) and elucidated relationships and interactions between them. This study however unveiled the highly disturbed state of Kiangan SES and erosion of Ifugao culture and belief systems owing to the ingress of modernization, mind-set change among locals and weak institutional support. In particular, the polytheism to Christianity shift was a causative factor leading to abandonment of traditional rice varieties and farming rituals as well as the transformation of Kiangan upland landscape and its associated biophysical structures. Furthermore, productivity-driven approach to food production also resulted in wide scale agro-biodiversity losses, environmental degradation and cultural erosion. It was nonetheless observed that the Kiangan SES has, as of this time, not yet shifted to an alternative state and is still able to conserve its main features despite pressures to it. Interventions are therefore warranted to redirect the trajectory of Kiangan SES, steer it toward sustainable agricultural development and consequently into its preservation on behalf of the people that depend on it for food and livelihood.",

We discussed it in light of the crisis of hidden hunger, agrarian change, and in formulating food policy. India demonstrated a rich heritage of eating leafy shoots that resonated in a high diversity of species (723 species) and culinary delicacies to accept them in various forms suiting its culture of taste. These plants are charged with key vitamins and minerals to mitigate micronutrient deficiency. Altogether, it emphasized their untapped potential to ensure nutritional security alleviating hidden hunger, specifically combating vitamin A deficiency. We also observed a heterogeneous distribution of edible species diversity across the regions perhaps affected by plant choice and suggested a data-driven framework to select a set of species for policy intervention. Building on our findings, we proposed their inclusion in national food policy through the encouragement of cultivation, awareness generation, and incorporation into meals.",

CaC, instead, is designed to establish a network of farmers who share their own practices with each other, and the role of the technician changes to that of facilitator in the design and execution of the overall process.

To address this gap, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 Ohio farmers after sharing a soil health report that detailed physical, chemical, and biological indicators from at least two sampled fields from their farms. Research findings demonstrate that while farmers expressed strong interest in soil biological health indicators specifically, the data often raised more questions than answers for participants. Specifically, three main themes emerged in the interviews: 1) uncertainties in interpreting the soil health indicators, 2) questions regarding translation of soil health data into management, and 3) affirmation of existing management choices. The first two response themes point to a need for scientists to develop greater access and exposure to soil health data to facilitate interpretation. Furthermore, researchers and extension agents can play a critical role in guiding recommendations for potential application of soil health data in on-farm management. While research on soil health has widely expanded in recent years, this study highlights the need for greater attention to its translational science and the co-production of knowledge.",

The objective of this study is to contribute to the analysis of the existing evidence that agroecology enables climate change (CC) adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural systems of Latin America, a region known for pioneering the development of this science, praxis, and movement. We applied the PRISMA method to analyze the existing literature providing such evidence. Stakeholder interviews were used to obtain in-depth perceptions of agroecology's contributions to CC adaptation and mitigation from a wide range of actors and development practitioners based in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru: farmers, NGO representatives, researchers, university program leaders, and public officials. From a total of 1821 initially identified articles, 62 were screened, and 24 case studies analyzed for methods and evidence provided. Twenty-six stakeholders were interviewed. Combining quantitative and qualitative assessment methods, the scientific literature shows that agroecological systems are appreciated for addressing resilience in a systemic way hence not just climate change per se. Mitigation was generally assess by quantitative approaches. Integrating stakeholders' discourse to our analysis highlighted their knowledge of underlying processes contributing to farm CC resilience, where crop and animal diversification and integration of trees into farming systems are central. Stakeholders attributed agroforestry and less use of synthetic fertilizers as important roles for mitigation. Our study highlights the pertinence of combining systematic analyses of the evidence and perceptions drawn from a plurality of stakeholders to recognize the positive contribution of agroecology to climate change adaptation and resilience. However, it also pointed to future research that further assesses the specific trade-offs and synergies between agroecological practices, mitigation, and resilience at multiple scales. This will be important to mobilize and better orient the support from public institutions and donors that remains lacking on the ground.",

The findings show that the functions of the movement are enabled by support from tertiary institutions, government departments, NGOs, international networks and the private sector. In the initial stages, the movement's growth as measured by the uptake of agroecology faced resistance because the associated labor intensity, especially in the early stages and farmers considered it to be very slow compared to conventional methods. However, the movement's mobilization through open dialogs, co-creation and farmer-centered learning approaches has seen a gradual and wide adoption of agroecology practices by over 2700 new and existing farmers in the Eastern Cape alone, thereby widening the learning and seed-sharing network. In the communities it has reached, the movement has registered transformational gains in biodiversity preservation, social cohesion, market power, gender equality and food security.",

This push for Zero-Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), while welcome as an alternative, also raises several questions on the nature of knowledge production and dissemination. This paper explores the knowledge politics around top-down \"skilling regimes\" and the principles and paradigms that emphasize social learning. We explore the multiple practices, meanings of agroecology among farmers, government agencies, and civil society organizations in the state of Gujarat. The action research included a survey of practices of 250 farmers in 12 districts, interviews, and stakeholder workshops. Insufficient investments in community-based extension mechanisms and lack of collaboration between state and civil society were features of the policy implementation. The absence of innovative platforms to facilitate knowledge dialogs and learning among actors to advance agroecology increases the gap between policy goals and its actual realization in practice. Programs for upscaling agroecology, we suggest, need to embed the diversity of technical and institutional processes through creating learning alliances to facilitate knowledge dialogs across dissimilar actors.",

The policies guiding our food systems, from production to consumption, navigate a complex landscape marked by paradoxes, realities, contradictions, challenges, and opportunities. Despite the presence of evidence-based policy frameworks, there remains a lack of comprehension regarding the fundamental factors essential for fostering a sustainable planet and a more inclusive society. It is imperative to challenge rooted perceptions surrounding even the most conventional aspects of agri-food systems, thereby justifying sustainable reforms and agroecological transitions. Such endeavors bolster societal and environmental resilience against economic, social, and environmental crises. Envisioning a viable future demands a more critical approach to the design of agro-policy and research frameworks.",

Olive cultivation is the most widespread permanent crop in Europe and the Mediterranean region and in many cases, it is under intensive farming practices with heavy use of agrochemicals, greatly affecting olive grove biodiversity. In this study we investigate the impact of different understorey management practices (undisturbed, cleared with mechanical means) on plant cover, ground beetle and bee richness and abundance, and on the abundance of ground arthropods and flying insects in olive groves on Lesvos Island, North Aegean, Greece. We found that undisturbed understorey had a positive impact on plant richness and abundance, ground beetle and bee richness and abundance, as well as ground arthropod and flying insect abundance. The results suggest that maintaining the plant cover undisturbed significantly improves the biodiversity of the olive groves and by extension the ecosystem services, such as pollination, pest control and soil health.",

It is important to identify and characterize these underutilized food plant species in the context of climate change and food and nutritional poverty. A survey was conducted among 45 participants in four rural localities, and field visits were carried out. The data obtained were analyzed thematically and through descriptive statistics. The study area is experiencing a progressive abandonment of species, resulting in a loss of germplasm and the traditional knowledge that underlies it. The reintroduction of these species into agroecosystems can be achieved by incorporating them into the local culinary practices. This will promote the resilience of agroecosystems and contribute to the food and nutritional security of society.",

The findings reveal moderate to high levels of crop and income diversification across these sites. Using a Tobit model, the study identifies significant socio-economic factors influencing crop diversification, including literacy, farm size, and market distance. Additionally, it shows that crop diversification intensity, the household head's age and education, and on- and off-farm income significantly affect income diversification. These factors, along with farm size, also significantly impact crop income. This research addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring the underexamined interaction between crop diversification and income diversification in Bangladesh. It contributes to a broader understanding of how diversification strategies can enhance agricultural productivity and income stability and offers valuable policy implications.",

This paper examines the evolving interpretations of AFN over the past two decades, aiming for conceptual clarity. Using a three-stage approach to systematic literature reviews, we conducted a rigorous synthesis of existing research. Through concept and thematic analyses, we identified key attributes and recurring themes associated with AFN. While a conceptual consensus remains elusive, diverse definitions often share essential attributes such as \"alterity,\" \"proximity,\" \"connectedness,\" and \"sustainability.\" Additionally, we find that AFN and short food supply chains generally describe the same phenomenon, with civic food networks viewed as a subset of AFN, emphasizing community engagement and civic participation. Notably, AFN are not always local food systems, nor do local food systems always involve AFN. To address these nuances, we present guiding questions to assist researchers in studying and reporting on AFN. This work clarifies the core attributes of AFN and offers a roadmap for focused inquiries. Ultimately, our findings aim to guide decision-making processes, ensuring that efforts to support AFN are rooted in a nuanced understanding of their complexities and potential for driving change in food systems.",

To analyze the opportunities and challenges associated with coffee agroforestry management, we conducted 58 semistructured interviews with coffee growers. In addition, we conducted a field investigation that tested production of Coffea canephora with the shade trees Australian Cedar (Toona ciliata), Jequitibá (Cariniana legalis), and Teak (Tectona grandis). Of the 58 interviewed farmers, 64% (37) were satisfied with the AFS. One of the main factors that caused satisfaction was obtaining income from sources other than coffee. Unsatisfied farmers mentioned the competition between shade trees and coffee shrubs. Cedar was the shade tree that grew most and reduced coffee production, while the combination with Jequitibá maintained more stable yields. We conclude that the higher the growth rate of trees, the higher the negative impact on the coffee production in the study areas.",

The fluidity of multilevel, polycentric social-ecological systems requires partnerships to be flexible and adaptive. As society changes, the foundation of stewardship programs also shift. In this article, Glasbergen's (2011) Ladder of Partnerships is applied to the analysis of three governance regime shifts in the agroecosystem stewardship program, the Ontario Environmental Farm Plan (OEFP). Six key-informant interviews with pivotal actors within each phase of the program were conducted along with a review of documents and program data. The study finds that changes in the context for, and the governance of, OEFP are shifting the foundations of the original program. The adverse consequences of these changes for the viability of the program, illustrates the need to understand governance issues. The study supports the call for program analysis that is sensitive to the evolution of the system in question. Specifically, the shifting baseline of social norms and policies that affect the sustainability of stewardship programs that are governmental civil society partnerships. The study concludes that the co-option of bottom up processes and programs by top down government interventions can lead to loss of integrity and legitimacy of the programs.

The \"long trajectory\" refers to the agroecology-based indigenous agriculture practiced in both highlands and lowlands of the country. The \"short trajectory\" started in the 1970s and became consolidated with the institutionalization of agroecology through initiatives focused on strengthening indigenous agriculture, commercialization of agroecological produce, conservation of natural resources and land, family farming, food sovereignty, and education and research. From 2006 onward, a new stage of the agroecological process in Bolivia began with its inclusion in national regulation and policy. Despite important advances, the agroecological process in Bolivia still faces substantial challenges, whose management will require coordination and collaboration between the different sectors, as well as a more explicit acknowledgement of the multi-functionality of agroecology.",

To this end the article seeks to point out the conditions that hinder this development and the factors that could favor it. The article is structured as follows: in the first section the UPA phenomenon is framed with reference to some significant planning experiences in progress in Western and Islamic countries. In the second section, an outline of Mashhad as a \"city in transition\" is provided highlighting its main factors of change. In the third section, the institutional framework of present urban planning in Mashhad is described, also showing the weak enforcement mechanisms of planning policy for UPA. Section four presents both a conceptual and material network of un-built areas potentially suitable for agricultural uses, articulated in three different classes. By referring to city maps and recent urban schemes, the study summarizes the physical characteristics, the ownership, and the resources of each class, from inside the compact city to its peripheral belt. The article concludes by indicating the three domains of policy, education, and social commitment as the main factors that can favor effective policies and practices for a multifunctional urban agriculture.",

These knowledge systems are specific to social groups or communities and the dialogue between them is not easy. Local soil knowledge is often misrepresented and reduced when correspondences with soil sciences categories are established without due care.This paper results from two field studies in an upland village of Southern Philippines. The sociocultural richness and the high diversity of farming systems characterizing this local context have highlighted the importance of accounting for the diversity of soil knowledge related to local issues and sustainability. Looking for a dialogue among the plurality of perceptions, knowledge system, and typologies regarding soils implies that attention be given to knowledge construction processes. In order to facilitate an egalitarian dialogue it is also essential to explore relations between soil knowledge, farming systems, and sociocultural context.Discussion with farmers about their soils has cast doubt on the practical relevance of soil science knowledge in a context of non-industrial and non-chemical agriculture and revealed the dynamic dimension of farmers’ soil knowledge construction and the practical relevance of contextualized knowledge.In this paper, we propose methodological and epistemological thoughts to help establish a common language between scientists and farmers. We also propose to use the soil groups emerging from field characterization as a practical tool to dialogue with farmers in the field, to build a common understanding of soil heterogeneity. We consider this approach as a critical step to initiate collaborative soil studies from a practical and endogenous perspective.",

Agroecology for sustainable production is one of the key proposals from social movements in these zones, however, its transference into practice remains limited, due to the deep-rooted influence of the green revolution. This article analyses the relationship between productive practice and agroecology proposals in Cabrera's ZRC, which is located in the Andean region of Colombia. This zone is one of seven ZRCs created so far in the country. The study uses key documents, data from focus groups and in-depth questionnaires from 55 farms. The data reveals that due to a prevailing campesino productive rationale, the ZRC provides favorable conditions under which to develop agroecology as practice, as they both share many similar principles such as those found in diversified agriculture. Furthermore, Cabrera's ZRC has a strong legal and organizational trajectory, capable of advancing agroecology as a social movement, which could in turn facilitate the defense of economic, social and cultural rights.",

We draw on qualitative and quantitative research, including over one hundred interviews with farmers and organizational staff, comparing five case sites in Virginia, New York, California, Minnesota, and Washington as well as national statistical data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture. Specific practices of Latino/a growers include growing biodiverse fruit and vegetable crops on a small scale, direct sales at farmers' markets, and maintaining family-based labor. Although they use little or no synthetic inputs, many are not certified organic, and are not tied in to high-end markets, and therefore do not receive the organic premium. This paper argues for a deeper look into who is included and excluded from alternative farming institutions and spaces and makes a case for the importance of creating new opportunities for immigrant farmers of color as part of these social networks and markets.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines ecological farm internships and the implications for agroecology and food systems' sustainability. Drawing on over 60 interviews with farmers and interns in Ontario, Canada, I show that internships offer hands-on learning opportunities to prospective farmers and food systems advocates unavailable through formal institutions. At the same time, many farmers rely on interns as non-waged workers to meet seasonal and labor-intensive production needs. This creates a dynamic tension where internships can simultaneously be innovative models of experiential education and unjust forms of exploitative labor. Engaging these tensions remains a fundamental challenge for the future of agroecology and sustainable food systems movements.",

The Bolivarian University of Venezuela, itself a product of the revolutionary process, founded the Program Degree in Agroecology (PDA) in 2004 to expand agroecological practices and knowledge, based on alternative pedagogical approaches. Over the next decade, over a thousand PDA graduates have come to occupy institutional spaces and productive projects in urban and rural areas, contributing to vertical and horizontal agroecological scaling. PDA graduates and educators play a key role in the growing movement of urban agriculture that confronts the economic crisis. The PDA has created key mediators in the form of human talent for territorializing agroecology and institutionalizing pro-peasant policy in Venezuela. As a political outlier, Venezuela is an important case for studying the strategies for territorializing what we refer to as socially committed, situated agroecology.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological landscapes, which promote critical features such as agrobiodiversity, represent valuable global commons. These landscapes are products of ways of life, local knowledge, and rural practices. Recent studies agree on the need to better understand such rooted social-ecological systems by more deeply exploring their human-environment relationships. To address this, we investigated agroecological landscapes in two communities, one in the Andean highlands of northwest Argentina, the other in the Dolomites in northern Italy. This research applies discourse-ethnographic methods to explore how the communities build institutions to protect their culture, how they manage change, and how the environment is perceived and used. Based on the results, we identified several dimensions of farmers’ intangible values, their understanding of well-being, and how they contribute to the genesis of landscapes (maize terraces, alpine pastures). This work shows that many interviewees did not perceive nature merely as a resource or service for humans, as suggested by the widely held discourse of agricultural industrialization, and that alternative relationships to nature are possible and do exist in practice. Further, this work raises relevant issues for how to imagine the transition to agricultural systems that do not define well-being only from the perspective of materiality and of humans.",

This study compared the role of sodas with a traditional maize beverage, pozol, in the state of Chiapas, specifically among rural and urban secondary school youth. We found that students find sodas to be desirably \"refreshing\" and \"tasty,\" and associated them with wealthier social classes and an alluring vision of modernity. Pozol, on the other hand, was seen as \"peasant food\" or a poor-person's drink. Nonetheless, most students have not abandoned its consumption and indeed, for many it represented their most significant daily liquid intake. Importantly, it was seen as more than refreshing libation, serving as a vital food source. We also found that within Chiapanecan society, pozol in fact represents a host of varying versions, whose consumption parallels ethnic, socioeconomic, and rural/urban factors. Ultimately, some traditional foods have maintained a certain resilience in the face of more globalized foods, in part because of their perceived nutritional and cultural value, thus helping to reinforce the resilience of the peasant agroecology they depend on.",

At the same time, agroecological practice may enhance ecological functions, contributing to ecosystem recovery in rural landscapes. The long-term impact of these initiatives will depend upon how they mesh with peasant territoriality; the relationship between land and people in its socioeconomic, political-institutional and symbolic-cultural dimensions. We analyzed agroecological and restoration/recuperation initiatives originating from government and non-governmental organizations with direct government support, and from peasant protagonism. We examined official records of initiatives in both categories, conducted in-depth interviews with public officials, and surveyed 47 small peasants associated with organic and agroecological markets. Government and government-linked NGO initiatives operate according to a neoliberal vision of sustainable-development that privileges generation of financial capital, also they have decreased their support for agroecology, and have little or no engagement with restoration/recuperation in terms of ecological or social complexity. By contrast, we identify a strong tendency in peasant agroecology that incorporates restoration/recuperation to achieve greater ecological and cultural complexity. The synergies that arise between agroecology and ecological recovery contribute to the construction of peasant territoriality, and are particularly evident in initiatives driven by indigenous organizations.",

    "abstract": "The Lacandon Maya is an indigenous group who live in Chiapas, Mexico. Their traditional lifeways involve swidden, sequential agroforestry management that mimics ecological disturbance and modifies succession. Lacandon farmers use fire to clear small plots for polyculture milpa agroforests, which they subsequently fallow. They actively manage all stages of their agroforests to provide ecosystem services and facilitate site recovery. However, it is unclear whether or how quickly the ecosystem structure of Lacandon agroforests matches that of a mature forest. Therefore, this study quantified canopy cover, basal area, ground cover, and litter layers and depth to empirically evaluate successional trends in vegetation and litter structure. Our results show that the Lacandon agroforest structure typically recovers to mature forest levels, but the speed and nature of this recovery vary by metric. They also indicate Lacandon traditional agroforestry is predicated on nuanced understanding of tropical forest successional dynamics, as illustrated by Lacandon farmers' recognition of successional stages that correspond to patterns in vegetation and leaf litter structure. As such, Lacandon ecological knowledge has the potential to facilitate the restoration of degraded tropical forests in Chiapas, Mexico. However, our findings also demonstrate that shortening fallow periods will undermine the ecological integrity of this traditional agricultural system.",

Most programs failed to take cognizance of the heterogeneous range of complex relationships between the environmental, economic, social and institutional challenges that limit low-input cattle farming. The current qualitative literature review evaluates the environmental, economic and social sustainability delivery impacts of the leading cattle development programs in the low-input farming sector in South Africa using a holistic systems approach. A mixed method procedure involving stratified sampling was used to allocate local and international-based programs while, purposive sampling was used to select programs with a wider scale of operation. The review then draws on the crosscutting key constraints emerging from the case studies to provide a better grounding for subsequent sustainability sensitive recommendations. Local-based cattle development programs advanced more market-led interventions while, their international-based counterparts had more interventions including, soil and rangeland improvement. The narrow focus by both local and international developmental programs is inadequate to address a wide array of environmental, economic, social, technical and institutional challenges faced by low-input cattle producers in South Africa.",

The traditional production system with some degree of modification that applies scientific knowledge can sustain the fragile mountain ecosystem of Northeast India. Moreover in order to maintain sustainable crop production without compromising environmental health, there should be more collaborative efforts between traditional cultivators and scientific communities to bring about win–win situations.",

    "abstract": "Integrating crop and livestock activities at the farm level is commonly proposed by research programs in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to sustainably improve farm productivity. This integration process requires farmers to change their knowledge, perceptions and practices to achieve sustainable intensification. This article presents a participatory support approach based on an analysis of farmers' current practices and knowledge and a simulation tool designed to facilitate interaction with farmers. It was tested in western Burkina Faso with 18 farmers representing three farm types defined by their balance between crop and livestock activities. Although a low level of crop-livestock integration was observed, every farmer recognized a positive link between the production of organic fertilizer and plant production. However, only one third of the farmers linked plant production with fodder and animal production. By building and simulating various integration scenarios, every farmer developed a deeper understanding of systemic interactions between crop and livestock activities on his farm. Project scenarios including the storage of biomass and animal stabling were evaluated. Although these innovations improved the farms' capacity to fertilize cereals and to feed herds, the structural changes involved were perceived to be difficult to implement either for economic reasons at the farm level or because they involved changes in biomass management at the community level. However, the support process led to tactical changes the following year, with 80% of the farmers increasing their storage of crop residues and organic manure. The approach was useful for farmers to evaluate and eventually implement possible innovations, and for researchers to better understand the constraints and limits farmers face when seeking to better integrate crop and livestock activities.",

There is need to develop some sound alternatives to enhance crop productivity without harming the environment. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of ecofriendly organic matrix-entrapped biofertilizers (OMEB) (Azotobacter chroococcum+Bacillus subtilis) on Basmati rice (Oryza sativa L cv. Basmati). The entrapped biofertilizers significantly increased plant growth, that is, fresh and dry weights, root length, root, leaf and tiller numbers, soluble protein, organic nitrogen, and free ammonium in leaves over free biofertilizers. The crop productivity, that is, grain and straw yield, and quality of grains in terms of grain protein, percentage of moisture, grain starch, wet gluten in grains, as well as NPK in grains and straw were also enhanced by OMEB. We concluded that the efficacy of free biofertilizers can be enhanced by entrapping them in appropriate carriers and providing protection to the biofertilizer microbes. It appears that organic matrix entrapped biofertilizers can be developed as effective organic alternative to conventional chemical fertilizers for rice cultivation in semiarid subtropical agroecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The development of an independent organic breeding and seed sector poses a significant challenge for organic agriculture in Europe. It should deliver cultivars suitable to the principles and conditions of organic farming and secure the integrity of future product supply. This study seeks to identify promising pathways to address this challenge by analyzing value chain organization. It is based on a mixed method approach combining the assessment of qualitative data from a stakeholder dialogue with an analysis of quantitative farm survey data.The results from the stakeholder dialogue show that a value chain partnership is a promising strategy to distribute the burden for refinancing breeding, as the whole organic sector would profit from organic breeding. A cross-sector pool funding strategy is proposed for joining forces among all value chain partners of the organic sector to invest in organic breeding and collectively secure the integrity of the future organic product supply. Four success factors have been identified: a long-term commitment, a pool fund for organic cultivar development, awareness-raising on the importance of breeding, and a high level of transparency in the process. The funding strategy is backed up by findings on market channels. Farmers who market their products through long value chains use less organic seed than those marketing through short value chains. This highlights the need to better integrate long organic value chains such as processors, traders, and retailers, and seed supply. Regardless of the marketing channel, farmers consider the development of organic breeding a vital measure to achieve higher organic seed use. This indicates that overcoming organic seed shortage is more likely to be achieved when also including breeding activities.",

The small holder dairy-based integrated farming system (IFS) under present study resulted in production of 323% more wheat equivalent yield (27358 kg ha−1) and diverse provisioning services (grains, fruits, straw, green fodder, milk) as compared to groundnut–wheat double cropping system. The dairy-based IFS generated 82.7% more net return (2501 US$ ha−1year−1) with 1.52 benefit cost ratio, resulted in uniform distribution of income throughout the year (US$ 529 to 909 every month) and generated 251% more employment (418 man-days ha−1year−1) than double cropping. It provided regulating services in the form of improved soil fertility (19% more soil organic carbon), enhanced saturated infiltration capacity, higher carbon sequestration (552%) and was more dependent on indirect and renewable energy sources. The dairy-based IFS recorded more soil biodiversity (earthworm, fungal, and bacterial count) and better nutrient (100 Kg N, 45 Kg P, and 80 Kg K ha−1 year−1), and by-product recycling (20.4 tonnes farm yard manure and 1.98 tonnes farm-compost) vis-a-vis double cropping system (supporting services) besides providing many cultural services.

    "abstract": "Agroecology is an approach that seeks to improve the integration of food systems through environmentally sustainable production systems. This paper explores the key practices considered to define agroecological farming in Bikita District of Masvingo in Zimbabwe. It reviewed the literature on agroecology and presented a criterion that informed analysis to distinguish between agroecological and non-agroecological farmers. Agroecological farmers mainly comprised resource-constrained farmers who sought to tap on their natural environment, local knowledge, and social networks to move away from conventional agricultural practices to achieve similar food and nutrition security and livelihood objectives as their non-agroecological counterparts. They differed from their non-agroecological counterparts mainly with respect to the diversity of crops grown, agronomic techniques used, and primary sources of income. Major challenges for farming households practising agroecological approaches includes lack of capacity for sustained adherence to agroecological principles (e.g., in the context of otherwise conventional systems; for all intends and purposes, existing extension messages and support mechanisms do not favor agroecological farming). These farmers, therefore, practice agroecological farming against institutions and policies that do not recognize agroecological farming. There is therefore currently ‘no level playing field’ for farmers and promoters of agroecological practices in Bikita as in many areas in Zimbabwe.",

    "abstract": "Intercropping ensures multiple benefits like enhancement of yield, environmental security, production sustainability, and greater ecosystem services. In order to better understand how mixed crop cultures mitigate stressful conditions, this study aims to highlight the beneficial effect of the intercropping legume–cereal in enhancing nutrient uptake for plant growth and productivity in low phosphorus (P) soils. To address this question, faba bean (Vicia faba L. cv. Sidi Aich) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Rihane 3) were grown as sole- and inter-crops over two growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 in a northern Algerian agro-ecosystem with a semiarid Mediterranean climate. The results showed that the plant growth and nodulation were significantly increased by 18% and 32%, respectively, for intercropping than for sole cropping and so more in 2018 compared to 2017. Moreover, grain yield and resource use efficiency (N and P) were significantly improved, as indicated by higher land equivalent ratio (LER > 1) in intercropping over sole cropping treatments. Also, the P and N concentrations measured in the rhizosphere were increased compared to bulk soil and even more so in the rhizosphere of intercropped species over two seasons. Our findings suggest that intercropping cereals with legumes may achieve high crop productivity and land use efficiency at reduced input levels.",

    "abstract": "The multiple problematics of agricultural intensification have promoted the emergence of several farming systems. Within these, biodiversity-based systems focus on increasing the structural complexity of agroecosystems through biodiversity, multiplying the functions, increasing the alternative pathways of materials and energy flow, involving mid- to long-term planning in all dimensions. Biological corridors have been proposed as tools in biodiversity-based systems, to mitigate the biodiversity loss and promotion of ecological/biological processes. However, the biological corridor definition has been vague or inconsistent, and often confounds shape and function. Lack of clear, unambiguous criteria that distinguishes a linear habitat patch as a corridor, together with the importance of the scale at which the concept is applied, contributes to controversy over the value of corridors for biodiversity conservation. Here we review the concept, origin, and functions of biological corridors, linking and contrasting them with the multiple elements of the agricultural landscape. In addition, we review the characteristics of the botanical species chosen to promote their implementation, analyzing the context to promote diversity of pollinators and biological pest regulators. The redesign of the agroecosystem, based on the promotion of biodiversity in cultivated and non-cultivated areas, has a fundamental role in the transition toward sustainable production systems.",

Managing SWD is mainly difficult due to its rapid life cycle, polyphagy and insecticide resistance, which also harms beneficial arthropods. Agroecological Crop Protection offers sustainable alternatives, like frequent harvesting, canopy thinning, and low ground cover. Our study in Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina, evaluated these practices in small-scale raspberry farms. Results showed a significant reduction in SWD larvae in treated farms, though effectiveness varied by area. The study underscores the need for tailored management strategies and suggests combining cultural practices with other tactics for better SWD control.",

    "abstract": "The paper provides a historical review and a contemporary snapshot of pastoral systems in Tunisia, exploring the dynamics of change in pastoral landscapes and territories and their respective drivers and outcomes. The core idea is to recognize the emerging diversity of pastoral systems in terms of structure and transformation, and thus to approach them analytically from a perspective of dynamic transition. The paper utilizes an agroecological gradient of transformation to illustrate the inherent agroecological nature of pastoralism by examining the different trajectories of these systems. The ongoing \"hybridization\" of pastoralism in South Tunisia is characterized by the emergence of diverse forms of pastoral activities and contexts. These novel forms of pastoralism occasionally diverge from certain agroecological principles. The paper also elucidates key factors that propel these trajectories and divergences of certain forms of pastoralism from agroecology. To this end, key elements and attributes from the political economy framework, with a particular focus on market and labor dynamics in pastoral areas, social metabolism, organizational structures, policies, institutions, and natural resource management, were discussed. The analysis shows how some of these drivers have contributed to the formation of a novel configuration of pastoralism.",

    "abstract": "In Zimbabwe, as in many other countries, agroecological transitions are often hindered by coordination and execution challenges, rather than by insufficient policy aspirations. Such aspirations, or political intentions, are found in many policy and policy-oriented documents. This study synthesizes 18 government policy documents, academic literature, and an influence-interest mapping exercise to assess the alignment and coordination of agroecology policies in Zimbabwe. Using machine learning-based text analysis, we evaluate thematic congruence across these documents in relation to agroecology principles. The results suggest that the key constraint is not the absence of supportive policies but rather, unclear mechanisms to align and coordinate them effectively. To address these challenges, we propose two approaches: the development of a transcendent agroecology theory of change (in the service of policy coherence) and a \"One Government\" approach for enhanced inter-sectoral coordination at lower jurisdictions and last-mile implementation. We posit that the analytical framework used here can be applied in real-world policy monitoring, focusing on agroecology or other social objectives.",

Within this scenario, the identification of agricultural practices providing economic benefits to farmers and, at the same time, favoring higher biodiversity levels is a key challenge. Aiming at assessing the benefit to biological diversity of certain types of agricultural management practices, we analyzed the effects of legume crops, in comparison to dry cereal crops, on biodiversity proxies in central Spain. We compared species richness, abundance, and functional diversity of birds, butterflies, and other flower-visiting insects between legume crops fields versus cereal fields. We selected three nitrogen-fixing crop types: alfalfa, peas, and vetch, being the first one under two different management systems, irrigated and non-irrigated. We found that all the taxonomic groups had higher species richness and abundance in legume crops than cereal crops, being highest in alfalfa than in the other legume crop types. Finally, it is important to note that some management types of legume crops may be detrimental to species that breed, forage, or rest in these habitats. Consequently, we recommend that efforts to promote legume crops for biodiversity conservation should be accompanied by appropriate management practices especially during the avian breeding season.",

Amid rapid uptake in Europe, we critically review the foundational literature supporting ALL: sustainable transition and innovation theories and the literature on agricultural knowledge and innovation systems to highlight transformative potential. To conduct this review, a diverse team of both social and natural scientists engaged in a co-creation process. We found that transformative ALL: 1) align methods with agroecology principles, 2) utilize place-based transformation approaches, and 3) foster a paradigm shift to participatory knowledge production. We identify seeds of transformation or cross-cutting characteristics across dominant theories and research approaches to fill political space and support transformative ALL. The first seed emphasizes moving beyond technical innovation toward socio-ecological system governance. The second seed promotes developing ALL at the territory/landscape scale as a mediator for open innovation across the science-policy-society nexus. The third seed highlights the transformative potential of inclusive and participatory knowledge production within structures that scale via networks. ALL, if methodically facilitated and supported across decision-making scales, have the potential to usher in a new transformative participatory paradigm in Europe toward more agroecological sustainable food systems at the science-policy-society nexus.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, smallholder farmers in northern Vietnam improved their vegetable cultivation with positive results for agrobiodiversity and nutrition. An unresolved question was if socio-economic differences among smallholder farmers influenced these outcomes, which this article addresses through a combined descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of household survey data. The study provides critical insights into the relationship between agrobiodiversity and dietary diversity among three ethnic groups in the uplands of northern Vietnam. Concerning crop diversity, the Hmong group cultivated the lowest number of crops (14) and the Thai group the highest (19), with Dao in-between (17). Total area of land cultivated and the area of vegetable production impacted positively on farm-level agrobiodiversity. Findings indicate that the vegetable production area is the main driver of vegetable species richness, with farmers allocating larger areas to these crops having considerably more diversity than farmers with smaller vegetable areas. Larger vegetable production areas, higher Fruit Species Richness, lower Staple Species Richness, larger household, and higher education contributed to a more diverse diet. The findings call for a more careful analysis of how differences in assets, ethnicity, and household characteristics influence livelihood improvement outcomes. These differences need to be better accounted for in policy interventions.",

    "abstract": "Soilborne pathogens limit productivity, exert chronic stress and may cause severe diseases in many crops, especially in smallholder systems. Despite the damage they cause, there is limited knowledge of the agroecological drivers that determine their abundance in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we assessed how farming practices (e.g. cropping systems, and organic input strategies) along with soil and environmental properties, influence the presence and relative abundance of Fusarium and lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) across multiple locations in western Kenya. Common farming practices in the region include maize monocultures, maize-legume intercrops, maize in rotation with legumes and vegetables, and perennial-based horticultural systems. Fertilization strategies typically involve organic, inorganic or combined nutrient inputs. We used baiting protocols to assess the abundance of Fusarium and LN in soils collected from 35 smallholder farms. Our findings indicate that agroecological practices such as diversified cropping systems and organic amendments influence soilborne pathogens and important soil health parameters. For example, organic inputs reduced lesion nematode pressure by 56% compared to inorganic systems, while diversified systems supported higher soil carbon and available phosphorus. These results highlight the importance of agroecological management in maintaining soil health and regulating soilborne pathogens to improve smallholder productivity.",

    "abstract": "Grenada, a Caribbean Island, is known for its principal export crop of nutmeg. However, the nutmeg industry is highly vulnerable to the challenges of land degradation, dependence on trade, limited economies of scale for production, and climate change. These challenges are anticipated to influence the sustainability of the industry. As a result, this study proposes the use of the soil security framework to assess the sustainability of crop production within nutmeg agroecosystems. A methodology for assessing each component of soil security was developed for the study, including land capability classification, soil health analysis, assessing crop productivity, identifying climate-smart agriculture, and revising the legislative environment. The research design and methodology incorporate quantitative and qualitative data jointly from soil resources and human participants. This approach expands existing studies by utilizing an interdisciplinary analytical approach for assessing soil security that can be implemented in the Caribbean. Through the soil security approach, the health and capability of the soil are suitable for nutmeg cultivation. Still, productivity is influenced by the adoption of management practices by farmers. These management practices are influenced by policies and programs implemented by governing stakeholders. Therefore, for sustainable agricultural production, a multi-stakeholder governing framework is recommended to effectively tackle challenges within the industry.",

Due to an unorganized distribution network, products placement in markets mainly takes place locally (71.4%). Most producers are cooperating but in an informal way.",

The present study assessed the knowledge development process and the raising of environmental awareness among 30 farmers from Poland exposed to four approaches aimed to reduce phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) losses to water. The farmers were interviewed with open-ended questions on-farm both before and after the project intervention. As hoped, the farmers attempted to adjust their farm practices to the European Union regulations, which are in some cases supported by subsidies. As a complement, the project offered tools for system-thinking based on farm data and support from agricultural advisors: a) a survey of plant-available P, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and soil pH, resulting in soil maps; b) assessment of nitrogen leaching risks from individual fields; c) compilation of a farm-gate balance. Farmers were positive to soil surveys and maps, but had limited understanding of the nutrient balance concept and calculations. They generally relied on their own experiences regarding fertilization rather than on calculated farm nutrient balances and leaching risks. Farmers' understanding and willingness to adopt new approaches to improve nutrient efficiency and reduce negative environmental impacts are discussed.",

We used mixed methods (participatory rural appraisals and 64 semi-structured household surveys) across six hamlets. The most robust 15 indicators were selected through correlation analysis. Two series of five least squares regression models determined that the critical points had significant impacts on economic disparities but failed to explain malnutrition levels. Consequently, we compared two contrasting hamlets according to their energy and protein supply. The results showed that FNS is linked to sustainability as the more self-reliant and equitable community exhibited higher food security. However, FNS depends upon a complex array of self-sufficiency strategies that remain linked to individual household idiosyncrasies.",

Recent work in agroecology has refined our understanding of agroecosystem resilience, but both temporal and geographical scales are often limited. Due to largely inaccessible and dwindling water resources, an examination of change at the scale of an agroecological landscape is required to better understand how rainfed agroecosystems remain resilient over an extensive period of time. Our article examines the relationship between agroecological landscape change and resilience in the face of powerful social-economic transformations. Our study combines the novel approach of geospatial, field and interview data in order to understand the long-term resilience of an entire agroecological landscape in the Palestinian West Bank. We argue that the study area has experienced a high level of resilience for over 70 years, perhaps for as long as 100 years, and this resilience is attributed not to a stability in production practices, but to a dynamism in practices that have enabled cultivators to adapt to broader political-economic shifts. In doing so, the paper calls for attention within agroecology and food systems research to the dynamism and resilience found within rainfed agroecosystems.",

Well-replicated studies during the transition are necessary for testing the causes of observed changes. To test soil property changes following conversion, we collected data from 18 dairy farms (nine converting and nine that remained under conventional methods) in the Waikato, Taranaki, and Manawatu regions of New Zealand. Soil properties on the converting group were compared with matched farms that continued with conventional methods. Converting to organic did not result in increased total carbon or nitrogen, but phosphorus decreased by 42%. Bulk density decreased by 3.5% in converted farms but increased by 9.8% in conventional farms. Earthworm densities were higher in organic farms but there was no significant change in soil microbial parameters. Total nitrogen was lower where microbial respiration was higher but there was no evidence of a link between earthworms and soil nutrient levels. This observation challenges whether the observed changes in studies of farms that have already converted are indeed caused by organic farming methods themselves. Long-term studies are needed before the broader implications of conversion can be fully assessed.",

We compare the Achí case to other examples documented in the literature and the key factors, or \"drivers,\" reported as important if not essential for scaling to occur. We find that the Achí scase is complex with regard to these drivers. Factors such as constructivist learning/teaching methods, favorable public policies, and strong social fabric appear to be weak, absent, or even negative. This is due in part to the violence and repression of the 1980s, which resulted in the assassination of 20 percent of the population by the military and paramilitaries, leaving the territory socially fragmented. Projects incorporating agroecology (revalorization of ancestral practices, seed saving, elimination of external inputs, strengthening soil health, increasing/guarding agrobiodiversity) are viewed as a potential strategy to aid in community recovery, and are promoted by local associations as well as by international institutions and NGOs. While social and cultural recuperation were initially hypothesized as primary causes for the adoption of practices, we encounter a range of additional and complex factors, such as the expectation of economic benefits and the presence of aid and development organizations. By analyzing these drivers and barriers we contribute to the ongoing debate over how agroecological practices may be scaled-out, particularly in regions exhibiting less than ideal conditions.",

Promotion and adoption of CA in Iran have been receiving increased attention from the national government over recent years. Therefore, to speed up development of CA as a basis for sustainable development, drivers that influence the development of CA need to be identified and modeled. The main aim of this study is to present a comprehensive model for CA development in Iran by identifying the institutional drivers that influence its promotion and determining the relationship between drivers. At first, the drivers identified from the literature and interviews with experts, and the relationships among the drivers were explored and clarified using Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM). A cross-impact matrix multiplication was applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis, which was then used to categorize the drivers in four sub-groups. The results showed that creating a suitable organizational structure is a very significant driving factor for CA development in Iran. Strong driving power and weak dependence associated with this factor should be treated as a critical driver. If CA shall expand more rapidly in future, then Iran’s government should invest in an appropriate organizational structure for it.",

We found, however, that beef farmers pursue agroecological principles through an impressive diversity of practices in this context. In 37 semi-structured interviews, we asked farmers how they put into practice a set of principles which covers many themes addressed in agroecological literature. Inspired by a grounded theory approach, but also based on literature and consultation of fellow researchers, we conceptualized for each principle distinctive pathways of action to categorize relevant practices. By documenting farmers' practices, we show that an agronomic interpretation of agroecology as a practice obfuscates the many ways farmers can contribute to the social dimensions of agroecology too, which also problematizes those food systems approaches that undervalue the farmers' agency in changing their social context themselves. This grounded conceptual framework may be used to further assess how each beef farmer addresses these different principles together in practice. Given these results and perspectives, we contend that empirical inquiries such as these are instrumental in maintaining the connection between agroecological theory and practice, allowing both to move dialectically forward.",

We conclude that although academic disciplines seek to adopt systemic approaches in their studies of sustainability, they are driven by reductionist and epistemological influences. In this sense, we consider the technical–biological perspective, which operates with an agroecological approach, as the best perspective that will contribute to the design and the development of sustainable livestock agroecosystems and, in addition, when its studies transcend to its application on plot or field to an agroecosystem or food system scale.",

In this program, resource-poor farmers receive a dairy cow and develop various skills and assets to improve their livelihood. One potential benefit of the program is to improve soil fertility through the application of manure. A study was conducted in the Ngoma district of Rwanda to assess the effectiveness of manure usage and current levels of manure knowledge, attitudes, and practices among the program beneficiaries. Our results suggest that more than 90% of Girinka farmers are using manure, and farmers positively attributed increased crop yields and improved soil fertility to manure use. However, farmers were not consistently using recommended manure management practices, citing lack of manure handling and transporting tools, distance to fields, and poor construction of cow sheds as key limiting factors. Significant differences in manure management, access to information and extension services, and constraints hindering manure usage among male and female farmers were also identified in this study. We recommend stronger emphasis on beneficial manure management practices during the Girinka trainings and suggest several ways to improve the potential benefits of manure usage for Girinka farmers in this region of Rwanda.",

The FIOIPS comprises five linked organic subsystems, including apple, grass, pig, biogas, and rainwater. Despite being proposed as a cost-effective agroecosystem, the FIOIPS's environmental sustainability and economic benefits remain unclear. In this study, we compared the FIOIPS with conventional (clean) tillage-based and grass-cultivation-in-orchard apple production systems commonly used in Weibei. Emergy flow and economic characteristics of the systems were analyzed by emergy and economic analysis using the emergy indices of transformity, renewability, emergy yield ratio, environmental loading ratio, emergy sustainability index, emergy exchange ratio, and feedback ratio of yield emergy. Although the FIOIPS has relatively low potential energy conversion efficiency and strong dependence on the inputs purchased from the market economy, it is superior to the other two systems regarding self-organizing capacity, renewable resource utilization efficiency, ecological environmental loading, economic benefits, and sustainability. From the perspectives of market economy and sustainability, the FIOIPS has promising applicability, feasibility and development potential for agricultural production on the Loess Plateau. Finally, disadvantages of the FIOIPS are discussed and possible solutions are provided for optimizing the integrated production system.",

It finds that the AGR idea does incorporate some elements farmers find useful, indeed, that they are implementing autonomously, such as use of organic soil amendments. However, the underpinning emphasis on commercialization does not allow room for them to practice site-specific SFM and subsistence mechanisms that they have developed as responses to risk. Some aspects of the AGR are themselves disadvantageous, for example repayment of credit at harvest time, the emphasis on inorganic fertilizer and land titling schemes. Despite advocating farmer choice, the current hegemonic implementation of the AGR makes it unlikely to support farmers’ sustainable agroecological practice.",

In this article, I draw on three case studies of CSOs promoting sustainable agriculture in India, in order to evaluate their potential to address contemporary agrarian issues in a pro-poor manner. I argue that, whatever the technical merits of sustainable farming systems may be, CSOs are constrained in their ability to implement these systems in a manner that directly meets the needs of the rural poor. This is largely because, in order to achieve their goals, sustainable agriculture organizations usually must forge relations with at least five separate entities: the state, donor organizations, activist networks, rural elites and the rural poor. Strategic decisions must be made regarding which of these entities are prioritized and, for a variety of reasons, the leaders of sustainable agriculture organizations often prioritize relations with powerful actors rather than the rural poor. This is a major barrier to the development of models of sustainable agriculture that may address the needs of rural communities in the context of the contemporary agrarian crisis.",

Today, it is seriously under threat by the unbridled development model. Objective. Describe the practices of food autonomy in the indigenous cosmovision of the Nasa people in Colombia. Method. Qualitative research with a descriptive focus. In total, 26 members of the Indigenous Reservation of Rionegro-Huila aged over 14 years voluntarily participated in the research in discussion groups and in-depth interviews. Results and conclusions. Food autonomy practices in the cosmovision of the Nasa people are related to fundamental aspects: spiritual harmony derived from harmonious relationships between people, the earth, the environment, and deities; the characteristics of seeds, cycles, planting methods, and the Tul; and communal work methods such as Minga and barter, which come together as acts of resistance against the capitalist model.",

We examine the state labeling initiatives in the northeastern U.S. (CT, MA, ME, VT), with particular focus on Vermont as it was the only state to enact a GMO labeling bill in 2016. We combine interviews with stakeholders and testimony from public hearings to understand the ways in which stakeholders and the public framed the issue. We find that frames tied to individual consumer rights and economic risks were evident across all northeastern states' discourses on GMO labeling, with some states emphasizing concerns linked to public health and lack of scientific data. In Vermont, we find that frames tied to the state's agricultural identity and collective welfare resonated within the progressive, direct democratic political landscape. These collective welfare frames differ from individually focused neoliberal frames more commonly found throughout GMO labeling debates and broader food activism.",

Subsistence-oriented smallholder farmers across the shrimp producing areas of southwest Bangladesh are widely adopting crop diversification techniques as a response to negative environmental changes and associated risks of crop failure. Cultivating multiple crops (including rice, non-rice crops, shrimp/fish, vegetables, and livestock) in various combinations through the year could be sustainable farming adaptation as it minimizes both economic and environmental risks. It also potentially promotes women participation in subsistence-oriented farming activities including homestead gardening and cattle rearing. Crop diversification in southwest coastal Bangladesh has critical implications for coastal land management.",

We examine the case of campesino grape producers in the Central Valley of Tarija, Bolivia, and how and why they combine commercial grape production with species-level agrobiodiversity. High production costs and ecological and economic risks of viticulture, alongside other species' sociocultural and economic values, are factors informing campesino production strategies. The importance of agrobiodiversity for campesino viticulturalists, however, is underrecognized by rural development authorities and we discuss opportunities to narrow the persisting gaps between rural development theory and practice in the Central Valley.",

While no-till increases total SOC in the medium to long term, it was hypothesized that the inclusion of high biomass cover crops and organic mulches may increase total SOC in the short term. The use of invasive, perennial leguminous species as mulch may sustainably increase SOC during limited-input fall vegetable production. The objective of this study, conducted in Alabama (USA), was to quantify total SOC changes due to organic mulches and forage soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Derry) as a summer cover crop after conversion to no-till during limited-input fall collard (Brassica oleracea L.) production. Forage soybean as a summer cover crop did not increase SOC. No-till without mulch (control treatment) significantly increased SOC at 0–5 cm from 6.3 to 14.0 g kg−1 soil in 3 yrs, whereas inclusion of cut-and-carry mulches increased SOC to ≥22.6 g kg−1 soil. Treatments did not affect collard yield, which averaged 17,863 kg ha−1 yr−1. This represents a novel, limited-input system that may help control on-farm invasive species while sustainably increasing SOC in the short term.",

We use elements of Chayanovian thinking and ecological complexity as a basis, considering that this decision is made by families with heterogeneous preferences in a context with a dynamic that, on the one hand, is non-linear for ecological cycles, and, on the other hand, is chaotic in terms of the interaction with the market. The model describes the relationship between the ecological-productive potential or capacity of a plot and the total production, as well as the effect of management (agroecological or agrochemical) on the ecological capacity. We explore the effect of agrochemical subsidies on this decision and discuss the consequences of these public policy instruments on the lives of farming families. The model shows that by using agrochemicals, both the economy and the ecological balance of the plot enter an unstable pattern with harmful long-term consequences, as there could be a significant reduction in household savings. The same effect is observed on production, since the ecological capacity tends to decrease throughout the simulation.",

We conducted a pilot study in the south of Espírito Santo, a tropical Brazilian region. The survey of trees took place on 136.9 ha of pastureland at nine rural properties. We interviewed 42 family farmers that practiced cattle ranching and had trees in their pastures. A multi-attribute utility function was created to select and order ten tree species with cultural and ecological potential for pasture afforestation. We evaluated these species regarding their interactions with soil cover, herbaceous biomass and bovine grazing. The ten selected tree species showed orderly decreased EESI (Ethnoecological Selection Index) values ranging from 0.8327 to 0.5958. All ten species were native, 30% were nitrogen fixers, 70% had Use Value, and none were invasive. Regarding soil cover, herbaceous biomass, and grazing, the under the crown and outside the crown strata showed no statistical differences between them. The crown base height and herbaceous ground cover positively correlated, while the canopy cover and herbaceous ground cover negatively correlated. The EESI creates an interface between the traditional knowledge of family farmers and scientific knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Organic agriculture aims to produce food while establishing an ecological balance to augment ecosystem services (ES) and has been rapidly expanding in the world since the 1980s. Recently, however, in several European countries, including Denmark, organic farmers have converted back to conventional farming. Hence, understanding how agricultural ES are affected by the number of years since conversion to organic farming is imperative for policy makers to guide future agricultural policy. In order to investigate the long-term effects of conversion to organic farming on ES we performed i) a model simulation case study by applying the Daisy model to simulate 14 different conversion scenarios for a Danish farm during a 65 year period with increasing number of years under organic farming, and ii) an on-farm case study in Denmark with one conventional farm, one organic farm under conversion, and three organic farms converted 10, 15 and 58 years ago, respectively. Both the model simulation case study and the on-farm case study showed that non-marketable ES values increased with increasing number of years under organic farming. Trade-offs between marketable and non-marketable ES were not evident, since also marketable ES values generally showed an increasing trend, except when the price difference between organic and conventional products in the model simulation study was the smallest, and when an alfalfa pre-crop in the on-farm case study resulted in a significantly higher level of plant available nitrogen, which boosted the yield and the associated marketable ES of the subsequent winter rye crop. These results indicate a possible benefit of preserving long-term organic farms and could be used to argue for agricultural policy interventions to offset further reduction in the number of organic farms or the land area under organic farming.",

Our framework is informed by a review of the literature from which we define the components that make up tree cover and the socioecological drivers of tree cover in cattle pastures. We propose that the drivers of tree cover are the continuum between two economies: the peasant and the capitalist.",

The raw milk system is remarkably resilient and gives lower prices to milk drinkers and better returns to small-scale farmers. The value chain intervention provides opportunities for some dairy farmers but can't compete and favors corporate entities less aligned with most farmers' and city residents' interests. Policy maker's preference for value chain interventions appears to be ideological as it is not justified by the outcomes, but support for alternatives is growing and needs to be built on.",

This study was designed to investigate the choices governing conversion to organic farming of an experimental mixed dairy farm in Lorraine (eastern France) and to highlight the associated changes in N fluxes. The study was conducted over a suitably long period of time at a farm scale integrating the diversity of practices in one conventional and then two autonomous organic systems (a grazing livestock system and a mixed dairy system). Two indicators were used to draw up the main features. First, the farm-gate N budgets show that the organic farm has a balance twice as low as the conventional system. Second, the soil surface balance exhibited substantial differences between functional zones. Finally, this study shows that an accurate estimation of soil surface balance requires taking into account the spatial distribution within the farm area based on practices and their rationale.",

    "abstract": "Factors affecting rice production in saline soil regimes and farmer adaptations were studied in northeast Thailand during 2012. Measurements included composite soil sampling, combined with a household survey on rice production and socioeconomic conditions. Soil salinity reduced rice productivity, despite the application of organic matter and fertilizers. Average rice yields were estimated at 1.56 tons/ha, but varied according to size of the saline paddies. Farmers with a high percentage of saline paddies incurred more costs, especially on farm maintenance. Income did not show significant relationships with farming activities, but it limited the number of options for fertilizer application. Although sufficient amounts of water can reduce soil salinity, irrigation creates some tension over local water supplies, thus an issue of social equity. Rice farmers in northeast Thailand feel compelled to practice the agricultural traditions of previous generations in light of diminished crop yields. Although farming is a source of identity for older people, it is not followed among many youth who perceive greater wealth opportunities from city jobs, leaving the future of family rice farming in jeopardy. Biophysical environments determine farming practices in saline soil regimes, as well as socioeconomic factors—an interdependent model called environmental–socioeconomic determination.",

    "abstract": "Currently, smallholder farmers in the Philippines and elsewhere are being engaged in the production of rubber and oil palm for global consumption. Among these smallholder farmers are indigenous peoples who continue to practice traditional forms of swidden agriculture. There is then a propensity for emerging agro-industrial production regimes to increasingly interact with and affect traditional swidden agroecosystems. In this article, we endeavor to explore the application of the resilience concept in analyzing and comparing the persistence of swidden agroecosystems enmeshed in globally integrated agro-industrial production in the province of Palawan, the Philippines. Drawing from six months of ethnography, we compare the resilience of swidden agroecosystems interacting with rubber and oil palm production regimes using indicators developed specifically to evaluate the social and ecological resilience of agroecosystems. Our findings suggest that swidden agroecosystems interacting with rubber production indicate greater resilience as compared to those with oil palm. This difference can be attributed to the greater tolerance of the rubber production regime to swidden agriculture, as well as the regime's more flexible production management systems. However, we caution that any plans of the rubber production regime to follow the oil palm contract model may result in the decline of resilience of swidden agroecosystems in rubber-producing communities.",

The livestock production activities that generate GHG emissions in Canada organized into four management groups: Farm animals, manure systems, crop production, and farm inputs, were used to define the system boundaries of a life cycle assessment (LCA). For the environmental assessment (EA) stage of the LCA an environmental impact matrix and a network diagram was used to identify the non-CFP of Canadian livestock production. The Unified Livestock Industry and Crop Emissions Estimation System (ULICEES) model was used to estimate the livestock CFP. An index derived from agricultural extension literature was used to assign weights to the non-CFP impacts during the EA stage of the LCA. The attention given to these impacts in this literature, factored by the crop areas associated with each issue and livestock type, resulted in the area-reference index (ARI). The impacts were assessed on the basis of Eastern and Western Canada and on two broad classes of Canadian livestock: ruminants and non-ruminants. Non-ruminants showed much less east–west difference in greenhouse gas emissions than ruminants. The farm animals component had the highest protein based emission intensity. The highest ARI contribution to the non-CFP was from growing annual feed grains for both ruminants and non-ruminants.

    "abstract": "Pigeonpea is a major pulse crop in India. However, its productivity, which hovers around 700 kg ha−1, has remained stagnant over the past several decades. Local landraces dominate the cultivation of pigeonpea in the country. A major reason for low productivity in pigeonpea is the nonavailability of quality seed of improved varieties to farmers. In this article, we share experiences of farmer-participatory pigeonpea seed production in Fatehpur and Kanpur Dehat districts in Uttar Pradesh in India. Through farmer-participatory varietal selection trials, farmers identified NA 1, long-duration pigeonpea variety and UPAS 120, short-duration variety, as their preferred choices. Long-duration variety NA 1 was preferred because of its disease resistance, higher yield, attractive seed size and color. Farmers were organized to form cooperative societies to undertake seed production, processing and marketing at the local level. Societies were also linked with the public sector seed producing agencies to participate in the formal seed production program. The C: B ratio of seed production of NA 1 variety was 1: 5.19 as compared to 1: 2.53 of the local variety. Village-level seed production not only addressed the issue of shortage of quality seeds but also brought higher incomes to farmers leading to improved livelihood.",

    "abstract": "Urban agriculture on green roofs has tremendous potential to enhance food security, economic opportunities, and community building in cities yet faces unique ecological challenges including limited soil moisture content for crops. We compared the effects of two green roof soil moisture management practices, sedum (Sedum album) groundcover versus watering, on performance and quality of three perennial culinary herbs: thyme, mint, and oregano. Individually and interactively, sedum groundcover and watering significantly impacted parameters of performance (biomass, vitality, and module coverage) and quality (total phenolic concentrations) of the three culinary herbs during early stages of establishment while having variable impacts during later developmental stages. Our results suggest that sedum groundcover can serve as a substitute for watering of hardy culinary herbs on green roofs on the basis of plant performance and quality. Findings can be applied to inform agroecological water management of herbs and other hardy specialty crops on green roofs toward enhancing their drought tolerance and advancing sustainable urban agriculture.",

    "abstract": "In Chile, as in many other parts of the world, agroecology was first developed from studies on traditional agricultural systems. In the late1970s and early 1980s, when a large portion of Chilean population was under high poverty, the first notions for agroecological thinking arised. In the early 1980s, NGOs were the first entities to do applied agroecology in the country. Of particular relevance is the Center for Education and Technology which was a pioneering NGO that implemented demonstrative agroecological farms making a huge impact in the development of agroecology in Chile. It also influenced academics that in the 1990s incorporated agroecology to some universities, and also state agencies that started to incorporate agroecology in their discourses. Finally, medium and large agricultural export-oriented companies made important efforts to incorporate agroecological principles in their farms. After more than 30 years, some NGOs are still playing a key role in promoting agroecology among farmers and rural communities. However, Chilean agriculture is still mostly dominated by modern conventional practices. Probably, the future conditions of high uncertainty and climatic disturbances will increase the need for agroecological practices that increase farm resilience and food sovereignty.",

It has been fundamental for the agricultural and cultural development of the region for millennia. Cajete maize is planted before the start of the rainy season. By planting it deep, it takes advantage of residual humidity. This paper seeks to analyze the history of cajete maize agriculture, as well as its changes and innovations. An exhaustive literature review was carried out, ethnographic work was developed, and changes and the prospects of cajete maize were analyzed. Recent innovations include the change of sowing dates and the use of a shovel instead of a half-moon shaped coa (digging stick). The main advantages of cajete maize over seasonal maize are more resistance to drought and higher yields. Cajete sowing is an activity that strengthens community ties, because it is performed by groups of farmers, based on family and communal reciprocity mechanisms, in which women also play an important role. The persistence of cajete maize is associated with its adaptation to rainfall variability and to the fact that it is part of Mixtec communities' cultural heritage.",

We randomly assigned plants to one of three compost tea treatments: aerated compost tea under ambient temperature, heated and aerated compost tea, and a control treatment. Heated and aerated compost tea increased soil percent nitrogen compared to the other treatments, and decreased activity of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme involved in chitin degradation, compared to the aerated-only treatment.

Using an example from Vanuatu (South West Bay, Malakula Island), this study explains how Government policy around sustainable development is disseminated and the impacts it has on practice. In the study area, there is little direct knowledge of policy although it is often well aligned with traditional (kastom) practice. Three case studies illustrate the policy-practice nexus here. The sengtau system ensures all clan members benefit from the use of clan lands, a system currently threatened by a shift from subsistence agriculture to cash cropping. A hybrid land-lease system involves leasing part of clan lands for commercial kava production, a situation concerning some who see it as a betrayal of customary practice. The use of taboo/closure of fishing grounds to allow regeneration of seafood capacity appears driven by dietary change and cash availability. While such traditions are rooted in cultural practice, the inroads made by globalization and the market economy pose threats to their sustainability. This shows the importance of having national policy guide on-ground practice alongside support for subsistence agriculture and associated social safety nets.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity conservation outside designated protected areas remains challenging in South Africa, where 80% of the biodiversity resources occur on private and communal lands. This applies to the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, which is the focus of this study. Landholders logically choose agricultural production ahead of conservation, which they often perform using non-ecological methods. Extension is well positioned to promote ecological agriculture, but its current contribution is unknown. This study examined the role of extension in ecological agriculture in KZN by investigating extension’s promotion of ecological agriculture among smallholder farmers and the factors impacting their employment of ecologically compatible practices. Data was collected through semistructured interviews with 44 respondents, comprising 5 provincial biodiversity conservation practitioners, 1 national biodiversity conservation manager, and 1 national and 4 provincial agricultural extension managers, selected by purposive sampling; as well as 25 extension officers and 8 farmers, selected by convenience sampling. The study found that extension mainly engages in technology transfer and distribution of production inputs, which poses challenges to biodiversity conservation. Extension shows little concern for biodiversity, and effectively promotes its degradation. Four sets of factors impacting extension’s capacity to promote ecological agriculture emerged: household/community-level, governmental, extension management, and ecological factors. Key among these were inadequate involvement of youth and men in agriculture; inadequate household production resources; poor collaboration and coordination between extension and biodiversity conservation institutions; top-down extension intervention; poor extension management and delivery capacities; and irregular and inadequate rainfall, as well as droughts and flooding. The study concluded that there is a need for a clearly articulated extension and biodiversity conservation policy supporting appropriate linkages and better coordination and integration of services among extension and biodiversity agencies within the National and Provincial Departments of Agriculture and with farmers; more effective agricultural education in schools; strengthening extension support systems; and creating conducive atmospheres for effective extension.",

It comprised male and female vine multipliers with land close to water sources growing sweetpotato during the dry season. They sold vines during the rainy season, with male multipliers and those with larger crops selling more. The average multiplier supplied approximately 50 farmers who commonly travelled 20 km, each buying approximately 1–2 bundles of vine and provided an entry point for disseminating technologies. ARI–Ukiriguru organized demonstrations of rapid multiplication, inorganic and organic fertilizers and new cultivars on multipliers' land. Fertilizer could economically more than double vine yields with huge potential benefits for an area where production is constrained by planting material; some multipliers immediately began using it. Multipliers took rapid multiplication and new cultivars to their home gardens for further experimentation, seeming likely to adopt especially the cultivar NASPOT 1. A strategy of growing large quantities of irrigated sweetpotato in Misungwi and selling the vines long-distance in Shinyanga, a marketing strategy derived from Uganda, was also adopted. These successes confirm the value of formal-informal seed sector interactions in ISSD.",

Using questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and plant community analysis, we assess the relationship between perception of CES by community gardeners, the management practices they utilize, and the agroecological characteristics of their garden plots, such as presence and prevalence of species that provide regulating and supporting ES. We find that while almost all survey participants report sociocultural benefits of gardening, experience of these CES varies significantly between gardeners, with garden structure influencing which group of benefits is most perceived. Experience of some CES was also correlated with local ecological knowledge and use of certain sustainable garden management practices, such as utilizing integrated pest management strategies and planting a wide variety of species, but not with observed non-provisioning plant agrobiodiversity. These results provide important insights into the complex role that CES play in encouraging environmental stewardship and shaping ecological outcomes in collectively managed urban green spaces.",

Yet very few existing studies have explicitly addressed their linkages. Synergies among the SDGs are often examined at the national level, overlooking nuanced opportunities revealed by small agroecology initiatives at the local scale. Based on literature review, field visits and semi-structured interviews with farms and relevant organizations in China, this research investigates how locally embedded agroecology practices lead to advancement of multiple SDG targets and facilitate the synergies among the SDGs. It also highlights their motivations, achievements, and challenges. We argue that the technocentric metrics of SDGs underappreciate the application of traditional knowledge and small-scale low-tech innovations. By bringing visibility to low-tech and small agroecology initiatives, this paper advocates for stronger inclusion of grassroots agroecology initiatives in SDG discussions among researchers and policy makers.",

    "abstract": "Due to rising population, the globe confronts serious issues with food security, unemployment, and ecological damage. In comparison to 9.9% in 2020 and 8.4% in 2019, about 10% of the world's population experienced hunger in 2021 (FAO, 2022). Diseases like anemia, thyroid, and night blindness can all be driven forth by malnutrition. Many low-income households find it expensive to eat animal products. A variety of neglected vegetables can serve as a substitute for vitamins, minerals, and secondary plant metabolites that support health. Under-utilized legumes, abundant in plant-based protein, offer an affordable alternative to address protein deficiency. The significant folic acid content of several underutilized green vegetables contributes to minimizing the risk of coronary ailments. Crop diversification is a strategy that considerably increases food security, health and nutrition, climate resilience, and environmental sustainability. In small-scale farming, the integration of a variety of crops not only enables more effective utilization of agro-ecological processes, but also contributes to the diversity of the human diet and raises family income. Vegetable crop diversification has potential to enhance availability and financial affordability of healthy and fresh food. Additionally, by cultivating a diverse range of crops locally, there will be rise in economic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Diversified crop rotations can be a win-win solution for farmers and society given increased agronomic yield and improved ecosystem services. However, the adoption of sustainable production practices must be widespread and accelerated to create resilient agroecosystems that can remain productive as the climate changes. In this paper, we use modified measures of sense of place (SOP) and social responsibility (SR) to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of diversified crop rotations (DCR) among producers in South Dakota (SD). Data was collected from 34 SD counties east of the Missouri River. Through the application of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we identified 3 constructs of SOP on working landscapes 1) place attachment and identity, 2) social networks, and 3) physical place dependence. Using a binary logistic regression, a positive association between the adoption of DCR and place attachment and identity was found. This suggests that farmers have an emotional bond to their land that plays a role in their usage of DCR. Our results suggest that measuring some dimensions of SOP in a working landscape context is important, but needs more refinement, specifically economic dependence, given that the items measuring it did not emerge as a factor in the EFA.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to alleviate negative impacts of elephant crop-raiding faced by smallholder farmers around the Okavango delta. Although many studies have identified the relationship between crop-raiding and climatic factors, little attention was paid to aligning cropping duration to high rainfall. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how crop maturity duration influences farmers' vulnerability to elephant crop raiding and food loss. An experimental plot consisting of early and late maturing varieties of maize, sorghum and cowpea was set up and monitored in farms adjacent to corridors. Early maturing varieties yielded more (mean = 0.35 tha−1) than later maturing varieties (mean = 0.25 tha−1). The prolonged stay of crops in fields exposed them more to elephants (p < 0.001). Unlike late varieties, early varieties served as an evasion strategy by allowing earlier harvesting when there was adequate rainfall and elephants rarely frequented farms. Late maturing varieties were harvested at 16–19 weeks when elephants frequented the fields. This harvest timing significantly influences the vulnerability of crops to debilitating elephant raiding. This outcome suggests that policy reviews should incorporate more climate action into smallholder farming systems to strengthen SDG 1: no poverty and SDG 2: zero hunger, ease hostility toward elephants and improve elephant conservation.",

We conducted baseline interviews and field experiments in Eastern Central Tanzania to determine farmers' perception on the approach and verify its socio-economic performance in cucurbit crop production. The performance of small-scale cucurbit farming in agroecological and conventional agriculture was broadly comparable. Farmers perceived the approach as effective and beneficial over conventional farming and pesticide-based agriculture but constrained by its more elaborate/laborious implementation. Still, agroecological farming significantly lowered the production costs. Therefore small-scale agroecological cucurbit farming in Tanzania represents a viable alternative and promising tool to reduce use of synthetic pesticides that negatively impact human health and the environment.",

This approach is intended as an alternative to resources-intensive assessment methods, covering larger areas and providing rapid yet empirical evidences for policy and practice. It is based on the translation of the 13 agroecology principles of the High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) into 21 contextualized indicators and questions that are relevant for the research area. They are grouped into four entry points for transformative action: land use and governance, farm management, social interactions, and socio-economic situation. This approach was tested in 16 villages and three districts in Xiengkhouang Province in Laos. The results show that villages are at an intermediate agroecological level. Comparable results and conclusions were achieved, regarding potential entry points for transformative action in specific villages, encouraging the reliability of the approach. It also showed to be promising in terms of the capacity to characterize the status of the 13 principles of agroecology, and to capture their changes in time. This approach may be further combined with other assessment methods to complement the aspects that require finer understanding or assessment over large territories.",

    "abstract": "This research employed a participatory co-design approach to improve sustainable agricultural practices in Sadivayal village, Tamil Nadu. Smallholder tribal farmers faced challenges like pest vulnerability, middlemen influence, and limited awareness of sustainable rice production technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened these issues, leading many farmers to lease their land to middlemen who practiced chemically intensive farming. This created confusion, as farmers were uncertain whether to let middlemen continue or switch to chemically intensive farming themselves, abandoning traditional methods. The study involved farmers in defining problems, planning interventions, and conducting treatment demonstrations, integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge. Three treatments including organic, chemically intensive, and integrated farming were tested on four indigenous rice varieties and one commercial variety (CO55). Results showed CO55 was preferred due to its high-yielding capacity (4622 kg ha−1) and drought avoidance due to short duration (121 days), while Karuppu Kavuni was valued for its pest and disease resistance. Seeraga Samba was the least preferred due to high pest susceptibility and poor yield (1828 kg ha-1). Farmers favored a combination of organic and inorganic practices, and the study has led to the adoption of CO55 (54%), Karuppu Kavuni (24%), and Mappilai Samba (12%) in the 2023 season. The study features the value of participatory approaches in addressing local challenges and promoting sustainable farming practices.",

To address these challenges, various policies and strategies have been designed and implemented in the country. This study is aimed at assessing and analyzing the relationship between dietary diversity and agroecology using the Tool for Agroecological Performance Evaluation (TAPE) methodology in selected regional states in Ethiopia. The study employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A total of 619 sample farm households were randomly drawn. The findings revealed that a large majority of farms assessed were found to be non-agroecological. In terms of diet diversity, the consumption of important food groups such as meat, eggs, fruits, and pulses has been very low. This result suggests that the vast majority of households suffer from micronutrient deficiency due to low level of dietary diversity. The study also revealed that households with more advanced agroecological farms had better dietary diversity. This study concludes that agroecological-based farming can improve production and contribute to better dietary diversity. As we move from non-agroecological to agroecological farms, dietary diversity score increases, suggesting the importance of fostering agroecological transition through awareness creation (agroecology education) and sensitization.",

    "abstract": "The agronomical, cultural, and historical importance of local varieties and the need of structured preservation of genetic resources have been widely recognized at both political and scientific levels in the past decades. To be engaged in genetic resource preservation, farmers must find it rewarding. Besides public policies, the generation of benefits depends crucially on the revenues farmers can collect through product sales, which, in turn, depends on consumers' preferences. If consumers are willing to pay a price premium that rewards farmers for the lower productivity and greater variability usually associated with traditional varieties, market can make a significant contribution to agrobiodiversity preservation. However, knowledge about consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for traditional varieties is scarce and the main research on this topic focuses on particular varieties making it difficult to generalize the results. This study, rather than determining consumers' WTP for a specific variety, seeks to estimate the WTP for the attribute \"traditional variety\" itself, using a hedonic price model. In-store Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auctions were applied for data collection. Results show that consumers, depending on their socio-economic characteristics, are willing to pay for the feature \"traditional variety\".",

More recently, many farmers have suffered crop losses in the wake of the spread of coffee leaf rust disease, and researchers are predicting that some areas will become less suitable for coffee growing in the near future as a result of climate change. For these reasons, many have called for the promotion of livelihood diversification as an additional component of rural development programs. This study uses thematic analysis of transcripts from 15 interviews with members of a regional Guatemalan coffee cooperative, Asociación Barillense de Agricultores, based on four different interview guides. Coffee remains the primary livelihood strategy of the respondents, whereas most other activities appear to offer relatively small contributions to incomes, with the exception of honey and a small sewing shop. Some of the farmer responses reflect coping mechanisms rather than risk management. The study also identified other themes mediating diversification, including income-smoothing, optimization, familiarity, social networks, and influences from external actors.",

Although there are demands to incorporate socioeconomic impact (SEI) assessment into regulatory deliberations, these often neglect to look beyond the technology in isolation to also include the networks of relations agricultural biotechnologies require and create. This paper argues that understanding the impacts of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) cultivation requires attentiveness to the operational context of the technology as well as a wide range of actors and potential pathways of harm. In order to do this and contribute new empirical research, this paper adopts a system-based perspective and focuses on socioeconomic impacts for a particular actor that is both critically important and highly vulnerable for sustainable agri-food systems: beekeepers. The paper explores the European Court of Justice ruling on the contamination of beehive products with GMOs. It then describes consequent legislative developments and the socioeconomic impacts observed in the wake of this in both Spain and Uruguay. The paper documents the distributive injustice being experienced by beekeepers and highlights the significance of assessing socioeconomic considerations from a systems-based understanding of agriculture and biotechnologies.",

Following El Salvador's \"turn to the left\", Salvadoran agrarian reform cooperatives and civil society allies began to allocate organizational resources toward writing public policy measures to incorporate agroecology under the FMLN government's agricultural social program, the Family Agriculture Plan (PAF). While the cooperative sector took part in active negotiations with the FMLN party for the institutionalization of favorable policies, the former guerrilla party formulized strategies for gaining a multiclass electorate in order to remain in power. With the intention to better understand the attitude and distinct Salvadoran actors, we utilize an anthropology of public policy framework to indicate how expectations of political party legitimacy failed to shape the institutionalization of agroecology in El Salvador. We suggest that the pursuit of agroecological policies is a balancing act of making use of the State to strengthen on the ground efforts without forging organizational disarticulation following changes in government administrations.",

While SRI conserves a large amount of water, it tends to endorse rice monocultures and emphasize complete eradication of weeds – practices that drastically truncate farm biodiversity. Except for a subset of “organic SRI,” most SRI practitioners apply agrochemicals. SRI proponents recommend the use of cono weeder, for weeding and soil aeration. However, poor farmers find the machine to be too costly and tend to apply herbicides for weed control, to the detriment of the environment and human health. In areas where surface water is unavailable, SRI induces use of pumps, which deplete groundwater stock and emit greenhouse gases, albeit substantially less in quantity than in conventional farming. Farmers’ adoption of SRI is motivated by spectacular grain yield, while environmental benefits remain a secondary consideration. This paper examines the SRI components that are discordant with the principles of agroecology and recommends redesigning of SRI methodology to conform to agroecology.",

Farm leaders' educational level, degree of risk preference, financial status, number of laborers, understanding of GCTs and of the dangers of chemical pesticides, knowledge of other GCT adopters, frequency of communication with neighbors, participation in technical training and the strength of media publicity have significantly positive effects on the GCT adoption behaviors of family farms, which are mainly influenced by the direct effects of characteristic variables. However, the spatial spillover effects of neighboring family farmers' participation in technical training, number of laborers, and financial status cannot be ignored. This result provides not only theoretical support for the demonstration and extension of the effectiveness of GCTs but also a reference for the selection of family farms as model households.",

    "abstract": "Not all agriculture based on perennial plants is ecologically sound or socially just. But an agroecological concept of perennial agriculture must be. We suggest three key elements of an agroecological vision for perennial agriculture. First, perennial agriculture must be managed with regard for the future as much as the present. Second, perennial agriculture must be situated in an ecological and social context, meeting the material, social, and ecological needs of the individuals and communities that engage in producing agricultural goods – making it what we term an \"agroecological endeavor.\" Third, perennial agriculture must include a diversity of plants, including – but not limited to – perennial plants. Thus, we propose envisioning perennial agriculture as the perennial management of an agroecological endeavor that includes perennial plants.",

Smallholder farmers who grow local varieties in diversity centers and communities contribute to supporting the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to adverse conditions. Widely cultivated in the Northeast region of Brazil, lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L), despite having relative economic and social importance, is little exploited in terms of conservation aspects. Based on a process of participatory interview, this article documents the knowledge of smallholder farmers associated with local varieties of this species, as well as the practices and strategies used for on-farm conservation in three producing areas of northeastern Brazil. The results revealed that farmers have a low level of education; the main factor for the loss of traditional knowledge is the disinterest of younger people in agriculture. The study highlights the importance of integrating scientific knowledge with traditional knowledge to develop sustainable agroecosystems, in which on-farm conservation is an alternative to diversify agriculture, but which requires government and private support to stimulate and enhance agricultural activities and the interaction among smallholder farmers.",

With a view to gaining a clear understanding of their cultivation practices and technical decisions in order to support farmers in a move toward environment-friendly practices, a two-year survey of tomato farmers was conducted in Mayotte. Thirty five farmers were interviewed several times about their crop management, and field observations were undertaken every two weeks. Results showed that the number of pesticide applications varied greatly (4–23) with a tendency toward over-application, and no relationship was found between the application rate and the health status of the crop. Inefficiency in protecting crop health also reflected a problem of access to pesticide information and a poor control of crop protection methods. Over-application of pesticide has long term impacts on marine health and biodiversity. The planting bed and the individual plant were found to be appropriate units for technical decision making and applying market gardening techniques. However, current agricultural advice does not apply to these units, suggesting that a redefinition of technical advice is needed.KEYWORDS: crop managementtomatopesticidessmall-scale growersdecision toolsisland biodiversity",

    "abstract": "Successful conservation strategies have increasingly looked beyond bounded protected areas and toward integrated landscape approaches that conserve biodiversity while maintaining ecosystem services that benefit human communities and food production. More integrated approaches to conservation are particularly timely in agricultural landscapes, where individual farm-level choices can play a significant role in the management of habitat provisioning, nutrient cycling, recreation amenities, carbon sequestration, and the delivery of clean water. This study presents results of an interdisciplinary analysis with shade coffee farmers in the Pico Duarte region of the Dominican Republic. Findings suggest that small farms, as part of a diversified livelihood strategy, maintain a diverse tree canopy, which supports soil conservation and important watershed services. However, high poverty levels and strong economic pressures to convert to high-input, monoculture crops are threatening native tree species biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services (e.g., delivery of clean water and carbon sequestration) to local beneficiaries, as well as to national and international actors. A coordinated effort to support smallholder shade coffee farmers across the landscape through agricultural extension, capacity building, and other market-and-non-market-based interventions offer the potential to improve rural livelihoods and ecosystem services conservation over the long-term.",

The existing literature has focused on the general dynamics of crop-livestock systems without exploring the specificities of each animal species. Egg production significantly contributes to the world food market and it is expected to continue due to its versatility. At the same time, consumption of organic products has increased in recent years, due to enhanced consumers' awareness. This work reviews the complex web of relationships between various elements of organic agriculture systems with integrated laying hens. The major findings about the integration of laying hens with crops in organic systems are as follows: 1) contributes to the reduction of inputs (less feed and fertilizers) and a diversified production; 2) supports ecosystem services shaping the landscape toward biodiversity and contributing to a healthier environment; and 3) improves farmers' livelihood, especially in developing countries. Its benefits will be increased by using mobile systems to ensure a better distribution of manure and in synchronization with canopy cover species, such as fruit and forest trees. However, more research is needed to find further contributions to this system sustainability.",

This phenomenon is notorious; familiar in biblical references to cyclical plagues of locust and discussions of pesticide treadmills, where pests resurge following the evolution of pesticide resistance. Targeted \"silver-bullet\" approaches, whether chemical, mechanical, biological, or genetic in nature, apply a reductionist lens toward the removal of a specific target pest, often ignoring ecological context, by application of said silver-bullet. In this review article, we cover how past and recent developments in theoretical ecology and complex systems dynamics provide a general and intuitive understanding of the classic problem of pest resurgence from a holistic perspective. We provide an illustrative example of a simple predator-prey model to demonstrate how complex interactions between predator control agents and their target pest prey can create alternative stable states, reproducing pest resurgence dynamics by locking systems in the outbreak stable state.",

However, there has been limited research critically assessing participatory methods employed in a codesign process. We therefore analyze the participatory methods applied for codesigning alternative land uses in the Sustainable Amazonian Landscape (SAL) project in the Caquetá department, Colombia. We conducted our analysis by situating the codesign process in a participation continuum and a codesign typology. We found that a gradient of participation level in the R&D project is beneficial for managing a codesign process. Thus, codesigning can be shaped during the project to respond to specific needs, and farmer participation levels change during the project. We found that codesigning is a process that only partially relies on participatory methods epistemologies. Instead, it reflects a tension between the continuity of a codesign project in a given territory, the sustained involvement of local partners, and external conditions such as socioeconomic and institutional stability. These are essential points to consider for co-designing the agroecological transition, as we suggest that these project-based research conditions might hinder critical principles of the codesign process.",

Therefore, a four-year experiment was carried out on an organic fennel crop comparing a system with organic management and a cover crop (ORG+CC) with both a traditional organic system (ORG) and a system without living mulch and fertilizer (CONTR). The systems were evaluated for agronomic performance, energy analysis, and carbon footprint. The carbon footprint was calculated considering the impacts of agricultural operations, and those by the production and biogeochemical processes of the soil through the DNDC (DeNitrification DeComposition) model. The ORG+CC system showed the most stable production recording the lowest losses over the years under adverse climatic conditions. The ORG and CONTR systems had an average marketable yield reduction of −29.58% and −43.66%, respectively, when extreme rainfall events occurred, compared to ORG+CC. The ORG+CC was the most sustainable system, showing the best Net Energy (output-input) value and the lowest total CO2 eq. emissions, despite the highest energetic requirements and CO2 emissions during cultivation.

Soil fertility and light intensity were also measured with and without tree influence to explain the yield differences. Results revealed that F. benghalensis trees reduce finger millet grain yield by 20.48% and straw yield by 13.73% per hectare, possibly due to the reduction in light intensity up to 75% under canopies. However the yield difference was substantially lower compared to farmers’ perceptions on crop loss due to Ficus species in agroforestry systems. Implications of these results for rainfed Ficus agroforestry in Mandya are discussed further.

    "abstract": "Abstract This research analyzes farmers' motivations for conventional management of subsistence food crops, in contrast to organic management of coffee destined for export. Semistructured interviews, focus groups, and financial analyses were conducted with farmers from a small organic coffee cooperative in western El Salvador. We sought to identify what factors have motivated peasant farmers to manage subsistence crops, primarily maize and beans, with agrochemicals. We found that a combination of environmental, economic, social and political factors have driven agricultural management decisions. The environmental requirements of coffee are distinct, where coffee in a diverse shaded agroecosystem responds better to low-input management than maize grown on steep slopes in nutrient-poor soil. In addition, there are no direct economic incentives for subsistence farmers to manage food crops organically, while the benefit of a price premium does exist for organic coffee. Finally, institutional support for agriculture encourages organic production for export crops and generally overlooks subsistence farming. Our data show that half of the farmers lost money on their food plots, with agrochemicals representing the largest cost. This research suggests that small-scale farmers need support in transitioning to more economically and environmentally sustainable farming practices. Keywords: subsistence agricultureagrochemicalsmaizeagroecologyCentral America Notes 1. Holdridge life zone classification system is based on local environmental conditions including altitude, rather than latitude alone. 2. Farmers indicated that the daily cost of labor was $4 plus lunch, which they valued at $2. 3. The nitrogen content per 100 kg of 16-20-0 fertilizer is 16 kg; nitrogen content per 100 kg of ammonium sulfate is 21 kg. 4. Twenty eight of 29 ACOES farmers were included in this calculation due to one data point being removed for suspected inaccuracy. 5. Household income was calculated in 2008 including all income made by all working members of the household. This data is reported in Morris et al. (2013). 6. As a point of comparison, typical maize productivity data of 1,905 kg/ha was estimated for Central America (FAO and CIMMYT 1997), 1,848 kg/ha estimated for Costa Rica based on agrochemical use (CitationThrupp 1990), and 1,200 kg/ha reported for the Brazilian Amazon (CitationHecht 1992). 7. Recommendations on fertilizer requirements for optimal maize production vary for different regions and different crops, soils, and climatic conditions. Osmond and Riha's (1996) model determined that 140 kg N ha-1 was recommended for optimal maize yields in Brazil, while rates of 65–75 kg of nitrogen per hectare are recommended for maize in Swaziland (Mkhabela et al. 2001).",

Farmer field schools enabled 82 farmers to adopt and adapt SRI practices in the initial season. SRI's alternative practices were found to contribute to healthier roots and more productive tillers, the average number of tillers per plant on farmers' SRI and control plots being 19 and 7, respectively. SRI was found to require 87% less seed than with traditional methods; yet, it gave 40% more yield per unit area in a drought year. The economic returns per hectare were 76% greater. There was some early evidence of soil-fertility improvement, but this can only be assessed over longer periods of time. Three years after introduction, over 3,000 farmers had continued adopting SRI practices in the district. In another 3 years, the number using these new methods had reached almost 29,000 in Dharwad and neighboring districts.",

Swedish farmers are dependent on the subsidies and payments of the RDP yet many are very critical of the program, especially those with animals and semi-natural pastures. A study based on semi-structured interviews with farmers in three districts in Sweden reveals the main reasons for their criticism to be: they feel trapped by regulations, powerless with respect to the controlling agency and lacking control of their finances. The study also identifies factors in the program that hinder the implementation of the sustainability goals of the CAP and RDP. The article recommends the adoption of guiding principles for facilitating transitions toward sustainable agriculture and emerging solutions to the challenges farmers experience.",

We design a methodology to estimate, normalize, and aggregate the indicators to form composite indices. The indicators under each dimension are aggregated using the progressive weighted average to give three-dimensional indices viz. economic, social, and ecological indices, which are aggregated to give a single holistic index called Farm Assessment Index (FAI). Unlike other approaches where the comparison of farming system is restricted within the sample under study, normalization of indicators using regional averages makes the FAI suitable for universal comparisons of farming systems across crops and regions. The methodology was applied to evaluate farming practices of 60 organic and 60 conventional farmers, from two Indian states over three years. The results from the application of the FAI demonstrates that the focus on yield or income as the sole indicator for policy decisions will not lead to sustainable farming systems. Policy makers need to shift toward holistic measures emphasizing human health, the livelihood of farmers and sustenance provided by agroecology. Case studies prove FAI to be a valuable tool for decision-makers in assessing farm practices and designing better agricultural policies and programs.",

No effects of periodical chicken presence on SRCW growth were observed. Total mineral N (Nmin) was affected by interactions between vegetation type, location, and soil depth; it was generally higher in SRCW than in grassland and in areas close to the chicken houses. Nmin did not appear to accumulate in the soil over the years, but there were strong indications for higher risk of N leaching to deeper soil layers and possibly to groundwater close to the houses and in SRCW. SRCW was beneficial for the chickens, but the combination needs to be studied further with a focus on strategies for preventing nutrient leaching to groundwater.",

The results revealed that although the cooperative members viewed the CLR as a threat to livelihoods, it was no greater a threat than other crises such as low coffee prices, extreme weather events, and persistent food insecurity. In response, members suspended organic coffee production, borrowed money to purchase food, sought off-farm employment, and grew limited subsistence crops. Yet most interestingly, for the long-term, they remained fully committed to producing high quality arabica coffee even though the cooperative was aware a future CLR outbreak could again devastate production. These findings question the underlying assumption of crop diversification initiatives which rarely consider the importance of farmer identity. Crop diversification and off-farm employment schemes seek to mitigate environmental threats (e.g., climate change) that smallholder farmers face, however this research shows that farmer identity can be just as, if not more, important than crop yields or even income generation. The authors propose a three-stage smallholder producer vulnerability framework to better understand and analyze future livelihoods disruptions of smallholder producers.",

It resembles the idea of wholeness or general well-being, which is interesting to integrate different disciplines. There have been valuable contributions in the area of agroecological management of diseases, pests and weeds with the aim of promoting crop health. Nevertheless, they remain relatively disconnected and lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework that helps to define crop health and how to promote it. The aim of this article is to re-conceptualize the notion of crop health from a transdisciplinary and holistic perspective. The system of reference is redefined by including the relationships between the populations of domesticated plants and the farmers. This implies a multidimensional approach and assumes that crop health is related to farmers' objectives, knowledge, point of views and values. Based on the review of studies in the field of agroecology, four components are proposed to evaluate crop health status: usefulness, adversities, safety and autonomy. Three components of health promotion were adapted from the salutogenic model proposed for human health: meaningfulness, comprehensiveness and manageability. This article intends to make a contribution on theoretical and conceptual aspects of a key concept for agroecology.",

It is essentially an efficient bioconversion technique to process organic wastes (manure, food, crop and forestry residues, solid digestate) into humus-like substances destined to different uses (soil amendment, organic fertilization, plant nursery substrates). Life Cycle Assessment, Energy Analysis, and Life Cost Costing were used to perform a cross-analysis aimed to assess the environmental, economic, and energy sustainability of some procurement systems of compostable materials (bulking agents and agricultural crop residues) to be allocated to composting on the farm. The procurement systems were characterized by different mechanization levels in order to explore the possible scenarios related to the availability of vehicles within the farm and increasing transport distances. Our findings underline that the most sustainable option for the environment it was not often the most cost-effective choice. Therefore, the cross-analysis of these relevant data sets allowed us to detail the different operative steps and guide the procurement system choice toward those showing the best compromise for both the environment and farmers (cheaper, with no or low impactful).",

We share our experience with a modest intervention, the Alternative Campus Tour (ACT), and frame this as a pragmatic way to operationalize CFSE in a way that also serves as an opportunity to expose and problematize the conditions of the neoliberal university that undermine the promise of a transformative CFSE.",

It has further confirmed that the logic of industrial agriculture has led our food systems down an unsustainable path, and that we must urgently change course. Agroecology is increasingly offered as the transformative and comprehensive solution that delivers benefits across all dimensions of sustainability. Yet, proponents of \"business-as-usual\" approaches continue to insist that producing higher, more resilient yields – particularly through new genomic techniques such as CRISPR/Cas – will serve as the means to ensure long-term food system resilience. Given the urgency for food systems transformation and drawing on agroecology as the paradigm shift we need, this article considers how new technologies can be assessed to evaluate their compatibility with food systems sustainability. Using the example of CRISPR/Cas, this article offers a preliminary framework for assessment based on FAO's 10 Elements of Agroecology. The purpose here is not to offer a comprehensive and definite assessment of CRISPR/Cas, but to serve as an example to highlight the need for holistic assessment tools when considering the development and uptake of new agricultural technologies.",

In view of the above, under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, measures are taken for the conservation of biodiversity. An instrument, in which Polish farmers have been participating since 2004, is the Agri-Environmental Program (AEP). The experiences of the implementation of Polish AEP are presented based on results of the study conducted in 2011 in the region of Mazury. The study involved approximately 8.5% of farmers participating in the program. The study results indicate the need for more significant diversification and adaptation of the AEP packages to the regional environmental determinants. Independently of the designated Natura 2000 areas, records must be taken of the patches of habitats of particular natural and ornithological values. This will allow a considerable facilitation of the procedures associated with the implementation of the nature AEP packages, and contribute to the enhancement of the effects of the funds allocated for that purpose. Another important issue is the strengthening of the market position of organic production holdings which promote the preservation of biodiversity and operate principally thanks to agricultural subsidies.",

Finally, reflections are presented on the scope of food sovereignty in the context of the Darién región of Colombia.KEYWORDS: drug traffickingland tenancyLaw 70 of 1993food sovereigntyagroecology ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors thank the Fundación Aurelio Llano Posada of Medellín and the Scientific Society of Latinamerican Agroecology (SOCLA) and the tutorial committee, particularly Gloria Zuluaga and Fernando Funes-Monzote for their reading of the manuscript and suggestions.

The impact of drug trafficking has been tackled in Ramírez (Citation2001), who explains the sociocultural dynamics linked with the production and transformation of coca in the western Colombian Amazon and the consequent stigmatization which falls on the inhabitants.2. 2.

This comes from the definition of Food and Agriculture Orangization of the United Nations (Citation2009): “food security is the existence of conditions that allow human beings to have physical and economic access, in a socially acceptable manner to a safe, nutritious diet in accordance with their cultural preferences, which satisfies their alimentary needs and allows them to live in a productive and healthy manner.”.” Thus, from the concepts of food sovereignty proposed by the Vía Campesina: “the right of peoples, communities and countries to establish their own agricultural policies, fishing, food and land that are ecologically, socially, economically and culturally appropiate to their unique circumstances. This includes the basic right to food and to the resources needed to produce foodstuffs, which means that all peoples have the right to a healthy, nutritious and culturally appropriate food supply and to the capacity to maintain themselves and their societies.” This emphasizes two elements: autonomy for the formulation of policies and the universal right to food. The theoretical discussion of both concepts will not be developed in this article since they lie outside its objectives. (Schejtman and Chiriboga Citation2009).4. 4.

The term comes from the language of the woodcutters and refers to the parts that remain in a tree trunk after the fine, homogenous central blocks have been removed; they are therefore, unused remnants that despite having contributed to the growth of the tree are considered to be worthless (Molano and Ramírez Citation1996; Gálvez et al. Citation2009).6. 6. See www.incoder.gov.co7. 7. “It is an organized social expression, autonomous and in solidarity with the civil society, whose purpose is to promote an integral, sustainable and viable development, constructed by exercising a participatory democracy in the management of development of its affiliates and the community” (Art. 6, Law 743 of 2002; www.medellin.gov.co).8. 8. “Urban or rural land without buildings or crops that forms part of the patrimony of the state because it lies within territorial limits and lacks any other owner. These areas are imprescriptible, that is to say they are not susceptible to being acquired in the process of ownership by acquisitive prescription of the authorities” (Colombian Law 137 of 1959; http://juridicasnr.blogspot.com /2006/07/ley-tocaima-ley-388-de-1997-artculo.html).9. 9. An example of this synthesis is as follows: “Doña Alba Chiquillo told me that almost everybody knows that frass from an ants’ nest makes very good fertilizer. It was used a lot for potatoes but it was difficult to get hold of without being bitten by the ants. So Jairo taught people a long time ago that the ortiga (Urtica baccifera) is very good for scaring them off. You make an infusion of ortiga, that’s it, you can’t touch it either because it’ll make your hand swell up, and if you through that onto the frass they’ll all run off it […]. Then you just pick up the frass and fertilize the crop” (45-year-old woman, August 2011).10. 10. “Conservation scenarios are defined as territories or portions thereof in which various stakeholders coincide in their apprecicstion of the need to develop comnbined actions to maintain, in the long term, predetermined biophysical attributes or ecological processes important for aesthetic, cultural or functional reasons, or of direct advantage” (Hurtado et al. Citation2008, 236).11. 11. “The network ofreservas plays a very important role in conservation given that: 1) they are centers for the promotion at the local and subregional levels of civil society in conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and consequently are facilitators in the establishment of synergies with the public sector in charge of carrying out conservation actions. 2) They may facilitate the establishment of absorption zones and biological corridors and other connections between fragments and/or protected areas. 3) In some cases they may offer the only possibility of conserving an important locality in areas where it would be difficult to establish protected areas open to the public” (236).12. 12. Resolution 1502 of August 2005 recognizes a collective territory of 13883 ha 7085m2 to the Community Council of the Rio Tolo Basin and Southern Coastal Zone consisting of 18 localities in the municipality of Acandí. This territory is located on the Panamian border, far from the settlement of San Francisco de Asís located in the coastal zone whose Afrocolombian community set up the Local Afrocolombian Council (Consejo Local de Negritudes) linked to COCOMASUR. The principles of adherence to the community councils are guided by the ethnic parameters of Law 70 of 1993.13. 13. The constitutional reform of 1991, recognizes the pluriethnic and multicultural character of Colombia; thus it was required to establish judicial tools such that the Amerindian and Afrocolombian groups that set out legal principles concerning the dealings of these groups with the state. Law 70 of 1993 or the law of Afrocolombians: “[…] has the objective of recognizing the Afrocolombian communities who have come to occupy barren lands in the rural riverside zones of the rivers of the Pacific Basin, in accordance with their traditional practices of production, the right to collective property, as presented in the following articles. It also has the goal of establishing mechanisms to protect of the cultural identity and rights of the black communities of Colombia as an ethnic group, and the promotion of their economic and social development, in order to guarantee that these communities obtain the same real conditions of equal opportunities as the rest of Colombian society. […] This law will also apply in the barren, rural and riverine zones that have been occupied by Afrocolombian communities who have traditional practices of production in other areas of the country and satisfy the requirements established by the law” (Article 1; http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc /ley/1993/ley_0070_1993.html). The law includes riverine areas of the basins of the rivers Tolo and Acandí which open into the Caribbean Sea although not in the coastal area. However, in the statutes of conformation of the COCOMASUR community council are included——according to the settlers—a strategy to amplify the collective territory to include these zones, a request which was presented to INCODER in 2011. This process delayed the adjudication of private deeds in the zone.14. 14. Until 2008, one could observe in the study area “[…] a symbolic valuation of the exchanged products and of the activities implicated in the production. For anyone who cultivates their farm and produce fruits and food plants it’s much better to exchange their products with someone who integrally values what is offered given when they pay cash for things. [Cultural tasks] such as sowing, weeding, pruning, fertilizing, harvesting, are actions that are little appreciated by someone who pays money for a coconut, a pineapple, a sietesabores, a borojó […]. The bartering creates an integral link between those who receive it and those who provide it as a gesture of solidarity. The functional dynamics of reciprocity is strengthened by a broadened valuation of the objects, ítems of knowledge and the possible services of exchange […]. Reciprocity is manifested daily and for many it’s the system par excellence” (Salazar Citation2012, 38).15. 15. The monthly allowance is US $65 and a basic shopping basket of foodstuffs.16. 16. “The ICBF, seconded to the Ministry of Social Protection, was created in 1968 to respond to problems such as nutritional deficiency, family disintegration and instability, the loss of values and abandoned childhood. The ICBF is present in every one of the departmental capitals, through its regional and sectional offices. It also has 201 zonal centers, as service points to attend to the needs of populations of all the municipalities in the country. Nearly 10 million Colombians currently benefit from its services. Children, young people, adults and families of urban, rural, Amerindian, Afrocolombian, raizal and rom populations, are all beneficiaries of this entity’s programs” (www.ibcf.gov; Gálvez Citation2007, 41).17. 17. This initiative ran between 1999 and 2009 as an expression of the anti-drug policies of the United States and Colombia. Also called the Plan for Peace, Prosperity and Strengthening of the State, it sought to eradicate illicit crops and substitute them with legal, sustainable economic resources. Local families participating in this process were incorporated without a prior screening process and in the capacity of reinsertados,”, that is, individuals who were formerly members of groups on the margins of the law and now reincorporated into civilian life. Inclusion of the Caribbean Darien of Colombia in these substitution programs was justified by its being seen as a zone that is highly vulnerable to these illegal economies.18. 18. See www.humboldt.org.co/iavh/documentos/politica/proyectos_de_ley/126-10%20Pesca%20y%20Acuicultura.pdf19. 19. The banana-growing industry was initiated in Urabá in 1963. Workers drawn from different parts of the country settled in camps set up within the banana plantations. The workforce attracted by the banana industry founded townships near to the plantations, which gave rise to municipalities such as Carepa and Chigorodó (Antioquia) (see Zambrano Citation2004). Leftist groups such as the Ejército Popular de Liberación (EPL) and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) led several of these settlement processes. A relationship has also existed between these guerrilla groups and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Agropecuarios de Antioquia (SINTRAINAGRO) and with the Banana Workers’ Union (Sindicato de Trabajadores Bananeros—SINTRABANANO), respectively (C. García Citation1996) and which gave rise to the organized labor wars of the 1980s. The EPL then demobilized and created the political movement Esperanza Paz y Libertad (“Hope, Peace and Freedom”), as well as the leftist movement Unión Patriótica (UP), both now vanished from the political scenario. One of the most infamous massacres was that of the La Chinita plantation, where 35 people linked to SINTRABANANO were assassinated or “encouraged” at the hands of FARC militias. See also Ramírez (Citation2001).20. 20. This group also has a presence in other neighboring localities of the settlement such as Triganá, Capurganá and Sapzurro21. 21. Physicochemical analysis was carried out with photometric methods and microbiological analysis by means of techniques in Rice et al. (Citation2012), endorsed by the Colombian Ministry of Social Protection. The tests were performed in the physicochemical analysis area of the Laboratory of Public Health connected to the Faculties of Public Health and Pharmaceutical Chemistry of the University of Antioquia, Medellín.22. 22. Electrical power in the settlement is provided between five in the afternoon and eleven at night, thanks to an electric generator installed by the Families in Action program and the Acandí Power Company. The generator broke down on numerous occasions, due to the growing demand attributed to the increase in domestic electrical appliances. During the 5 months of fieldwork, the generator had an effective service period of 48 days, working intermittently. This has stimulated the purchase of household electrical generators (72 units by December 2011), kept running daily by the most expensive gasoline in the country: US $ 8.33 per gallon brought from Turbo, while in Medellín a gallon costs US $4.72.",

LEAFS compares three small-scale, diverse vegetable production systems, one powered by human labor, one by draft animal power, and one by small engine power. Data was collected on all inputs including land usage, labor, and direct and indirect energy consumption. Yield of crops was measured and converted into energetic and economic output. This data was used to calculate efficiency statistics including energy and financial returns on land, labor, and energy invested. The draft animal and machine power systems were comparable in the financial returns to labor while the human system yielded approximately 25% less in this regard. The human and draft animal systems had equal energy returns to energy invested of 1.21, a high rate of efficiency for vegetable production. The machine system was net energy negative but efficient compared to conventional production. Data from all three systems suggests factor substitution of both labor and land for energy.",

    "abstract": "Ecological sanitation offers both sanitation and fertilizer through recycling of nutrients. Human fertilizer provides a close to free addition of nutrients in household farming and may, therefore, decrease the downward risk of fertilizer adoption. We study an ecological sanitation investment program in southern Mali, where just over 150 beneficiaries got a urine diverting dry toilet installed. Our results suggest that the average household in our study is able to produce amounts of N, P, and K equivalent to around a fourth of its yearly expenditures on artificial fertilizers, corresponding to a yearly addition of nutrients or a yearly reduction in fertilizer expenditures to a value of about 50 €. However, the quantity and quality of N, P, and K actually retained is found to be only a fraction of this potential amount. Using propensity score matching methods, we find an increase in maize yields among beneficiary households, but no effect on the yields of other crops. Moreover, households substitute artificial fertilizer with human fertilizer at 10–15% of the average household use of artificial fertilizers. Thus, the substitution may worsen an already bad soil nutrient balance. Higher retention levels are needed for solutions to prove financially viable.",

Despite their common use, traditional biodiversity indexes prove ill-suited for assessing complex systems of this type. This study proposes a novel index, AGB, to assess agrobiodiversity in systems that mix species, varieties, lifeforms, and uses. The AGB index was tested using agrobiodiversity inventories in Vanuatu, where we compared agrobiodiversity levels and patterns of change over the course of a crop cycle between different field types. The 297 sampled fields contained a total of 127 species with an average of 10.1 species and of 11.6 varieties per field. During the cropping cycle, species and varietal richness diminish. The AGB index was compared with the Shannon and Pielou indexes and proved to be accurate for assessing and monitoring agrobiodiversity at the species and varietal levels. It may be a useful tool for agrobiodiversity monitoring in agricultural systems undergoing changes in practices and for achieving a better understanding of their biocultural resilience.",

    "abstract": "Conventional definitions of food loss and food waste consider that the phenomenon can be measured with mass or monetary units. However, the problem is that it is not easy to establish what a discarded foodstuff is. Furthermore, these definitions do not incorporate in their analyses the loss of productive resources. From political ecology and agroecology, other alternative definitions consider that the calculation should be done in terms of energy. This would allow us to include the loss of productive resources in the phenomenon. However, since the counting tools generated by the agrarian economy reduce any economic activity to mass or monetary units, these alternative definitions face a problem of quantification to a greater extent. Consequently, there is currently an open debate about what constitutes food loss; a debate that is not reaching any helpful outcome. In light of these limitations, a qualitative approach to the phenomenon can be more practical. Based on our analysis of food loss in the context of fruit production in Lleida (Catalonia, Spain) we argue that to understand the phenomenon it is more effective to analyze how food loss is produced rather than to try to quantify it.",

A field study of a two-year organic horticultural rotation (2015–16 and 2016–17) was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil hydraulic arrangement and cover crops management on cash crops productivity, soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and C balance. The experiment consisted of two simultaneous rotation systems, a cauliflower-tomato rotation on raised beds and a zucchini-lettuce one on flat strips between them, combined with cover crops as living mulch or break crops. The results pointed out that the use of proper hydraulic arrangements may partially reduce the exposure of crops to extreme climate events, like heavy rains and floods, allowing the preservation of soil fertility. The cover crops increased the yields and enhanced the soil nutrient pools. Our study showed the important role of cover crops since the soil C stock values were significantly higher when they were used in the rotations. The analysis of the GHG emissions, C balance and C efficiency revealed that combining agro-ecological and conservation practices can improve environmental sustainability in organic farming in the Mediterranean area, allowing farmers to maintain/increase their agricultural systems sustainability.",

This contribution analyzes how sustainability certification shapes broader social dynamics in targeted communities by applying the concept of social cohesion. This framework allows for the discussion on the appropriateness of sustainability certification to foster the needed societal conditions for community empowerment and collective action, both of which often regarded as key for a broader sustainability transition. Insights from key informant interviews in two Ghanaian cocoa communities targeted by a Rainforest Alliance cocoa sustainability project indicate that there is an enhanced interaction between scheme participants leading to new ingroup-outgroup patterns among community members. Further, while some informal institutions and one particular societal group are negatively affected by the sustainability intervention, no broader effect on communities' overall social cohesion was measured. Finally, despite contributing to the greening of cocoa production, certification implements measures that risk to hamper the spread of collective action and may dilute the \"societal glue\" in targeted communities.",

    "abstract": "Transitioning to more sustainable agricultural practices is a key goal in agroecology. Before practices are adopted, however, farmers must weigh a complex set of biophysical and socioeconomic tradeoffs. Tarping is a weed control practice gaining popularity in New England, but many of its biophysical impacts remain unclear to farmers. Here, we used participatory action research to engage in mutual learning with farmers around the tradeoffs of tarping for weed control. We collected quantitative biophysical data with a field study and qualitative data on biophysical and socioeconomic factors by interviewing farmers. We found tarping has a number of benefits, challenges, and uncertainties, though most farmers had positive overall perceptions of the practice. Many of our biophysical results matched farmers' experiences, including that tarping dramatically heated soils, suppressed weeds, and increased crop yields. However, our mixed results for the effects of tarping on soil nitrate contrasted farmers' perception that tarping increases soil nitrate availability. Engaging in participatory and mixed methods research was an effective approach to unveil complex tradeoffs around tarping and ensure our research was relevant to farmer interests. Future research on long-term effects of tarps will be valuable to inform the sustainability of this practice.",

As a matter of fact, however, the production of organic food can be mimicked by industrial production by means of marketing. Moreover, consumers do not always properly know which the differences between standard and organic food are. Industrial food producers have many incentives to mimic high quality organic production, both in terms of profits and reputation. Here, a model with three firm types is presented: organic food producers, standard food producers setting high price to mimic organic food, and standard food producers setting low price. This model shows that the lack of knowledge generates two sources of adverse selection: the bad purchase made by consumers buying from mimicking firms, and the case of consumers buying standard food consciously, either because of their ignorance or to avoid the risk of the bad purchase. If correct knowledge were available, the resulting outcome would change dramatically: it is shown that after a policy oriented to disseminate education and awareness, a net increase in social welfare occurs, since consumers' gain is greater than mimicking firms' loss.",

    "abstract": "New farming technologies such as improved fallow of herbaceous legumes have been developed over the last 20 years as alternatives to traditional yam cropping systems in areas where shifting cultivation is no more possible. One aim of this research was to analyze actual adoption by smallholders of such a technology and influencing factors in the Southern Guinea Savannah in Benin (West Africa). On the other hand, a second objective was to measure agronomic and economic performances of the innovative yam-based cropping systems in comparison with the usual ones under producers' natural and socioeconomic circumstances in order to discuss the technology potential for large scale adoption. Smallholders with limited land access now develop as usual cropping systems a one-year fallow of Andropogonon gayanus–yam rotation or a maize–yam rotation. Innovative sedentary yam-based systems consist of an Aeschynomene histrix intercropped with maize–yam rotation or a Mucuna pruriens intercropped with maize–yam rotation. Factors potentially affecting adoption were included in a polynomial logit model. Agronomic and economic performances were assessed by the multiple regression and net present value of the 4-years double rotation. Ranking matrix was used to highlight constraints that may impede adoption. Benefits, lessons, and challenges are discussed in this article.",

A food event is an ecosystem whose behaviors, habits, creativity, and opportunity reflect the organization of the system and its message. A \"sustainable food event\" should also be a \"food event designed in a sustainable way.\" The article focuses on the changes that need to occur in the design and management of food events as systems in order to balance natural resource use and reduced environmental impact with the needs of production, economic viability, and social well-being. Through the application of systemic design, the article shows how it is possible to design an event whose life cycle transcends its limited duration in time in order to translate its sustainable action into simple, daily acts.",

    "abstract": "Lentils and garlic are primarily grown under conventional tillage (CT) practice; however, both crops have been fetching lower profits due to the high cost of both cultivation as well as the required inputs. For securing more benefits and using residual soil-moisture, farmers have started the zero-tillage (ZT) practice in a rice-based cropping system. In general, it is imperative to compare these two systems (ZT and CT) to assess their energy consumption, and their broader environmental and financial performance. In this study, we found that the total energy input was reduced by 38% with ZT as compared to CT (3.96 GJ ha–1) for lentil cultivation; in contrast, for garlic, CT's energy consumption was 11% of that of ZT (113.55 GJ ha–1). Energy output increased by 13% and 4% with ZT, in comparison to CT, for lentil and garlic, respectively. Similarly, ZT reduced CO2e (carbon dioxide-equivalent) emissions by 50% and 98%, as compared to CT, for lentil and garlic cultivation, respectively. The maximum financial benefit was seen to be obtained with ZT: the production cost was reduced by 28% and 33%, as compared to CT practices, for lentil and garlic, respectively. The return-cost ratios from ZT and CT were 3.39 and 2.18 for lentil, and 7.64 and 3.52 for garlic, respectively. We can, therefore, conclude that ZT is an energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and cost-effective practice of lentil and garlic production.",

This study aimed to analyze the first years of implementation of this legislation, by identifying its advances and setbacks for a sustainability transition. The Multilevel Perspective was used to study the relationship between niche, regime and landscape. Information was collected through an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, with a total of 41 participants. This study attests to the importance of social actors and landscape to create innovations at the niche level, and to the power of the regime to restrain these advances (outsourcing of restaurants alleging cost and convenience reasons). In this case specifically, changes in the niche and landscape level at the time of development of this innovation and a lack of resilience of the actors added to the power of the regime, which led to a setback of this policy.",

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the possibility of applying an indigenous KSB strain and MW combination for reducing doses of MoP during cultivation of perennial crops like tea. The study over two consecutive years revealed that cumulative tea production of some of the applied treatments was significantly higher than that of recommended MoP treatment. Application of KSB and MW in the first split instead of MoP recorded higher exchangeable K content in soil during August to October, especially in the second year of the study.

We examined the relationship between agricultural land use patterns and farmers' practices and identified existing and potential characteristics of healthy agroecosystems at local scale in the context of village communities in Zanzibar, Tanzania. With in-depth household survey and participatory mapping, five distinct cropping patterns were identified and their relation to land cover elucidated. Consequences of the diverse local farming strategies to field level cultivation patterns are dynamic. However, long-term adaptation of the local farmers to prevailing edaphic site conditions and resource-poor circumstances create fragmented but fairly stable land use patterns at landscape level. By integrating local expert knowledge and realities with scientific knowledge, we identified sustainable agroecosystem characteristics and farming practices, which are knowledge-intensive, alternative and adaptable to local conditions. Some of these practices are already a part of the local farming strategies and some require training and higher level support to reach healthier agroecosystem and better food security. They also offer potential opportunities for forest conservation since their tree-based nature provide forest products to the communities.",

Seed yam production by the entrepreneurs was based on the adapted yam minisett technique (AYMT) and results between 2013 and 2015 suggest that the agronomic performance of AYMT under “farmer-managed” conditions was good, with reasonable yields of yam and an average weight (0.8 kg) in the required range for grade 1 seed yams. The entrepreneurs achieved a good economic return (gross margin) and this translated into a return on investment of around 400–600%.

    "abstract": "The Togo Hills borderland between Ghana and Togo is known for its cultural and ecological diversity and dynamic socio-political history. In this setting, African rice (Oryza glaberrima) is cultivated together with other local cultivars of Asian rice (O. sativa), and smallholders are keen innovators. This article presents the results of participatory variety selection (PVS) trials, in four different cultural and ecological settings within the Togo Hills, designed to understand farmers' innovation and variety choice. Farmers belonging to different ethnic groups organized their trials and evaluated fourteen farmer varieties from six West-African countries and one Nerica variety. The way the PVS trials took shape and evaluation was conducted reflected the socio-cultural and economic differences between the settings. Despite these differences, farmers showed a broad interest and preference for different varieties based on different criteria, related to agroecological conditions, household consumption needs, market demands and/or ritual purposes. We contend that ― in a period of climate crisis, bio- and agrobiodiversity depletion, rapid social change and market instability ― plant breeding in West Africa must be participatory, decenter from a focus on high external input agriculture and include farmers' varieties, better contributing to food security, quality, and nutrition, while strengthening agroecological practices.",

    "abstract": "Urban/peri-urban dairying in East Africa used to be typified by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schumach) as the primary forage. However, the ever-declining space for farming has made forage cultivation increasingly difficult. As a coping strategy, farmers are harvesting vegetation biomass from natural environment, particularly common reed (Phragmites australis, Cav.) from wetlands. This study aimed to compare elephant grass and common reed in terms of chemical composition and in situ rumen degradation. Samples were collected (in dry and wet seasons) and analyzed for chemical composition, and in situ rumen degradation of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) determined. Rumen degradation was determined by incubating triplicate nylon-bagged samples in rumens of three cannulated Ankole–Friesian crossbred steers. The CP content ranged from 10.8% to 16.2% DM (common reed), and 9.9–12.5% DM (elephant grass). Common reed showed lower DM, and ADF compositions, and higher effective rumen degradability of DM, CP, and NDF in both seasons. For both forages, CP content was higher during the dry season, while effective rumen degradability of DM, CP, and NDF were higher in the wet season. In summary, the chemical and rumen degradation results suggest that common reed may be nutritionally superior to elephant grass.",

    "abstract": "This study revealed the profile of common bean farmers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. One hundred and thirty-eight farmers from 24 municipalities were interviewed. We observed that common beans are a key component of agricultural systems in this state, with the number of varieties managed by family varying widely (from one to 11). This variation was influenced by socioeconomic, ecogeographic, and cultural factors. An impressive number of common bean varieties were being managed by farmers who resided at mid-altitude zones and combine subsistence crops with market-oriented cultivation. In three of five mesoregions visited, the traditional agriculture has been affected by climate changes. The majority of farmers who managed low diversity of common beans, and all farmers who stopped growing this crop in recent years resided in these regions. Facing the risk of genetic erosion, farmers, researchers and extension workers involved in this research are building strategies to strengthen the conservation of this local germplasm. Actions are underway with public agencies to enhance the importance of self-consumption cultures for food security, local development and conservation of cultural traditions. Among these, we highlight the publication of Catálogo da Diversidade Feijão-comum do estado do Rio de Janeiro. In addition, an ex-situ conservation agreement was established for the varieties, with a strong participation of custodians, to provide greater security to the local common bean germplasm.",

The study aims to enhance discussion and gain an in-depth understanding of farm entrepreneurship in the context of sustainability in China. We conducted a case study of five farmers practicing organic farming through semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The analysis shows that organic farms enhance sustainability through many economic, social and environmental contributions. Additionally, emerging societal awareness of healthy foods and the increasing demand for organic products are among the most important opportunities contributing to the growth of organic farming. Despite this, farm entrepreneurship among organic farms faces many challenges, such as land use rights, lack of business networks and government subsidies. However, the government is the main player in promoting sustainability practices among entrepreneurs and society through agricultural policy development and promotion of organic products. We believe that this paper is the first attempt to study organic farm entrepreneurship in China from an entrepreneurs' viewpoint. The conclusions could have potential implications and guidelines for promoting organic agriculture policies in national and international contexts. The conclusions have significant implications and potential guidelines for promoting sustainability in national and international contexts.",

Our study aimed to provide preliminary information on regeneration in cashew orchards by studying the effect of previous land cover, the surrounding landscape, and orchards' age on the density of species and number of plants. We followed linear transects in orchards planted in areas previously covered by savannah and forest. We found typical forest species growing in the understory, even in orchards previously occupied by savannah or as old as 42 years. The density of species is higher in orchards planted in previously forested plots and in more forested environments. Species density in the understory decreases as orchards get older, but it seems that it increases again after a certain age threshold. This study shows that cashew orchards in Cantanhez retain their potential for succession to forest, and highlights the continuum that may exist between orchards and forests. More research is needed to assess a possible \"forestization\" of the savannahs through cashew plantations.",

However, the power relations underlying the sexual division of labor, which makes women responsible for household and care work remain, as women’s workloads increase with their involvement in the local market. For this reason, this case study demonstrates that gender equality is not automatically attained by implementing agroecological practices on farms or by participating in local markets.",

Sangiovese were evaluated under field conditions. MAPs were cultivated in the rows of a mature vineyard. The introduction of MAPs in the vineyards slowed down technological ripening and increased total VOCs in Sangiovese berries. Among the different VOCs classes, C13-norisoprenoids, vanillins, and phenols showed significantly higher concentrations in berries of grapevine intercropped with MAPs. The presence of MAPs enhanced berry concentration of: vomifoliol (C13-norisoprenoids), homovanillic alcohol, and homovanillic acid (vanillins), 4-vinylguaiacol, syringol and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenol (phenols) and 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (aliphatic alcohols), while reducing the level of p-cymen-7-ol, 1-hexanol and nerol. Data suggest that intercropping with MAPs could influence the accumulation of VOCs in grapevines and contribute to the composition and volatile profile of this cultivar.",

This study assessed the diversity of farmers' faba bean varieties and local knowledge related to their use and management across multiple cultural and agroecological contexts. We conducted 288 structured and 48 semi-structured interviews in five agroecological zones and four cultural areas in northeastern and southwestern Ethiopia. A total of seventeen farmers' varieties were identified and documented based on phenotypic descriptors. The tepid sub-moist mid-highlands of South Wollo had the highest number of varieties (five) of any area sampled; however, the humid mid-highlands of Jimma had a higher Shannon-Wiener diversity index based on the area planted to each variety. Most farmers reported that they had originally obtained their traditional varieties from family members, whereas new varieties were typically purchased from local markets. According to farmers, both male and female adults participated in the production and processing of faba bean, with some distinct differences among cultural areas. Understanding the diversity of farmers' varieties has important implications for on-farm conservation strategies to enhance the use value of this multipurpose leguminous crop.",

Behind this plate, most tensions emerge between family traditions and other sustainability spheres. These tensions are related to socio-affective risks, animal suffering, time constraints, effort, and monetary costs. Integrating sociocultural elements such as family traditions in public policy becomes fundamental when promoting sustainable diets in similar contexts.

We conducted individual surveys with 33 Spanish RRM farmers that collected multiple variables regarding general characteristics of farms, productive parameters, rangeland management and opinions around perceptions. We performed associative tests in order to detect the most important drivers of economic profitability and personal satisfaction. Among a wide diversity of farms, we found no features or management types associated with higher profitability, but rather a link to the level of intensification and degree of experience. About 93% of the farmers were mostly satisfied with RRM, even though they face difficulties – highlighting bureaucratic ones. To overcome such hurdles, we encourage improving the dialogue between farmers, researchers and institutions. This is the first state-level study on RRM in Spain, and one of the first analyses collecting farmers’ perceptions on this topic.",

These initiatives unfold in contexts where resources are often limited, forcing trade-offs between activists' visions of agroecology and what they can do in the immediate future. Drawing on documentary research, 26 semi-structured interviews, and over 100 hours of observation, we examine the evolution of agroecology in Madrid, Spain, focusing on the deployment of three initiatives. We find that to cope with precarity, some activists adapt their practices by adopting scaling-up strategies that involve increasing the number of participants and collaborating with the City of Madrid. However, the political dimension of the simple acts like gardening or procuring agroecological food becomes less clear, raising questions and spurring debate within the social movement. The compromises made and the reflexive stance on what is gained and what is lost, we argue, ultimately are testament and contribute to agroecology's political vision and goals, albeit in ways that are perhaps quite different from those initially envisioned.",

    "abstract": "Legumes have multiple advantages that meet agroecological challenges. However, many farmers are reluctant to include them permanently in their crop rotations. We investigated farmers’ motivations for growing pulses in a case study of a French cooperative which has developed a pulses sector, by analyzing data from questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Environmental and social values were more present among organic than conventional farmers; the latter were more concerned about their image. The results suggest that mechanisms to promote knowledge sharing among farmers would be valuable and highlight the intermediary role between local stakeholders that cooperatives can play to support agroecological policies.",

    "abstract": "Although Maasai's traditional food system (TFS) is claimed to keep a low prevalence of metabolic diseases (MD), the link between its qualities and health benefits is not well established. An ethnobotanical survey was conducted to determine the link between health benefits and qualities of the Maasai TFS in Monduli, Arusha, Tanzania. The survey involved 21 Maasai TFS practitioners (MTPs) and revealed that the TFS has varieties of 19 dishes and a diversity of 78 flora species. The diversity of dishes and species had various potential health benefits: nutrition like Fe and vitamin A; therapeutic and protective effects against ailments including MD like gout, pressure, indigestion, and kidney disorders. Some food processing technologies (FPT) like nixtamalization, and meat roasting had potential protective effects against the MD. Cultural preferences and restrictions (CPR) for the food selection insured individual nutritional and health needs are met, and reinforcement of Maasai socio-structure and cohesion. Integrated protection and promotion measures are required to prevent unplanned nutritional transitions away from the TFS. Further research on the nutritional and medicinal roles of some FPT and the frequently used species could facilitate the protection and use of the TFS for the health benefits of especially marginalized people.",

This article is based on a collective, reflexive and comparative analysis of eight research projects dealing with agroecological transitions at the scale of farming systems and agrifood systems. Each project brought together a diversity of actors having different visions of ecologization. The aim of this article is to describe how and with what benefits this diversity of visions was addressed in the projects. We show that taking into account the diversity of visions is necessary for understanding agroecological transitions, and that beyond this, sharing this diversity among the concerned actors is necessary for accompanying them in an inclusive way and, under certain conditions, enrich transition pathways. We also show the need to adopt analytical approaches to characterize the visions along with participatory action-research approaches allowing to share them and support transitions. Finally, the collective and reflexive process we carried out for this article also enabled the researchers to situate their projects and themselves with regard to their role in the agro-ecological transitions.",

Sociodemographic factors such as market accessibility and household assets could be shaping the structure of these networks and impacting diversity, however formal evidence is scarce. Through surveys in nine rural communities in the Cofre de Perote highland region in Mexico, we modeled seed exchange networks for native maize and conducted a social network analysis followed by statistical modeling. Results show that access to urban centers is negatively related to the robustness of community networks. Within communities, households with bigger plots, more time producing, sufficient maize for self-consumption, and fewer members were able to save seeds for the next cropping season and were more likely to donate seeds. Additionally, households that exchanged more produced more maize morphotypes. We conclude that the maize seed networks under study are serving as seed reservoirs for families in case of scarcity, thus contributing to food security. They are also important for in situ agrobiodiversity conservation of six maize morphotypes. However, it is necessary to promote seed exchanges between households of communities with more access to urban centers, to strengthen networks, and preserve their maize diversity and seed scarcity-dampening function.KEYWORDS: Seed exchange networksagrobiodiversity conservationseed accesshighland native maize AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank farmer families of the Cofre de Perote region, for kindly accepting to share the information for this research.

In this study, we investigate the potential and feasibility of implementing an enduring transformation to a sustainable food procurement model in public higher education institutions based on agroecological principles for the case of Spain. To address our research questions, we employed participatory workshops and a questionnaire survey (1,058 respondents) to analyze perceptions and priorities around sustainable food practices on campus of the university community across three Spanish public universities. Workshop participants proposed and prioritized interventions aimed at improving the sustainability of on-campus food services. Some recommendations for action for policy makers are detailed in the Discussion section, as key actors in this process. Pathways toward a future transition to more sustainable practices included the importance of food services to the university community, the high level of understanding of food system impacts and demand for change from consumers on university campuses, the universities’ commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the potential of university networks as a powerful agent of social change and social innovation.KEYWORDS: Sustainable food systemsconsumer perceptionsparticipatory processesagroecological transitionSDG12 AcknowledgmentsThe database was generated under the project PDR19-Alimentando al Campus, of the Madrid Rural Development Programme, co-funded by EAFDR/European Union, Spanish Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Ministry (MAPA) and the Community of Madrid (through IMIDRA).

This study examined how the agroforestry tree Gliricidia sepium intercropped with soybean, groundnuts, or maize affects crop nutrient compositions. The study was conducted in five Zambian chiefdoms for three crop-growing seasons (2019–2022) on 13 farmer-led demonstration trial sites. Seven treatments were tested that included maize, soybean, and groundnut plots with and without Gliricidia interventions. Grain samples were analyzed for crop nutrient contents using standard laboratory methods. Results showed that the treatments significantly (P < 0.05) improved maize nutritional properties except for crude fiber, total carbohydrate, and metabolizable energy. G. sepium intercropping with maize and soybean decreased the antinutritional contents and displayed better functional qualities. All elemental mineral components (except potassium, calcium, and sodium) were higher in the Gliricidia + maize intercrop than in the control treatment. The Gliricidia+soybean intercrop had lower mean mineral concentrations than the control (soybean only) except for Mg, Cu, and Zn. The Giliricidia+groundnut intercrop significantly increased groundnut mineral components except for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Iron. It can be concluded that G. sepium intercropped with maize, soybean, and groundnuts significantly improved the crops' nutritional quality.",

It is because soil quality assessments have been conducted in research stations, which are difficult to continue in the long term mainly due to lack of funds in SSA. Farmers in the semi-arid Ethiopian Rift Valley (NERV) cultivate maize with long-term manure application to the fields (aradas). The history of manure application was carefully ascertained from farmers, and 40 manured aradas for 20 years and more and 40 unmanured fields were selected. Soil chemical properties (SOC, total N, Olsen P, CEC, exchangeable cations, EC, and pH) were analyzed, while on-site NO3-N and soil physical properties (soil compaction, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention capacity) were measured. The manured aradas increased SOC, total N, P, CEC, K, Na, Mg, EC, and NO3-N and lowered Ca and pH. The arada soils lowered soil compaction and bulk density and increased porosity. No consistent changes in hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity were observed, probably because of plough pans underlying the surface soil layer across NERV. Soil quality assessment to diagnose farmers' long-term manure application based on field measurement and interviews can be an appropriate approach in SSA.",

Microbial functional groups were quantified by PLFA analysis. Soil attributes were measured, and management details were obtained by interviewing landowners. Microbial biomass in MP soils was higher, more diverse and contained proportionately more fungal (F) than bacterial (B) biomass than did CM and hayfield soils. Microbial biomass, diversity and F:B ratios in CM and hayfield soils were not different.

Aside from giving farmers an opportunity to diversify their income and reduce inputs, these systems have been shown to provide a number of ecological benefits. Given the growing demand for environmentally produced food, this paper assessed how farmers of silvopastoral agroforestry systems distribute their products in the context of alternative food networks (AFN). Applying Global Production Network (GPN) analysis, the distribution of output was assessed for eight farms in two Italian regions (Umbria, Lazio) following qualitative interviews. While farmers of the case studies partly rely on conventional supply channels and markets, all of them engage in alternative forms of food distribution, such as off-farm sales, home deliveries, and farmer-owned shops enabling direct exchange with customers. Paired with a focus on high product quality, it can be argued that these farmers also form part of alternative food networks. This practice does result in higher prices for directly marketed products, an easier management of product information at the point of sale, as well as high levels of traceability. Yet, the fact that only a few farmers advertise the environmental benefits of their production systems indicates some potential for further value enhancement, which could allow farmers to capitalize on the synergy of alternative production and distribution.",

We investigated human-ecosystem relationship for agriculture development using sustainable natural resource management strategies for improved livelihood in a cultural landscape inhabited of Apatani tribe in northeast India. We argue that social robustness, traditional institutions, and cultural obligations govern resource management; we investigated integrated agriculture and allied resource (water and forest) management strategies by assessing community's current state in light of past 50 years and possible opportunities to strengthen local institutions for resource governance. The community maintains diverse agro-ecosystems to congregate the house consumption and cash needs. Early and late growing rice varieties cultivated along with fish farming to maximize agriculture production. The agro-ecosystems exhibited a high ecological and economic efficiency that brings a high degree of self-sufficiency to the community. Resource management is done by village institutions through collective decisions; needful transformations are done to fulfill the demand of changing environment.

Particular attention is paid to the role played by the “new challenges,” which are the policy aims of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) after 2013: climate change; safeguarding biodiversity; rational use of water resources and promotion of bio-energy. The conceptual framework is the new set of indicators on sustainability evaluation proposed by the Fondazione ENI Enrico Mattei. No empirical findings have been carried out in this research. This study is aimed at highlighting the possible relationships between the challenges that the CAP faces if it is to guarantee sustainability in the sector and to evaluate how the promotion of these policy priorities can affect sustainability. The results of this qualitative analysis show the possible contradictions between the CAP objectives if harmonic and sustainable agricultural development is to be achieved.",

It has put the livelihood of 2.5 million people at risk and aggravated the burden on the country`s food import bill. This study presents a case of the Resources Dual Circulation System of the dairy sector to support the contention that this system contributes to the sustainability of dairy farming in the era of trade liberalization. The results indicate the potential of the system with regard to the efficiency in farm-level integrated resource use techniques; the contribution to smallholder dairy farmers in terms of improving milk income and productivity; the provision of a competitive supply chain system with better raw milk prices and environmental friendliness with respect to organic manure usage and biogas production. The study concludes that strategies designed to develop the dairy sector and improve the welfare of dairy farmers in Sri Lanka during the economic liberalization period should take into account the characteristics of the dairy sector's dual circulation system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The conversion of conventional farms to organic farming is a challenge with regard both to solving or preventing environmental problems, and to satisfying consumers' growing demand. In this article, the dynamics of organic agriculture in relation to local outlets are analyzed together with the role of those outlets in the territorial development of organic farming. A comprehensive approach was adopted based on surveys conducted on farmers and actors in the agricultural sector applied to the scale of the Ile-de-France region. Two crops, emblematic of problems of structuring supply chains in relation to technical problems, were studied: sugarbeet, considered to be an impediment to conversion because of the absence of organic markets, and alfalfa, seen as an ideal gateway to organic farming systems, but which finds limited outlets in areas with few livestock farms. We show how opportunities for local outlets can play on the development dynamics of organic farming on a regional scale. We then identify leeway for developing organic systems by finding compromises with these two crops. Finally, we discuss the interest of studying these opportunities for local outlets as possible determinants of conversions, which can contribute to explaining the local geography of organic agriculture in a given region. Keywords: organic agriculturelocal outletsspatial determinantssugarbeetalfalfa ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Marie Garin and Aline Lambert for their participation in this study, through their Agroparistech engineering project on organic sugarbeet, and for the organization of the round table. Notes 1. Bibliographical research using the keywords \"organic farming\" and \"outlet\", run on the Web of Knowledge database, yielded few results (only 57 references). The issue of outlets from farmers' point of view is rarely addressed per se. It is sometimes mentioned in the case of lack of structuring in the supply chain or to point out the diversity of possible modes of commercialization for organic products. No specific studies were identified on opportunities for outlets in a particular territory, and possible differentiation between farmers and geographic sectors. 2. Landscape agronomy was recently proposed as a discipline to build bridges between agronomists, geographers and ecologists, and aimed primarily at exploring the links between landscapes and agricultural production systems.",

    "abstract": "The widespread transition into intensive agroecosystems has led to a considerable decline in plant biodiversity especially for organisms in the field boundaries. The aim of this study was to survey the vegetation of fields and field boundary types located in an agricultural landscape. We provided the structural map of the landscape and classified it into field boundary types nested in three main groups of natural and seminatural elements. Species recorded in all habitat types were categorized into two emergent groups based on their response to land use intensification: 1) agrotolerant species (AT) and 2) high nature-value species (NV). We analyzed the effect of landscape structure and soil physicochemical properties on species richness of these groups. We found both landscape structure and soil properties significant in explaining variation among AT and NV species richness both at 2-m-×-2-m and landscape scales. The most overall species richness was recorded for agricultural fields (43 species) followed by non-crop field edges (37). Woody green veins and permanent ditches were the elements providing high NV species richness clearly, while fields and other field boundary types were mostly supporters of AT species richness. Diversity of AT species increased along nitrogen and clay content gradients of the soil, while NV species benefited where phosphorus and soil moisture content were high. We recommend agricultural landscapes to be more specified with (semi-)natural habitats which embed high a proportion of rare weeds as nature-value plant species.",

This potential benefit is of particularly great relevance in the case of countries in Central and Eastern Europe, in which the agricultural landscape was damaged by the process of homogenization as a result of the collectivization of agricultural production. This article presents research focusing on the relationship between organic farming and landscape composition in selected locations with varying natural conditions within the Czech Republic. The first part of the research evaluates the overall development of landscape structure during the period of transition from socialist mass-production to farm management based on private companies and family farms. Analysis making use of the landscape metrics proved an increase in the heterogeneity and diversity of landscape between the years 1985 and 2006. The second part of the analysis focused on the relationship between farm management and changes in landscape use. The results showed differing trends in the studied locations, which do not depend on farm management alone, but also on other factors, especially natural conditions in agricultural landscape.",

    "abstract": "In Côte d'Ivoire, smallholder farmers cultivate cassava on poor, highly weathered soils without improved varieties or fertilizer inputs. Land pressure combined with high demand result in premature harvests and low yields. Furthermore, subsistence agriculture limits the adoption of input-intensive technologies. This study aimed at identifying integrated soil fertility management systems for increasing cassava productivity and profitability in two locations in southern Côte d'Ivoire. The integrated technical interventions included improved cassava genotypes and modified spacing, legume intercropping, and application of fertilizer at moderate doses. Overall, an improved cassava variety (Yavo) generally out-yielded the other varieties at both sites. Legumes performed better at the higher soil fertility site and gave higher grain yield and biological nitrogen fixation in a 2 × 0.5 m cassava spacing compared to 1 × 1 m. The response of cassava to nutrient amendments varied between sites, suggesting the need for site-specific adaptations. Fertilizer application was essential to avoid cassava yield reduction upon legume intercropping as a result of competition for nutrients and N immobilization and delayed re-mineralization of legume residues. Growing legumes, however, substantially increased profitability. Hence, better synchronization of legume sowing, legume residue and fertilizer application in relation to cassava growth phases is needed.",

Management for control of insect pests of agricultural commodities can be facilitated by our knowledge of these factors. We sampled for a minor coffee pest, a leaf-chewing beetle (Rhabdopterus jansoni), across sites that varied in coffee shade management and landscape land use composition. We show that R. jansoni abundance increased with higher local shade tree density, and the percentage of high-shade plantations and habitat diversity in the surrounding landscape. Sites at lower elevations also had more R. jansoni than at higher elevations. This study suggests that this minor pest prefers high-shade plantations, landscapes dominated by high-shade coffee land use, and lower elevations. These results will be useful for understanding this pest’s population dynamics with continuing shade intensification and climate change occurring in the Mexican and Central American coffee growing region.KEYWORDS: herbivoreRhabdopteruspest controlscalemanagement ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Kate Ennis, Aldo De la Mora, Linda Marín, Stacy Philpott, John Vandermeer, and the Perfecto & Vandermeer labs for project and field help.

    "abstract": "Emergy synthesis is an energy-based evaluation method useful for investigating agroecosystems in the context of ecology and economics owing to its ability to express different types of inputs on a common basis: the solar energy. In this article, emergy synthesis is used to analyze, in quantitative terms, the agroecosystem in the area of Yan'an, which coexists with a mineral exploitation region in the Loess Plateau of China. The analysis indicates that the emergy input supporting the agroecosystem totaled 1.26E + 22 seJ/yr in 2006. On a percentage basis, renewable resources, nonrenewable resources, and purchased emergy accounted for, respectively, 36%, 31%, and 33% of the total emergy input. With 67% of its total emergy input derived from local resources (renewable and nonrenewable), the agroecosystem is indicative of a sustainable pattern of agricultural production. The environmental sustainability index for the agroecosystem was calculated to be 1.70. A comparative analysis indicates that Yan'an's agroecosystem is more sustainable than Chinese, Italian, and Japanese agriculture on a nationwide basis.",

Indicator frameworks have been developed to facilitate evaluation, but in practice, food policy evaluation remains limited, as cities face increasing challenges. Through an explorative case study, we examine implementation opportunities and challenges for the indicator framework with a relatively greater potential reach among governments: the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact framework. Data, collected from expert interviews, were inductively analyzed for evaluation opportunities and challenges. Our analysis confirms that, at present, the value of this framework lies less in the evaluation outcomes themselves, and more in opportunities generated from the process, such as concretizing policy priorities and goals and generating political will. Encountered challenges include lack of data and resources, difficulty of adaptation to the local context, and poor data accessibility. Evaluation challenges between thematic areas differ: issues related to food production, supply, and distribution prove relatively hard, while health and governance issues are easier to assess. We emphasize the value of approaching evaluation less as a mechanism of accountability and control, and more with a view to acknowledging its processual capacity to improve food policy and learn.",

Second and third-year results are presented. Nitrogen (N) input obtained within the rotation from N2 fixed by legume cover crops was higher under SI (34% potential self-sufficiency) than CP (5%). Marketable yields of cabbage, celeriac, leek, lettuce, and onion were similar, and aboveground dry matter increased by 16% under SI (8.6 Mg ha−1) compared to CP (7.5 Mg ha−1). Nitrogen use efficiency (N output/ N input) was 8–16% higher under SI compared to CP, mainly due to the full year clover. Nitrogen surface balance (N input – N output) was higher for SI compared to CP, indicating increased N leaching risk under SI. Short season and shallow-rooted crops under SI left more mineral N to 2.5 m depth in autumn than deeper-rooted crops under CP. Cover crops indicated to mitigate N leaching risk. Vegetable production can be intensified sustainably using more yielding crops, cover crops, reduced tillage, and plant-based fertilizers.",

There is a current re-emphasis upon changing the methods of flour and bread production technologies, and wheat landrace varieties have made a resurgence. Wheat landrace varieties have become widespread and create the demand for their consumption as an alternative to industrial wheat. Producers have come together to form collectives of different structures and seek ways to expand production of wheat landraces. As a result, alternative food consumption communities have become established in which consumers can access wheat landrace products. The factors related to the development of wheat, flour, bulgur, bread, etc. should be put forward to consumers and producers. The fieldwork of this research is based on five community supported food groups formed by consumers in the İzmir province of Turkey, and associations/groups that produce wheat varieties in Çanakkale, Balıkesir and Kars provinces. The aim of the research is to identify common problems that reduce the separation between wheat production and consumption and how to increase the use of wheat landraces and their products by using participatory action research.",

    "abstract": "Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) have grown globally since the late 1990s to promote responsible consumption and production in the agri-food sector, although their expansion varies across countries and socio-economic contexts. Initially, the Fair Trade movement and development organizations established AFNs to address socio-environmental challenges faced by producers in the Global South. However, as cooperation and development agendas evolve, more Fair Trade and development actors are forming North-North AFNs (N-N AFNs) to tackle socio-economic imbalances in agri-food systems of the Global North, especially in the EU. Despite their prevalence, these initiatives and their structures lack extensive academic study. Drawing on Le Velly's framework for the analysis of AFNs, this paper conducts an in-depth qualitative analysis of three N-N AFN initiatives in Belgium, Italy, and Greece. The analysis demonstrates that while these initiatives share common objectives in terms of fairness and shortness of the agri-food system, variations arise in terms of its accessibility and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the findings emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all model for N-N AFNs across Europe, as different organizational arrangements – such as farmers' cooperatives, consumers' cooperatives, and business partnerships – emerge in response to specific project goals within each national context.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have found that growing or wild-harvesting some of one's own food is associated with food security in high-income societies. Yet this research has not established causal relationships, and it measures household food security using indicators that assess only access to market food. To disentangle how non-market food production interacts with food security, we interviewed 26 key informants who play central roles in communities of gardeners, hunters, fishers, foragers, and homesteaders in northern New England, U.S.A. These informants indicated that non-market food production relates ambiguously to short-term food access in high-income societies where market food is cheap relative to wages. But non-market production can enhance all other recognized dimensions of food security: availability, adequacy, acceptability, agency, utilization, stability, and sustainability. Causation can run the other way, too: food insecurity was said to increase the likelihood and intensity of engagement in non-market food production. Yet poverty can deprive food-insecure households of the equipment, money, skills, and land access needed for successfully producing their own food. Overall, our informants portrayed non-market food production as a skills-based safety net for reliably feeding oneself from the landscape through personal and societal crises, from the distant past to the climate-change future.",

Vineyards are considered one of the most relevant crops in the arid lands of Argentina. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing more sustainable practices to enhance a balance among available resources, living organisms, and productivity in vineyards worldwide. We studied the coverage and richness of spontaneous vegetation in a vineyard of Mendoza specifically examining its contribution to biodiversity and carbon storage. We characterized, analyzed, and discussed the plant diversity and the effects of management practices on coverage and carbon storage in both the inter-row and row spaces. As expected, the inter-row areas exhibited greater number of species and higher coverage percentage under both removal and non-removal practices compared to the row spaces which were predominantly dominated by non-native species. The aboveground vegetation in both the row and the inter-row retained more carbon than the belowground biomass. The spontaneous vegetation in the inter-row space accumulated 1.6 tnC/ha, while the under row space accumulated 0.18 tnC/ha. This research provides valuable insights into the characteristics and carbon retention capabilities of spontaneous vegetation growing in a commercial vineyard from Mendoza, Argentina.",

It searches for alternatives to pest management so as to increase yields while promoting biodiversity conservation. Our goal was to know the perception and opinion of agroecological farmers of the Pampa region on crop pests, the techniques they use for pest management and their perceptions on biodiversity. A survey was conducted which provided 103 responses. The main pest mentioned was ants. Of farmers surveyed, 64.71% claim that their main pest significantly reduces their yields, 79.42% claim that they monitor their crops for pests, although those with over 25 years of experience tend not to. Farmers have a mostly positive perception of biodiversity, particularly birds even though many identify pigeons and parrots as damaging. These results make it possible to describe the agroecological Pampa farmers and to show some common pest issues that need to be observed to benefit production in the area. The study highlights the importance of biodiversity for these farmers and their willingness to use tools that attract birds that could potentially manage pests.",

    "abstract": "Food production systems in protected conditions are probably the most intensive agricultural systems causing biodiversity loss. Experimental sites in different European areas were established to investigate whether an agroecological approach to organic greenhouse production allows preserving or increasing biodiversity. Soil nematode communities were characterized by DNA-metabarcoding, and some biodiversity indices were calculated. A general increase in absolute number of genera indicates that the innovative treatments potentially positively influence biodiversity. A multidimensional analysis revealed that the change in nematode community compositions is caused more by country and sampling year than by the farming system. However, regionally, some shifts in biodiversity are obvious and the impact by a farming practice likely. This study is the first indication that the implementation of some agroecological measures in European protected cropping systems is feasible as at least they did not worsen (nor improve) soil biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture contributes to agricultural development, economic growth, and poverty reduction initiatives in Zambia. In northern and rural regions of the country, development requires improvements to the management of local and farm-generated inputs. Fish farmers have limited market access and purchasing power, which restricts access to commercial inputs, such as formulated feeds and chemical fertilizers. Instead, farmers adopt integrated-agriculture-aquaculture (IAA) practices, whereby on-farm resources supply essential inputs. Research is limited regarding local systems of resource management, and this hinders development of innovations for improving efficiency. This mixed-methods study explored local patterns of resource utilization. Smallholders (n = 63) participated in surveys and interviews regarding resource management. A series of quantitative analyses, including descriptive statistics, principal component analyses (PCA), and multinomial logistic regression (logit) models, identified relationships between these resources, household livelihood, and system productivity. Qualitative analyses explored farmer perceptions regarding seasonal resource availability. Results suggested that livestock manure, homemade feeds comprising maize and soybean, garden residues, and kitchen wastes were the most frequently selected inputs. Logit models of feeding intensity found that income, proximity to Luwingu Town, experience in aquaculture, and access to extension services were key household resources. High-intensity feeding strategies incorporated commercial feeds, chemical fertilizers, as well as home-made feeds containing a wide diversity of both high- and low-quality ingredients. Low-intensity feeding strategies incorporated only farm waste and termites. Potential innovations that may improve system performance in resource poor contexts are considered and recommendations for additional research are offered.",

Diversification of agricultural production systems has been proposed as an effective adaptation strategy. Elements of diversification have featured in viticulture adaptation studies, but the understanding of diversification and its potential as a climate change adaptation strategy has not been explicitly explored with winegrowers. To develop insights in this area we identified regional climate challenges, defined climate change related threats and opportunities, and envisaged diversification solutions. Data collection involved a literature review on climate change impacts, adaptation and diversification in viticulture systems, followed by a focus group with industry stakeholders. Agroecological practices, plant material and vineyard location were the core diversification themes identified in the literature. The study found that winegrowers' understanding of the potential for diversification include implementing agroecological practices, diversification of plant material (clones, rootstocks), alternative vineyard locations, integrating different crops and growing alternative varieties. The study expands on current literature by explicitly assessing winegrower understanding of the potential for diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy in winegrowing systems.",

Soil and root samples were obtained in an AFS with coffee cultivated in the Natural/Wild system, an AFS undergoing conversion to the syntropic system, and a conventional AFS. Spore counting, mycorrhizal colonization percentage, and AMF sequencing using the Illumina Miseq platform after DNA extraction and amplification were performed on the samples. Syntropic AFS and conventional AFS showed the highest values of mycorrhizal colonization. However, no differences were observed in the number of glomerospores and beta diversity data among the three AFSs. Around 80 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified in the AFSs. Syntropic AFS had a higher number of ASVs than the other AFSs. These results show that agroecosystem management can influence AMF communities. Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were the most abundant AMF families in the AFSs.",

A series of three workshops used farmer-participatory research methodologies to assess attitudes and perceptions of small-scale anaerobic digesters in New York State by smaller scale livestock and crop operations. Results indicate a diverse group of farmers are interested in using anaerobic digester systems. Participants who attended the tour and workshop also increased their level of knowledge and understanding of anaerobic digester systems. Participant discussion revealed a need for more information for AD establishment on small farms including detailed economic data and a greater number of example AD systems. Additionally, results showed improved funding sources for adoption of this sustainable technology will likely increase farmer's rate of adoption.",

    "abstract": "Following a cradle-to-farm-gate approach, we determined the input of fossil energy and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) for conventional and agroforestry land use on a farm in a low profit region of Germany. On the basis of a calculation model with a recurring crop rotation of maize, rye, oat, and a catch crop mixture, it was found that a short rotation alley cropping system (SRACS) with a 10% (A10) and a 40% (A40) tree area for bioenergy production consumed 7% and 32% less fossil energy than the conventionally managed site (C). Simultaneously, the net energy gains and energy efficiency of the plant production process were increased by up to 8 and 53%, respectively. Likewise, the operational GGE accumulated to 3.1 Mg ha−1 yr−1 under C farming and could be reduced by 9% and 36% in A10 and A40, respectively. Overall, a multidimensional land use indicator comparison proved that under specific site conditions agroforestry land use can increase the energy output per unit of land area, while the energy input and GGE per metric ton of biomass yield were considerably lower than in C farming. Nominal range sensitivity analysis revealed that the energetic and ecological performance of the system was highly sensitive to the size and productivity of the tree area as well as to the use of fertilisers. Our findings suggest that SRACS may fundamentally improve the environmental and energetic performance of the cultivation process on marginal land, without leading to substantial losses in agricultural livestock production area.",

Combining peasant and academic knowledge, we have addressed a distinctive peasant agroecosystem, describing multiple dimensions and analyzing sustainability processes in three nested scales: farm subsystems, the farm as a system, and farm links with its social–ecological context. Key synergies between management and natural assets conservation are revealed in detail, as well as productive activities (7) and species (75), of which their ecology and possible uses (43) are well known. This allows high productivity and self-sufficiency levels that account for most of the family economy, the majority of which is non–monetary and not linked to cash crop farming. Strong links to community, peasant organizations, NGO´s and public institutions help to manage and deal with external threats. However, public policy for rural infrastructure does not always contemplate peasants as inhabitants of the region. Traditional knowledge enables sustainable use of the Chaco forest. Nevertheless, additional support from other stakeholders would appear to be a necessary requirement in order to harness the potential of locally based peasant farming in the current threatened context.",

Push-pull technology (PPT) is an agronomic package designed to reduce the effects of Striga and stemborers on maize and sorghum production. As PPT is promoted in new areas, including Ethiopia, there is a need to review the evidence that the technology helps farmers mitigate or adapt to climate change. Furthermore, proponents need to consider whether tasks associated with establishing and maintaining PPT may worsen existing gender burdens. We assess whether PPT is climate- and gender-smart based on a review of 40 publications that included field experiments or farmer surveys. We find strong evidence that intercropping with drought-tolerant Desmodium effectively reduces Striga abundance and enhances grain yield. Although gender influences PPT adoption, there is a lack of knowledge about additional labor requirements for women. We recommend research focusing on 1) the efficacy of PPT under different climate conditions, 2) optimal timing of planting push and pull species; 3) evaluation of fodder outputs; 4) water requirements associated with establishment; and 5) implications for gender burden across cultural contexts. We suggest a participatory approach that integrates farmers' perspectives to support climate mitigation, adaptation, and gender equity.",

Although agroecological management using crop functional and genetic diversity could improve soil fertility and family nutrition, experimental evidence is scarce. We conducted a field experiment in which conventional agricultural management (CON) was compared to an agroecological alternative (AGR), with interspecific and intraspecific diversification factors. We hypothesized that: (1) the higher input of organic matter and the suspension of tillage in AGR plots would improve soil conditions, nutrient content and productivity in maize, and intra-root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi as compared to CON plots; and that (2) these conditions would further improve in AGR management with increased intra- and interspecific diversity, since a diverse plant community in the rhizosphere should enhance microbial activity. AGR increased pH, the soil availability of K, Ca and Mg, K in leaves, and mycorrhizal colonization. Within AGR, diversified treatments temporarily increased NO3− in the soil. The fixation of nitrogen by additional legumes could have produced this result. We conclude that AGR with interspecific diversification is a viable alternative to CON, since a variety of additional edible plants became available concomitantly with the improvement of mycorrhizal relationships and soil conditions.",

In addition to climate change and the increasing aridity of large sections of land, there is also a growing demand to feed the population. Hitherto such integration has been practiced on a relatively small scale by commercial farmers on privately owned land, and by smallholder farmers on communal land. The latter use the land for grazing livestock, but this readily leads to an overutilization of the resource, resulting in serious land degradation. This paper examines perceptions and costs/benefits associated with integrating livestock with game. While the cost–benefit analysis (CBA) result for livestock farming alone was 0.67, indicating that the project is not sustainable, the CBA for integrated game and livestock farming was 1.13, implying that it is sustainable. The net present value (NPV) for the game+/livestock farming was also positive, indicating that it is a worthwhile investment when compared with livestock farming only.",

The study investigates whether organic farms are becoming more like conventional farms, with related environmental and social problems. The framework is illustrated with a historical analysis of the Swedish case of organic apple farming. The analysis shows that in Sweden, conventionalization is part of the current dominant \"intensive organic farming concept\", while an emerging concept, the \"ecology of food systems\", is attempting to break free from this process. The proposed analytical framework can be used for comparing OF concepts and for guiding future development efforts according to the needs of stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "GHG emissions of an extensively managed Danish organic farm were estimated upstream and on-farm. The results were compared to Danish national levels based on land area and output. Overall, the farm emitted 2.12 t CO2eq ha−1 yr−1. Excluding land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) related emissions, the combined GHG emissions from energy- and agriculture-based activities at the case farm were 47% lower (per unit area) and 12% higher (per unit output), than GHG emissions from Danish agriculture. With current livestock density (0.64 LU ha−1) and crop production area, the case study farm would supply at average 1,466 kcal per inhabitant per day in Denmark, if the farm was scaled up to Danish national level. With a reduction of livestock density to 0.36 LU ha−1 and proportional cropland area expansion for food production (ceteris paribus), the case study farm could supply around 4,940 kcal person−1 day−1, matching Danish national levels (including Danish net food export surplus of 41.5. Simultaneously, the case study farm would have a better GHG balance per unit area and unit output in food, compared to the rest of Denmark. Hence, the case study farm system could serve as an alternative model for Danish agriculture under a sustainable extensification scenario with lower GHG emissions, while maintaining sufficient output for human consumption.",

These findings demonstrate that there are substantive production and marketing issues that influence producer decisions to change an existing management system.

Total food production and consumption for 2012–2013 were 89.5 and 94.5 million tons with a self-sufficiency coefficient of 0.87. The ecological footprint for the country is 2.8 global hectare (Gha) and foodprint is 0.88 Gha per person with an increase of 3.3 and 2.9% per year up, respectively, to the year 2025, reaching values of 3.34 and 1.05 Gha per person. Biocapacity of the country is estimated as 0.82 Gha per person with an ecological deficit of 0.9 Gha with a predicted value of 2.5 Gha for the year 2025. The balance between consumption and national food production as well as foodprint was analyzed under 4 scenarios differing in the amount of consumption of meat and dairy products. In all scenarios with increasing consumption of animal products, the unbalanced relation of consumption–production was intensified and resulted in a decreased self-sufficiency index and increased foodprint. Results also showed that enhancement of input use efficiency (water and nitrogen) by 20% higher than current values could lead to improvement of agricultural self-sufficiency and considerable reduction of foodprint in all future scenarios.",

We found differences among farms in sward height, densities of several insect families and insect diversity that were related to management but not to cattle density. Sward height was more strongly related to the insect community than surrounding land cover patterns.

Finally, the variance of the data was analyzed under a bifactor design (management, site). The variables of study were chemical, physical, and biological properties of the soil, as well as annual net income of the production unit. The interval scale applied to the chemical properties of the soil indicates that TA has better conditions for growing corn, with a score of 3.6, followed by CA with 3.5, and CVA with 3.3. The cluster analysis only showed correlation with the order of the scores for the type of management. The ordinal scale showed a holistic view of the conditions of the plot's resources and CA was ranked first, followed by CVA and TA, for their ability to promote the health of the agroecosystem. A statistically significant effect of the management was found in all chemical and physical soil properties, whereas for the biological factors it was necessary to analyze the dominant taxonomic groups.",

Hatchability and survivability ratio was estimated from 858 batches duck eggs recorded from 220 marginal/landless duck farmers over a period of 24 months. Statistical analysis by fitting fixed effect general linear models revealed that the ambient temperature and relative humidity were the most critical climatic factors that affect the hatchability ratio of duck eggs and survivability ratio of ducklings. Besides, the human-made factor was also found to be associated with variations of the hatchability and survivability performances of duck under broody hen incubation. Thus identification of these factors and their effects on the studied traits would be helpful to provide appropriate season-based management strategies for economic and sustainable duck production in rural backyard farming systems. The present finding could be a valuable insight for duck farmers not only in north-east India but also in other developing countries with a subtropical hot humid climate with prevailing backyard duck production systems.",

During the diffusion of this social movement, non-governmental organization (NGO) activism, the introduction of organic farmers' markets and local organic certification, and collaboration with universities have played significant roles. Our findings suggest that partnership, place, and knowledge have been important contributors to the agroecological transition. Utilizing the concept of cognitive praxis, we conclude that the participatory mode of knowledge production and the horizontal process of knowledge exchange have contributed to the movement's diffusion by providing opportunities for local ecological knowledge to be produced, reinvented, and disseminated.KEYWORDS: Agroecologysocial movementcognitive praxisknowledgeChiang MaiThailand AcknowledgmentsWe would like to appreciate all the participants who shared their thoughts, experiences, and wisdom on life.

The BR program has experienced great success in Spain however questions linger regarding their contribution to agricultural sustainability. Here, we evaluate the performance of two selected local agroecological initiatives through a Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) approach focusing, specifically, on their potential contribution to community resilience. To do so, we collected survey data from participants in one local agroecological initiative in the non-BR designated \"La Vera\" area and in the \"Mariñas Coruñesas e Terras do Mandeo\" BR. We found that participants valued positively the achievements of both initiatives but identified two important obstacles for CHANS community resilience: 1) lack of economic competitiveness of the products and services offered due to the higher prices of agroecological products when compared with conventionally produced market-oriented competitors and, 2) governance obstacles related to subsidy dependence and excessive governmental regulations of local community management practices and decision-making. Though there were no statistically significant differences between BR and non-BR survey data, non-BR respondents did identify more governance issues than BR respondents suggesting that BR designation may empower local communities institutionally providing them with more decision-making leverage in their interactions with the administration.",

AER and AEA integration allowed secure data storage and real-time automated visualization and statistical analyses without programming. At no field station did legume intercropping or biological pest control increase cassava yields. The Chambezi field station had the highest yields even under untreated control conditions and only here, soil fertility amendments further increased root weights. Intercropping with cowpea legumes, alone or in combination with other practices, had no significant effect on cassava plant size or survival at the Mumbaka and Vianzi field sites and even negatively affected one or both parameters. Organic pest control had no effect on any target variable, except for plant size at Chambezi. Therefore, labor-intensive and expensive pest control practices may not be worth the investment at least when virus-resistant cassava varieties like Kiroba are used.",

To date, little is known about pro-environmental actions implemented by farmers based in these regions, their knowledge and beliefs about the practices they use as well as challenges encountered. The current study uses narrative interviewing approach employed predominantly within the social sciences to elicit and understand life experiences associated with farmers' implementation of pro-environmental diversification. 15 Irish, 7 British, and 7 French farmers engaged in pro-environmental diversification were interviewed using a narrative approach. A qualitative, thematic analysis of the interview data found that, in most cases, farmers' pursuit of pro-environmental diversification was associated with alternative farming systems such as organic agriculture, regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, and permaculture. Primary challengesexperienced by farmers implementing pro-environmental diversification were: a lack of clear regulation; information, and formal training in pro-environmental farming; along with labor requirements. The results of this study help to better understand farmers' motivations in undertaking pro-environmental diversification and their perception of these actions, which can hinder the development of effective strategies and interventions to promote sustainable agriculture practices.",

Such stoichiometric imbalances can result in inefficient use of non-renewable P resources as well as aquatic eutrophication. On average, P surpluses in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) systems of the United States vary between 1.4 and 3.1 kg P per kg of plant-available nitrogen (PAN) applied. Hybrid systems combining manures and biological N2-fixation from cover crops can limit P over-fertilization and reduce synthetic N fertilizer inputs. On average, about 40–48% of corn and 69–75% of wheat crop N demand could be met by manures and legume cover crops in the United States. However, the range of their possible N contribution to a specific system is wide given the variability in nutrient concentrations/availability and transfer to a subsequent crop. The adoption of hybrid systems is also limited by other constraints, most notably the spatial decoupling between animal and crop production.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate factors affecting persistence of the invasive, federal noxious weed Benghal dayflower in sustainable agronomic systems. Seeds were exposed to a range of temperatures simulating those found in hay bales in the field and periodically tested for viability over 21 days. Seeds were nonviable after one day at 65 °C and after 14 days at 50 or 45 °C. A second series of experiments examined the effects of simulated rumen digestion on germination and viability of Benghal dayflower seeds and the response was compared to that with seeds of five other common weed species. Time courses revealed that seeds from the other weeds were acutely damaged by digestion and viability depressed after 48 and 96 h, but germination of Benghal dayflower seeds was increased at 48 h, and only a slight decrease occurred after 96 h. In the third experimental series, stem fragments of Benghal dayflower were buried in soil at 2 and 6 cm depths and exposed to aerial temperatures of 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C for 30 days. Root development occurred at both depths, but leaf development was restricted at 6 cm and subterranean spathe development was not found at 2 cm. Temperatures higher than 25 °C favor regeneration at both depths. The results, collectively, show the difficulty encountered when trying to control or eradicate Benghal dayflower in sustainable farming systems. Farms must avoid using fresh hay as animal feed when Benghal dayflower is present in hay fields, as little restraint on seed viability will be exerted during digestion and generation of manure. Cultivation is unlikely to be an effective control strategy during summer months when Benghal dayflower is growing most aggressively, because soil temperatures are optimal for vegetative regeneration.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with specialty chefs and butchers in the Rocky Mountain Region based on the hypothesis that they operate as opinion leaders and understand that the benefits of, and barriers to, implementation of their current meat program is crucial for successfully introducing new products, such as Rocky Mountain Legume-Finished beef. Interviews revealed that professionals struggle with being ‘conscientious’ and ‘sustainable’ while still providing a consistent product for their customers. Although a few chefs spoke of setting ‘hard limits’ and ‘high standards’ for products, this did not emerge as a financial reality for other chefs or customers. In order for alternative sources of beef to be truly viable, beef production must address both environmental and economic concerns, while providing a consistent product in terms of taste and quality. Understanding the concerns of culinary professionals allows alternative ranching and agricultural production methods to be tailored as a viable for beef producers.",

This study is a field trial on a hilly farm, which compared a natural plot to an organic one. It showed that in the plot conducted with natural farming, total soil organic C increased significantly compared to the organic plot, from 1.97% to 4.16%. In organic farming system a significant increase of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at the lower part of plot was observed as a consequence of soil loss (+ 25%). An economic analysis of the two farming systems on four farms, carried out considering the average costs and the average revenues, highlighted for the first time the greater profitability of natural cultivation compared to organic farming (+43%). The balance between safe food production, natural resources management and economic performance, obtained by substituting the organic farming with natural techniques, provides new and effective resilient agricultural practices to the organic farm sector.",

We question the adequacy of Tegucigalpa’s top–down planning system and explore the concept of urban agriculture (UA) as a multifaceted lever that can provide building blocks for an alternative bottom–up strategy to address the intricate web of problems the city faces. Noteworthy among our discoveries is the potential of school gardens to serve as a channel for strategically achieving community goals. UA is organized as a result of residents’ need to overcome food insecurity and hardship in the city. Still, the topic of active citizenship and bottom–up development is not yet consolidated in the context of Tegucigalpa. Moreover, the city poses challenges regarding the resources needed for practicing UA and the diffusion of knowledge to the population. Nevertheless, steps must be taken toward further considering UA and its social assets that may compensate for the unfavorable access to resources in the urban area.",

In temperate regions, population density has been shown to be largely determined by the rate and timing of immigration from tropical areas. Historical records of planthopper outbreaks in western Japan over 1300 years suggest that the cropping system may influence planthopper populations as the likelihood of an outbreak has increased substantially since the conversion to intensive rice production during the second half of the twentieth century. To investigate this in more detail, planthopper populations were compared in naturally and conventionally farmed paddies in Hiroshima Prefecture. Naturally farmed paddies differed from conventionally farmed ones in the absence of synthetic chemicals and the use of plant compost as the sole source of fertilizer. Paddies farmed naturally for >8 years had less planthopper damage than conventional paddies, slightly lower densities of white-backed planthopper, much lower densities of brown planthopper, and higher rates of planthopper parasitism by the nematode Agamermis unka. Nematode density and parasitism showed a close correlation with variation in planthopper populations, suggesting that nematodes may control planthoppers in naturally farmed paddies.",

However, it is unclear how commercial, high-yielding varieties adapt to less environmental conditions such as weed pressure and mixed cropping cultivation systems. In Europe, organic breeding organizations conserve local, traditional varieties and develop new varieties under low-input conditions, aiming at increasing the range of varieties adapted to harsh cultivation conditions and mixed cropping. To evaluate whether organic varieties (i) cope better with weed pressure and (ii) have a higher adaptability to mixed cropping, we compared the agronomic and quality performance of eight organic varieties with eight commercial, high-yielding varieties, focusing on tomato, the economically most important vegetable in the EU. Each group was cultivated as single plants and in a mixed cropping system, respectively, with a legume and with or without exposure to weed stress by a grass. The organic group outperformed the commercial, high-yielding group, specifically, in mixed cropping systems. Weed stress lowered the yield of both groups, but the organic group showed higher fruit weight stability across the varieties than the commercial, high-yielding varieties when grown as single plants under weed stress.",

Molecular characterization was performed using 281 SNPs on a total of 545 individuals. Our results demonstrate that populations characterized by high yield and yield stability can also hold sufficient genetic variability to quickly adapt to different climatic conditions attaining specific adaptation, of great relevance in low input and organic agriculture.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, mountain livestock farming systems fall within the scope of the agro-ecological transition due largely to animals grazing on spontaneous vegetation. Recently, the development of organic farming production has become noticeable and has contributed to changes in production systems organization. In the context of a strong sociotechnical system, around dairy sheep production, in the “Grands Causses” region in southern France, we investigate whether this development is a means of fostering the agro-ecological transition. We interviewed seventeen farmers chosen to capture changes in breeding practices under effects due to sociotechnical system. We describe their conversion to organic farming using the processual analysis framework, studying the changes in their practices over time with regard to the sociotechnical system. In the early 2000s, some farmers entered the first pathway to organic conversion, while milk sales under organic signs were not possible because the local collection network was insufficient and the network was not near their farm. Then, in 2005, a second pathway to organic conversion emerged with farmers looking to increase their free time and their revenue, which requires increasing milk production (volume) and recruiting a new collaborator. These farmers chose to supply their organic milk with a price premium to dairies operating outside the Roquefort interprofessional organization, which at that time had restricted volumes by “quotas.” A third pathway to conversion was developed in 2014, following the abolition of the “quotas,” and it drew producers who were looking for a niche to secure the price of their milk; these producers were encouraged by the future buyers of their farms who wanted to continue with organic farming. In the three pathways, the farmers stopped using chemical inputs, replacing them with other practices and showing that organic farming permits certain agroecology principles, such as closing nutrient cycles. To sell milk with premium price due to organic products, some of the farmers changed the seasonality of production (April to October) and increased the productivity of ewes (liter/ewe), contributing to a reduction or abandonment in rangeland grazing. However, not all the farmers in our sample opted for these strategies, proving that organic farms are very diverse. This questions the choice of organic agriculture as a means of upholding all the principles of the agro-ecological transition and shows the importance of the sociotechnical system, specifically the organization of downstream sector and agricultural extension actors to promote it.",

While UPA is well researched, direct links to economic crisis and class variations in participation have only received limited attention in the Nigerian context. This study focuses on Benin City, the second largest city in Nigeria's southern oil producing region, where repeated and unpredictable fluctuations in oil prices have significant implications for livelihoods. The paper discusses the results of field-based data collected using qualitative research methods (observation, in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys) in Benin City, Southern Nigeria, where there is a dearth of published material on the practice of UPA . The paper reveals that in the context of unpredictable and frequent exposures to economic shocks, households at all socio-economic levels depend significantly on food production activities, not only for their immediate survival, but as a means of reducing household vulnerability and building resilience against future shocks.",

Beginning in 2015 the network complemented global higher education responses to SDGs, IPCC Reports, ASEAN work-plans, FAO's scaling-up agroecology initiative, UNESCO sustainability programming and more. University partners, farmer groups, research institutes, NGOs, regional organizations, governments, international agencies, and donors collaborated. This new Southeast Asian academic network was an innovation to address perceived gaps in other academic networks, alliances, or intergovernmental and non-government membership organizations. It facilitated cross-sectoral cooperation and transdisciplinary discussions with representatives of both specialized or mandated national agriculture colleges or universities as well as multi-purpose universities with agri-food faculties or schools. The network lost some momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic but FAO collaborating with SEAMEO-SEARCA and others initiated some follow-up online. Nonetheless, the initiative remains an unfinished experiment in regional network-building and academic reform. The paper contributes to literatures on higher education sustainability, regional learning, sustainable agri-food systems, and agroecological transitions while critically analyzing network aspirations, outputs, outcomes, and future research needs.",

As a result of difficulties in securing a reliable food supply, it is thus quite rare to see the accumulation of food in rural villages in Africa. On the other hand, the Dirashe people living in southern Ethiopia own traditional storage pits called \"polota\" that can store sorghum for several years. This study investigates how the people utilize polota in their daily lives in order to secure a sufficient supply of food at both the individual and community levels. Participant observation and interviews were conducted to ascertain the roles of polota, the management of crops, and the historical background of polota. Moreover, climate data were analyzed to understand the climate over a span from several years to several decades, as this has a great influence on food production. Ultimately, the polota enables the villagers to prepare for a year of harvest failure by strategically storing crops harvested in a year of large yield. Additionally, those who own a number of polotas voluntarily open them and share the stored sorghum with villagers during the time of food security.",

Utilizing nest boxes to attract natural predators of fruit-eating birds is frequently effective in lowering bird damage, as well as increasing fruit marketability. The adoption of a conservation practice, however, depends on a grower's level of interest. What is the level of interest in nest boxes, and how do growers perceive the influence of natural predators on the farm ecosystem? To answer these questions we conducted an online national survey of cherry and blueberry growers focusing on potential interactions between key farm variables. We found a surprising consistency in perceptions of the functioning of the farm ecosystem and a high level of agreement on how natural predators affect other production factors. Growers typically perceived nest boxes to lower bird damage and pest pressure, and to raise fruit quality and income. They also indicated a significant interest in installing nest boxes, and strong agreement that extension and outreach related to the costs, benefits and timing of implementation of nest boxes would be helpful.",

Excessive application of commercial feedstuff for ducks weakens the sustainability of rice–duck farming. This study aims to investigate green forage (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as a substitute for commercial grain mix, to attain a maximum economic benefit and pollution-free production in rice–duck farming. The effects of a mixed feedstuff of green forage and commercial grain mix with a stable ratio of 1:4 (MFSR), mixture feedstuff of green forage and commercial grain mix with dynamic ratios (MFDR), and full commercial grain mix (FCGM) were studied. Results showed that Cherry Volley and hybrid ducks were more adaptable to mixed feedstuff than Mud ducks. Growth of ducks was classified into rapid, slow and steady-growth stages. The weight, body length, neck length, and chest circumference of ducks that were fed MFDR were only slightly decreased. The carcass weight, eviscerated weight, and semi-eviscerated weight of ducks fed MFDR were similar to those fed FCGM. MFDR significantly decreased duck fat accumulation. MFDR did not have negative impacts on the agronomic traits of rice yields. Duck profits per 667 m2 were calculated as CNY (Chinese Yuan) 254.91 (MFSR), CNY309.27 (MFDR), and CNY39.36 (FCGM). MFDR effectively improved the rice–duck farming.",

The biofertility indicators such as soil health, uptake of nutrients by the crops, yield, and yield attributes were studied in the cropping sequence of rice (Oryza Sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol). The recycling of organic residues is evident from the results as the values of soil microbial biomass carbon (364.0 μg/g soil) and carbon dioxide evolution (1.75 μg/g soil/h) were recorded. The results show that dehydrogenase and phosphatase enzymes activities have increased significantly after 3 years as a result of the incorporation of residue plus green manure. The mean yield data of rice and wheat crops revealed that incorporation or burning of residue in the field resulted in a slightly higher yield over residue removal. Further, higher grain yield (rice = 7.54 t/ha, wheat = 5.84 t/ha) was recorded in residue plus green manuring treatment. Total uptake of the nutrients by rice–wheat crops in sequence was highest (N 203.70, P 37.20, K 203.60 kg/ha) in case of crop residue plus green manuring treatment.

First, that agricultural productivism and a cosmopolitan outlook on plant breeding, often considered to be at odds with agroecology's principles, were in fact necessary elements for the emergence of crop ecology, and therefore of agroecological thought more generally. Second, we argue that the excesses of the Green Revolution, against which agroecology reacted in the last decades of the twentieth century, did not just stem from a disregard for the agricultural knowledge of indigenous peasants. They also resulted from the marginalization of intellectual dispositions that had taken shape in peripheral areas within the global geography of scientific production. A third implication, specific to the history of Greek agriculture, is that the claim that interwar Greece's rural economy failed to substantially develop needs to be nuanced when the priorities of Greek agronomists are taken into consideration.",

With the latest dramatic transformation of China's domestic seed market, and the strong presence of Chinese agribusiness in the global seed market, a closer examination of China's laws and regulations on the domestic seed industry is not only justified, but much needed. Counteracting the prevailing positive assessment on these new changes from the government and the seed companies, in this paper, I show that China's seed governance is moving from a precautionary system that resembles the European path to a system featuring self-governance with strengthened legal means that shares more similarities with the US path. Such a system transition will lead to the rising power of China's large agribusiness companies globally, in contrast with increasingly weakened seed governance and a more problematic future for seed sovereignty.",

Thirty-three local farms were selected to the study, where each farm was taken as a single system and the areas used for crop and livestock production (e.g., cashew field, corn field, beans field, cattle pasture, pigpen, etc.) made up the subsystems within each system. Considering diversity as the number of subsystems within a farm and interaction as exchange of materials between internal subsystems, the higher the diversity and interactions, the more efficient nutrient cycling was. This higher efficiency arises from using the nutrient in more than one subsystem, before being exported from the system. Overall, just a few farmers have used strategies to enable the return of nutrients to its original area. The interaction among the subsystems was restricted to flows deriving from plant to household and livestock production.",

    "abstract": "Upper-elevation mesic Hawaiian forests have been transformed by cattle ranching and invasive ungulates within the past 200 years. Although the flora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands have been radically altered by the introduction of invasive species, there is a movement of agriculturalists within the islands interested in reintroducing native species and reforestation in agricultural spaces. One of the keystone species in the Hawaiian Islands is the endemic tree species Acacia koa, known for its ecosystem services and cultural importance. This species is valuable for nitrogen fixation, aquifer recharge, habitat for biodiversity and usefulness in agroforestry systems. This investigation is focused on the relationship between the tree species A. koa and the forage grass species Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu) in a silvopastoral context, at an elevation of 5,200 feet above sea level (1585 masl) on the island of Maui. The site of investigation is called Pu’u Makua in Hawaiian and is situated on the southwestern flank of Haleakalā (10,023 feet above sea level–3055 masl) and is part of Ulupalakua Ranch. A total of n = 28 forage samples of P. clandestinum were taken in dry season, 21 of which were taken from underneath the canopies of koa trees (which had been planted in densities of 3, 4, and 6 m apart). The other seven samples were taken in full sun (where no koa trees were growing). This same protocol (sampling n = 28) was repeated in the wet season. Forage samples were then sent to the Agricultural Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa for forage analysis to compare attributes of kikuyu under different canopy densities of A. koa. To better understand the leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy of various densities of A. koa, hemispheric (180 degree) photos were taken and then input into Gap Light Analyzer Software for LAI. LAI data of A. koa as well as forage attributes of P. clandestinum were then input into the statistical software InfoStat to investigate relationships between canopy cover and forage quality at each specific location. It was found through Pearson correlation analysis that there are in fact significant relationships between koa and the quality of kikuyu. Measurements of koa trees were also taken to estimate biomass and the amount of carbon sequestered within each tree. These measurements were input into allometric equations specific to koa growing on the Island of Maui that were created by the United States Forest Service. Lastly, to better understand the knowledge of ranchers on Maui, we conducted surveys regarding various ranchers’ perceptions of native and non-native trees and their usefulness for silvopastoral ranching systems. Ranchers also identified various tree species that were of use (or harmful) to their operations. Since A. koa was on this list of helpful trees and conferred various ecosystem services and agroecological benefits, the incorporation of koa into ranching systems on the island of Maui is recommended in zones appropriate for its growth.",

    "abstract": "In Colombia, nearly six decades of war have devastated the countryside and induced land-related issues that perpetuate marginalization of rural people. Although the Peace Agreement of 2016 and the Integral Rural Reform offer new prospects for resolving legacies of conflict, the reconstruction of the countryside requires participation of rural communities. Social movements advance agroecology as a suitable territorial management approach for enabling the socio-ecological reconstruction of rural areas. Escuelas Campesinas de Agroecología (ECAs) are farmer-led formative initiatives that emerge around productive, market, and political processes aimed at scaling agroecology by developing new knowledge and learning systems. This qualitative study investigates the potentialities of ECAs as a social learning strategy for empowering farmer communities confronting current post-conflict challenges. Through a systematization of experiences, the work of seven ECAs is analyzed in relation to three phenomena – problematization, social networking, and critical thinking. The different pedagogies are then scrutinized based on identity frameworks. Results evidence that the context-specific approaches of ECAs enable communities to integrate diverse epistemological knowledge into collective learning systems and move it to a broader social context through social networks. We conclude that ECAs represent a suitable approach for transforming postwar environments while facilitating the achievement of peacebuilding goals.",

The objective of this study is to provide advanced understanding and analysis of the perspective of urban and peri-urban farming through the lens of embeddedness in the life of the urban community. The study adopted Prato Province (Tuscany Region, Italy) as a case study area. Spatial analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders (N = 9), field observations and discussions with local farmers (N = 17) were deployed in the research. Drawing upon our research, we identified a wide diversity of unique, locally focused and rooted agrifood initiatives and innovative food networks connecting individual (or groups of) farmers with local people. Our findings suggest that observed farms tend to be highly differentially re-embedded to the urban space of Prato Province and its inhabitants. Mutual interconnectedness through jointly cooperating local agrifood initiatives truly contributes to a more sustainable shape of territorial agrifood system. Furthermore, our observations showed a clear tendency toward more sustainable land management in the region. We claim that well thought out and smart local food governance and systemic involvement of innovative territorial planning instruments, have potential to beneficially contribute to the formation of inspirational and transferrable sustainable agrifood systems.",

    "abstract": "Typically, the agroecosystem is known as the basic unit of study of the agroecology. However, no consensus exists regarding its definition, which is reflected by the early state of agroecology as a science. This fact was illustrated after an exhaustive analytical review of the different agroecosystem definitions proposed and currently used in the literature. We reviewed 157 articles and other key scientific literature and found seven different concepts. It is necessary to advance in unification of the terminology to bridge the gaps among agroecology, agricultural sciences, and other disciplines that enable progress toward sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to propose a discussion about the need to have a semantic and operational concept of agroecosystem. Agroecosystem is a synthesis, product of the culture – nature interaction, it is regarded as a homogeneous natural unit, where an agrotechnological management system (AMS) is introduced according to farmer needs. Therefore, the agroecosystem is a holistic, irreducible, and particular basic unit of agroecology and the agricultural sciences, which integrates production processes and attributes for a sustainable agriculture.",

The local farming community has developed a unique system of raising buffalo for Banni breed animals that is cost effective which is low cost, climate -smart and sustainable. The livestock production system has evolved over generations and incorporates scientific considerations. The behavior of 55 Banni buffaloes was observed with a thermal imaging device and interpreted based on farmers' experiences. The nighttime behavior of these buffalo is unique. The animals were trained to follow the \"leader-follower\" hierarchy when moving around the pasture. The night grazing movements of the herd are controlled by the \"leader buffaloes\" without herders. The animals walk back and forth during the night along a known path. Concentrate feed mixed with jaggery, water and motherly instinct seem to be the main motivators for the buffalo to return from grazing – a type of Pavlovian conditioning behavior. The present study provides an alternative approach for developing simple, cost effective, welfare-oriented strategies for management using the behavioral aspects of animals.",

Deficiencies hinder the adequate implementation of agricultural projects and the achievement of collective rights. Thus, this article analyses the institutional diversity of the Weenhayek people in southern Bolivia and their governance of fishing on the Pilcomayo River. Weenhayeks have a fishing identity, creating aquatic food systems and a riverine culture. We undertake document analysis (20), participant observation, and interviews (13). Our results reveal that the Weenhayek’s indigenous governance system is not homogeneous throughout their territory. The “fuzziness” of the socio-ecological boundaries shows the fragility of the formal institutional boundaries. This indicates the importance of perspectives that addresses institutions beyond formal schemes, to support sustainable food systems and food sovereignty.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTKEYWORDS: Aquatic food systemsinstitutional diversitycommunity-based governancePilcomayo riversocial-ecological systemsrural development AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the collaboration for this research to the Comunidad de Estudios JAINA as local research institution and the political organization of Weenhayek’ peoples (ORCAWETA) in Bolivia.

    "abstract": "Maize is the most important staple crop in the world; 1.15 billion tons were produced in 2019. Insect herbivores cause significant damage for maize production, and as a result, global pesticide use has increased over the last 20 years causing severe environmental degradation and negative impacts on human health. Today, there is a trend toward including more sustainable management practices that are less harmful to biodiversity and human health. One such a practice is the use of natural enemies to regulate pest populations using conservation biocontrol or introduction of biocontrol agents. These practices have been in place for several decades in different cultivation systems and regions throughout the world, however; information about the effects of more sustainable management practices on maize production is scarce. We conducted an expert assessment to evaluate whether there are any general trends or consensus about the importance of biocontrol for maize production globally. We compiled information from 70 experts from 28 different countries using an online survey. Of those surveyed, 91% of experts agreed that biocontrol was important for maize production regardless the type of maize they study, the final harvest destination or crop use, or management regime. Using the information obtained, we identify several opportunities for engaging with farmers in order to use biocontrol as a tool toward agricultural sustainability.",

We argue that a combination of these two approaches makes polyculture design tools more robust. We assessed quantity, quality, and complementarity of information from multiple sources for designing diversified cropping systems with vegetables and spice crops for cold temperate climate. Trait and observational data were integrated from: (i) two grower-oriented and one academic crop database, (ii) a survey of farmers practicing community-supported agriculture, and (iii) a systematic literature review on the use of spice crops in vegetable farming. Survey results reveal that the farmers were capable of achieving medium to good levels of their main goals, but failed to reach desired multifunctionality with their polycultures, which can be potentially improved with computational tools. None of the analyzed data sources provided a comprehensive dataset for all target crops and functional traits. However, source combination allowed for design from known crop companions (farmers survey and grower-oriented databases), to addressing specific pest problems (literature review), and increasing functional complementarity and facilitation by trait matching (academic and grower-oriented trait databases). Integrating information from different sources increased the number of crop combination options but also planning and management complexity.",

This realization drives our choices of learning strategies and activities that will prepare students for complexity and uncertainty. Our quest for a just, sustainable, and nutritious food system adequate to equitably serve everyone on the planet today and into the future is an enormous challenge. An undertaking of this magnitude will be met only with major adjustments informed by thoughtful teaching and practicing problem solving skills through a new educational lens. The principles of agroecology help us focus this lens on the wicked problems of today and the future, and prepare students for navigating uncharted territory. The dimensions of such education are broad, transdisciplinary, and long term.

However, at a policy level, alternative conceptualizations of agroecology have emerged that emphasize on-farm efficiency gains but lack broader objectives of agroecosystem and food system transformation. This phenomenological inquiry explores the agroecological narrative among Scottish farmers and considers its impacts on agroecosystem and food system change. Interviews were conducted across 15 farms in Scotland (20 participants) following the trans positional cognition approach (TPCA). Actualizations of agroecology were found to be value-driven approaches to developing individualized, lower-input farming systems. All farms were attempting to influence agroecosystem change through the application of ecological principles, and most (11/15) were contributing to food system change directly through involvement in alternative food networks. Smaller-scale farmers appear to deliver the most authentic actualizations of transformative agroecology but emphasized more strongly their financial challenges. A key recommendation for policymakers is to strengthen the support mechanisms available for small-scale ecological agriculture.",

The researched network is located in the municipality of San Cristóbal de Las Casas, in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, and has been using participatory certification for over 12 years. We analyzed published bibliographies about the network and documents generated by the Network, in addition to conducting observations and interviews. The experience of \"Comida sana y cercana\" shows that participatory certification is a methodology capable of intersecting the five levels of agroecological transition, from technical issues to social organization and the solidarity economy. The participatory certification is an instrument for the territorialization of agroecology, as it brings farmers closer to agroecological principles.",

Due to the scarce attention paid to NUS by agronomic sciences, little is known about their biotic pollination, although it is a well-studied aspect for commercially important plants. We evaluate the contribution of animal pollination to NUS managed by Patagonian FFS. We present a literature review of the NUS used and aspects related to their pollination and floral visitors, for which 725 papers were reviewed. FFS use 426 NUS (414 angiosperms, 10 gymnosperms and 2 ferns). Most NUS (86.7%) depend to some extent on animal pollination, either for the production of fruits or seeds that are harvested for consumption (direct dependence, 35%) or for obtaining seeds (indirect dependence, 65%), which in many cases are necessary for reseeding. Gathering and cultivation are the most common management practices for these species. Hymenoptera and Diptera are the animals that contribute most to NUS biotic pollination. Our results show that animal pollination is a key contribution of nature to sustain cultural aspects and food sovereignty of FFS in Patagonia.",

The study is a) a literature scan and farmer survey to determine inventory of wool produced but not marketed in Atlantic Canada; b) an evaluation of sustainability of sheep’s wool insulation products currently marketed globally; and c) an exploration of potential scenarios for manufacturing sheep’s wool insulation. It indicates some potential for adding value to wool, for more profitable sheep farming, but further research is needed on the economic, environmental, and social benefits in a wide range of rural contexts in order to ensure sustainability over the long term.",

Yields of winter wheat, sugar beet, and maize were higher in rotation with perennial legumes/grasses than without these diverse crops. Adding mineral NPK to farmyard manure increased yields in rotation without perennial legumes and grasses. There was no difference between intensive and minimum soil tillage. Increased nutrient cycling by integrating crop/animal enterprises contributes to greater self-sufficiency in nutrients, providing more resiliency in time of climate changes and economic uncertainty.",

But lack of planting material (seed) at the onset of the rains is a major constraint. This study examined smallholder strategies for sweetpotato seed conservation and multiplication, their agroclimatic determinants, and farmers' perceived drought risk at four sites (Dilla, Chuko, Hawassa, Sodo) in Ethiopia using informant interviews, a survey of 278 households, and agroclimatic statistics. Conservation practices were dictated by farming system and agroecological conditions. The long-term mean length of dry period when multipliers must conserve seeds ranged between 103 and 131 days across sites. Seed multipliers faced high uncertainty of rainfall onset that varied from the end of February to mid-May. Estimated probabilities of moderate and severe droughts affecting seed conservation ranged from 36–75%, and 15–58%, respectively. In drier sites, age of multiplier, land-holding size, sweetpotato production experience and access to extension were positively associated with being a vine multiplier. Knowledge of indigenous conservations strategies should inform seed system intervention design.",

We discuss how the history of these associations has led them to play a role in local politics and national policies around agriculture and highlight how these organizations have succeeded both economically and socially, while also noting the challenges they face, as observed by themselves and outsiders. While the history of women's agroecological production organizations in Ecuador may be unique, as it is entrenched in indigenous rights movements, our results also point to opportunities and obstacles that are more common across small scale farmers and deserve attention from both policymakers and agricultural organizations.",

We investigated soil management practices on 26 small-scale farms in a mountainous region, focusing on reconciling static sustainability definitions with dynamic resilience concepts. Surveying farmers revealed varied adoption rates of regenerative practices: intercropping (85%), residue retention (73%), cover crops (61%), organic amendments (46%), integrated organic/mineral amendments (46%), improved irrigation (38%), conservation tillage (30%), crop rotation (19%), and organic/biological pest/disease treatment (11%). Farms were categorized as conventional (C), neutral (N), and regenerative (R) based on practices. Qualitative assessments using seven indicators yielded scores of 4.28 (C), 6.34 (N), and 7.88 (R). Quantitative analyses showed significant differences in soil organic matter percentage (1.86 C, 2.75 N, 3.32 R), soil respiration (156 C, 296 N, 380 R), and earthworm abundance (2.92 C, 4.24 N, 5.72 R). The Soil Quality Index (SQI) indicated varying soil health from 0.05 (C) to 0.49 (R). Our findings highlight the importance of adopting synergistic, sustainable soil management practices to ensure enduring agricultural productivity and safeguard soil resilience, especially in the Mediterranean region.",

However, factors driving ABP implementation and their impact on crop production and diversity are not fully understood. Our study assessed the influence of socio-economic and environmental characteristics on ABP adoption, crop diversity, and total weight vegetable production in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina. Through interviews and a multi-model inference approach, we found that ABP implementation is tied to gardener experience and formative assets (e.g. horticultural experience, specific training). Crop diversity, integral to ABP, is affected by farming practices and farmer characteristics (Farm animals, Pollinator-friendly practices, Experience, Additional training and Environmental knowledge). The Total weight produced was primarily influenced by the type of garden, the gardener's experience and some ABPs. Long-standing commercial and community objectives and the use of farm animals and commercial seed led to greater production. Strengthening key drivers, such as farmer training, through public policies (e.g. income generation, financing, specific training, land access) can bolster the role of urban gardens in providing a healthy environment and promoting food sovereignty.",

    "abstract": "Soils are the foundation of healthy ecosystems, and promoting soil health is a primary aim of agricultural strategies intended to sequester carbon and combat climate change. In this exploratory study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis to characterize soil health messaging from 10 governmental and 10 non-governmental sources targeting Wisconsin farmers. Data were collected through internet searches, focusing on accessible web content from governmental agencies, public universities, and local offices, as well as prominent industry, nonprofit, and advocacy groups within the agricultural sector. A coding framework, developed through an iterative and inductive approach, identified six primary categories and 37 sub-categories representing key themes in soil health messaging. The study compared messaging across source types by analyzing code term frequency, highlighting differences in content emphasis between governmental and non-governmental sources. Findings indicate that governmental messaging largely advocates for conservation agriculture and associated principles but does not reference climate change nor connections between soil health and broader environmental issues. In contrast, non-governmental messaging offers a wider array of information while drawing connections among soil health, organic agriculture, ecosystem health, and climate change. The omission of climate change by governmental sources may be a significant constraint on soil health discourse and climate action.",

Using a participatory methodology with local farmers, eggs, chicken, and plantain were selected for analysis. Moisture, protein, fat, ash, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium contents were compared across the three production systems. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and MANOVA. Results indicate that agroecological products from the studied farms tended to have lower moisture content. Agroecological eggs showed higher fat content (11.09 g/100 g vs 9.32 g/100 g conventional and 8.45 g/100 g commercial). Agroecological chicken presented higher protein content (22.37 g/100 g vs 20.73 g/100 g conventional and 18.1 g/100 g commercial) and potassium (281 mg/100 g vs 298 mg/100 g conventional and 213 mg/100 g commercial). Agroecological plantain had higher ash content (0.85 g/100 g vs 0.77 g/100 g conventional and 0.79 g/100 g commercial) and calcium (8 mg/100 g vs 5 mg/100 g conventional and 6 mg/100 g commercial). These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). While these findings suggest potential nutritional benefits of agroecological production in this region, further studies with a larger number of replicates are needed to confirm these trends on a broader scale.",

In 2023, a comprehensive survey conducting 20 in-depth questions with three participants was conducted to systematically document farmers' perspectives and experiences. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through on-site observations conducted in citrus orchards and their surroundings, with at least 60 visits made throughout the year. The results revealed that R. decollata effectively controls pest snails, Eobania vermiculata and Xeropicta derbentina, reducing their populations by preying on them and their eggs. Other positive implications include reduced chemical pesticide use and lower maintenance requirements for citrus orchards. However, there are negative implications, notably ecological impacts and the risk of species extinction, particularly endemic species, and the potential damages on commercial vegetables. Consequently, this underscores the importance of a balanced approach in introducing non-native and invasive R. decollata for pest control, emphasizing the need for thorough risk assessments and ecological considerations to maintain the delicate equilibrium of ecosystems and agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "Agroecology, agency, and bottom-up governance are deemed essential for sustainable food security, yet alternative food initiatives face difficulties accessing decision-making spaces related to public policy and resources. During the pandemic, grassroots movements emerged in Spanish cities to tackle food insecurity through mutual aid, drawing inspiration from agroecological principles. How these initiatives engage with governmental actors and policies remains unexplored. The article uses semi-structured interviews and participant observations to examine two cases of Agroecology-oriented Food Redistribution Initiatives (AFRIs) in Seville and the Barcelona metropolitan areas. It aims to address three main research questions: 1) What kinds of actors and relations characterise the considered food initiatives? 2) How is sustainable food security understood and performed? 3) How do the initiatives relate with governmental actors and what problems emerge in this interaction? AFRIs emerge as assemblages uniting diverse social actors with a shared focus on food security, understanding it as the right to access sustainable, healthy food, intertwined with other basic needs and related social struggles. Sustainable practices are accompanied by the maintenance of conventional elements in the initiatives, which results in hybrid food networks. Relationships with local government institutions vary between the cases, revealing challenges and ambivalences regarding their role in supporting the provision of fresh and sustainable produce. While the study's findings indicate that scaling up agroecology does not necessarily result in conventionalization and co-optation, such efforts also come with trade-offs. Despite collaborative endeavors, initiatives like the Barcelona AFRI may find themselves in a marginal role and fall short of fundamentally transforming the prevailing food aid model on a broader scale.",

Through participatory dialogue, we identified communities of family farmers in the mountainous region of Espírito Santo, Brazil, who use and conserve creole varieties. We elucidated the characteristics of their farming systems in their different agroecosystems. The research was carried out with a strongly participatory approach and offered explanations, through participatory reflection, about the factors influencing farmers' seed-saving decisions. Pomeranian people and organic farmers, who sell directly to consumers and are highly involved in the community, were the ones who most contributed to the conservation of Creole varieties. Species with seminiferous propagation were more likely to be at risk, while those with vegetative propagation were generally better conserved. We conclude that policies aiming at community integration and agroecological and organic farming practices strongly support conservation through the active use of Creole varieties. Factors such as adverse weather conditions and an aging rural population require interventions at both global and local levels.",

This study examined the Farm Resilience Mentorship Program (FaRM) in Canada. In 2022, FaRM recruited 26 mentors across Canada and provided training in mentorship and advanced grazing systems. Through interviews, we explored 12 program mentors' adoption process and the role support networks and mentors had in their learning pathways. Our findings highlight how diverse social connections support motivations to learn and adoption and how the adoption experience and support systems inform mentor approaches to teaching and knowledge exchange. These findings have implications for how programs can support the development of mentors and enhance engagement in training programs improving sustainable production and farm resilience.",

The results show that the assessed farming systems’ multifunctionality is essential to rural livelihoods while sustaining crop and tree diversity. While dry season crop diversity drives household’s sufficiency and capacity to respond to crop failure, medium-low sufficiency of production in more than a third of the assessed systems, as well as soil degradation in cereal fields lessen adaptive capacity. For their contribution to climate resilience, diverse and perennial cropping regimes should be supported and maintained.",

    "abstract": "In Cuba, beans are part of the traditional gastronomy and livelihood of the people. During bean harvest, farmers generate high volumes of stubble, which they burn, thus adversely affecting soil health and organic matter, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. Bean harvest occurs during the dry season, a period of feed shortage for livestock, such that integrating farming and livestock production could be a way to feed and fatten sheep at little cost. We assessed the feasibility of feeding bean stubble to sheep by determining 1) volumes produced and nutritional value of stubble, 2) acceptability, performance, and carcass yields of lambs fed stubble, and 3) feasibility for this integrated farming-livestock system at local and regional levels. During harvest, 650 tons of stubble are produced in the municipality of Morón by 190 farmers, which represents a potential to feed more than 3,500 lambs, with acceptable average daily gains of 90 g per day with minimal supplementation. We thus affirm this is a viable technological practice with economic, ecological, and social implications as an acceptable alternative to burning stubble to enhance food security and livelihoods of small and medium-sized farms, while generating new employment opportunities, especially for rural women. Future studies are needed to evaluate the economic, ecological, and social impacts of this agriculture-livestock integration technology.",

    "abstract": "Nepal has 15 distinct agroecosystems spread across three major agroecozones: Tarai, Mid Hill, and High Hill. These regions support a rich variety of agrobiodiversity. This paper examines the significance of native agrobiodiversity within each of these agroecosystems for diversified food, nutrition, health, business and environment. The information presented is derived from various literature sources, discussions with key experts, and the authors' own experiences. Each of these agroecosystems has cultivated and preserved numerous unique species, landraces, and genotypes of agrobiodiversity, including crops, forages, livestock, agro-insects, agro-microorganisms, and aquatic genetic resources. This agrobiodiversity is deeply connected with local cultures, traditional knowledge, and skills. The high diversity of agricultural genetic resources (AGRs) within Nepal's relatively small area is a crucial factor for ensuring food security, nutrition, health, business opportunities, and environmental sustainability. Many niche products, prized for their purity, quality, taste, health benefits, and nutritional value, are sold at premium prices. However, the focus on production-centric agricultural programs over the years has led to the replacement of many niche-specific varieties by more uniform and limited ones. Introducing new genotypes into a particular agroecosystem may undermine the principles of ecological agriculture. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the competitiveness of native AGRs and associated indigenous technologies within each agroecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Agri-food systems are called upon to undergo profound transformation. The development of \"flow approaches\" (including lifecycle assessment, carbon footprint, ecological footprint, and metabolism methodologies) has been crucial to point to the material side of human activities. More specifically, these approaches highlight the material and energetic costs of long agri-food value-chains, intensive farming practices, high levels of geographic specialization, as well as the production of non-food commodities. In the logical progression from diagnosis to action, flow approaches are currently being used as decision-support tools. But what are the biases induced by flow approaches when it comes to supporting real-world transformations? Based on our experience and interdisciplinary background, we argue that flow approaches provide a decontextualized and narrow framing of issues related to agri-food systems, such as accumulations and transfers across space and time, inequalities and asymmetries along the chain of activities, or long-lasting environmental impacts. Some aspects are measured and emphasized, while others are difficult to observe or neglected. Flow approaches, alone, are not well suited to inform issues of environmental justice, radical transformation, and local governance. As in most cases methodological advances will not suffice to overcome the biases induced, we call for hybridizing methods and for broadening analytical perspectives.",

After 30 years of biotechnological crops, these proposals have failed on their pledges, while the risk assessment, non-considered outcomes to the environment, biodiversity and health have been overlooked. New Plant-Breeding Technologies (NPBTs), with the capacity of inserting, deleting, or modifying DNA or RNA nucleotides in specific genetic regions have emerged in the last 15 years. The most prominent technique used to edit genomes is CRISPR-Cas. Its proponents argue that mutations introduced via genome editing pose no risk to the environment and/or human health; thus, these products should be exempted from any regulation, risk assessment, traceability and labeling, a push that would actually restrict the freedom to choose of farmers and consumers. Our work summarizes the outcomes reported in the scientific literature on the use of gene editing tools in food crops. We discuss perspectives for upgrading biosafety governance of these new GMO in order to promote the autonomy of farmers, away from positivist techno-scientific fixes that downplay the systemic crises in which industrial agriculture plays a major role",

Here, we examine the relationship between farm size and the use of agroecological practices by assessing 596 management plans for farms associated with the Brazilian participatory agroecology network Rede Ecovida. In contrast to other studies, we found that the probability of using agroecological practices generally did not differ by farm size. We draw on interviews with agroecological actors to contextualize these findings and characterize the relationship between farm size and agroecology, both as a set of practices and a social movement. We suggest that, in this case, the lack of a relationship between farm size and agroecological practices might be explained by Rede Ecovida's role as a \"social carrier\" that advances agroecological principles and practices in the pursuit of territorial, or actual, autonomy. This study highlights the importance of the socio-organizational dimensions of agroecological transitions and suggests that increased support should be directed to social networks and participatory certification models to encourage scaling agroecology across diverse farm types and sizes.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) face increasing challenges from pests and climate change, among other issues. In response to these challenges, international agricultural research for development (R4D) investment is often focused on developing and scaling up techniques and technologies that bolster resilience. However, such approaches are often technocentric and follow linear assumptions of innovation diffusion and adoption, which overlook the complex realities that influence smallholder farmers' dynamic decisions and engagement with novel techniques. This study used qualitative ethnographic methods to explore the experiences, knowledge construction, motivations, and decision-making of farmers in Western Kenya regarding the extensively researched push-pull technology (PPT). Findings reveal that motives for practicing PPT evolve as farmers respond to emerging realities. Farmers' practices were motivated by factors such as food culture, resource availability, market demand, social networks, and risk management. Farmers often modify and adapt PPT components rather than simply adopting the practice as taught or shown. Contextual factors such as health, livestock ownership, land tenure, access to information and inputs, cost/benefit trade-offs, and social dynamics interact in complex ways. Ultimately, innovation unfolds as a dynamic process requiring inclusive participation, flexibility for local adaptation, and long-term collaboration with farmers as partners in finding solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recycling agricultural residues to obtain production factors directly in the farm could be crucial to improve sustainability. The aim of this study was to use plant residues to produce both organic amendments (on-farm compost) and plant biostimulants (liquid extracts). They were applied on a 2-year organic fennel crop, both alone (compost on-farm – OC) and combined (compost on-farm plus parsley extract – OCex) and compared with two commercial organic fertilizers (of vegetal origin – ORG-V; and of animal origin – ORG-A) and an unfertilized control, alone (NF) and combined with the extract (NFex). On average, the agronomic performance of compost treatments was higher than the unfertilized control and comparable to ORG-V. The use of the plant extract induced a synergistic effect with the on-farm compost, likely due to the P, K, Ca, Fe, and Mg supplementation by the extract to fennel crop. This is a relevant result, particularly in the perspective of widening the number of fertilizers produced inside the farm in organic farming, thus avoiding both synthetic fertilizers and commercial organic fertilizers. Finally, on-farm compost use reduced GWP emissions, since an average value of −12.44%, compared to the commercial fertilized treatments, was found, thus suggesting environmental sustainability.",

This analysis aims to expand the debate studying the different perspectives on the relationship food security/sustainability of the European Union and the African Union through the framing of the documents produced by these institutions since 2007. The results show differences in the approach about this relationship seen by the European Union as a long-term goal that looks at the protection of the environment and natural resources while the production changes to be more resilient to external shocks and market fluctuations. Meanwhile, the African Union uses a short-term approach due to the urgency felt by the continental unique environment that makes production development and adapting a priority over environmental issues. These differences need to be targeted to avoid current and future divergences that could impact on the application of the aforementioned standards and to ensure food for all without compromising the future of our ecosystems.",

After tabulating the data, they were exported to the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software platform version 20, and analysis of variance was performed using the F-test to compare the means of each set of questions. The proportions of responses were compared using the chi-square test and Fisher's test at a probability level of 5%. Based on the knowledge of the rural extension workers, it was confirmed that most rural extension workers understand the importance of social technologies, and the vast majority participate in activities related to social technologies.

    "abstract": "Sustainable practices are key factors in the advancement of environmental protection in agroecosystems, especially if these systems are situated in degraded and vulnerable areas, such as semiarid regions. One sustainable practice developed primarily in tropical farms is the use of a multi-cropping system. This system was applied using participatory approaches by family farmers from a semiarid region of Brazil and evaluated based on the perception and monitoring of the farmers, particularly the soil moisture enhancement in their productive areas. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of management practices on soil moisture in multi-cropping areas using an alternative method, based on the standard method, developed and applied by farmers in the field. In addition, the soil moisture alterations in multi-cropping systems were evaluated considering the water retention curve and the soil moisture monitoring in situ. We concluded that conservative practices in multi-cropping systems do contribute to water conservation. Furthermore, the establishment of a methodology to evaluate multi-cropping systems directly in the field by farmers is an important strategy to show to the farmers’ results that confirm the importance of the practices developed by them to maintain good production and general benefits to the environment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe study aims to ascertain farmers’ practices, challenges faced, and suggestions for scaling up crop diversification and sustainable agriculture in Punjab, India’s Granary. The results highlight that both organic and conventional farmers are grappling with similar challenges. However, a higher proportion of organic farmers cited difficulty in marketing, high labor requirement, low yield and low income as major challenges. Farmers offered several suggestions for scaling up production, resource access, and marketing facilitation. Valuable insights are offered into how ingenious low-cost solutions can alleviate resource-constrained conditions and state policymaking geared to create an enabling environment while engaging with farmers and stakeholders.KEYWORDS: Practiceschallengessolutionsorganic farmingIndia AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge the support and advice from numerous stakeholders, especially the respondent farmers. The consistent perseverance and efforts of our talented research team, including the project junior research fellow Maitri Sharma and interns Malika Kukreja and Sheena Chadha, are highly appreciated.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a “minimum price” for any crop the government considers remunerative for farmers and hence deserving of “support.” Currently, the MSP is fixed for 23 farm commodities. The procurement of paddy and wheat from farmers at MSP remains intrinsic to the state’s agricultural policy. Over the last four decades, one of the lowest increases in MSP has been for wheat and cotton, at a compounded rate of 6.63% and 6.45%, respectively. Surprisingly, the MSP for rice (common), which the farmers in Punjab have favored, stood at Rs. 1,940 per quintal in the marketing season 2021–22, an increase of 7.36% compounded annually from Rs. 74 in 1975–76. In their maiden policy to promote crop diversification and save groundwater, the newly elected first-time government in Punjab announced procuring green gram on MSP during 2022–23. Paradoxically, the State nodal agency could purchase less than 12% of stocks on MSP leading to a distress sale by farmers to private traders (https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/minimum-support-price-msp-farmers-explained-6706253, accessed Oct 3 2021). Thus, MSPs are rarely effective except for wheat and rice.2. A distinction needs to be drawn between organic and natural farming. Organic farming applies inputs from the market, which natural farming abstains from this, i.e., use at the farm or village level (Dorin Citation2022).3. The Public Distribution System (PDS) evolved as a system of managing scarcity by distributing food grains at affordable prices. Over the years, PDS has become an important part of the Government’s policy for the management of the food economy in the country (https://dfpd.gov.in/pd-Introduction.htm, accessed Oct 3 2021).4. Studies focusing on determining farmers’ experiences in adopting organic farming practices in Punjab include Kaur and Kalra (Citation2010), Singh (Citation2010), Kalra et al. (Citation2012), Tomar (Citation2019), Kaur (Citation2020), and Singh (Citation2020) Data for other more holistic farming systems, like natural farming, are missing as the offtake is negligible.5. The Participatory Guarantee System of India (PGS-India) is a quality assurance initiative that emphasizes the participation of stakeholders and operates outside the frame of third-party certification. (https://pgsindia-ncof.gov.in/pgs-india, accessed Jan 25 2021).6. The National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP), launched in 2001, laid the foundation for the systematic development of the organic agriculture sector in India (https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/organic/data.htm, accessed Jan 4 2021).7. A workshop on “Survey Field Work and Data Collection” was held on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021, for the facilitators by an expert agronomist from the School of Organic Farming, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.8. Consultations were held with multiple stakeholders, including Krishi Vigyan Kendras at S.A.S. Nagar (Mohali) and Patiala, Nabha Foundation at Patiala, Baba Nanak Trust at S.A.S. Nagar, Khaalis Collective at S.A.S. Nagar, and Arms2Farms Technosolutions Pvt Ltd. at S.A.S. Nagar, for identification of best sustainable practices adopted. Thus, eight sustainable practice categories were identified, namely, agrobiodiversity and landscape management, soil health and nutrient management, water management, cropping management, weed, pest and disease management, waste and energy management, post-harvest management, and work integrity, health, and safety management.Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund, U.K., under Grant No. BB/P027970/1.",

It addresses the need to comprehend how grassroots initiatives contribute to social change and the massification of agroecology in Mexico. Analysis was done using PCA and social network analysis from 167 surveys. Results show that grassroots initiatives impact 18 indigenous groups in the center and south of Mexico, and focus on eco-friendly production, social justice, popular education, and food markets. Initiatives started because of three tipping points that responded to neoliberal policies, relocating local food and massifying agroecology. There are 13 types of stakeholders that promote agroecology and influence grassroots initiatives.KEYWORDS: Agroecologygrassroots initiativesMexicotypologysocial network Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Humanidades Ciencia y Tecnología [12031014].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe term agroecology has undergone broad diversification since it was first conceived as the study of the ecology of agricultural systems. In addition to the \"tripartite\" definition, which includes science, practice, and social movement, political and \"emancipatory\" agroecologies, among others, are included. There is no consensus on the meaning of \"agroecology\" and \"agroecological,\" nor the objectives and uses associated with those concepts. Thus, despite the concept of \"agroecology\" not being consolidated nor unisemic, its meaning and application continue to diversify according to the interests and perspectives of the users. That diversification encompasses different ways of looking at agriculture's role in human societies and the environment in which they are based and function. Agroecology, too, has been seen as an activity whose objectives include issues as diverse as mythical, ceremonial, dogmatic, political, or religious. Moreover, this unrestricted diversification also devalues and trivializes the term and hinders the mutual understanding among academics, practitioners, promoters, decision-makers, the public, and government agencies. We begin a series of reflections on the various agroecologies in Mexico that we hope will promote the formation of clear, well-defined, and documented concepts to contribute to synergies among agroecologies and the advancement of their objectives.KEYWORDS: Conceptual confusionconceptual diversificationsustainable agriculturescientific agroecologytechnological agroecology AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Instituto de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas y Sustentabilidad-UNAM under Grants IIESPO-FJEG; IIESPO-EBM.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1.

    "abstract": "To emerge as a dominant socio-technological regime, agroecological transitions require supportive public policies and collective agroecological actions, with refinement in scientific/technological practices, cultures, markets, and user preferences. Using a multi-level perspective approach, this study inquires why the proper positioning of these determinants is substantial in transforming niche innovations in agroecology into a dominant regime by replacing vicious cycles associated with enriching agribusiness with virtuous cycles that support regional ecologies and communities. The models of agroecological transition during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods in Kerala and how the political agroecological position during the latter period succeeded in enabling a transition were examined. Owing to the landscape turbulence caused by COVID-19, the Government of Kerala triggered the de/realignment of determinants toward agroecological transition through programs, strategies, and nudges using a bottom-up approach under the \"Subhiksha Keralam\" (Self Sufficient Kerala) project. At the agroecosystem level, Characteristics of Agroecological Transition was used to quantify the magnitude of transition, the results demonstrating an improvement in farms during the COVID-19 period. The majority of homestead farms were characterized as agroecological, either in transition or advanced. Agroecological transition became possible because the government systematically targeted user preferences and societal values, along with modifying policy and technology, through nudges, thereby preventing possible lock-ins.",

For amplification, field visits and informal interviews were carried out with agroecological farmers. The results reveal a clear distinction between agroecological farmers, from those in transition, and those following conventional. Agroecological practices are not only determined by the perceived risks associated with the use of fertilizers and pesticides by the producers. Agroecological farmers show potential to amplify agroecology. Finally, this study shows that transition and amplification can be evaluated as different processes.",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurship in grain infrastructure has emerged in the development of new wheat supply chains from farm to market to support alternative agriculture and food systems. This includes the establishment of flour mills with the ability to preserve the identity of small batches of flour, mediate flour quality and safety, and retain processing and value within rural communities. Yet new decentralized flour mills may lack adequate space and environmental controls and refrain from pesticide treatments necessary for long-term grain storage and aging prior to milling. The relationship between grain aging and whole wheat bread baking quality under informal storage conditions was evaluated using factor and multiple regression analyses. The results indicated that aging correlates positively with whole wheat bread baking quality over 1 year of storage. Growing location, growing year and their interaction, however, were better predictors of quality. These results suggest when storage space and environmental controls are limited, blending grain by growing location could be a more effective and practical method to improve quality than grain aging or blending by growing year, which both necessitate long-term storage. Blending by location may strain definitions of regional or local in some alternative systems.",

Within this context, this article emphasizes the importance of the participatory development of technology and presents an index for the participatory prototype and agricultural tool appraisal (PTA index v1.0) and its application for the evaluation of the bajachonta, a technological model for the harvesting of bunches of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth.) in Colombia. It can be concluded that the proposed index is a simple, flexible and useful method to evaluate the potential scaling of prototypes of agricultural tools in a participatory manner, as well as to orient the design process and/or help in technology selection.",

    "abstract": "The Industrial Revolution led to replacing peasant mass selection by individual selection. In 1836 John Le Couteur on the suggestion of the Spanish botanist Mariano LaGasca codified the isolation method, empirically practiced since the early 19th century. It consists in replacing varieties or populations by “copies” of a better plant – by a (quasi) clone. It requires plants that “breed true to type,” namely that are individually reproducible as is the case for small grain cereals. It exploits the natural variation of populations. George Shull’s “hybrid corn” extended the isolation method to maize thus exploiting the natural variation of maize population but took great care to hide it behind genetic considerations on the exploitation of the elusive heterosis. To anyone focusing on what breeders do, this sleight of hand would have been clear as early as January 1909, when Shull detailed the breeder’s task: building a random sample population of individually reproducible plants (reproducible by the breeder and only the breeder) by “making all possible crosses among different pure strains” obtained by “as many self-fertilization as practicable.” Although only a marginal and unique genetic yield increase could be expected from such an extravagant proposal, it solved the overdominant problems of an industrial agriculture, crop uniformity and breeders’ property rights. Shull was clear about his goals, but these crucial aspects were ignored while all attention went to the non-existent yield increase of the exploitation of heterosis.",

First is how ecoservices are currently designed and implemented primarily for human benefit without concern for how these impact other species. We conclude that awareness of this imbalance is the first step toward meaningful change. Second we observe that human exceptionalism guides most decisions, and ask whether we can overcome this mind-set to embrace ecoregeneration and design of resilient and mutually beneficial agroecosystems. Our attitude toward the challenge and moving toward greater humility about human roles that guide management decisions in the ecosystem is a requisite for change. Third we conclude that a broad focus on One Health could be employed in designing more resilient and reciprocal agroecosystems and guiding our actions toward creating future systems that will meet the needs of humans and other species in the ecosystem. Changes in our awareness of beneficiaries that embrace a more inclusive outlook, in our attitudes toward other species, and in our responsible actions that will enhance an entire host of biological players in the agroecosystem will be essential for mutual survival.",

In Zuni dryland agriculture, fields on alluvial fans and other valley-edge landforms are managed to receive supplemental water and nutrients by retaining storm runoff and associated sediment and organic material transported from adjoining uplands. An experiment with Zuni blue maize (Zea mays L.) and commercial hybrid maize was conducted in two Zuni fields to study traditional maize and its productivity as part of a larger study of Zuni agroecosystems. Following a closely related paper on maize growth and productivity, studies of maize nutrient composition and quality are presented here. More nutrient differences occurred between Zuni and hybrid maize than between runoff and other treatments. Zuni grain had higher concentrations of more nutrients than hybrid maize, and for several elements, there was an inverse pattern in grain vs. leaf nutrient concentration between cultivars. Zuni grain had a higher N (protein) concentration than hybrid maize, and a higher proportion of N in grain vs. leaf, indicating an ability to partition more N and other nutrients into grain. Parallel differences in maize and soil N and P were found between the two fields, though the cultivars had different P content patterns. Overall, agronomically sufficient concentrations of most nutrients were present across cultivars and treatments. Long-term production and nutrient management of maize grown without conventional irrigation or fertilization reflect a traditional agroecosystem that incorporates sustainable practices intended to maintain productivity with conservation of soil and water resources.",
