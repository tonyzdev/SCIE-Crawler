    "abstract": "Temperature distribution which occurs in pavement and bridge slabs heated for de-icing and snow melting during cold periods is determined by using vertical ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems with U-tube ground heat exchanger (GHE). The bridge and pavement models (slabs) for de-icing and snow melting were constructed. A three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) was developed to simulate temperature distribution of bridge slab (BS) and pavement slab (PS). The temperature distribution simulations of PS and BS were conducted numerically by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program named ‘Fluent’. Congruence between the simulations and experimental data was determined.",

    "abstract": "Several natural coagulants have been studied for use in water treatment. The seed of Moringa oleifera Lam, for example, is a natural coagulant whose extract has been mentioned as effective not only for removing color, turbidity, and compounds with absorption at UV-254 nm, but also for significantly reducing the amount of sludge and bacteria in wastewaters. Therefore, the present study (1) evaluated the molecular weight of the extract of Moringa oleifera seed utilizing electrophoresis, and (2) compared the efficiency of different extracts obtained, using solutions of NaCl (0.01 M, 0.1 M and 1 M), distilled water, and Moringa oleifera Lam seed, acting as a natural coagulant in order to obtain drinking water. The tests were performed in Jar Test, and the effectiveness of the process was assessed regarding the removal of color, turbidity and UV-254 nm. It was observed that the molecular weight found in this study is consistent with literature data. Moreover, the highest removal efficiency of color, turbidity, and UV-254 nm occurred with 1M NaCl solution, with coagulant concentration between 100 and 300 mg L-1. The results obtained evidenced that the seed of Moringa oleifera Lam is a great alternative for use as a coagulant in drinking water treatment systems.",

Bates and Watts (1980) quantified model nonlinearity using the geometric concept of curvature. Here we aimed to evaluate the three most common parameterizations of the Logistic and Gompertz nonlinear models with a focus on their nonlinearity and how this might affect inferences, and to establish relations between the parameters under the various expressions of the models. All parameterizations were adjusted to the growth data from pequi fruit. The intrinsic and parametric curvature described by Bates and Watts were calculated for each parameter. The choice of parameterization affects the nonlinearity measures, thus influencing the reliability and inferences about the estimated parameters. The most used methodologies presented the highest distance from linearity, showing the importance of analyzing these measures in any growth curve study. We propose that the parameterization in which the estimate of B is the abscissa of the inflection point should be used because of the lower deviations from linearity and direct biological interpretation for all parameters.",

The fruit's bioactive compounds at two stages of maturity, start and end of maturity, are evaluated, with differentiating colors between green-yellow and orange for two sizes of the fruit. The ratio between sugars and acids increased from the beginning to the end of maturity. Quercetin was not found in the samples. Nevertheless, rutin was predominant in small and large size mature sample, followed by greenish yellow (start of maturity) color of the small size fruit, with values ranging between 6.904 and 6.761 mg g-1 and 5.891 to 4.465 mg g-1, respectively. Myricetin rates ranged between 1.085 and 1.170 mg g-1 and 1.110 to 1.309 mg g-1 for greenish yellow and orange fruits, respectively. These results characterize the fruit of Physalis peruviana L. as a source of phenolic compounds in food. Antioxidant activity, influenced by the different stages of fruit ripening, is correlated to a higher content of the flavonols rutin and myricetin. Maturity degree and fruit size affect the fruit's chemical characteristics.",

In this sense, from the DigCompEdu CheckIn self-assessment questionnaire, validated for the Portuguese population by Dias-Trindade, Moreira, and Nunes (2019), the research presented in this paper aims to identify the most fragile and robust areas of digital skills of primary and secondary education (ISCED) perceived by teachers in Portugal. The quantitative methodological approach emphasizes teachers' perception of their digital skills in three dimensions: teachers’ professional competences, teachers’ pedagogical competences and students' competences and involved 434 teachers from mainland Portugal and the Autonomous Regions. The results allow us to conclude that teachers have an overall moderate level of digital proficiency – level B1 - Integrators – and the dimensions pedagogical competences and students’ competences are those where teachers have more weaknesses than in other levels. From a panorama observed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to understand their needs regarding work that involves digital technologies at different moments in the teaching activity. The results thus, show the need for teachers to increase their level of digital competence through specific training and the importance of developing public policies that prepare teachers for a more digital school.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that refers to the connection between everyday elements and the Internet, in a way that common daily activities can be automated and simplified. The addition of it to our daily routine allows ordinary actions to become more efficient. Furthermore, the use of Internet connection as a way of communicating enables live display at any place, which adds up advantages. Also in everyday life, temperature control becomes more and more necessary in many different environments, such as industrial, commercial, or residential. Thus, control processes need to accompany the evolution of internet connectivity in many fields, throughout applications that can be used in mobile devices alongside these processes. This paper proposes temperature monitoring of an environment, via wireless communication and with live interface display on a web page or a mobile application developed in MIT App Inventor (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). While implementing commands via hardware and software a procedure to lower room temperature was applied through a ventilation system. The data are collected through a DHT11 temperature sensor, and the wireless communication is through a Node MCU Wi-Fi module, alongside the development board Arduino UNO. It was possible to condition the cooler to work accordingly with a preset temperature range by using its IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Thereby, this project is a low-cost solution in low scale and advantageous alternative to temperature control while implementing the concept of IoT.",

    "abstract": "Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) face challenges in achieving sufficient control dimensions from decoding movements of left and right limb. To address this limitation, the motor imagery (MI) of fine movements from the same arm or leg can provide natural control of external equipment and increase the available control dimensions in a BCI system. However, conventional feature extraction and machine learning techniques have shown limited potential in detecting variations in EEG signals during the imagination of movements involving unilateral limb joints. In this study, we analyse the classification of movements specific to a single limb by utilizing EEGNet. We investigate the performance of EEGNet in classifying three different states: right-hand MI, right-elbow MI, and the rest state EEG signal. Our findings demonstrate that EEGNet achieves mean classification accuracy of 71.24% for the three-class classification task. The lowest accuracy observed was 58.89%, while the highest classification accuracy reached 84.44%. The results indicate that EEGNet has the potential to effectively differentiate MI signals of joints located on the same limb, offering promising avenues for intuitive control of external equipment in BCI applications. By surpassing the limitations of conventional techniques, EEGNet opens up new possibilities for improving control dimensions and enhancing the functionality of BCI systems.",

Within the scope of the study, two energy recovery applications were made. Instead of the heat needed in the aging furnace, the waste heat in the solution furnace was recovered and used, in the other application, the waste heat was used to pre-heat the burner supply air. Thus, the results of deactivating the burner system to be used for the heating process in the aging section, as well as the savings achieved by this method and the reduction in unit product cost, were evaluated. Thanks to the savings made to reach the zero-carbon footprint target, the carbon footprint has been reduced. By using the waste heat in the aging furnace, 762.659 MJ hour-1 of energy was saved, and the return on investment was 482.8%. The amount of savings achieved by preheating the burner supply air was determined as 641.022 MJ hour-1. The return-on-investment value was realized as 1116.1%. Thanks to the natural gas savings, 538 tons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions are prevented every year.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical harvesting can be considered an important factor to reduce the costs in coffee production and to improve the quality of the final product. Coffee harvesting machinery uses mechanical vibrations to accomplish the harvesting. Therefore, the determination of the natural frequencies of the fruit-stem systems is an essential dynamic parameter for the development of mechanized harvesting system by mechanical vibrations. The objective of this study was to develop a three-dimensional finite element model to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the coffee fruit-stem systems, considering different fruit ripeness. Moreover, it was carried out a theoretical study, using the finite element three-dimensional model, based on the linear theory of elasticity, for determining the generated stress in a coffee fruit-stem system, during the harvesting process by mechanical vibration. The results showed that natural frequencies decrease as the ripeness condition of the fruit increases. Counter-phase mode shape can provide better detachment efficiency considering the stress generation on coffee fruit-stem system during the harvesting by mechanical vibrations and presented a difference greater than 40 Hz between the natural frequencies of the green and ripe fruit.",

    "abstract": "Medical image analysis is a significant burden for doctors, therefore, it is used to supplement image processing. Many medical images are assumed to be diagnosed as accurately as healthcare experts when the precision of image detection and recognition in an image processing approach matches that of a human being. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based predictive modelling is an important component of many healthcare solutions. This paper develops and implements a neural network-based method for skin cancer prediction to expose the neural network's strength in this field. This method determines which form of deep learning is best for diagnosing diseases with an accuracy exceeds human ability in terms of speed and accuracy, and determines the optimum number of layers and neurons in each layer for both Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) to obtain the best possible precision. The results of the proposed method showed impressive results, especially for CNN. There is a clear superiority of CNN over DNN. The CNN (which relies on convolution filters) provides great results in extracting features due to the focus on the intended area of the image without the surrounding area region of interest. This led to a remarkable decrease in the number of parameters and the speed of attaining results with higher accuracy. The results indicated that CNN has a high accuracy rate compared with the other existing methods where the accuracy rate of CNN is 98.5%.",

For the deterministic method, the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method has been selected and for the stochastic method, the Monte Carlo integration has been selected. For each case, the number of variables will be adjusted to observe the effect on error. For the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method the permutations increased with the inaccuracy of 9% when the number of nodes increased to 3 but was reduced by 90% and later on the error depicted a drop as the number of nodes raised further. For the stochastic method, that was chosen from large sample size, the inaccuracy was found to be inversely proportional to the sample size. This concluded that the monte-carlo approach was not affected by the impact of dimensionality moreover, deterministic method also seemed to overcome the dimensionality constraint.",

In petrochemical plants, furnaces are essential equipments for process operation and due to energy costs, adequate operation and control are of extreme importance for process economics. The search for new and more efficient control laws led to the development of fractional PID control algorithm, which is based on the use of fractional differential equations. In this work, a previously identified mathematical model of an actual industrial furnace is used for fractional PID control studies. Feedback loop in servo control was analyzed, focusing on the study of the influence of the controller parameters over control loop performance. Particularly, P, fractional PI and fractional PD controller were considered in this study. Simulations were carried out showing that the fractional controllers were able to perform set-point transitions. The control loop performance was evaluated by ITAE and ISE criteria, showing that, in this study, fractional PI is the best algorithm.",

The nut showed a high lipid content (48.5%), while the shell showed a low content (1.2%), although both parts of the plant had similar fatty acid composition. Low contents of saturated fatty acids were found in both parts, indicating anti-atherogenic, anti-thrombogenic and hypercholesterolemic effects. The content of n-3 fatty acids (438.7 mg g-1 of total lipids) found in the nut corroborates with the literature, while the content found in shell (329.4 mg g-1) is not previously described. The total tocopherol content was higher than other oilseeds. The great amount of α-tocopherol present in the shell is highlighted since this is considered primarily responsible for the metabolic activity of vitamin E. Dietary Reference Intakes proved that both parts of Sacha inchi have a good nutritional supply. The use of multivariate analysis allowed nuts and shells to be distinguished and their constituents to be checked. The incorporation of Sacha inchi in the human diet is promising due to its intrinsic characteristics, as well as the use of the shell in food processing.",

The vinasse concentration by the coagulation/flocculation process favored the use of the thickened sludge either for fertilizing purposes or for biogas production. The photocatalysis treatment of the clarified vinasse mineralized pollutants and reduced toxicity, with subsequent water reuse. The first series of coagulation/flocculation experiments were carried out in a jar-test apparatus at room temperature with samples of 200 mL and several coagulant concentrations. In the second series of experiments, photocatalysis tests were performed on the clarified vinasse obtained by coagulation/flocculation under conditions optimized in the first series of experiments. The photocatalysis tests were performed for five consecutive days with UV irradiation, using TiO2-P25 as photocatalyst. Significant reduction of toxicity, consistent with the reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD), was found when the photocatalysis treatment subsequent to coagulation/flocculation process was employed. Further, 98% reduction of turbidity and 87% reduction of color were obtained by the coagulation/flocculation process. Coupled to the photocatalysis process, significant reductions in absorbance, toxicity and COD (80%) were also achieved.",

In the case of adsorption isotherms, Langmuir´s model had the best adjustment for biosorption and indicated adsorption in monolayers. A strong interaction of metals with the surface of the adsorbent was indicated due to low elution rates. Thermodynamic parameters showed that the biosorption process was spontaneous and endothermal.

    "abstract": "Current research evaluates the efficaciousness of pine (Pinus elliottii) bark as adsorbent of the toxic heavy metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr) from aqueous solutions, at two pH conditions: 5.0 and 7.0. Approximately 500 mg of adsorbent material and 50 mL of solution contaminated by Cd, Pb and Cr at different concentrations prepared from standard solutions of each metal were added in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks were stirred during 3h at 200 rpm at 25ºC. Further, 10 mL aliquots were then retrieved and concentration of metal Cd, Pb and Cr determined by AAS. Adsorption isotherms for each metal were consequently obtained and linearized according to Langmuir and Freundlich's mathematical models. Results show that the Pinus bark was efficacious in the removal of toxic heavy metals Cd, Pb and Cr from contaminated solutions and that the bark's adsorption capacity depended on pH solution.",

Merlot grape pomace showed different classes of bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids and stilbene with high antioxidant activity according to the DPPH (2.58 ± 0.07 mg mL‑1), autoxidation of system β-carotene/linoleic acid (70.60 ± 0.91%), ABTS (1.22 ± 0.01 mg mL-1) and FRAP (23.83 ± 0.64 µM FeSO4 g-1) assays. The extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with high values for Bacillus cereus (MIC = 12.5 mg mL-1) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 25 mg mL-1), respectively. In addition, fingerprint regions of the phenolic compounds were found by mid-infrared, supporting the results of the chromatographic analyses. Through the PCA, the antioxidant potential assays had high correlation with phenolic composition. Therefore, considering the significant concentrations of the different bioactive compounds found in Merlot grape pomace, it can be inferred that this cheap by-product can be reused by the food industry in the development of new products",

The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes for the treatment of wastewater from leather industry, investigating the reduction of COD, ammoniac nitrogen concentration and toxicity in treated wastewaters. The results showed that the kinetic of degradation by Fenton and Photo-Fenton reactions can be divided in two stages: an initial fast process, where approximately 70% of the COD reduction takes place, followed, by a slow process, where a reaction takes up to 4 hours, resulting in about 90% of COD reduction. Different mass ratios of Fé2+/H2O2 were tested and the results showed that the efficiency of the Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions increases from 65 to 90% as the concentration of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) increases. No significant difference in the ammoniac nitrogen amount reduction for the Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes was observed, either before or after coagulation. The ammonia removal was ascribed to the oxidation of nitrogen organic compounds, possibly forming N2 and nitrate ions. The toxicity biossays using Artemia salina decreased as the wastewater was degraded and increased if the hydrogen peroxide residue at the end of the reaction was high.",

During an evaluation of the parameters, it was possible to indicate that there are two main polluting sources. The first is soil exploitation extending until the river's edges, which has no gallery forests, leading to sediments and nutrients fallout into the water body, mainly during the rainy periods. The second source is the dumping of domestic sewage, pointed as responsible for the elevated levels of organic matter and coliforms.",

    "abstract": "The topographic factor of the Universal Soil Loss Equation and its revised version (R)USLE are currently calculated by Digital Elevation Models (DEM) integrated to Geographic Information Systems (GIS). However, some countries have no topographic information to calculate DEM. In this study we evaluated the use of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data for computing the (R)USLE topographic factor. Furthermore, 90 m SRTM DEM, refined 30 m SRTM DEM and DEMs 30 m and 90 m derived from official topographic maps (1:100,000 scale) were used. Using DEMs the topographic factor was calculated by USLE-2D software. The topographic factor calculated from SRTM data showed greater detail levels (especially in flat areas) than those obtained from topographic maps. The reduction of spatial resolution of DEM-SRTM provided the topographic factor’s average rate decrease. SRTM data may be employed in further studies for soil loss predictions. The methodology may be useful in Brazil for the development of soil and water conservation programs.",

In the present work, flours obtained from jabuticaba peel and okara were employed as ingredients in the development of three cereal bars formulations. The products obtained were characterized for physico-chemical parameters, microbiological quality and sensory acceptance. The bars showed high protein content (8.9 to 9.2 g 100-1 g) and fiber (7.25 to 9.05 g 100-1 g), microbiological parameters according to Brazilian legislation and high sensory acceptance. The average scores assigned by the judges in acceptance testing by hedonic scale were higher than 7 in all attributes (color, taste, texture, flavor and overall impression). The obtained results showed that cereal bar production can be a viable alternative for the technological use of jabuticaba peel and okara. The use of these ingredients can contribute to obtaining products with high nutritional quality and to the valuation of biomasses that are often regarded as agro-industrial waste.",

Several techniques are currently used in the water industry to determine the best dosage of the coagulant, such as the jar-test method, zeta potential measurements, artificial intelligence methods, comprising neural networks, fuzzy and expert systems, and the combination of the above-mentioned techniques to help operators and engineers in the water treatment process. Current paper presents an artificial neural network approach to evaluate optimum coagulant dosage for various scenarios in raw water quality, using parameters such as raw water color, raw water turbidity, clarified and filtered water turbidity and a calculated Dose Rate to provide the best performance in the filtration process. Another feature in current approach is the use of a backpropagation neural network method to estimate the best coagulant dosage simultaneously at two points of the water treatment plant. Simulation results were compared to the current dosage rate and showed that the proposed system may reduce costs of raw material in water treatment plant.",

The study presents a qualitative research based on the systematic literature review, which is tested through field research, involving companies in the medical and hospital area belonging to the same supply chain. The bullwhip effect has been observed throughout the industry for many years. Several academic studies have assigned to operating causes the reason for its occurrence. Few studies have focused behavioral causes. Through this study, it appears that affective trust (honesty, mutual understanding, credibility, respect and compliance) and trust in the competence (knowledge/technique, commitment in the relationship) are both necessary for keeping the relationship, but without affective trust, the relationship does not develop. Moreover, an organizational culture based on trust and collaboration exchange, and knowledge related to processes and technology among businesses, contributing to the joint planning and collaboration in the information sharing occurs. Thus, aspects of behavior toward partners of supply chain companies can mitigate the operational causes of the bullwhip effect by improving information and knowledge sharing, demand forecasting, replenishment policy, and reducing the risk coordination among the chain participants.",

Therefore, the adsorbent was characterized for its chemical composition, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, and pH of point of zero charge (pHPZC), thermal stability and porosimetry. Adsorption tests were conducted by using a Central Composite Design (CCD). Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models evaluated the adsorption kinetics, and sorption isotherms were linearized according to Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich. The effect of initial concentration, temperature in the process and the desorption were also analyzed. SEM results showed that the açaí adsorbents (or CA) had irregular and heterogeneous structure, and IR analysis evidenced the presence of hydroxyl, aliphatic, phenolic and carboxylic surface groups; both analyses indicate favorable adsorption characteristics. The pHPZC of the adsorbent is 4.41, 4.02 and 7.10 for CA modified with H2O2, H2SO4 and NaOH, respectively. The optimum adsorption conditions were pH 5.0, within 40 min, with 4 g L-1 as the ideal adsorbent dose. The predominance of chemisorption occurs, in mono and multilayer. The adsorption is only spontaneous for Cd2+ at 15 and 25°C. The CA has the potential to increase the removal efficiency of Cd, Pb and Cr, when chemically modified, particularly with H2O2 and H2SO4.",

Due to its characteristics and composition, tomatoes present reduced shelf life, and preservative techniques are required. In this study, response surface methodology was used to optimize process conditions during the osmotic dehydration (OD) of tomato slices, through the desirability function. Optimization factors were absolute pressure (21-89 kPa), vacuum application period (7-15 min), and osmotic solution water activity (0.893-0.943), while investigated responses were sodium incorporation (NaI), water loss (WL), solid gain (SG), weight reduction (WR), and osmodehydrated product water activity (ODaw). The optimized conditions were achieved, and a further hot-air drying (HAD) was conducted at different temperatures and air velocities. During the OD, lower absolute pressure, and osmotic solution water activity led to lower NaI and higher WL and WR. Shorter drying time and higher diffusivity were obtained at higher temperature and air velocity, during the HAD. The dried tomato slices with sodium incorporation reduction were evaluated with regard to the final water activity, rehydration and color, in which no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed between the treatments.",

In this paper, streamlines were drawn and investigated in different longitudinal profiles, cross sections, and plans. The results indicated that the secondary flow strength and size of the vortex formed at the distance of the beginning to the bend apex would increase. The core of central vortex moved away from the inner bank towards central line of the channel by 22%, and to the water surface by 20%. On the contrary, the size of the secondary vortex increased by 15%.

    "abstract": "In this study, mangaba residue (seeds) was used as a substrate for Aspergillus niger lipase production by solid-state fermentation. The partially purified enzyme was efficiently immobilized in a sol-gel matrix by covalent bonding with an immobilization yield of 91.2%. The immobilized biocatalyst and free lipase had an optimum pH of 2.0 and 5.0, respectively. However, greater stability was obtained at pH 4.0 and 7.0, respectively. The biocatalysts showed stability at the optimum temperature of 55°C, where the residual activity was above 87% after 240 min., of incubation. The lower deactivation constant (kd) and higher half-life of the immobilized biocatalyst indicated greater thermal stability than those obtained with the free enzyme. The Michaelis Constant (Km) (77 and 115 mM for free and immobilized lipase, respectively) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) (1250 and 714 U mg-1 for free and immobilized lipase, respectively) indicated that the immobilization process reduced enzyme-substrate affinity. Regarding the operational stability, the biocatalyst showed relative activity above 50% until seven cycles of reuse in olive oil hydrolysis. This novel biocatalyst obtained from a tropical fruit residue showed biochemical characteristics that support its application in future biocatalysis studies.",

We calculated transition probabilities among states, probabilities of equilibrium of states, and expected lengths of the defined states for all stations and seasons to investigate spatial/seasonal variability. Results showed that for the entire region and for all seasons, the probability of dry days is greater than the probability of rainy days; expected values of rainy spells are low, indicating that the rainfall regime in Paraíba is characterized by high rainfall intensity distributed over short rainy periods. The dry-dry transition probability presents the highest values for all seasons and stations, as well as the corresponding expected dry spell length, indicating that this region is subjected to prolonged dry periods. The transition probabilities that lead to dry condition are higher in the interior of the State, while probabilities that lead to rainy condition are higher in the coastal region as well as the probability of rainy days, which is greater in fall, during the rainy season.",

The Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) has been characterized by its difficulty of disaggregation in nature, requiring a long period for this. On the other hand, with the increase in civil construction activities the demand for raw material also increases, causing considerable environmental impacts. In this context, the objective of this research is to propose a simple methodology, preventing its dumping and accumulation in irregular areas, and reducing the demand of raw materials by the civil construction industry. The results showed that compressive strengths obtained were lower than recommended by NBR 8491 (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas [ABNT], 2012b) at seven days of curing time. However, they may be used as an alternative solution in masonry works in order to not submit themselves to great loads or structural functions. The studied bricks also presented water absorption near to recommended values by NBR 8491 (ABNT, 2012b). Manufacturing costs were also determined for this brick, comparing it with the costs of other brick types. Each brick withdrew from circulation approximately 300 g of PET waste. Thus, for an area of 1 m2 the studied bricks can promote the withdrawal of approximately 180 beverage bottles of 2 L capacity.",

This study aimed at optimizing the extraction and characterization of bioactives compounds from S. malaccense leaves. Extraction was optimized using a 23 full factorial design to evaluate the effect of ethanol concentration, time and temperature on polyphenols and antioxidants contents. Analyses of phenolic compounds content (Folin-Ciocalteau and HPLC-DAD), in vitro antioxidant capacities (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP), antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeasts of ethanolic extract was carried out in optimal conditions of extraction. The optimized extraction condition was 45 min., 80°C and 40:60 (v v-1) ethanol:water. The extract showed high total phenolic content (0.074 mg GAE kg-1), DPPH (0.666 μmol TE kg-1) and ABTS (0.853 μmol TE kg-1) free radical scavenging ability and appreciable ferric reducing power (1.267 μmol Fe2+ kg-1).

Recent research has been focusing on alternative coagulants based on natural elements, as opposed to the commonly used iron and aluminum salts, for use in water and wastewater treatment processes. In this context, a thorough literature review on alternative coagulants and their application to water treatment processes has been conducted in this work. In addition, three experiments have been conducted with a widely used natural organic coagulant (Moringa oleifera). The alternative clarification system used is the helically coiled tube flocculator (HCTF), with high turbidity removal efficiency and low processing times. A comparative analysis of the turbidity reduction over time was performed with samples collected after 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400, and 2700 s from the hydraulic circuit. The process efficiency using the proposed alternative coagulant reached 95.3% (after 1800 s). The turbidity removal efficiency remained almost constant after 1800 s, with variations below 1%. These results prove that natural alternative agents can be powerful tools in the water treatment process, with efficiency values exceeding those obtained using chemicals (e.g., aluminum sulphate) as coagulant/ flocculant agents.",

Soil texture, soil resistance to penetration, elevation and slope in an experimental area of 15.5 ha were employed as attributes to the generation of MZ, correlating them with data of soybean yield from 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 harvests. Data interpolation prior to MZs generation is important to achieve MZs as a smoother contour and for a greater reduction in data variance. The Kriging interpolator had the best performance. CVI index proved to be efficient in choosing MZs, with a less subjective decision on the best interpolator or number of MZs.",

    "abstract": "Improve quality of timber structures design is an aim that must be systematically sought by engineers in this area. An important topic that can contribute directly to be achieved in this subject is the more consistent knowledge related to structural properties of wood. Know values of longitudinal modulus of elasticity (E) and shear modulus (G) is essential for proper evaluation of plate structures performance, as example. It has been usual to adopt statistical equivalence for E and G values in plans longitudinal-radial and longitudinal-tangential, although experimental confirmation of this hypothesis is required. In this context, the aim of this work is to determine values of ELR, ELT, GLR and GLT, based on static bending tests, to five dicotyledonous species. Results showed statistical equivalence between the elastic properties in both plans, and the relation E = 35G was obtained for the five wood species here considered.",

We developed composites based on hydroxyapatite (obtained by deproteinizing bovine bone), collagen (obtained from bovine tendon) and chitosan (obtained from gladii of the squid species Loligo), that were characterized by different techniques (X-ray, FT-IR, Thermogravimetry, DSC and SEM). Three biomaterials were evaluated here: B1 (collagen/chitosan/hydroxyapatite), B2 (collagen/hydroxyapatite) B3 (collagen/hydroxyapatite). For in vitro cytotoxicity tests, two cell lines were used: HEp human larynx tumor cells (ATCC-CCL-23) and VERO cells from African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops). These toxicity tests demonstrated that the evaluated composites are not toxic. In biocompatibility tests, the results of a histological analysis showed that all three biomaterials present a low inflammatory tissue reaction. The tissue response was most favorable for sample B3, followed by B2 and B1, in that order. Based on these results, we conclude that all three biomaterials show good biocompatibility and no evidence of cytotoxicity; thus, these materials represent good candidates for tissue and graft engineering for use in bone regeneration.",

The factors and their specific levels tested were the total alkalinity of water (TA; 50 and 100 mg L-1 CaCO3) and the CH/TA ratio of water (CH/TA; 1/2, 1/1 and 5/1). In the indoor system, the 5/1 CH/TA ratio tanks had higher total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) than the 1/2 or 1/1 CH/TA ratio tanks.

Further, tests were carried out to evaluate the sorption process by kinetic, equilibrium and thermodynamic studies. The adsorbents showed a surface with favorable adsorption characteristics, with adsorption sites possibly derived from lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. The dynamic equilibrium time for adsorption was 60 min. Results followed pseudo-second-order, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich models, suggesting a chemisorption monolayer. The thermodynamic parameters suggested that the biosorption process of Cu and Zn was endothermic, spontaneous or independent according to conditions. Results showed that the studied materials were potential biosorbents in the decontamination of water contaminated by Cu(II) and Zn(II).

This system uses a natural gas-fueled 30 kW microturbine to generate electricity, and to produce hot water by recovering energy from the waste heat in the exhaust gases by using a heat exchanger, which serves as the drive source of an absorption chiller with a nominal capacity of 35 kW. In the financial analysis economic indicators such as payback, net present value and internal rate of return were used to verify the economic feasibility of this system, while in the exergoeconomic analysis, the Theory of Exergetic Cost was used to determine the exergetic monetary costs. A thermodynamic model was developed on the EES-32 (Engineering Equation Solver) platform. On applying the financial analysis, the results showed that the micro cogeneration system is feasible with positive values of R$ 206,540.00 for NPV, 27% IRR and a 6-year payback. Based on the exergoeconomic analysis, the cogeneration system is also feasible since the monetary cost of the electricity is lower than that charged by the electricity company but this is only possible after the 5th year.",

    "abstract": "Minimization of stress during the transportation of live fish is essential in maintaining the welfare and performance of the animals. In order to test the hypothesis that stress during transport of fingerlings of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) can be reduced with the aid of the anesthetics menthol, eugenol or benzocaine, we have assessed the effects of these agents at various concentrations on the physiological parameters and survival rates of fish subjected to conditions simulating those normally used in transportation. Fingerlings (N = 1200) were fasted for 24 hours and distributed in 20 L polyethylene bags (N = 50 per bag) containing 5 L of water and an anesthetic at the appropriate concentration. Fingerlings treated with menthol at 75 mg L-1, or eugenol or benzocaine at 20 mg L-1, maintained levels of plasma cortisol and glucose that were lower than those of the stressed but untreated controls and within the physiological limits of the baseline values for this species. Under these conditions, the survival rate was 100%, suggesting that stress was substantially reduced despite dense consignment. Treatments involving higher doses of the studied agents induced significant anesthetic toxicity.",

However, it accounts for a small fraction of the energy matrix of most countries. Electric energy generation by solar systems can be improved through tracking. This work aimed to develop and compare a closed and an open loop solar tracking system. The closed loop system was developed using Light Dependent Resistors. An algorithm was developed for the open loop tracker as a function of the geometric relation between the sun and the photovoltaic module. A simulation was run to compare this algorithm with a system using tracking at fixed time intervals, for clear sky conditions, with different tracking parameters and for five different latitudes. No significant difference was observed between the proposed open loop tracking algorithm and the fixed time interval algorithm for the tracking parameters evaluated. The open and closed loop solar tracking systems were compared experimentally in Rio das Ostras, Brazil (22.49 °S 41.92° W). An average gain of 28.5% was observed for the open loop tracking system over a latitude tilted system and 33.0% for the closed loop tracking system.",

The framework was proposed by means of an exhaustive literature review which identified the positive points of other Lean Six Sigma frameworks available on literature. The framework was applied to a case study, and the assessments were based on semi-structured questionnaires and analysis of records and documents. The implementation was carried out in a manufacturing company in Brazil, which belongs to an American-based multinational. In the case study described herein, the manufacturing company established the proposed framework to support the combination of lean manufacturing and six sigma and introduced an enterprise-wide culture of project through the proposed Lean Six Sigma framework, which resulted in significant benefits.",

The fermentative activity and physicochemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics of the sourdoughs and breads were evaluated. Among the breads that were prepared using different sourdoughs, that which was made from grape sourdough presented high pH (4.30) and less acidity (2.99 mL 0.1N 100 g-1). The grape sourdough was selected for research because it presented the highest fermentation volume and because it was the most preferred in the sensory analysis. The aerobic lactic acid bacteria count at 30°C was 7.52 log CFU g-1 and yeast count was 7.62 log CFU g-1. After one year of cultivation, the aerobic lactic acid bacteria increased by 1.34 logarithmic cycles at a temperature of30°C and the yeasts were reduced by 0.61 logarithmic cycles. The results of this study indicate that the use of different substrates in the preparation of sourdoughs provides breads with different sensory characteristics. Although it is an old process, the application of the spontaneous fermentation technique in bread making is still much used in view of the demand for products with the specific characteristics of this type of fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Acerola is considered a superfruit due to its high vitamin C content, but it is highly perishable. Dehydrating acerola juice using a spray dryer is a significant alternative to reduce seasonality and extend the product's shelf life. Moreover, the demand for more natural and convenient products is on the rise. In this context, this study aims to examine the impact of different temperatures (150, 170, and 190°C) on the spray drying process of 'Junko' acerola juice, supplemented with 15% w/w maltodextrin. The dehydrated juice was evaluated for pH parameters, Titratable acidity (g of malic acid 100 g-1), Soluble solids, (ºBrix), Water content (%), Total solids (%), Vitamin C (mg 100 g-1), and was reconstituted in water to evaluate color (L*, a*, b*). The resulting powdered acerola juice exhibited average vitamin C levels ranging from 11,541.22 to 11,371.35 mg 100-1. There was an increase in organic acid content and a reduction in water content to values between 5.56 and 4.81%. The average soluble solids content in the rehydrated juice was 9.6 ºBrix. Concerning the red intensity (a*) of the rehydrated juice, the temperature of 170ºC yielded a greater value. As for yellow intensity, there was a notable increase with the increase of drying temperature. These results highlight the importance of considering not only the addition of encapsulating agents, such as maltodextrin, but also the temperature during the spray dryer atomization process.",

Based upon chemical analysis, it was verified that most alcohol and vinegar production occurred with T2 and T3 treatments, probably due to the higher sugar content available to the conversion procedures carried out by microorganisms.

The equilibrium isotherms were determined using the Thermoconstanter Novasina device, with temperatures between 25 and 45&ordm;C. The moisture of the bagasse on a dry basis (d.b.) was determined by the furnace method. The drying curves and drying rate curves showed that the increase in temperature decreased drying time, due to an increase in the drying rate. In equilibrium isotherms, the increase in temperature caused an increase in equilibrium moisture content, a factor attributed to the characteristic of the material. The experimental data were adjusted to the BET, SABBAH and OSWIN models; under the studied conditions, the SABBAH model presented the best adjustment, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99.",

No significant differences were found between treatments for body length, gonad weight or gonadosomatic index, but body weight was higher in fish subjected to T3 compared with other treatments. Furthermore, significant increases in tubular lumen and germinal epithelium were observed in fish exposed to T1 and T3, respectively.

Lipase was produced by solid state fermentation of pumpkin seed flour with 30% moisture, at 30°C for 120h. The enzyme was pre-purified with ammonium sulfate and immobilized in the sol-gel matrix by covalent attachment and physical adsorption. A higher yield of immobilization (81.88%) was obtained in the latter. The free enzyme presented higher hydrolytic activity with pH 4.0, at 37°C; moreover, it was more stable with pH between 6.0 and 7.0, at 35°C. The immobilized lipase showed maximum hydrolytic activity with pH 11.0, at 50°C; it was more stable with pH 11.0, at 37°C. Parameters Km and Vmax were best determined by Hanes-Woolf linearization.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of isolated spoken digits is the core procedure for a large number of applications which rely solely on speech for data exchange, as in telephone-based services, such as dialing, airline reservation, bank transaction and price quotation. Spoken digit recognition is generally a challenging task since the signals last for a short period of time and often some digits are acoustically very similar to other digits. The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of machine learning algorithms for spoken digit recognition and disclose the free availability of a database with digits pronounced in English and Portuguese to the scientific community. Since machine learning algorithms are fully dependent on predictive attributes to build precise classifiers, we believe that the most important task for successfully recognizing spoken digits is feature extraction. In this work, we show that Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF) provide a set of highly predictive coefficients. We evaluated our classifiers in different settings by altering the sampling rate to simulate low quality channels and varying the number of coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Jaboticaba is a fruit native to Brazil. Its skin represents up to 43% of the fruit and contains high levels of fiber, minerals and phenolic compounds. The use of the skin waste adds value to the fruit. However, one of the drawbacks of skin storage is the high water content, which requires drying processes to preserve the skin without leading to the loss of nutrients and antioxidants. The influence of different drying temperatures on the levels of nutrients and antioxidants was investigated. Jaboticaba (Plinia jaboticaba (Vell.) Berg, genotype Sabará) skins were lyophilized or dried at three temperatures (30, 45, and 60ºC, using food dryers). The skins were then ground, stored (protected from light) and subjected to analysis of proximate composition, vitamin C, phytate, polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. The drying process had little effect on the proximate composition of the flour, presenting significant difference only for crude protein, fiber and non-nitrogenous extract. The greatest preservation of chemical constituents occurs in the lyophilized jaboticaba skins. Among the drying temperatures tested, however, the skins dried at 45 and60°C had more highly preserved nutritional substances and antioxidants.",

The highest and lowest average velocities found in the Amazon River were 2.27 m s-1 and 0.735 m s-1, respectively. The main contributors to the Amazon River presented average daily velocities close to 2.0 ms-1 for the flood period, but in the dry season these velocities did not exceed 0.5 m s-1.

In this context, the use of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems has been incessantly pursued to achieve productivity gains, sustainability and reduction of production costs, as well as being important in the individuals’ quality of life. Autonomous robotic systems such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) have been used on shop floor to assist the aggregation of these competitive advantages to the business. Coupled to the use of these vehicles, other technologies such as the internet, digital factory and cloud-computing have been integrated into manufacturing in direction of the so-called advanced manufacturing, or Industry 4.0. Thus, this work aims to apply the concepts of digital factory in an example of aircraft manufacturing system, to analyze the efficiency and workload of the AGVs that transport materials from the warehouse to the assembly stations. Based on a theoretical approach by discrete-event simulation method and guided by the principles of Industry 4.0, analysis related to needed amount of AGVs, cycle times, deliveries and downtime of the vehicles were performed for different situations. Thus, it searches for better results in terms of productivity and decision-making support regarding adding-value related to materials transporting and information over long distances, delays, waiting and unnecessary movement of workers, in order to obtain improvement and profits for the aircraft manufacturing system.",

The results were compared with multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) and LMR. The prediction was made using or not meteorological variables (wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity) as input data. The results showed that the inclusion of these variables could increase the general performance of the models considering one step ahead forecasting horizons.

    "abstract": "The generation of electric energy using alternative energy sources has been constantly studied by researchers owing to concerns regarding energy supply alternatives and the desire to reduce environmental impacts in its generation. This study evaluated the performance of an electricity generator operating in dual mode using biogas and biodiesel blends, which were obtained from a swine-waste biodigester and residual frying oil, respectively. The experiment was performed using blends B8, B20, B50, B80, and B100. The electrical power generated was higher in the dual mode corresponding to a load of 5.0 kW, showing differences of 18.7% for B8 and 21.7% for B100. In normal and dual modes, the B8 blend exhibited the lowest specific consumption of liquid fuel with values of 389.2 and 270.2 g kWh-1, respectively. The efficiency was higher in the normal mode, showing results of 22.0 and 24,7% using B8 and B100, respectively, compared to 17 and 20% in the dual mode corresponding to a load of 5.0 kW. These results indicate that biodiesel from residual frying oil can be used in normal mode and in combination with biogas in dual mode.",

Ongoing research and development in gesture recognition systems with broad application prospects have focused on improving accuracy and real-time performance as well as the robustness of specific machine learning algorithms against environmental conditions. This paper addresses the accuracy enhancement of a novel Fifth Dimension Technologies data-glove-based gesture recognition system using a genetic-algorithm (GA)-trained k-means++-improved radial basis function (RBF) or GK-RBF neural network. First, we analyzed and modeled the sensor distribution in the data glove and proposed joint constraints based on the finger joint angle and sensor mapping. Then, we trained the model and conducted experimental verification to demonstrate the model´s excellent real-time performance. Our results showed a training accuracy of 100%, a reduction in training error rate by 89.3%, and an accuracy rate improvement of at least 3.5% between the different static gestures, even with different operators. Specifically, the GK-RBF neural network outperforms the RBF and GA-modified models by 4.36 and 2.21 abs.%, respectively, in terms of recognition accuracy. The 99.85-% accuracy rate of 10-fold cross validation proves a high degree of compatibility with data-glove-based recognition systems.",

The proposed LNA employs SilTerra 0.13 Î¼m RF CMOS technology (April 2018 version) for its design and is developed based on the single-stage cascode topology. The performance of the design has been optimized using the source degeneration technique with gain-boosting and middle inductors. Due to the limitations of the process design kit (PDK), custom inductors have been developed for the LNA circuit. The inductors use ultra-thick metal (UTM) with a copper thickness of 3.3 Âµm. At 60 GHz, the proposed LNA has a simulated input reflection coefficient (S11) of -15.71 dB, reverse gain (S12) of -15.83 dB, forward gain (S21) of 7.25 dB, output reflection coefficient (S22) of -8.78 dB, noise figure (NF) of 6.79 dB and minimum noise figure (NFmin) of 6.55 dB. It is also unconditionally stable at 60 GHz with a simulated Rollett stability factor (K) of 1.27 and B1 stability factor of 0.79. The design shows high linearity, with a simulated input 1-dB compression point (P1dB) of -12.31 dBm and third order input intercept point (IIP3) of -3.09 dBm.

    "abstract": "Cereals possess functional and nutritional properties already consolidated in the literature; they are also an excellent source of health-promoting bioactive compounds. This work aimed to determine the best solvents to extract phenolic compounds from black oat, rye, and wheat through a simplex centroid design, using pure solvents and binary and ternary mixtures. The response variables were the total phenolic compounds (TPC) and the antioxidants (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) were quantified. For optimized extract, the phenolic compounds were identified by UHPLC. An optimization study for the recovery of antioxidant compounds from these cereals to obtain extracts with better antioxidant properties is reported. The water and acetone binary mixture extracted 18, 49, and 110% more than water and 3.2, 4.0, and 5.5 times more than TPC acetone for black oat, rye, and wheat, respectively. Chromatography identified that rye has the highest number of phenolic compounds, including vanillic acid (3008.64 Î¼g g-1), ellagic acid 352.05 Î¼g g-1, hesperetin 24.33 Î¼g g-1, and formononetin. To conclude, the binary mixture of water and acetone was the best condition to obtain a maximized extract for the analyses in the optimized proportions of solvents for the extract are as follows: 0.52/0.48 for oats, 0.46/0.54 rye and 0.33/0.67 for wheat, respectively. This study optimizes the time and improves quality in measuring antioxidants, both for cereals and derivatives, and for evaluating the potential of new products.",

    "abstract": "The durability of reinforced concrete structures can vary significantly depending on their specific application. One of the elements that has a negative impact on this durability is the corrosion of steel bars. In this context, several studies have been conducted with the aim of mitigating the incidence of this phenomenon, and such efforts include the replacement of conventional carbon steel bars with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. The primary aim of this study is to analyze the impact of concrete properties on concrete beams reinforced with GFRP concerning bending stiffness and failure mode. To achieve this analysis, numerical simulations using the finite element method were carried out using the educational version of the Abaqus software. The most significant results of this investigation indicate that varying the Î±E parameter, parameter depending on the type of aggregate used according to NBR 6118 (2014), for beams using steel as the reinforcement material is more advantageous in terms of increasing load capacity, when compared to varying the fck. However, the opposite behavior was observed in the beams using GFRP as the reinforcing material. In addition, it can be seen that the failure mode presented significant changes when the steel reinforcement is partially replaced by GFRP, due to the brittle nature inherent in the material.",

The amount of floristic species is wide and diverse, whether in shape, texture or color. The ornamental species Catharanthus roseus, considered to have a tropical climate, it has cultivars in which the color of the flowers is one of its attractive aspects, and these can vary from white to different shades of pink. Thus, the objective of this work was to use deep learning techniques to evaluate the potential of the two-stage convolutional approach called Mask R-CNN to quantify C. roseus flowers and qualify them in terms of color for application in the floriculture and landscaping sectors. 700 images were collected in gardens in the North of Minas through smartphone cameras, of which 500 had both pink and white flowering and 200 had only the leaves, to compose the background. For the composition of the synthetic image bank, 100 white flowers and 100 pink flowers were processed in png format and formed the foreground, the two being separated as two subclasses. The training using the transfer learning technique with the Mask R-CNN algorithm was carried out in Google collaborative, with commands in python language and libraries from the Github platform. Through rating quality evaluators, the Convolutional Neural Network Mask R-CNN showed overall accuracy above 90% and accuracy above 80%. The network proved to be efficient in estimating the number of flowers, in addition to detecting and segmenting them, qualifying them in terms of color.

Analytical modeling is a digital tool for determining the behavior of masonry buildings under the influence of dynamic and static loads. In the analytical modeling process, different types of elements are involved to represent buildings. Due to the complex geometrical features of historical buildings, it is significant to the preference for convenient elements. Mardin Great Mosque was discussed and analyzed for the selection of convenient element preferences. Three different mosque models were built and analyzed by using three different element types (frame, shell, solid). In the findings of the paper, the values at the same points on the models were compared. When the first natural vibration period was examined, the first model is 0.76sec, the second model is 0.76sec, and the third model is 0.71sec. In addition, considering the base shear under dead load, 98.35% similarity was observed. As a consequence of the geometrical features of historical buildings, inappropriate definitions and inconvenient element preferences emerge the results questionable. Therefore, to be able to manage the analytical modeling process effectively requires accurate and appropriate definitions of the elements to be preferred.",

    "abstract": "The earthquake triggered numerous secondary geological disasters, mainly landslides, which can have considerable impact on the environment as well as people's lives in the affected region. In this research, to obtain clear understanding of the restoration level and the evolution of landslides after an earthquake as massive as the Wenchuan earthquake, Beichuan County of Sichuan Province was considered an example, and the development characteristics and the evolution of post-earthquake landslides in the affected area were studied. Using ALOS, GF-1, and ZY-3 remote sensing images and GIS technology, the development of landslides in Beichuan County over a period of 13 years (2007–2019), comprising the period before and after the Wenchuan earthquake, was analysed. The main inducing factors of landslides before and after the disaster were discussed from many aspects. After the Wenchuan earthquake, the number and the area affected by landslides in Beichuan County drastically increased. Five years after the earthquake, there was rapid recovery in the development of landslides; however, it has not fully returned to the state before the earthquake yet. Many landslides have also occurred in medium- and high-altitude areas and medium- and high-slope areas. However, as time goes on, the high-risk areas of landslides began to migrate slowly to areas with lower altitude and gentle slope. Before the earthquake, river erosion was the main cause of landslides in the study area. After the earthquake, landslides were concentrated in the southeast and central parts of this area—places with strong earthquake intensities—which was attributed to seismogenic faults. With the recovery of landslide development, river erosion became the main contributing factor again. The findings of this research can provide insights to aid disaster prevention in the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area and the spatio-temporal evolution of landslide disaster development in earthquake-stricken areas.",

    "abstract": "During the turning process, the cutting tool heats up during use, potentially reaching temperatures above 900ºC. When these temperature levels are reached, the cutting tool loses its mechanical properties and wears out prematurely. To address this issue, a solution was found in coating the cutting tool with a thin layer of thermally insulating material. The purpose of this work was to numerically simulate the heating phenomenon in the transient regime of a tool and tool holder set while considering the presence of the coating, as well as to evaluate heat exchange by conduction. Another factor considered in this work was the presence of contact resistance between the tool and the tool holder, which, according to some studies, impacts the temperature field of the cutting tool. Some parameters related to contact resistance were taken into account to make the model closer to real situations. Simulations were carried out using the COMSOL® program to solve the transient three-dimensional heat diffusion equation using the Finite Element Method. Subsequently, the temperatures found for the uncoated cutting tool were compared to the temperatures found for the cutting tool coated with Titanium Nitride (TiN), Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3), and Titanium Carbide (TiC).",

    "abstract": "Taiwan's declining birth rate and the lack of personnel in the national army have worsened. In particular, the loss of human resources caused by the lack of career competitiveness among national army officers has been increasing daily. Effective career competitiveness not only aligns personal interests with job roles but also enhances self-confidence and increases workplace value. The professional competitiveness of military officers depends on the nurturing of the Military Academy Education System (MAES), which involves the comprehensive consideration and evaluation of individual performance such as university education (UE), sport and combat ability (SCA), and military skill (MS); it is a complex multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem. However, the current method fails to effectively consider individual attributes, which may result in cadets being assigned to unsuitable units or positions, leading them to consider retirement and thereby weakening national defense capabilities. To solve this problem, this research integrated the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and three-dimensional importance-performance analysis method to propose a novel three-dimensional TOPSIS (3D-TOPSIS) model, aimed at improving the evaluation process of cadets’ career competitiveness.

    "abstract": "Precipitation causes runoff with significant uncertainty. The rainfall-runoff modeling relationship depends on the runoff coefficient. Many models have been developed with different methods to calculate the runoff coefficient. Black box or fuzzy models can be preferred instead of deterministic methods in uncertain natural events. However, black box methods often do not consider the event's physical aspect. Therefore, in the present study, Simple Membership Functions and Fuzzy Rules Generation Technique (SMRGT) which base on fuzzy logic was preferred in determining the runoff coefficient since it also reflects the physical cause-effect relationship of the event. By this way, both the hydrological event's uncertainty and physical aspects were addressed. Therefore, it can be used for any basin when the limit values of the variables are expanded. Correctly determining fuzzy sets and fuzzy rule bases are essential points to be considered in fuzzy modeling. According to the literature, SMRGT is the best one to use for this purpose. On the other hand, SMRGT is relatively new. Meteorological, geomorphological, and land use-related characteristics were considered for modeling. The Kalecik Basin's runoff coefficient is found as 0.28 which is lesser than the average of Turkey. The model has 2.28% of MARE.",

However, there is no agreement on the inoculum dose since it depends on the contaminant concentration and other very specific parameters in each case. This study aims to evaluate the effect of Chlorella sp. inoculum doses on ethinylestradiol (EE) removal from wastewater treatment plant effluent in Celendín district of the province of Celendín, Cajamarca region, Peru. Four doses of inoculum (0, 100, 200, and 300 mL) were tested at a 2,1x106 cell?mL-1 microalgae cell concentration and 4 mg?L-1 of ethinylestradiol in photobioreactors. The final concentration of ethinylestradiol was determined after 20 days through High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). It was evidenced that a dose of 300 mL?L-1 of Chlorella sp. could remove 96,49% of ethinylestradiol from wastewater, unlike the other tested concentrations, which were below 80,92% removal. It was concluded that at a higher dose of Chlorella sp. inoculum, a higher ethinylestradiol removal percentage was observed in a wastewater sample from a treatment plant in the Peruvian Andes.",

    "abstract": "Abstractive text summarization is based on Sequence-to-Sequence architecture which is developed to capture syntactic and contextual information between words. Abstractive summarization is needed to address information overload and enhance summary generation. However, it faces challenges such as maintaining consistency, capturing subtle nuances, and striking a balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness. To overcome these challenges, a novel Bi-directional Stacked GRU-LSTM for ABstractive text summarization (Bi-STAB) framework is proposed to generate an effective text summarization system using a hybridized deep learning network. Initially, the original document is pre-processed and fed to the hybridized stacked deep learning network for relevant feature extraction. The hybridized deep learning network extracts features from the text by capturing both forward and backward sequential dependencies by ensuring contextual information from both directions. An Attention-based Neural Network is used to select the most relevant parts of the text to form a coherent summary from these extracted features. Finally, the summary is then post-processed to enhance readability and provide a concise and accurate representation of the original text. A simulation of Bi-STAB is performed using MATLAB, and validation is performed using WCEP and Giga Word data. TBy comparing the accuracy of Bi-STAB with existing techniques such as DeepSumm, MOOTweetSumm, and WL-AttenSumm the proposed framework outperforms these techniques by 84.80, 88.35, 92.17, and 97.64%, respectively.",

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the content of heavy metals at four different points in the soil and food crops produced near a sanitary landfill in Porto Nacional, Brazil (central plains). The average concentrations of metals in the soil were in the order of iron &gt; manganese &gt; copper &gt; nickel &gt; zinc &gt; cadmium, and for fruits and vegetables, in the following order: iron &gt; manganese &gt; zinc &gt; copper. Notably, nickel, cadmium, chromium, and lead were not detected in any of the ten samples of vegetables (cassava and pepper) and fruits (pequi, papaya, cajá fruit, acerola, mango, guava, jackfruit, and lemon) analyzed in the present study. Regardless of the different types of vegetables, age, and gender, the EDI values ranged from Manganese (1.08 × 10?02 to 7.10 × 10?05) &gt; Iron (2.30 × 10?02 to 7.81 × 10?04) &gt; Zinc (1.42 × 10?03 to 7.10 × 10?04) &gt; Copper (1.55 × 10?03 to 7.10 × 10?04). Furthermore, the results showed that children are at greater risk than adults of ingesting heavy metals according to the responses obtained by the EDI, THQ, and HRI indexes. However, the potential health risks from residual metals are considered insignificant based on the results. On the other hand, papaya, acerola, and jackfruit are not recommended for consumption due to their high microbiological contamination, mainly by E. coli and Staphylococcus.",

This research aims to improve understanding of change management process for digital transformation involving citizens for prioritising problem handling and devising appropriate solutions at different stages of the process. Firstly, content and thematic analysis techniques were employed to identify and analyse the characteristics of the change management process from 33 relevant studies in a systematic review. Subsequently, a change management process model was developed, including five stages: determining a change initiative, developing a change plan, communicating changes resulting from digital transformation, monitoring the progress of changes, and learning from past lessons. This model was then applied to analyse the change management process in a case study using text clustering technique based on online news released by the Shanghai government in 2023, allowing to gain insights into challenges/problems and strategies used to address them at each stage in the process. The findings show the utility of the model for analysing the change management processes. Implications for academia and practitioners are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The present study addresses corrosion in critical safety systems on an offshore oil and gas platform of the Floating Production Storage and Offloading type. The platform is over 25 years old and is currently being decommissioned. Corrosion on offshore platforms is of significant concern because of the risks associated with compromised mechanical integrity or functionality of fire protection systems. Such compromises can lead to property damage, environmental damage, worker health risks and escalation of fire-related emergencies. To achieve the aims of this study, a bibliographic search was conducted from 2017 to 2023. In addition, other relevant search sources were considered. These included accident data collected by the Brazilian National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels, which is responsible for regulating, contracting, and supervising economic activities in the petroleum industry. Field research was also conducted to assess the operating conditions and integrity of both fixed and portable firefighting systems, as well as the damage caused by corrosive processes in these systems. Ultimately, the study concludes that operators in exploration and production fields are genuinely concerned about the integrity of their systems during the decommissioning process. This concern is aimed at preventing harm to people, the environment, and the company’s assets. In addition, operators seek to avoid incidents that could negatively impact the company’s reputation with society, investors, and regulators.",

The research involved 215 healthy young male and female participants, selected in Abeokuta South Western Nigeria, using the snowball sampling technique. Employing statistical analyses and regression models, the study explores the nuanced relationship between finger length and human weight. Regression analysis revealed specific finger length L5D (r = 0.307), R1D (r = 0.338), and R5D (r = 0.331) are statistically more reliable for determining human weight, while R2D (r = 0.066) and L2D (r = 0.057) are less reliable, providing valuable insights for ergonomic applications. Multiple regression analysis reinforced these findings with robust model equations. Single and multivariate regression analyses deepened the study, yielding high correlation coefficients and coefficients of determination. The practical implications of this correlation are highlighted, particularly in shaping ergonomic design principles for products and environments accommodating diverse body types effectively. This research serves as a foundation for future investigations, emphasizing the potential for extending the study to a larger and more diverse population, thereby enriching the understanding of the intricate interplay between finger length and human weight.",

    "abstract": "The present study subjected two distinct cultivars of cress (Dada? and Bahar) to salinity treatment (0, 30, and 60 mM) to determine its effect on the properties of the cress cultivars. The Dada? cress cultivar exhibited higher levels of antioxidant enzymes, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, vitamins, and amino acids compared to the Bahar cress cultivar (P ? 0.01). However, Bahar cress had a higher content of sucrose, fructose, and galactose compared to Dada? cress. The salinity treatment resulted in a marked increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes in both cultivars of cress. Moreover, the Catalase (CAT) activity in Dada? and Bahar cress rose significantly from 12.89 to 22.45 and from 6.71 to 17.33, while the Peroxidase (POD) activity increased from 14.01 to 25.87 and from 8.95 to 18.57 (EU/g plant), respectively. Additionally, histidine levels in both cress cultivars increased under the 60 mM salinity treatment. Although the sugar content of cress cultivars increased with salinity application, interestingly, the 30 mM salinity treatment caused a decrease in the level of fructose. An increase in the levels of individual phenolic compounds was observed depending on the concentration of the salinity treatment, while a decrease in the amount of anthocyanins was noted. Finally, this research indicates that the application of salinity, an abiotic stress factor, influences the nutritional and functional compounds of cress cultivars, with salt concentration playing a significant role.",

However, as the solving strategies focus on increasing production, food losses that reduce availability for consumption and affect climate change tend to happen. In this study, the nutritional composition and microbiological quality of food losses in the central market of Merida, Mexico, were determined. The study population was composed of a set of discarded foods that were deposited in containers at the central market. Three types of sampling were obtained: for solid waste, for the calculation of the food percentage contained in the solid waste, and for chemical and microbiological analysis. The sample data was recorded and analyzed with descriptive statistics. The average solid waste generated per day was 1185.02 kg, with more than three-quarters (86.08%) of its content consisting of fruit and vegetable groups. No animal-derived foods were found among the food losses since this central market doesn’t supply them. The greatest amount of protein and fiber was present in vegetables, while fruits had the greatest amount of moisture and carbohydrates. The presence of microorganisms, mainly yeasts, was higher than the established limit, making the food unsuitable for human consumption. However, it was found to be a good source of lipids and organic matter, making them useful for composting, biofuel production, or the extraction of bioactive compounds.",

All extracts showed antioxidant activity when compared to the control sample, reducing the reaction rate. However, the mixture containing extract of etna pepper leaves (Capsicum frutescens) and red pitaya peels (Hylocereus costaricensis) was the one that presented the lowest experimental value of k (0.1358 h-1).

The results demonstrated that vesicle loading and stability can be controlled by the experimental procedure used to entrap the drug. Different initial drug to lipid molar ratios strongly affect encapsulation efficiency. The reverse-phase evaporation method resulted in the largest 5-FU encapsulation efficiency, around 6%.

    "abstract": "Soy is a food rich in proteins and its cost is lower when compared to animal protein. However, it is still under-consumed, especially in the Western world. Cheese whey is a byproduct of the dairy industry originated from the production of cheese, and is very harmful to the environment when disposed improperly, given that it then might become a pollutant. Its treatment is usually expensive, but its composition is quite rich in nutrients needed in the human diet. In this context, five different formulations of a chocolate-based drink were produced using soybean and/or cheese whey, with the purpose of assessing the sensorial acceptance of the formulations regarding attributes like color, flavor and consistency. For the prepared samples, rheological characterizations were also performed in the temperatures of 10 and 20&deg;C. The results showed that the formulation produced only with whey had higher sensorial acceptance in terms of flavor and consistency. On the other hand, this same formulation was found to achieve lower levels of consistency and pseudoplasticity.",

Sensory analyses of the papayas were performed on days three and six of storage, by acceptance testing. Coatings with hydroalcoholic extract of propolis wild type and green rosemary controlled weight loss and firmness in papayas. The coatings showed no effect on the variable SS. Fruit coated with hydroalcoholic extract of rosemary green propolis showed satisfactory results evaluating AT, SS/TA and pH, as well as sensory analysis.

Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis was achieved using a sequential experimental design, performing a fractional factorial design (FFD) followed by two Central Composite Rotatable Designs (CCRDs). The optimization was achieved under the conditions of 200 g L-1 of DRB concentration, 30 μL of α-amylase g-1 of DRB and 40 μL g-1 of amyloglucosidase (AMG), at action times of two and three hours, respectively. In bioethanol production, it was evaluated the effect of adding of 15 μL g-1 of protease prior to the action of amylases. Fermentation was conducted at 29°C, with 4.0% Saccharomyces cerevisiae and initial pH of 5.0. The hydrolysis with protease yielded 3.55% ethanol, an increase of 115.15% in relation to the medium without protease addition, and the conversion had a yield of 101.5% in 24h of alcoholic fermentation. This study demonstrates the possibility to obtain bioethanol from DRB.",

Twenty five 25-L outdoor polyethylene aquaria were used to hold experimental fish (0.82 ± 0.06 g; 10 fish per aquarium) for 6 weeks. There were two conditions of TA (low or high) and of TH (moderate or high) in the culture water, obtained by the application of different salts (CaCO3, Na2CO3 and CaSO4) upon a previously acidified water, all at the same rate. Water quality and growth performance variables were observed in each replicate. The acidification of the supply water with HCl has resulted in significantly lower final body weight (p &lt; 0.05). Except for the Na2CO3, growth performance of tilapia has improved significantly after CaCO3 liming or CaSO4 application (p &lt; 0.05) and no significant difference was detected between these last two fish groups (p &gt; 0.05). It was concluded that beyond a minimum level of TA (≥ 20 mg L-1 CaCO3) and TH (≥ 20 mg L-1 CaCO3), it is also important that fish culture waters have a TH/TA ratio higher than 1.",

For industrial application, there are equipment and techniques to evaluate the bending stiffness of lumber, through dynamic tests such as the longitudinal vibration technique, also known as stress wave, and the transverse vibration technique. This study investigated the application of these two techniques in the assessment of the modulus of elasticity in bending of Teca beams (Tectona grandis), from reforestation, and of the tropical species Guajará (Micropholis venulosa). The modulus of elasticity estimated by dynamic tests showed good correlation with the modulus measured in the static bending test. Meantime, we observed that the accuracy of the longitudinal vibration technique was significantly reduced in the evaluation of the bending stiffness of Teca pieces due to the knots existing in this species.",

In less than 10 s an irreversible resistance is established, and the cake starts to build up.

    "abstract": "This work presents a hybrid approach called GA-NN for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Nearest Neighbor heuristic (NN). The first technique was applied to determine the groups of customers to be served by the vehicles while the second is responsible to build the route of each vehicle. In addition, the heuristics of Gillett & Miller (GM) and Downhill (DH) were used, respectively, to generate the initial population of GA and to refine the solutions provided by GA. In the results section, we firstly present experiments demonstrating the performance of the NN heuristic for solving the Shortest Path and Traveling Salesman problems. The results obtained in such experiments constitute the main motivation for proposing the GA-NN. The second experimental study shows that the proposed hybrid approach achieved good solutions for instances of CVRP widely known in the literature, with low computational cost. It also allowed us to evidence that the use of GM and DH helped the hybrid GA-NN to converge on promising points in the search space, with a small number of generations.",

The results indicate ten elements for composing the business model framework, in which value proposition, customers and culture are part of it. The practical implication of this study indicates an opportunity to boost the integration of product and service in the aerospace industry, specially using AHP for business model construction. For future researches, others companies can be considered in the study. In addition to manufacturers, service firms or operators of helicopters can compose the specialists group. Besides, another Multi Criteria Decision Method can be applied aiming to do a comparative analysis of the results among the methods.

The variables pavement age, traffic, International Roughness Index (IRI) and Flexible Pavement Condition Index (FPCI) were associated with numerical scales and linguistic concepts such as new, old, light, heavy, good, fair, and poor. From the information obtained through the application of forms, variables were modeled with the aid of software InFuzzy and fuzzy models were developed for IRI and FPCI. For validating the model, a straight line adjustment was used to relate the predicted to the observed data.

The simulation of the dynamics of pollutant concentrations throughout the water body was conducted by means of structured discretization of the geometry of Igapó I Lake, together with the finite differences and the finite elements methods. Firstly, the hydrodynamic flow (without the pollutants), modeled by Navier-Stokes and pressure equations, was numerically resolved by the finite differences method, and associated with the fourth order Runge-Kutta procedure. After that, by using the hydrodynamic field velocity, the flow of the reactive species (pollutants) was described through a reaction transport model, restricted to the carbon-nitrogen cycle. The reaction transport model was numerically resolved by the stabilized finite elements method, by means of a semi-discrete formulation. A qualitative analysis of the numerical simulations provided a better understanding of the dynamics of the processes involved in the flow of the reactive species, such as the dynamics of the nitrification process, of the biochemical demand of oxygen and of the level of oxygen dissolved in the water body at Igapó I Lake.",

The samples´ microbial, physical and chemical composition was evaluated. Twelve panelists were selected and trained using as criteria the panelists´ discrimination power, reproducibility and consensus. Eleven terms were generated by the method of network descriptors. The intensity of each descriptor in each sample was evaluated by unstructured scale of 9 cm. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Duncan´s mean test and principal component analysis. The sensory profile shows that low sodium beef burgers had lower fat and salty flavor when compared to untreated control and greater flavor and spice aroma. The above proves that reducing sodium intake causes increased perception burger tasters when compared to the presence of spices in the product. Treatment with 50% sodium reduction obtained the best results for texture softness and appearance. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the chemical composition of ash, protein and fat in all burgers. In the case of general sensory attributes, treatments with sodium reduction obtained higher intensities of the attributes evaluated, except for meat and salt flavors.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread purchase of mobile communication devices and their extensive usage in every aspect of life, allied with global mobility and market penetration – a more culturally universally adaptable interface has become a priority. This pliable interface must conform continuously with the changing abilities of the end user and the person’s culture, irrespective of the prevailing ambient culture. The information required to customise this interface must be derived from the user’s actual digital footprint and not on their feedback. This treatise presents the usability evaluation results of a culturally inclusive and ubiquitous mobile learning (M-Learning) platform (‘Mobile Academy’), with an AI-based adaptive user interface which takes the snapshot of the installed apps on a smartphone as input, predicts the user’s cultural affiliation as well as the language preference and thus offer a culturally customised user interface as the output. The proof of concept (PoC) prototype has been developed based on the CIAUI (Culturally Inclusive Adaptive User Interface) framework, using plasticity of user interface techniques. This approach was taken to test the affordability of developing inclusive applications, considering the ever growing large global culturally diverse user base. Usability evaluation was then conducted and the results carefully analysed. The results indicated that the PoC exhibited enhanced cross-cultural usability and affordability of such techniques. The evaluation results of the PoC also advocates in favour of the user’s cultural profiling based on the mobile usage data, particularly a single snapshot of installed apps. The research provides direction for future research and application development.",

    "abstract": "Reinforced concrete is an essential material in the modern world, and the use of genetic algorithms that aim at the optimization of the structures of this material is an increasingly widespread tool. The objective of the present work was to propose a method by means of a Genetic Algorithm to find the optimized geometry of a rectangular reinforced concrete column based on its cost. The two main parts of the work were developed as: a geometry verification algorithm that received height, base, layers in x and y directions, diameters of transverse and longitudinal steel rebar as the main parameters of the proposed sections, and a genetic algorithm that generated 240 random populations and selected them, crossed among them and then generated new 100 generations of individuals, followed by selection of optimized ones by its penalized cost. The generations had more and more favorable individuals and it was possible to determine an optimized geometry for the proposed example. It is, therefore, concluded that genetic algorithms are useful tools for optimizing reinforced concrete parts with multiple parameters. The proposed algorithm methodology really checks and selects the best individuals for the sections proposed by engineers, and larger initial populations are essential to find a minimum global cost among the different options.",

During the brewing process, approximately 85% of all barley used is transformed into solid residue, which is currently destined for animal feed or just discarded. A possibility to increase the value of this byproduct is the production of carbonaceous materials, such as activated carbon, for the treatment of tartrazine yellow dye solutions. The structures and morphologies of the samples were characterized. Furthermore, the adsorptive capacity and kinetic behavior were studied. Regarding the characterization of the material, the activated carbon presented a porous morphology and high surface area (768.4 m² g-1). Additionally, the kinetic study showed that the equilibrium time of the adsorption process from the tartrazine yellow dye discoloration was 60 min., and the data presented dispersion according to Elovich’s kinetics. It was possible, from the experimental design, to evaluate the adsorptive capacity of the material in which it performed best at pH &lt; 5. Finally, in the equilibrium study carried out by the adsorption isotherms, it was found that the increase in temperature influenced the process, raising the maximum adsorptive capacity in which the data fit into the Langmuir isothermal model",

Therefore, the required costs to implement an e-commerce platform are considered to guarantee demand for the factory’s productive capacity. While deterministic analysis might provide initial overviews of economic feasibility, there are inherent risks associated with manufacturing. These risks are likely to influence considerably the outcome of economic evaluation, hence, stochastic analysis is performed based on the software Oracle Crystal Ball®. The proposed approach guarantees an accurate and detailed evaluation, as well as solid conclusions regarding the economic feasibility of cosmetic initiatives in Brazil.

The random forest model demonstrated superior effectiveness with a lower prediction error. Bayesian optimization refined both ANN and random forest models. Experiments yielded an average solar panel efficiency of 16.79%, with performance indicators (coefficient of determination) of 0.96966, 0.93466, 0.98419 and mean absolute percentage errors of 7.518, 10.658, 5.089%. Bayesian optimization improved the traditional ANN model by up to 36.2%. Random forest exhibited lower sensitivity to hyperparameters compared to ANN. Two important parameters such as coating thickness and solar insolation were identified by feature sensitivity analysis. In terms of accuracy and robustness, random forest outperformed in predicting anti-reflective film-coated photovoltaic solar panel efficiency.",

The space distribution of the interpolated data and the accuracy of the interpolators were verified through the method of cross-validation. Both methods were shown to be appropriate in accomplishing the interpolation; however, some expressive differences were observed. The IDW method is recommended for underestimating the value of precipitation in 2.2 mm, while Spline overestimated it by 4.3 mm. In face of the necessary safety for agricultural planning, the use of the IDW method is then recommended, as it also presented the lowest standard deviation of the mean, representing a smaller margin of error",

    "abstract": "Forest fragmentation may negatively impact fauna and flora. An important tool for the development and implementation of research on these effects is the use of a geographic information system (GIS). This paper aims to perform an integrated analysis of the landscape fragments that compose the Alonzo River watershed, Paraná State, by using remote sensing tools and landscape ecology metrics. The analyzed landscape metrics were Patton's index, total area of the patches, edge length, edge density, forest fragment density, and the core area of the patches. The results showed 888 forest patches with area values ranging from 0.15 ha to 2509.82 ha, and it represents 12.5% of the total forest land cover of the studied basin; this means that 85.3% of the forest patches are less than 50 ha and that 75% of those fragments have a Patton's index value of less than 3.9. The fragments that compose the studied area may be subject to edge effects and biodiversity loss as long as they present reduced areas and small core areas. Thus, the use of GIS and landscape ecology metrics is a quick and efficient way to evaluate the effect of fragmentation over large areas.",

An experimental methodology was established in a micro-CHP laboratory to simulate the dynamic operating conditions of the system considering the thermal load (chilled water), the activation source (hot water) and the heat dissipation circuit (cold water). The thermal load was simulated from a set of electrical resistors installed in a water heater and the activation of the chiller from recovery gas a microturbine 30 kW and through a compact heat exchanger, where water is heated and stored in a hot buffer tank. The absorption chiller heat dissipation system consists of the pump and cooling tower. The system responded appropriately to the thermal load imposed providing COP values in the transient regime of 0.55 to 0.70 the temperature conditions tested.",

In contrast, the sustainable exploitations of natural resources by timber producers demand alternatives to exchange the use of restricted or blocked tropical wood species (e.g. Araucaria angustifolia) by other timbers, which are liable for commercial certification. This research, based on the test results obtained according to the Brazilian Standard prescriptions (NBR-7190 - Annex B), aimed at evaluating the influence of the apparent density on radial and tangential shrinkages, considering the results for forty-three Brazilian tropical wood species. Usually, this parameter is regarded as necessary to define the timber species to different applications.

The production of the extract followed a rotational central composite design, varying the ethanol proportion and the ultrasound exposure time in between. The results of the experimental planning were: extract volume yield; total phenolic compound and antioxidant activity expressed by the DPPH and FRAP methods. Mathematical models were constructed using the significant parameters for each response, and its predictive capacity was evaluated through an analysis of variance of the regression. Better results were found in extracts from husk obtained by the dry method using solvent in a proportion of 40-50% (v v-1) ethanol to 40-60 min. of ultrasound exposure.",

Various authors arbitrarily delimit this area without a prior study, which leads to significant errors in the results. In recent years, a variety of models to estimate the footprint area was presented mainly with stochastic and analytical approaches, usually expensive. Thus this article aimed to develop a methodology based on geostatistics for inference of the footprint area for temperature and relative humidity. By using geostatistics it was possible to observe that the radius of footprint had a temporal variation (between times and days) and spatial variation (between points), pointing out the great importance in assessing the footprint area. However, for a better analysis of this method we suggest to model the anisotropy in future studies, because the footprint area behaves like an ellipse with different radii at different directions. And for this, it is necessary to collect data with a regular distribution within a mesh.",

Also, the use of water as a solvent added to the ultrasound-assisted technology improves this eco-friendly process. Therefore, an aqueous eco-friendly extraction, including extraction time and ultrasound presence or absence (conventional extraction) was performed in order to extract bioactive compounds from blueberry and raspberry pomace. Response parameters included levels of anthocyanins, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids, and antioxidant activity determined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods. Analysis of variance results indicated that ultrasound-assisted extraction for 45 min. was feasible to extract the bioactive compounds. The antioxidant content of the extract obtained by the ultrasound-assisted process was 1.4 times higher on average and the total phenolic concentration was 1.6 times higher (for blueberry 5.02 and for raspberry 2.53 mg gallic acid equivalent/g) compared with those obtained by the conventional process. Thus, the ultrasound-assisted extraction method can be a profitable alternative to extract bioactive compounds from blueberry and raspberry pomace, as it is energy efficient, requires fewer chemicals, and produces less effluent. This eco-friendly technology is therefore viable for food, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries, and also for reducing food waste.",

To obtain the data it was used a datalogger from Campbell Scientific, Inc, model CR23X. It was observed that under solar irradiance below 550 W m-2 the panel did not convert maximum power, and above this value the panel reached saturation levels. Temperature increase led to reduced voltage, and consequently lower module output power, decreasing the efficiency value by nearly 6% at temperatures 15oC above the Standard Test Conditions (STC) temperature. These panels are usually placed at different angles according to local latitude, remaining fixed in that position. In comparison with a horizontally-placed panel, it was obtained a 4-hour increase in yield when the panel reached saturation value. Dust levels reduced electricity production levels by approximately 16%. These factors must be taken into account for placement and maintenance of photovoltaic systems, so they can function efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Changes in smoked bologna sausage manufactured with Niletilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and wheat fibers in refrigerated storage (6 ± 2°C) during 30 days were evaluated. Minced fish (MF) obtained from waste (parings from the filleting fish operations) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was used as raw material. In this experiment, were determined Staphylococcus count, the detection of Salmonella sp. (day 0), psychrotrophic count, total and fecal coliforms at45°C, the acceptance sensory test (days 0 and 30), water activity, instrumental color, pH and lipid oxidation analysis (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - TBARS) days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 of storage. Lipid oxidation (TBARS) and water activity provided significant differences among storage days. However it was concluded that the bologna sausage remained stable and with acceptable quality for 30 days of storage may be a new alternative to adding value to fish products, because the researched microorganisms had a low count, changes in pH were not significant and sensory test indicated good acceptance of the product during the 30 days of storage.",

For this purpose, six HSF-CWs were used: two non-cultivated (HSF-CWs 1 and 4), two cultivated with Tifton 85 grass (Cynodon spp.) (HSF-CWs 2 and 5) and two cultivated with Alternanthera (Alternanthera philoxeroides) (HSF-CWs 3 and 6). It was made a reversal in the flow direction of the HSF-CWs 1, 2 and 3. The reversal of the wastewater flow direction was performed when the superficial flow of the wastewater applied (SF) reached 50% of the length of the HSF-CWs. There was a single reversal for each system, on different dates. Reversing the flow direction promoted distinction on the dry matter yield of Tifton 85 grass. This was not observed in HSF-CWs cultivated with Alternanthera. The reversal of the wastewater flow direction promoted, in principle, the extinction of the SF advance in the HSF-CWs, but did not prevent its return. Waiting for the SF to reach 50% of the length was not the best criterion for reversing the flow direction.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater from concrete plants has a high pH and a high concentration of suspended solids, necessitating treatment before reuse or discharge into the environment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of two chemical coagulants, aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) and iron chloride (FeCl3), and a natural coagulant, Moringa oleifera (MO), all in their soluble forms, in the treatment of wastewater from concrete plants. To this end, the efficiencies of the three coagulants, in combinations with different proportions, were tested. The quality parameters of the wastewater obtained after the treatments were compared to the limit values for non-potable water. The use of coagulants in their soluble form potentiates their effect, especially when preparing the MO extract, i.e., greater amounts of the protein responsible for the coagulation is extracted. A mixture with MO and Al2(SO4)3 in a 20:80 proportion showed the best results, with 97.5% of the turbidity removed at 60 min. of sedimentation, allowing the treated water to be used for washing vehicles and flushing toilets. The FeCl3 treatment produced a high concentration of chlorides, which could cause corrosion problems, and is therefore not recommended for concrete wastewater treatment.",

Although the açaí juice is highly appreciated in Brazil and even worldwide, its commercialization is still limited. Microfiltration process is largely applied in juice processing, eliminating many of the traditional processing steps and reducing time, energy and addition of clarifying agents. Furthermore, microfiltration process may eliminate microorganisms and compounds responsible for turbidity in the juice. Current assay applies a microfiltration process to obtain a stabilized açaí permeate pulp. Microfiltrations of açaí pulp were carried out in a dead end configuration with a flat membrane of 0.22 μm pore size. Permeate pulp was characterized according to its turbidity, lipid concentration and microbiological analysis. Initial permeate flux was 103 kg m-2 h-1. After an initial flux decline during 30 min., due to membrane compaction and fouling occurrences, flux was stabilized at 20 kg m-2 h-1. The microfiltration process reduced the initial açaí pulp turbidity by 99.98% and lipids were not identified in the permeate. Microbiological analysis showed that the contamination by microorganism decreased in the permeate pulp when compared to that in raw açaí pulp.",

In the search for cleaner technologies, the application of electrochemical processes, such as electro-flocculation, or natural coagulants, such as Moringa oleifera Lam extract, have become recurrent in literature. Since the required operating conditions for alternative technologies are such that they hamper effective application, current paper presents results obtained with the use of a hybrid system of treatment which combines electro-flocculation and the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera lam to evaluate the removal of reactive blue 5G dye from aqueous solutions. Milder conditions of electric current intensity (0.10 – 1.50 A) and natural coagulant concentration (250-2000 mg L-1) were tested. Through a Central Composite Rotatable Design, it was possible to obtain a quadratic model which subsidized the optimization of operating conditions. Applying an electric current of 0.97 A to sacrificial electrodes of iron and a concentration of 2000 mg L-1 for the extract of Moringa oleifera Lam, an average 86.79% color removal was obtained, considered a satisfactory rate.",

First, RE was characterized by its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Subsequently, films were elaborated by the casting technique and characterized by the thickness, moisture content, solubility, mechanical and barrier properties, optical characteristics, and their bioactive activities. The RE concentrations tested in films were 1, 5, 10, and 20% (v⋅wwater-1). RE showed antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus brasiliensis; however, it did not inhibit Escherichia coli growth. Film solubility and moisture were approximately 12 and 35%, respectively. The addition of RE weakened the films mechanical and barrier properties. As the color of RE is green, the films tended to this coloration, lost luminosity, and the opacity increase was proportional to the RE concentration. Low luminosity indicates better barrier properties against UV light. From Pearson's correlation test (p &lt; 0.05), the films concentration of RE, antioxidant activity, and inhibition zone (IZ) demonstrated a positive and significant correlation. This study demonstrated a by-product and a commercial RE potential in developing active biodegradable films.",

Therefore, a (2 x 2 x 4) factorial experiment was carried out in the present study to investigate the compressive strength and elastic modulus of slag-modified cement concretes with different strength levels (characteristic compressive strength of 20 and 30 MPa) subjected to different maximum temperatures (200, 400, 600, or 800ºC) and cooling procedures (slow or fast cooling). According to analyses of variance (ANOVA), air-cooled specimens showed higher residual mechanical properties. Higher residual elastic modulus was observed in concretes with higher initial strength, whereas residual strength was only affected by initial strength for higher temperatures. Effects of different cooling methods were more pronounced in slag-modified concretes than in concretes produced with ordinary Portland cement, especially for temperature up to 400ºC. Since slag-modified concretes have lower calcium hydroxide content, volume expansion and cracking propagation due to lime rehydration during slow cooling were mitigated, leading to higher post-fire mechanical properties. In contrast, these types of concrete exhibited significant temperature difference along their cross-section when fast cooling was used, so that a substantial thermal shock caused limited post-fire mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "This research paper delves into the prospect of curbing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by strategically deploying solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and orchestrating demand response (DR) mechanisms within Indian lignite power plants (LPP). The study responds to the critical imperative of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originating from coal-based electricity generation, a matter of substantial consequence in the context of climate change. In pursuit of optimal solar PV system allocation, this research employs the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, considering a spectrum of factors including solar resource availability, electricity demand patterns, and the CO2 intensity associated with coal power generation. The primary objective is to minimize CO2 emissions while maximizing the integration of solar PV and curtailing power losses, all while accounting for the intermittent nature of solar power and the dynamic nature of demand. The proposed approach is rigorously tested on the IEEE 33 bus system, supplied by the LPP. The results convincingly demonstrate a remarkable reduction in CO2 emissions, amounting to 29.69%, following the implementation of the proposed approach. This research presents a concrete step towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy landscape, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector.",

The rotating system is modeled by applying the rigid shaft Stodola-Green model, in which the shaft gyroscopic moments and rotatory inertia are accounted for, in conjunction with the hydrodynamic cylindrical journal bearing model based on the classical Reynolds equation. A linearized perturbation procedure is employed to render the lubrication equations from the Reynolds equation, which allows predicting the eight linear force coefficients associated with the bearing direct and cross-coupled stiffness and damping coefficients. The results show that the methodology presented is efficient for balancing rotor systems. This paper gives a step further in the monitoring process, since Artificial Neural Network is normally used to predict, not to correct the mass unbalance. The procedure presented can be used in turbo machinery industry to balance rotating machinery that require continuous inspections. Some simulated results will be used in order to clarify the methodology presented.",

The total phenolic contents were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The results revealed that the extract and fractions inhibited the germination of lettuce, tomato, onion and wheat. The ethyl acetate fraction from the underground part inhibited lettuce germination by 68% and wheat germination by 60%. In the growth bioassays, the ethyl acetate fraction from underground and aerial parts showed strong inhibitory effect in the growth of root (> 40%), hypocotyl/coleoptiles (> 40%) and dry mass. The ethyl acetate fraction from underground parts presented higher total phenolic contents, better activity in the DPPH assay and the fraction with greater phototoxic effect by germination and growth of lettuce, tomato, onion and wheat.",

The catalytic properties of V2O5 may be strengthened and modified when it is dispersed in pure oxides like SiO2, TiO2, and Al2O3. In this work, mixed oxides V2O5/SiO2, V2O5/TiO2, and V2O5/Al2O3 were prepared through the sol-gel method and obtained in nominal concentrations of 10% of V2O5. All samples were submitted to calcination in muffle at 400ºC for 5h. The characterization of the materials by nitrogen adsorption indicated that they present a mesoporous structure. XRD results disclosed that vanadium is highly dispersed in mixed oxide 10% V2O5/TiO2. The materials obtained were studied through selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with propane. It was observed that the V2O5/TiO2 system presented a greater efficiency in the conversion of NO to N2 associated to a higher dispersion of vanadium in the support, if compared with the results of other systems reported in literature.",

While wheat and oat brans are still the conventional sources of fiber for human consumption, other new fibrous products have been developed – at research level – from waste or by-products generated by food industries. This research aimed to develop a new dehydrated food product - peach palm fibrous flour - from the waste generated during the processing of the heart-of-peach palm. The average yield in dry weight from this waste into farinaceous products was 129.8 g kg-1. The flours showed high values for the total dietary fiber, 59.1 to 65.5 g 100 g-1, almost entirely represented by the insoluble fiber, as well as a low proportion of calories - 96.1 to 101.1 kcal or 408.2-429.5 kJ per 100 g of product - when compared to wheat bran. These results highlighted the peach palm flour as a potential source of fiber for human nutrition, particularly as fibrous ingredient of formulated food and functional supplements. Also, it contributes to minimizing waste disposal and to the agribusiness of peach palm grown for heart-of-palm production.",

Due to commercial features, characterization of pure olive oil and commercial mixtures represents an important challenge. Reported techniques can successfully quantify components in concentrations lower than 1%, but may present long delays, too many purification steps or use expensive equipment. Image analysis represents an important characterization technique for food science and technology. By coupling image and UV-VIS spectroscopy analysis, models with linear dependence on parameters were developed and could successfully describe the mixture concentration in the range of 0-100% in mass of olive oil content. A validation sample, containing 25% in mass of olive oil, not used for parameter estimation, was also used for testing the proposed procedure, leading to a prediction of 24.8 ± 0.6. Due to image analysis results, 3-parameter-based models considering only R and G components were developed for olive oil content prediction in mixtures with up to 70% in mass of olive oil, the same test sample was used and its concentration was predicted as 24.5 ± 1.2. These results show that image analysis represents a promising technique for on-line/in-line monitoring of blending process of olive soybean oil for commercial mixtures.",

The wastes were collected in a central distribution market for food, shredded, blended, inoculated with sewage sludge and characterized. The waste was characterized in terms of organic carbon, soluble and total COD and Kjeldahl nitrogen, so it was put in an anaerobic reactor for the biological degradation that was monitored during 300 days. The results show that during the experiment, the degradation of the organic material wasn’t possible, because of the low COD and C/N ratio removal. Probably, this fact was caused by the physical aspect of the waste, such as a semi-solid paste.

Hf-SP3 had the highest sulfate content (37.45%). Hf-SP3 was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column using a NaCl gradient. Fractions were lyophilized and submitted to 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The anticoagulant activity was evaluated by the activated partial thromboplastin time using rabbits plasma and expressed in international units per mg of SP using standard HEP (193 IU mg-1). The chromatographic procedure separated into four different SP fractions (F I, F II, F III and F IV) eluted at concentrations of 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 M of NaCl, respectively, reveling among them different marked on charge density, when compared by electrophoresis. F III had the highest anticoagulant activity (10.72 IU mg-1), suggesting that the sulfate is important in this process. In conclusion, our results suggest that sequential extractions of Hf-SP are an important biotechnological tool for identification of novel anticoagulants and studies of structural characterization are already in progress.",

    "abstract": "In the current construction market there is a high demand for sustainability. In addition to that the Brazilian government is enacting tougher and tougher legislation on the disposal of solid construction waste. These demands increasingly make the construction company responsible for the entire lifecycle of its waste as well as the accompanying cost and environmental impact of solid waste. A software program was used in the research which allows construction companies gather information about waste. This helps the decision makers, at all different levels of the company improving waste management through better decisions. The software program was used during the construction of two residential buildings, constructed by a large construction company in the South of Brazil. Five key performance indicators were used by the construction company team: Generated Waste Height (cm), cost per built area (R$ m-²), Waste Segregation Quality Index (WSQI), Effective Waste Management Index (EWMI) and Waste Management Quality Index (WMQI). After four months the total cost of waste management was R$ 83,551.71 for site A and R$ 91,668.02 for site B. About 70% of the waste was raw material waste. The software program provided information not previously available, which made it possible to calculate the cost of material loss, indicating corrective actions, all without losing sight of cost reduction opportunities for the management of Solid construction Waste (SCW).",

The aims of this study were to evaluate lipase production by Candida viswanathii in submerged cultivation with different culture medium compositions, replace olive oil with plant oils from the Amazonian region, and assess the effect of nitrogen sources. By using olive oil as the sole carbon source, C. viswanathii produced high levels of biomass and lipase with minimal nutritional requirements (potassium, magnesium, and yeast extract). Plant oils from the Amazonian region supported cell growth, and pequi oil was the best inducer for lipase production (1.66 U mL-1). In comparison with inorganic sources, organic nitrogen sources induced the highest levels of lipase production. Typical microbial growth and lipase production were observed using pequi oil and peptone as a nitrogen source. The selected conditions resulted in good cell growth (YX/S = 1.25 g g-1) and lipase production (YP/S= 118.10 U g-1) after 60 hours of cultivation. In conclusion, the fermentation parameters indicated that Amazonian oils are promising for lipase production by C. viswanathii, and oils modified by this enzyme can be used in the food and cosmetic industries.",

The addition of up to 30% SPF in the sausages increased fat, ash, energy value, and decreased moisture and water activity. Concerning the physicochemical aspects, the increase in SPF increased the weight loss during cooking, shrinkage, lightness, redness and yellowness, and improved sensory properties of odor, flavor and overall acceptance. The sausages presented microbial counts according to the limits allowed for human consumption. Therefore, sausages made with marine catfish fillets presented suitable nutritional, physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics. However, although higher global acceptance scores were observed with the increase in SPF levels, no significant differences were detected from the inclusion of 10% SPF. Therefore, it is possible to produce fresh marine catfish sausages with a minimum of 10% SPF, to maintain satisfactory technological and sensory characteristics and a healthier appeal.",

The composition of packaging did not influence the moisture, crude protein, total fat, ash, cooking loss and water activity. The active packaging of oregano oil showed higher color protection in burgers during the storage period. The texture showed a small variation (5-10%) between packagings at day 1, stabilizing in the other periods until the storage end. The burger samples with 25% reduction in sodium and packaging with 1% oregano essential oil (B25) had better taste and aroma, getting a acceptability index above 80% for both periods (30 and 120 days). The use of 1% of oregano essential oil incorporated into packaging reduced lipid oxidation of burgers analyzed in 14% when compared packaging without adding oregano. Microbiological analyzes were maintained stable during the entire storage. Thus, active packaging with oregano essential oil can maintain the quality of beef burger without interfering with their physical and chemical characteristics and improve their sensory attributes during 120 days of storage.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes the preparation, characterization, and evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). AgNPs were synthesized from the leaf extracts of plants from the Arecaceae family, which are abundant in the Amazon region. AgNPs were characterized using UV/Vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. AgNPs presented maximum absorbance between 420 and 430 nm, the mean diameter obtained by DLS ranged from 130.43 to 352.93 nm and the polydispersity index (PdI) ranged from 0.523 to 0.689. The surface charge measured by the Zeta potential was negative and ranged from -17.2 to -26.97 mV. FTIR analysis suggests that the phenolic compounds and/or proteins in the chemical composition of the plants studied may have been responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions and stabilization of AgNPs. The morphology of AgNPs observed was largely spherical and presented some agglomerates. Transmission electron microscopy analyses showed polydispersed AgNPs without the formation of large agglomerates. The synthesized AgNPs presented homogeneity and rapid bioreduction. The concentration of AgNPs required to eliminate microorganisms by up to 90% was lower for Gram-negative bacteria (2.75 μg mL-1) than for Gram-positive bacteria (21.75 μg mL-1). In addition, AgNPs synthesized from plant species that are native to the Amazon proved to be promising, since they showed excellent antimicrobial activity against microorganisms of clinical interest.",

Hence, a worthwhile research question may be posed thus: In multiobjective optimization, what can facilitate the decision maker in choosing the best weighting? Thus, this study attempts to propose a method that can identify the optimal weights involved in a multiobjective formulation. Our method uses functions of Entropy and Global Percentage Error as selection criteria of optimal weights. To demonstrate its applicability, we employed this method to optimize the machining process for vertical turning martensitic gray cast iron piston rings, maximizing the productivity and the life of cutting tool and minimizing the cost, using feed rate and rotation of the cutting tool as the decision variables. The proposed optimization goals were achieved with feed rate = 0.35 mm rev-1 and rotation = 248 rpm. Thus, the main contributions of this study are the proposal of a structured method, differentiated in relation to the techniques found in the literature, of identifying optimal weights for multiobjective problems and the possibility of viewing the optimal result on the Pareto frontier of the problem. This viewing possibility is very relevant information for managing processes more efficiently.",

The understanding of the product behavior during the freezing process can assist in a better process management and quality control. This work reports the study of freezing and thawing of three types of processed meat in order to determine process parameters in an industrial forced‑air freezing tunnel at ‑30oC. Chicken sausages (frankfurter type), mortadela (bologna type) and mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) were studied. Products were placed in several layers in corrugated cardboard boxes (CCB) for sausages and mortadela. MDCM was placed in a nylon box. Temperature sensors were inserted in the products and the freezing and thawing curves were obtained. Freezing curves were used to determine the freezing time (tf), initial freezing point (Tf) and final freezing point (T’m). Products placed in different layers in the CCB had significantly different freezing times, being the higher rates for products placed in more external layers than internal ones. The external layers of product were subjected to heat transfer by convection showing its importance to decrease freezing time. The results strongly suggest that products placed in different layers could have distinct quality properties and also play a key role in the freezing process efficiency.",

However, for its efficiency, it is important to determine the best way of application of the electrical variables. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different voltages (100, 150, and 200 V) of alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC), frequency of 50 Hz, for 180 s exposure, concerning the aspects of behavior and meat quality of pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). Fish subjected to AC remained unconscious longer, evaluated by behavior analysis, when compared to DC. The pacu subjected to 100 AC, 200 AC and 100 DC showed less bleeding in the fillets. The lightness (L*) of the fillets were higher in 150 AC, 150 DC and 100 DC, followed by 200 and 100 AC. The redness (a*) in pacu fillets were moderate in treatments 200 and 150 AC and less intense in treatments 100 DC and 100 AC. The yellowness (b*) was higher in fish fillets treatment 150 DC and lower in 100 AC. Therefore, the 200 V alternating current (AC) used in water stunning caused apparent unconsciousness of up to 4 min. after exposure and less bleeding in fillets, thus it is a suitable stunning method to be recommended for the pacu processing industry.",

    "abstract": "Before product development, Requirement Engineering (RE) is the fundamental need to know customer preferences for any product. Traditionally, RE is carried out in several ways, particularly by conducting interviews, questionnaires, surveys etc. but these methods provide limited amount of data. As user’s preferences vary from country to country for any type of application, it is very hectic and time consuming to collect user requirements from different countries manually. As the internet is widely used now a days, a large number of customer’s reviews are available online that can be used to obtain the requirements for any product without manual work. Online customer reviews can be divided into three types: user experience, bugs and feature requests. Among these 3 categories, feature requests can be very useful for stakeholders (analysts/ requirements engineers) to acquire the requirements of each application. So, the approach is proposed for feature requests extraction from mobile application reviews of travel industry. In this paper, 4 categories of mobile apps of travel industry belonging to 5 countries have been extracted from Google Play Store and Apple Store. For each category, data from 5 different mobile applications have been considered. Since, the review of users from different countries is in their respective language, those reviews are translated into a standard language i.e. English, and then feature requests from these reviews have been extracted. After that, features are retrieved from user reviews and topic modeling is performed on extracted features since one or more features can be modelled under one topic. To know the opinions of users for any feature request, sentiment analysis is also performed on feature request sentences. These feature requests are also classified as Functional and Non-functional Requirements since it is very useful for application developers to improve or maintain the product to better facilitate the application users",

Development of the high level of resistance to multiple antibiotics and lack of new drugs accentuate the need of new antimicrobial substances against this opportunistic pathogen. A novel dimethyl carboxylate cyclohexane derivative was synthesized and initially screened against four Gram-positive bacteria and four Gram-negative bacteria by agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against all test pathogens using resazurin dye by broth microdilution method. Effect of test compound on growth curve of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BDU-49 was evaluated by turbidimetric method. Time kill assay was performed to assess bacteriostatic or bactericidal nature and relationship between the concentration of the test compound and the net growth rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BDU-49. Test compound exhibited better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa BDU-49 was the most susceptible test culture with MIC 62.5 μg mL-1. The growth curves of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BDU-49 demonstrated that test compound could inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria. Time kill assay showed that test compound is bactericidal at 2× MIC and bacteriostatic at MIC. Overall, these data indicate that test substance could act as probable novel anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa compound in future.",

In order to clarify how national culture influence countries' capacity for innovation, regression models were developed, and comparisons were made. We will use the multivariate linear regression method for the analysis, with the scores obtained by countries in the GII as the dependent variable and the values of cultural dimensions as explanatory variables. Individualism, long-term orientation and indulgence dimensions have a positive influence on countries' innovation. However, there is a negative relationship between uncertainty to avoidance and innovation. Possible reasons for these associations may include greater professional focus, openness to new ideas and greater resistance to innovation. Since the reality of each country is different, whether due to its culture, history and social aspects or due to its geographical location and availability of natural resources, it is not possible to simply import policies from one context to another. Given these factors, an analysis is needed on how infrastructure and cultural difference can influence the innovative performance of countries. This study aims to expand the literature on how culture in its different forms assists in the innovation process of countries by presenting quantitative and qualitative results on which cultural dimensions are most relevant to innovation.",

Integrated urban water management is a major factor in the effectiveness of an urban drainage system. In large cities, negative effects caused by the disorderly urbanization process, especially those related to rainwater runoff, are increasingly present. An evaluation model of urban drainage systems was generated using System Fragility Indicators (IFS) and their ranking via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), in the Jaracati River basin, Maranhão State, Brazil. Indicators were measured through the evaluation of the system and the experience of specialists in drainage systems. The results obtained allowed for the consolidation of a model to support planning and decision-making in the assessment processes of measures to mitigate socio-environmental impacts involved in the urban drainage of a watershed, with performance indicators capable of guaranteeing the support of a model being verified measurement of performance parameters of urban drainage systems.",

Therefore, this residue can be used as raw material for obtaining products such as xylitol, a sugar-alcohol with sweetness similar to sucrose, anticariogenic, substitute for sugars in diabetic and obese people’s diet. This polyol is currently produced by chemical catalysis of the xylose obtained from lignocellulosic residue. However, the bioconversion by yeasts is an alternative for this process. This work aims to determine the chemical composition of the oat hulls and to use the acid hidrolysate from this residue for the xylitol production by batch fermentation employing Candida guilliermondii. Chemical analysis showed that oat hulls are composed by cellulose (29.26%), hemicellulose (28.35%) and lignin (22.22%), among others. The batch fermentation resulted in xylitol yield and volumetric productivity of 0.54 g/g and 0.34 g/L.h, respectively",

For this reason, a successive extraction method which simulated a rhizosphere solution employing synthetic organic acids was previously proposed. The method was developed in order to access the long term potential availability of trace elements to plants. Data from successive zinc extractions with organic acid mixtures, as well as with routine extractants (Mehlich I, DTPA, and NH4OAc) adjusted to a non-linear model based in first order kinetic mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the estimator asymptotic properties for that adopted non-linear model were valid. Classical methodology for sampling and likelihood was used, with the bootstrap methodology as an alternative. Zinc extractants composed of organic acid mixtures presented similar inferential results; however, these results were different from those obtained with routine extractants. Data adjustment with routine extractants presented narrow confidence bands, suggesting that predictions with these extractants were considered precise within the studied interval, except for data obtained with NH4OAc. In general, zinc availability prediction inferential results were precisely adjusted to the non-linear model as set by the methodologies used: linear approximation, bootstrap, and curvature measure.",

To that end, adsorption studies were performed under different conditions of temperature, adsorbent concentrations, pH values, and color mixes (two- and three-color) on dye solutions produced in laboratory. Soybean meal showed great ability to remove color, especially in solutions with pH 4 and 6 at 60°C and containing 10 g L-1 of adsorbent. Considering that values of adsorption efficiency ranged between 74 and 99%, depending on the dye and treatment conditions, soybean meal proved to be an alternative material for the adsorption of acidic dyes.",

From the simulation results, it is found that both FLC and ANFIS controllers gives better performance than PI controller.

Weight and component losses of wood after the biotreatment were the following: weight (5%), glucans (1.5%), xylans (4.3%), lignin (5.7%) and extractives (57.5%). The residual amount of lignin (expressed by the kappa number) in pulps from biotreated wood chips was lower than that of pulps from the undecayed control. Depending on the delignification degree, kraft biopulps presented similar or up to 4% increase in pulp yield and 20% less hexenuronic acids (HexA) than control pulps. The extended delignification with O2 decreases approximately 50% of the kappa number of the pulps and increases brightness, but had no effect in HexA reduction. The bleaching steps with chlorine dioxide (D0ED1 sequence) decreased the kappa number up to 97%, increased pulp brightness up to 84% ISO and decreased HexA amount up to 91%. The use of C. subvermispora in biopulping of E. globulus generated important benefits during the production of kraft pulps that are reflected in a high pulp yield, low residual lignin content, low HexA amount, high brightness and viscosity of the biopulps as compared with pulps produced from untreated wood chips.",

MSW leachate rates less than 750 kg ha-1 day-1 of BOD provided no elevation of contaminant concentrations to critical levels during the experiment period and, therefore, these rates can be used.

    "abstract": "Electrical energy, solar energy, and/or direct combustion of a fuel are the most common thermal sources for home water heating. In recent years, the use of solar energy has become popular because it is a renewable and economic energy source. Among the solar collectors, those assisted by thermosyphons are more efficient; therefore, they can enhance the heat transfer to water. A thermosyphon is basically a sealed tube filled with a working fluid and, normally, it has three regions: the evaporator, the adiabatic section and the condenser. The great advantage of this device is that the thermal resistance to heat transfer between its regions is very small, and as a result, there is a small temperature difference. This article aims to model a thermosyphon by using correlations based on its operation limits. This modeling will be used as a design tool for compact solar collectors assisted by thermosyphons. Based on the results obtained with the mathematical modeling, one copper thermosyphon, with deionized water as the working fluid, was developed and experimentally tested. The tests were carried out for a heat load varying from 30 to 60W in a vertical position. The theoretical and experimental results were compared to verify the mathematical model.",

We also perform calculations on two subseries corresponding to the periods before and after 1970, where the second period is characterised by a significant increase of positive trend in rainfall intensity. We find no significant change in behaviour between these two subseries and the entire series, indicating that the dynamics of the underlying process did not change.

    "abstract": "Biosurfactants are molecules synthesized by a wide variety of microorganisms They are characterized by the ability to reduce surface tension and act in the dispersion, solubilization, mobilization, removal and viscosity of petroleum and its derivatives. The aim of this study was to produce biosurfactant using the filamentous fungus M. circinelloides in cultivation with previously established conditions to evaluate its properties, characterize the chemical structure and investigate the application of the biomolecule in the hydrocarbon recovery. Biosurfactant yield was 6.0 g L -1 . The surface tension was reduced to 26 mN m -1 with a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 1.5%. The biosurfactant exhibited stability to surface tension under adverse environmental conditions. M. circinelloides surfactant is similar to chemical surfactants for presenting Oil displacement area of 50 cm2 in water-in-oil dispersion, as well as reduce the oil viscosity from 843.6 to 14.7 cP. Physical-chemical analyzes showed that the biosurfactant produced is a lipopeptide. The cationic character was identified by performing the zeta potential. The biosurfactant demonstrated no toxicity and recovered 95.9% of motor oil adsorbed on a clay soil sample, presenting considerable potential for use in bioremediation processes, especially in the petroleum industry.",

Then, it is necessary to characterize and determine their bioactive compounds, their cytotoxic, mutagenic and/or antitumor properties, in order to guarantee food safety and its beneficial coadjuvant effects. The ginger rhizomes were dried at temperatures 40, 60, and 80°C and the bioactive compounds were extracted with methanol and ethanol (70:30 and 95:5). The rhizomes showed to be intermediate source of vitamin C. The highest levels of anthocyanins and yellow flavonoids were dried at 40°C. The highest content of phenolic compounds was for the extracts MeOH 70:30 and EtOH 70:30 at 80°C and for flavonoids MeOH 95:5 at 40°C. Data showed a positive correlation with the content of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant activity. The EtOH 70:30 extract at 80°C, did not present a cytotoxic effect, by calculating the mitotic index, or mutagen, by the evaluation of the chromosomal alterations, for the Allium cepa L. This extract showed a cytotoxic effect for human kidney tumor cells, by MTT test, for all concentrations tested and in the two evaluation times. The data serve as basis for the consumption of ginger, with a high content of bioactive compounds, with no harmful effect for the normal cells studied and with antitumor potential.",

The heat pipes were produced using copper tubes with an outer diameter of 9.45 mm and a length of 200 mm, and were tested horizontally at increasing heat loads varying from 5 to 35 W. The working fluid used was distilled water. The experimental results showed that all capillary structures for heat pipes worked successfully, so the studied manufacturing methods are suitable. Nonetheless, the hybrid heat pipe is the best, due to the lowest thermal resistance presented.",

The activity was evaluated under optimal (65°C/ pH = 4.5) and non-optimal conditions of temperature and pH and its stability was evaluated during storage at 8°C. The enzyme solution was processed at 9.5 W L-1, 40 kHz, 23°C and at pH 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, for up to 120 min. The activity was measured at 35, 65 and 80°C. The US process was able to increase, reduce or not alter the enzymatic activity, depending on the conditions applied. These modifications depended on the pH of the enzyme solution, the ultrasound processing time and the activity temperature. In different ultrasound conditions, mainly at 35 and 65°C, the enzyme activity did not change, demonstrating that this technology can be used for other purposes, such as microbial inactivation, without affecting the enzyme. The activity increase (up to 15%) occurred under non-optimal pH and temperature conditions (pH 3.5 or 5.5/ 80°C), suggesting that ultrasound promoted stabilization and enzymatic protection. This result is interesting in the starch saccharification, which requires the enzymatic reaction at high temperatures. Therefore, such results can increase the application range of this enzyme in different industrial applications.",

Based on recent literature review, this article discusses the green wedges, green belts and greenway planning models in order to evaluate their capability in answering contemporary ecological and social issues. The article presents a conceptual overview of the selected planning models through a recent literature review, looking at the fundamental concepts of green infrastructure; then, it enlightens the connections between the spatial forms and the functions derived of these forms. These three models are connected infrastructures, varying between the ring, the star or linear forms. What differs the most is the capacity to encompass existing patches like forests or other valuable areas and the proximity and distribution of green spaces throughout the city. Whilst green belts, for their fringe condition, distance itself from the majority of inner-city dwellers, both green wedges and greenways can cross the urban fabric, and reach a greater number of neighborhoods, although the simple existence of these features does not guarantee their social functions. These findings have significant implications for the design of city expansions and can help to configure better neighborhoods in growing cities.",

While wheat and oat brans are still the conventional sources of fiber for human consumption, other new fibrous products have been developed – at research level – from waste or by-products generated by food industries. This research aimed to develop a new dehydrated food product - peach palm fibrous flour - from the waste generated during the processing of the heart-of-peach palm. The average yield in dry weight from this waste into farinaceous products was 129.8 g kg-1. The flours showed high values for the total dietary fiber, 59.1 to 65.5 g 100 g-1, almost entirely represented by the insoluble fiber, as well as a low proportion of calories - 96.1 to 101.1 kcal or 408.2-429.5 kJ per 100 g of product - when compared to wheat bran. These results highlighted the peach palm flour as a potential source of fiber for human nutrition, particularly as fibrous ingredient of formulated food and functional supplements. Also, it contributes to minimizing waste disposal and to the agribusiness of peach palm grown for heart-of-palm production.",

The massifs with high erosive resistance tend to have convex general form and low MCI and TCI. Those with low resistance have concave form and high MCI and TCI. The diagram of TCI vs. MCI permits to distinguish erosive characteristics of massifs according to their constituent rocks.

Results of confidence intervals indicated statistical equivalence between MOE values obtained by means of both methods, thus corroborating the simple mathematical model proposed by ABNT NBR14810 (ABNT, 2006). Panels produced with up to 15% oat hulls (Treatments 1 to 6) showed the highest average MOE values. The methods employed to obtain MOE in static bending were statistically equivalent.

Yacon is a root with approximately 90% w.b. of moisture content, whose high concentration of fructooligosacharydes and antioxidants has gained attention in the food research field. Yacon slices were osmotically dehydrated for 2 hours in a sucralose solution and then dried in a convective tray dryer for 2 hours, varying the osmotic solution's temperature and stirring rate and temperature of the drying air. All thermophysical properties were determined during the drying process at 30-minute intervals. The thermophysical properties were determined not only experimentally but also calculated by models available in literature based on the product's centesimal composition. A satisfactory agreement between experimental and predicted results was obtained. Further, empirical models obtained by nonlinear regression were successfully fitted to the experimental data, as a function of moisture content, within a 94% - 3% w.b. range.",

It is obtained by organic solvent extraction of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). Microencapsulation is a good alternative to transform liquid food flavorings free-flowing powders and to improve stability of protection of compounds of interest. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess microencapsulation by spray drying of turmeric oleoresin using blends of maltodextrin-gelatin and starch-gelatin, evaluating its sorption isotherms and the storage stability at different temperatures. Turmeric oleoresin encapsulated was stored at - 20, 25 and 60°C, in the absence of light, and at 25ºC in the presence of light, and analyzed over a period of 35 days for curcumin and total phenolic contents and color. The encapsulation efficiency was 72.3% for capsules with starch-gelatin blends and 52.1% with maltodextrin-gelatin blends. Besides the greater encapsulation efficiency, starch-gelatin blends also showed greater stability during storage and retention of curcumin and phenolic compounds. Encapsulated materials were more stable during storage at - 20ºC and less stable at 25°C in the presence of light. Water adsorption of turmeric oleoresin microcapsules were well described by GAB model and the microcapsules produced with starch-gelatin blends showed high hygroscopic behavior.",

    "abstract": "The biogas is an alternative fuel produced by the biomass anaerobic digestion (organic waste) and is composed by methane and carbon dioxide. The shift in the composition of biogas is very important because it increases its use viability as biofuel. The remotion of carbon dioxide (CO2) increases the methane (CH4) concentration in biogas composition, making its heating value higher. A decrease of acid hydrosulphide (H2S) concentration reduces the corrosion produced during the use of biogas in thermal systems for the secondary energy production. This work aimed to develop a physical and chemical mechanism for biogas CO2 remotion. The device developed was an absorption column stuffed of 250 cm high and 30 cm of diameter, using pipe of PVC rigid of 20 mm of diameter as stuff and water as solvent. Tests were done with inside pressure and gas flow in the column between 300 and 500 kPa and 190 and 670 cm3/s. The original biogas has a concentration of 33% CO2. With the utilization of the column absorption a reduction in CO2 concentration of 15% was obtained, which showed an increasing of 57% in the lower heating value of biogas per unit of mass",

The objective of this study is to investigate whether the sewage of the Maringá Regional University Hospital (HUM) has pathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotics. The samples were collected at two sites, one from the entire hospital and the other from the blood bank. 100 mL were inserted in dilutions of 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 in cultures Mac Conkey Agar, Salmonella-Shigella Agar, Mannitol Salt Agar and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar. The samples were subjected to bacterial identification and antibiogram. The identification was based on bacterioscopy by Gram staining, and biochemical evidence. The antibiograms were made in accordance with the disk diffusion methodology in Müeller-Hinton agar, and 12 antibiotics were used in these tests. They were isolated and 39 samples were identified; of these, 18 species showed resistance and moderate resistance to at least one antibiotic. Bacteria isolated and identified as K. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and C. freundii showed resistance to almost all tested antibiotics. It was found that the HUM releases bacteria with multi-resistant to certain antibiotics into the public sewage system. Therefore, it becomes to deploy an efficient system of treating effluents in the HUM.",

Brazilian regulations are now characterizing odors as a form of air pollution and state that odor discomfort on surrounding populations must be avoided by industries. No olfactometry-related technology is standardized or even recognized. This makes it vital to create a federal reference, at least methodological, on the subject. Thus, the present work had the objective to apply, adjust, and evaluate the results of different olfactometric techniques in three types of industries which are known as odorous. The points of most significant odor emission to wastewater treatment plants were located at the system inputs. The techniques that were used are based on international standards and regulations. In all case studies, the applied odor assessment methods (odor intensity, quality, hedonic character and concentration) were found to be satisfactory for representing the odor situation. The method presented in this paper for evaluating the hedonic tone proved to be very convenient. These methodologies allowed for the results to be presented in a numerical form, providing with objective results from subjective analyses.",

The WCP had the pH adjusted with lime to values close to 7.0 and the nutrient concentration changed to obtain a BOD/N/P ratio of 100/5/1. As a result, hydraulic retention times longer than 160 h in all treatment systems during phase III had not promoted greater efficiencies for removal compared with the phase I, because the recovery time of the systems was inadequate.

The proposed formulation allows the consideration of short or long fibers placed arbitrarily inside a continuum domain (matrix). The most important feature of the formulation is that no additional degree of freedom is introduced in the pre-existent finite element numerical system to consider any distribution or quantity of fiber inclusions. In other words, the size of the system of equations used to solve a non-reinforced medium is the same as the one used to solve the reinforced counterpart. Another important characteristic of the formulation is the reduced work required by the user to introduce reinforcements, avoiding \"rebar\" elements, node by node geometrical definitions or even complex mesh generation. Bounded connection between long fibers and continuum is considered, for short fibers a simplified approach is proposed to consider splitting. Non-associative plasticity is adopted for the continuum and one dimensional plasticity is adopted to model fibers. Examples are presented in order to show the capabilities of the formulation.",

    "abstract": "There are different methods developed to aid decision makers. Multicriteria processes are emphasized and demand adequate analysis and synthesis of the available information. Objective and subjective variables (for instance: cost, perception, quantities, productivity and environment) must be simplified in order to obtain the best solution. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides a good answer for the quantitative measurement in multivariable decision problems. The method allows decomposition and synthesis of selected criteria, in a comparative process with prioritization of the best alternative. In this paper the AHP method was applied for the selection of a solid waste truck-compactor.",

    "abstract": "Urban rivers are exposed to great degradations and alterations in their water and morphology caused by human actions in the watershed. The present work sought to evaluate these questions through a case study developed in an urban watershed in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. To that end, different procedures were used, such as field surveys, interviews with local inhabitants, use of satellite imagery and evaluation of river morphology by bathymetry to check for channel instability. It was possible to conclude that a great quantity of solid residues is thrown into the river and most sewage is disposed directly into the stream channel. Moreover, the increase in sediment production from civil construction has created sedimentation on the outlet. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that the lack of infrastructure and environmental education are reflected on the channel’s alterations.",

To determine the performance of transformer, it is necessary to have investigations on ageing of transformer oil due to thermal degradation. In this work an effort has been made to analyze various critical parameters like acidity, Breakdown Voltage (BDV), viscosity, volume resistivity, loss tangent, dielectric constant and spectral response for different range of thermal degradation of transformer oil with various compositions of materials like pressboard and Kraft paper. As initiative an exclusive Thermal-UltraViolet (UV) analysis has been carried out to investigate the spectral response of transformer oil. By estimating the condition of oil, the unexpected failure of transformer and power outages can be prevented.",

The green seaweed Caulerpa cupressoides var. lycopodium sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) demonstrated anticoagulant (in vitro) and anti- and prothrombotic (in vivo) effects. However, their toxicity in vivo has not been fully determined. This study evaluated their toxicity in vivo in male Swiss mice. Animals (20-26 g, six group-1) received crude SP (9 mg kg-1, i.p.) or 0.9% saline (0.1 mL 10 g-1, i.p.) for 14 consecutive days, and then analyzed the wet weight of animal’s body organs-1 and biochemical/hematological parameters. Histopathological evaluation was also performed related to crude SP treatment. The results showed that crude SP did not cause toxicity and mortality. Regarding the biochemical analyses, crude SP did not lead to hepatic or renal dysfunctions, but affected (p &lt; 0.05) the platelet count (1530.75 ± 1.05 × 103 µL-1) compared with the control (969.75 ± 0.51 × 103 µL-1) according to the hematological evaluation. Although histological changes in the liver and kidney have occurred, results suggested reversibility. The increased spleen size (p &lt; 0.05) also had no toxicological significance based on histopathological analysis. Therefore, crude SP from C. cupressoides could represent safe pharmacological tool in future studies on immunomodulation and thrombosis in vivo.",

Because more than 60% of the study area has weak or very weak potential fragility grades, the natural characteristics of the basin may be considered appropriate. Regarding the environmental fragility, i.e. taking into account human actions, the basin has more than 50% of its area with weak or very weak grades. However, more than 40% of the study area has environmental fragility above their potential fragility grades. This situation indicates the presence of intensive land uses beyond natural landscape restoration processes. These sectors require that stricter territory management policies be implemented.",

Additionally, a semi-empirical equation for prediction of DL is derived using dimensional analysis and multiple linear regression technique. The performance of the produced equation was compared to five empirical prediction equations of DL selected from literature. It presented correlation coefficient r2 = 0.87, suggesting that this equation is suitable for the estimation of DL in streams.

The nutritional quality of the lipid fraction was evaluated by the index of thrombogenicity (IT), index of atherogenicity (IA) and the hypocholesterolaemic fatty acids-to-hypercholesterolaemic fatty acids ratio (h/H). All the studied species presented a high protein content (12.88-21.61%) and a low amount of total lipid (0.26-4.07%). The pink shrimp had the most protein and octopus contained the least total lipid. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were detected in all samples, presenting the highest values in mussel (204.62 and 123.57 mg 100 g-1, respectively). The analysed species presented low IT and IA values and an h/H ratio around 2 or higher, and therefore, they are considered potentially healthy foods.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to recover this valuable protein and minimize the environmental impacts. Adsorptive processes using alternative adsorbents from agroindustrial waste increase the number of alternatives for adequate final disposal of the waste and add value. The aim of this study was to develop a mesoporous activated carbon (AC) from defective coffee beans (DCB) for the adsorption of fresh whey protein. The morphological structure of the adsorbent produced was characterized, and both Raman spectroscopy, FTIR and thermal analyses were performed; and the effect of pH on the adsorption capacity (q, mg g-1) was evaluated. The characterization showed that: the AC exhibited a porous size between 33 and 43 Å, corresponding to mesoporous materials; the crystallite size (La) of AC was estimated at 9.31 ± 0.14 nm; the highest adsorption capacity value (239.1781 mg g-1) was achieved at pH 2.5 and 25ºC; and the point of zero charge of the adsorbent was at pH 2.0. The pseudo first-order model fit best to the experimental results (R2 &gt; 0.99) of whey protein adsorption onto activated carbon, and the Langmuir model was the most appropriate to represent the experimental data, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 378.4380 mg g-1, demonstrating the potential of AC obtained from DCB to adsorb fresh whey protein.",

The optimization of a fermentation medium contributes to improve the microbial production of the polymer on a large scale and make the product more accessible to the market. Factorial design and response surface were used to evaluate the concentration of sucrose, yeast extract, glutamine, glutamate and oxalic acid on the HA production by Streptococcus zooepidemicus in shake flasks. Biomass, lactate and acetate production were also studied. Yeast extract showed to be the main significant variable for all the studied responses, showing positive effect. For the HA production, glutamine was also significant and presented a positive effect. The best condition for the polymer production was 50 g L-1 of yeast extract and sucrose and 0.6 g L-1 of glutamine, glutamate and oxalic acid. In this condition, the fermentation was carried out in bioreactor with pH controlled at 8 and 0.5 vvm. HA production in bioreactor was explained by logistic regression model and the maximum concentration asymptotic of HA was 0.860 g L-1. An increase of 34% on polymer production was observed when compared to shake flask assay. Thus, it was possible to optimize the polymer production using statistical techniques.",

    "abstract": "Hydrophobic carriers can be used to improve the activity, stability and other properties of enzymes. Physical agents, like ultrasound, may also contribute to improving the dispersion and collision of the reagent molecules, decreasing the reaction time and intensifying the catalytic process. However, its effect on the enzyme activity and reaction selectivity is still not entirely understood. Here, enzyme modulation of immobilized lipases was studied under pulsed ultrasound irradiation in fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) synthesis for biodiesel production. Novozym 435® and two commercial lipases from Thermomyces lanuginosus and Rhizomucor miehei, immobilized on Octadecyl-Sepabeads were used as a biocatalyst in the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils and ethanol. The use of ultrasound associated with catalysis by the Novozym 435 increased the production of FAEE by about three times (from 8.9 to 26.4%) using soybean oil and changes were observed in the profile of the products. From the sonicated reaction, ethyl-palmitate production decreased from 23.4 to 11.7%, while the ethyl-linoleate content rose from 47.5 to 59.2%. On the other hand, the T. lanuginosus lipase was less affected by sonication with the overall production of FAEE increasing from 17.2 to 24.1%, with ethyl-palmitate and ethyl-linoleate content changing from 16.2 to 17.5% and 55.0 to 47.8%, respectively. Although the changes in the production yield are not too high, the main idea here was to show that ultrasound modulates the lipase activity as well as its respective selectivity. Thus, ultrasound, is responsible for changing the ethyl ester production, which can be applied to many other biochemical processes to improve or modulate their synthesis yield.",

    "abstract": "Cities keep growing, and in most of the cases this expansion process is hard to model and describe for planning actions. Quantitative methods are increasingly used to help planning, monitoring, and regulating urban land-use processes. Remote sensing images series are making possible different types of spatial-temporal analysis of the Earth surface. Surface albedo is a remote sensing product acquired in a long series of satellite images such as Landsat (more than 40 years of observation). Those analyses allow measuring waterproofed areas for urban drainage studies, as well as monitoring urban spreading patterns, growth vectors, and issues related to comfort and environmental quality, as well as about land use and land-use planning (directives for master plans) among others. This article shows the direct applicability of surface albedo changes as an indicator of urban land-cover changes. The current study analyzed the urban area of Petrolina County (PE) in the following periods: 2001 and 2006, 2006 and 2011, and 2011 and 2017. Such analysis uses the surface albedo variation along the time and results showed a strong correlation between increased surface albedo and urban expansion. Besides, it enabled to observe the relation between the high urban growth in the 2011-2017 period and the urban spot expansion by 14% (approximately 590 thousand square meters of territorial extension). The Urban development stood out in the Northern and Southwestern regions of Petrolina County.",

Thus, this study aimed to verify the possibility of using the time-independent general extreme value distribution (GEV) for modeling the probability of occurrence of both SPI annual maxima (the maximum monthly SPI value; SPImax) and SPI annual minima (the minimum monthly SPI value; SPImim) obtained from the weather station of Campinas, State of São Paulo, Brazil (1891-2011) and to evaluate the presence of trends, temporal persistence and periodical components in these two datasets. The goodness-of-fit tests used in this study quantify the agreement between the empirical cumulative distribution and the GEV cumulative function. Our results have indicated that such parametric function can be used to assess the probability of occurrence of SPImin and SPImax values. No significant serial correlation and no trend were detected in both series. For the SPImim, the wavelet analysis has detected a dominant mode in the 4-8 year band. Future studies should focus on the development of a GEV model capable of accounting for such feature. No dominant mode was found for the annual monthly SPI maximums.",

Moisture content d.b. of the soybeans increased from 0.12 ± 0.01 kg kg-1 to 1.45 ± 0.19 kg kg-1 during 270 min. of process. Two models were used to fit the kinetic curves: an empirical model developed by Peleg (1988) and a phenomenological one, proposed by Omoto et al. (2009). The two models adequately represented the hydration kinetics. Peleg model was applied to the experimental data and the corresponding parameters were obtained and correlated to temperature.

    "abstract": "The behavior of seaweed Sargassum filipendula during a removal of nickel from a 50 mg/L aqueous solution at pH 3.5 in fixed-bed columns operating in adsorption/desorption cycles has been studied. Two elution systems were tested; the first one operating with the direct passage of eluant and the second one with the solution recycle.Then, ten consecutive sorption-desorption cycles were investigated in two packed-bed columns, the first column was regenerated with H2SO4 (0.1 M) and the second one with MgSO4 / H2SO4 (3.5% in pH 3) in eluant recycle system. The sorption and desorption stages were carried out for about 30h and 2 h, respectively, representing 20 days of a continuous use of the biomass. A high quantity of recovered nickel was observed in the elution stages (approximately 97%). After 10 cycles, it was verified that the Sargassum filipendula biomass continued accomplishing elevated values of nickel removal from the solution, showing to be an efficient alternative treatment of wastewaters containing metals. The biomass is easily found and the regeneration presented low cost besides having facilitated the treatment process dispensing successive biomass changes.",

TiO2 and Nb2O5 were submitted to the agglomeration process (particle size: 0.210 and 0.297 mm) and calcined at 500ºC for 5h. Nb2O5 was solubilized in oxalic acid (0.5 mol L-1) at 70ºC for 8h, mixed with the glass beads, dried at 110ºC for 12h and calcined at 500ºC for 5h. The efficiency of the photocatalytic process was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and DNS method. The results showed that catalysts of Nb2O5 are promising for application in photocatalysis, mainly 15% Nb2O5 glass-1, which presented similar results to TiO2.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent microwave drying improves the quality of the dehydrated product, because reduces the effect of microwave hot spots. Mathematical modelling is essential to understand the physics of this drying process and to optimize the operation conditions. However, there are few modelling studies about intermittent microwave drying. This work proposed a mathematical model based on mass balances of liquid and vapor water in which a non-equilibrium formulation described the water phase change. The microwave heating, described by Lambert’s law, was accounting as source term on the thermal energy conservation equation. The numerical solution used the finite element method, and the experimental drying of potato samples validated the simulated drying. The values of moisture content and temperature obtained by numerical solution of the model showed good agreement with experimental data. From this, it was observed the presence of three periods in the drying kinetics: an initial heating phase almost without drying, follow by a phase with constant drying rate, and final a decrease of drying rate and temperature increasement. The model results showed that the interior temperature was higher than the surface temperature of sample, and there was water evaporation inside the potato. In additional, the gradients of temperature were reduced due to intermittency of the microwave power. This redistribution of temperature could contribute to the improvement of product quality during drying.",

    "abstract": "The success in the application of artificial pollination techniques, aspects of floral biology should receive special attention, especially regarding the viability studies of pollen grains. In this sense, two experiments were carried out, aiming to determine the floral stages: floral opening (anthesis), female, male and senescence stages of A. squamosa L flowers under tropical climate conditions, and to evaluate the germination and viability of pollen grains submitted to different storage conditions. In the first experiment, observations and data collection began when flowers were still closed. Readings were taken every two hours for 46 hours until all the flowers reached the senescence stage. For the second, the experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 x 7 factorial scheme, with 2 storage conditions (environment at 27 ± 2°C and refrigerated at 5 ± 2°C) and 7 pollen grain conditioning times (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours), with 4 repetitions for the analysis of pollen grain germination and 3 repetitions for the analysis of pollen grain viability, and each repetition consisted of one blade. The variables evaluated were percentage of viable and non-viable pollen grains and percentage of germinated and non-germinated pollen grains. For tropical climatic conditions, the flower anthesis (female stage) of the sugar-apple begins at 00:00 h, extending until 12:00h on the same day. The flowers of the tree reach a functionally staminate stage (male stage) from 6 a.m. the next day. Pollen grains stored at room conditions (27 ± 2°C) remain viable for up to 24 hours after collection, showing that storage in a cold environment at low temperatures (5 ± 2°C) is not necessary. Seed pollen grains have a germination percentage of 51.25% when stored under ambient conditions (27 ± 2°C) for up to 4 hours after collection.",

Also an empirical model is used to estimate tool wear rate and force values on the edges of the worn drill .By using the block diagram of machine tool drives, the changes in the feed and spindle motor currents are simulated, as wear rate increases. To predict tool wear rate, fuzzy logic capabilities have been used to develop an intelligent system. The simulation results presented with MATLAB software show the effectiveness of proposed system for on-line drill wear monitoring. This is confirmed by comparing the measured and estimated values with each other in which the value of R2 was obtained 0.9367 in the regression graph.",

The SACs consisted of two tanks measuring 0.40 x 0.10 x 0.15 m, constructed of glass and filled with a 0.13 m layer of pea gravel; these were installed within a BOD incubator to maintain a 20°C temperature. The SACs were not cultivated and were submitted to average TCOA concentrations of 246 (SAC1) and 328 kg ha-1 day-1 of BOD (SAC2) for 51 days. With regard to the removal of organic matter, in the form of TSS, BOD and COD, no statistical difference was verified (p > 0.05) between the SACs, being that the average removal efficiencies for the referred variables in SAC1 and SAC2 were 68 and 76%, 66 and 73%, and 55 and 58%, respectively. The models proposed by Brasil et al.

    "abstract": "Drying of agricultural products at high temperatures can be simulated by mathematical models, which intend to describe the drying process close to commercial patterns. They are based on simultaneous heat and mass transfer between the product that is losing moisture, and the air that is supplying energy to the process. All models use these balances, never allowing values of relative humidity of the air to be greater than 100%. However, it has not been common to evaluate air enthalpy, which should not have significant variation during the entire process, accepted as adiabatic. In this work, a mathematical model is proposed for fixed-bed corn (Zea mays L.) drying simulation, according to the Michigan State University (MSU) model. In the numerical solution, the enthalpy of the drying air was maintained constant as a quantitative physical indicator for correction of the heat and mass exchange in each step of the process, in order to obtain more real evaluations in all drying stages, and in the results for final moisture of the grain. As a result, greater space and time intervals for the simulation were possible. The simulation was validated by comparisons with literature results.",

Cellulase were produced in three different batches using NaOH 4% (w v-1) pre-treated sugarcane bagasse as the carbon source in the fermentation broth. The amount of the bagasse in each batch was 10, 50 and 100 g L-1. The kinetic of the cellulase production was accomplished by periodically determining the cellulasic activity of the fermentation broth using pre-treated bagasse as the hydrolysis substrate. Changes in the pH also were determined. The cellulase deactivation kinetic was accomplished by periodically determining the cellulasic activity of the fermentation broth samples stored at 4°C and at -18ºC. One may conclude that Aspergillus niger produces cellulases when grown on medium with pretreated sugarcane bagasse as carbon source. The ideal time to collect the enzymatic broth was about seven days with maximum yield of 0.0013 U mL-1∙h for the batch with 10 g L-1, and 0.0018 U mL-1∙h for the batches with 50 and 100 g L-1. The cellulase complex does not suffer considerable deactivation when stored at -18°C (freezer) for 43 days, however, the activity drops by 40% within 48 hours when stored at 4°C (fridge).",

Samples were collected along the line of treatment of each SWTP, and after laboratory procedures, analyzed by LC-MS/MS and ELISA techniques. In some samples, we verified concentrations of chemical compounds with potential to disrupt the endocrine system of living organisms. Therefore, the release of this effluent, even within the effluent discharge standards (BRASIL, 2005) or in condition to be purified by the water course, may lead to physiological changes in the organisms of the receptor water body.",

Mean weight was 12.1 &plusmn; 1.05 kg at the beginning. Lambs were fed with a mixture of 30% corn silage, 35% soybean meal, 34% oat hay, and 1% vitamins and minerals, ad libitum. Samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle were analyzed for their content in moisture, ash, crude protein, total lipids, and fatty acid profile. Oleic acid (18:1n-9) was in greater concentration than other fatty acids in all samples investigated. The concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFA) increased (p < 0.05) with an increase in slaughter weight, while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased. Lambs slaughtered at either 28 or 36 kg had an n-6/n-3 ratio (2.9 and 2.85, respectively) close to the recommended for humans (4.0 maximum). The overall results showed that slaughtering lamb at 28 kg resulted in the best meat quality as shown by nutritional indexes for humans (PUFA/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios) and concentrations of crude protein (16.02%) and total lipids (13.24%).",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the convective drying in fixed bed of yellow passion fruit bagasse. Firstly, the initial moisture of the bagasse was determined in stove, at 105 ± 3ºC for 24 hours. In the drying tests, it was collected the bagasse mass values over time, by using a convective dryer, operated at four temperatures (35, 45, 55 and 65ºC) and three air flow speeds at 0.8, 1.0 and 1.3 m s-1. Having the curves of the drying and of drying rates, it was observed that the temperature had a great influence on the bagasse drying, since as the temperature increases, the drying time is shortened, increasing thus the drying rate. The curves of drying and of drying rate were fitted to the models proposed by Page (1949 apud MOTTA LIMA et al., 2003)and Motta Lima et al. (2002), and the models set by Hogdes (1982) and Toffoli (2005 apud SANTOS et al., 2008), respectively. Other mathematical models were also fitted for each drying process, such as: Simple Exponential, Page, Henderson and Pabis, Logarithm, two-term exponential model, and Wang and Singh model. The best model was chosen by analysis of the highest R² and F-test, and the lowest root mean square error.",

The experiment followed a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of diets containing: untreated cashew nut meal; cashew nut meal treated with antioxidant on zero day of storage, and cashew nut meal treated with antioxidant on 21st day of storage. At 42 days old, broilers were slaughtered. Breast and abdominal fat of each bird were identified, weighed, frozen stored for subsequent analysis. The variables studied were: pH, water holding capacity, cooking losses and shear force, in the meat and color of the meat and of the abdominal fat. Treatments did not affect (p > 0.05) the evaluated parameters. However, the yellowness (component b*) of the abdominal fat was higher in birds fed the diet containing meal treated with antioxidant at storage day zero. In conclusion, the cashew nut meal can be stored for 35 days without antioxidant, but in order to achieve intense yellowness in abdominal fat of broilers 500 ppm antioxidant addition is required, at the beginning of storage.",

    "abstract": "Due to growing electricity demand, cheap renewable energy sources are needed. Fuel cells are an interesting alternative for generating electricity since they use hydrogen as their main fuel and release only water and heat to the environment. Although fuel cells show great flexibility in size and operating temperature (some models even operate at low temperatures), the technology has the drawback for hydrogen transportation and storage. However, hydrogen may be produced from methanol steam reforming obtained from renewable sources such as biomass. The use of methanol as raw material in hydrogen production process by steam reforming is highly interesting owing to the fact that alcohol has the best hydrogen carbon-1 ratio (4:1) and may be processed at low temperatures and atmospheric pressures. They are features which are desirable for its use in autonomous fuel cells. Current research develops a mathematical model of an isothermal methanol steam reforming reactor and validates it against experimental data from the literature. The mathematical model was solved numerically by MATLAB® and the comparison of its predictions for different experimental conditions indicated that the developed model and the methodology for its numerical solution were adequate. Further, a preliminary analysis was undertaken on methanol steam reforming reactor project for autonomous fuel cell.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combinations of soaking temperature and time during the parboiling on the technological, physicochemical and sensory quality of two upland rice cultivars. The milling degree for BRS Primavera and BRS Sertaneja cultivars ranged from 7.11 to 8.89 g100 g-1 and 7.62 to 8.91 g 100 g-1and the head yield from 63.77 to 69.26 g 100 g-1 and from 73.22 to 75.40 g 100 g-1, respectively. The ash content for parboiled BRS Sertaneja increased up to 68%; regarding protein, the content increased up to 10% and for lipids, the values increased up to 86%, approximately, after processing. The higher the soaking temperature, the lower the milling degree and head yield. The parboiled rice BRS Primavera achieved higher contents of ash and lipid in relation to non-parboiled milled rice, while the BRS Sertaneja obtained higher ash, protein, lipid, and crude fiber contents. Parboiled rice samples had higher yield and cooking time than milled rice samples. The condition of soaking at 65°C for 60 min. and 60oC for 112 min. was sufficient for the acceptance of all sensory attributes evaluated in BRS Primavera, and 65oC for 420 min. in BRS Sertaneja.",

Current assay analyzes the clarification of sugarcane juice in a laboratory carbonatation process. Assays were performed randomly with a two-level factorial design with three replications at the center point to evaluate the effect of pH and carbon dioxide flow in clarification. Process efficiency was assessed according to rates of starch removal, ICUMSA color and calcium left in the juice. Rates of starch removal at 89.19 and 85.75% and of ICUMSA color at 92.93 and 91.66% were obtained, respectively, in assays with carbon dioxide flow at 200 NL h-1 and pH at 8.0 and 9.0.

It was included 0, 5, 10 and 15% of the dehydrated mixture in the dough of the cake. Moisture and lipid contents were not modified (p &gt;0.05) when the mixture was included in the cake. There was a positive linear effect for crude protein (y=6.24 + 0.29x, R²=0.77) and mineral (y=0.60 + 0.19x, R²=0.85). Carbohydrate and calorie contents decreased linearly (p &lt;0.01) according to increasing levels of the mixture in the cake. With regard to sensory analysis, there was a negative linear effect for taste (y=7.48 – 0.07x, R2=0.98), texture (y=7.48 – 0.047x, R2=0.93), acceptance (y=7.13 – 0.046x, R2=0.99) and purchase intention (y=3.82 – 0.039x, R2=0.93), demonstrating that increasing levels of inclusion of the dehydrated mixture caused a decrease in the acceptance of the cake. It can be concluded that the inclusion of up to 15% of salmon and tilapia dehydrated mixture in spinach cake increases the contents of crude protein and mineral matter, and reduces the carbohydrate content and calorie. However, based on the sensory results, it is recommended to include 10% of the dehydrated mixture of fish in the spinach cake.",

    "abstract": "Social media has significantly influenced modern lifestyle and the way in which most of the industries operate their business. Social media data refers to the contents created by users during their social interactions in the form of text, sound, visuals, etc. It has now evolved as the major source of information for different industry verticals like retail, marketing, advertising, tourism, hospitality, education, etc. The huge volume of data resulted in the necessity for better and efficient procedures for personalized information retrieval. Traditional data mining and information retrieval techniques based on content-based and/or collaborative filtering proved computationally costly and less scalable against the volume it must deal with. Adoption of clustering techniques is a potential solution for this problem as it can minimize the amount of data required to be managed in industrial applications like recommender systems. This empirical research focuses on evaluating multiple clustering algorithms with the goal of finding an ideal solution for clustering numerical data extracted from social media sources. Three different publicly available datasets with varying number of attributes and records from tourism domain are used for the experiments conducted as part of this work",

    "abstract": "There is a huge information stockpile available on the internet. But the available information still throws a stiff challenge to users while selecting the needed information. Such an issue can be solved by applying information filtering for locating the required information through a Recommender System. While using a RS, the users find it easy to curate and collect relevant information out of massive databanks. Though various types of RS are currently available, yet the RS developed by Collaborative Filtering techniques has proven to be the most suitable for many problems. Among the various Recommended Systems available, movie recommendation system is the most widely used one. In this system, the recommendations will be made based on the similarities in the characteristics as exhibited by users / items. The movie recommendation system contains a huge list of user objects and item objects. This paper combines Collaborative Filtering Technique with association rules mining for better compatibility and assurance while delivering better recommendations. Hence, in the process, the produced recommendations can be considered as strong recommendations. The hybridization involving both collaborative filtering and association rules mining can provide strong, high-quality recommendations, even when enough data is unavailable. This article combines various recommendations for creating a movie recommendation system by using common filtering techniques and data mining techniques",

The studies were carried out through computer simulations, with an EMTP (Electromagnetic Transients Program) type software. A power system with high penetration of such renewable generations was modeled and several contingency scenarios were simulated in a transmission line that performs the connection of the wind power plant to the grid. The scenarios included the variation of parameters such as fault type, inception instant angles, resistance, and distance, to explore the main differences between the contributions to the fault of a wind power plant and conventional generation. Among the atypical analyzed characteristics, the following can be highlighted: the absence of the DC (Direct Current) component for Full-Converter generation, independent of fault inception instant angle and distance variation; low levels of the fault contributions at the wind power plant terminal; low levels of voltages at the wind power plant terminal, evidencing the high SIR (Source Impedance Ratio) characteristic of these generations; atypical relations between the fault resistance and measured currents; and others. The obtained results show the importance of further studies on the impacts of inverter-based generations on fault currents and voltages, allowing developments that are able to improve control and protection systems for grids with high penetration of this wind generation topologies",

In order to reduce latency, fog computing can handle a significant amount of computation for time-sensitive IoT applications. The Fog layer is simultaneously vulnerable to numerous assaults. To defend the fog nodes from attacks, fog computing paradigms may be suited for deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this paper, a combined Ensemble Intrusion Detection Model using Deep learning with Efficient Feature Selection using Random forests is proposed for Fog Computing Environments by using two deep learning models of traditional CNN and IDS-AlexNet model called Ensemble CNN-IDS with Random Forest and showed this model gives high accuracy of attack detection. The respective model implementations demonstrated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset that consists of 9 classes of attacks namely Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcodes and Worms. The proposed combined Ensemble Intrusion Detection Model using Deep learning with Efficient Feature Selection for intrusions detection is shown to be accurate and efficient by using different classifiers. Our proposed model provides high the accuracy in attack detection of about 97.5% that it outperformed various other traditional and recent models.",

It is responsible for moving, according to Agência Nacional de Transportes Aquaviários (Antaq, 2018), approximately 9.8 million passengers and 3.4 million tons of cargo distributed by state, interstate longitudinal transport interstate and crossing. However, despite the great importance, there are several blockages related to the conditions of the roads and vessels in certain routes. The study in question proposes the use of a mathematical tool to analyze vessels from the relative efficiency involving parameters of input and output for two analysis scenarios: Energy Efficiency Analysis and Modality Analysis, being analyzed variables such as power, consumption, total time of the trip, total distance of the line of action, passenger capacity and ticket price. For that, the data of 652 vessels used in the Amazon region registered in the Brazilian states (Pará, Amazonas, Amapá and Rondônia) were verified, and from these data, a sample space of 148 vessels from the same utilization level was selected. With these data, a model was developed using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology, with the aid of the DEA-Solver software. After the use of the solver, the relative efficiency indexes of each vessel were obtained, allowing to rank and measure the efficient and inefficient Decision Units (DMU'S). Lastly, analysis of the general characteristics of efficient vessels were made in order to stratify the parameters that may have transformed them into efficient DMU`s, making it possible to trace a profile of the type of vessel employed in each type of line, thus helping in decision making of new projects.",

    "abstract": "A recent study shows that the most commonly used app stores, iOS app store and Android's play store had up to 2 million apps from where users can explore, purchase, share, download and install applications on a single click. More and more apps are being added daily which makes the app stores a large software repository. An enormous amount of data is provided by the end users in the form of user reviews. This data can provide valuable insights for acquiring requirements. User reviews include plenty of information as they contain information about faulty features (Bug reports), ideas for new features and improvements (feature requests), or user experience that can help app developers and vendors to achieve software enhancement and evolution tasks. As feature requests are the ones that are most helpful for the purpose of eliciting new requirements, the work is done on feature requests out of the 3 categories mentioned above. This study is conducted to provide a general approach that extracts feature request from user reviews. The proposed approach has five main building blocks, namely, (i) Extraction of Feature Requests, (ii) Feature Extraction from Feature Requests, (iii) topic modelling, (iv) sentiment analysis and (v) Classification into Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR). Firstly, it finds the feature requests out of the reviews, then perform extraction of features from feature requests, then further work on grouping the features into topics, next apply sentiment analysis to mine the user opinions on the extracted topic and finally group them into Functional and Non-Functional requirements.

    "abstract": "Typical constructed wetlands (CW) sizing methods in tropical countries rarely considers climate parameters as evapotranspiration (EPT) and rainfall (Ra), even though high levels of EPT and Ra can change the pollutant removal kinetic and Wastewater hydrodynamic. This paper aims to evaluate the climatic influences (EPT and Ra) on fit of several kinetic-hydrodynamic models used to describe the sewage organic matter removal in a real scale vertical (VSSF-CW) and horizontal (HSSF-CW) subsurface flow constructed wetland. Sewage quality (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - BOD and Chemical Oxygen Demand - COD) and sewage flow rates data were applied of First Order, Grau-Second Order, Monod, Monod Multi and Stover-Kincannon kinetic models, combined with ideal continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and plug-flow reactor (PF) hydrodynamic models. Monod, Monod Multi and Stover-Kincannon models (in CSTR) were more able to represent organic matter removal in CWs. Models considering EPT and Ra were more adequate or with no statistical difference compared with conventional models (that don’t consider EPT and Ra), except for BOD in VSSF-CW.",

    "abstract": "There is still a lack of standardized methodology in the cryopreservation of Salmo trutta f. fario sperm. Thus, the present study was designed to compare current freezing protocols to improve and as well as to examine the post-thaw quality and fertilizing ability of cryopreserved sperm in Salmo trutta f. fario. Sperm samples were diluted at a 1:10 ratio in one of three extenders (Alsever’s solution, glucose-based, and ionic-based) containing four types of cryoprotectant (DMSO, DMA, MeOH, glycerol) at 10% concentration and frozen in 0.1 mL pellets on surface of the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, 79°C) or in 0.25 mL straws 2 cm above of the liquid nitrogen (LN2) surface at a rate of ~30°C for 10 min.1 before storage in a mL cryotank (-196°C). The frozen sperm cells in straws and pellets were thawed in a water bath at 25°C for 30 s and at 20°C for 6 s respectively. Fertilization was carried out using a ratio of 5x105 sperm/egg in both freezing methods. The glucose-based solution including glycerol produced the highest post-thaw progressive motility (62.5 ± 1.24%), motility duration (57.2 ± 0.46 s), and viability (56.4 ± 1.57%) (p &lt; 005) in the straw method. In breeding trials, similarly, sperm frozen-thawed with the glucose-based solution including glycerol produced the highest fertilization (54.2 ± 0.36%) and hatching (30.6 ± 0.28%) in the straw method. Fresh sperm used as control produced 82.6 ± 0.45% and 78.4 ± 1.27% fertilization and hatching respectively. It was concluded that sperm frozen in straws produced higher post-thaw sperm motility and fertility of eggs than those frozen in pellets. Also, the results suggest using of glycerol-supplemented glucose solution because of producing better results in both freezing techniques.",

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the influence of biofilm on the reactor fluid dynamic behavior, through the analysis of a few important parameters, such as minimum fluidization velocity, bed expansion and porosity, and particle terminal velocity. The main objective of the present work was to investigate the fluid dynamics of an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor, having activated carbon particles as support media for biomass immobilization. Reactor performance was tested using synthetic residual water, which was prepared using the solution employed in BOD determination. The results showed that the presence of immobilized biomass increased particle density and altered the main fluid dynamic parameters investigated.",

There was monitoring of temperature, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), C, N, C/N ratio and reduction of mass and volume. In the controlled treatments, the thermophilic phase was lower, the moisture was in the ideal ratio for the process (with lower values in the natural treatments), and there was a decrease of 3-4 times of the values of EC and the higher reductions of mass and volume. In all treatments, the values of pH were neutral and the C/N ratio declined 37-50%, assuming final values of matured composts.

A pilot nanofiltration unit, operating in the tangential flow, provided with a membrane in the spiral configuration, Model NF90-4040 (Dow Filmtec Membranes) was used. Two types of fortified water with carbamates were performed: distilled water and pond water.

Thus, six homogeneous regions with annual mean precipitation were determined through a cluster analysis using Ward's agglomeration method and applied to a historical series of 31 years (1960-1990) at 413 satellite monitoring points in the state of Pará, where the selected years occurred during an El Niño or a La Niña event. When adjusting the probability models, the chi-square test was applied to 413 monitoring points spread over the six homogeneous regions during years with a La Niña or an El Niño, as well as the complete set of years. The normal model (i.e., the normal function) had the best fit, with chi-square values below 3.84 (tabulated chi-square values). The model was validated using 12 rainfall stations of the National Water Agency (ANA), which were distributed across the six homogeneous regions. In this case, the chi-square test for the 12 stations also had values lower than 3.84. A good fit between the observed and the regionalized data demonstrated the potential of the methodology developed and used for estimating annual average precipitation probabilities.",

The two scenarios are verified using numerical procedure, CFD tools, for two types of twisted tapes: short width twisted tape and center cleared twisted tape. The results show that in both types, using alternate axes improved thermal properties. Also the tube friction factor which represents the flow resistance grows with alternate axes twisted tapes. Investigation of regularly spaced twisted tapes also showed that putting the tapes in closer distance can improve flow disturbance. While rotating the middle part helped the flow disturbance, the amount of rotation is also important.

Furthermore, the setup time between the executions of two tasks depends on both, the task sequence and its associated machine. A metaheuristic genetic algorithm and a variable neighborhood search were used in order to solve the problem due to the difference among their characteristics. The maximal time for the schedule to be completed, also called makespan, was the performance measure used to evaluate the solutions.

    "abstract": "Currently, methods used for pavement design are empirical and based on experiments conducted in the 1960s. Due to the number of variables that can influence an empirical analysis, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) proposed a mechanistic-empirical method. Based on this method, the MEPDG (Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide) software was developed and later, its improved version, the AASHTO Ware Pavement ME Design. In both software versions, default values were developed from traffic data of the United States. However, characteristics of the Brazilian traffic are different from characteristics in the United States. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the effect on national pavement performance due to the use of the default axle load spectra that are available on both software versions. Thus, computer simulations were performed using Brazilian axle load spectra, based on data collected at the Imigrantes Highway in São Paulo, and using the default load spectra of the software. The results show that the Brazilian axle load spectra studied damages more the national pavement than the default spectra of the software. Therefore, it is not recommended the use of default spectra for designing Brazilian highways similar to the one studied, because this would lead to under-designed structures.",

As doses of monensin increased, final body weight, average daily gain, gain-to-feed ratio, and dressing percentage were affected cubically (P &lt; 0.03), where animals fed 9 ppm of monensin presented greater average daily gain and better gain-to-feed ratio. Likewise, as dose of monensin increased, dry matter intake, hot carcass weight, and neutral detergent fiber and fecal starch digestibility in finishing period decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, neutral detergent fiber digestibility in adaptation period in creased linearly (P = 0.01) as doses of monensin increased. Thus, based on the results of this study, if monens in is going to be included in finishing diets for feedlot Nellore cattle, the dose of 9 ppm should be considered as the most feasible option.",

The coefficient of experimental variation (CVe) is the factor with the greatest influence for the experimental plot design; followed by the parameters - index d, which determines the difference to be detected between treatments; by the number of replications and, finally, by the number of treatments, which has the smallest effect on the plot size (BEUs). For the efficiency of use of the experimental area - EUEA, one can select larger plots (three BEU) with a lower number of repetitions (three) or smaller plots (two UEB) with a higher number of repetitions (10) with the same level of accuracy to evaluate the yield of ‘Gigante’ cactus pear. However, the selection criteria are based on the smallest experimental area, reflecting the maximum of EUEA.

Cut flowers require the use of technologies to improve postharvest quality and floral longevity. This research aimed to study the postharvest conservation of inflorescences of Alstroemeria cv. Ajax at different storage temperatures. Floral stems were placed in containers with distilled water and stored at four temperatures (4, 8, 12, and 22ºC) for 12 days. The following analyses were performed: fresh mass variation, respiratory activity, relative water content, soluble and reducing carbohydrate contents, polyphenol-oxidase and peroxidase enzymes, pigments (anthocyanin and carotenoids), and longevity. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, the results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the effect of treatments submitted to F-test. Significant differences were compared using the least significant difference (LSD) at 95% confidence interval (p ≤ 0. 05). The temperatures of 8 and 12ºC were effective in maintaining the postharvest quality of inflorescences during storage period, as they remained turgid due to transpiration reduction caused by low temperatures, and longevity reaching 46 and 22 days, respectively.",

Several researches have demonstrated this effect through studies in specific localities. As deposition of particulate matter varies according to locality, these results cannot be generalized or used in other places, since these studies do not characterize their local dust. Considering these research opportunities, this paper evaluates the deposition effects on photovoltaic modules by different types of dust from anthropogenic activities recurrent in urban areas, a typical situation of distributed microgeneration. Particulate matter of iron ore, building construction, quarry, and mineral coal are characterized morphologically and dimensionally. Then, their effects on photovoltaic module performance are analyzed under different deposition densities according to typical urban deposition rates. The results show that the different dust materials studied attenuate the power generation capacity to different extents, and superficial dust density of the particulate matter also produces different effects. These results can be used in performance and economic feasibility analyzes of photovoltaic generators in different locations with similar pollution characteristics.",

The purpose of this paper is to map and analyze the temporal evolution of vegetation distribution over the Parana river floodplain between 1976 and 2007. Orbital images from 1976 (LANDSAT MSS-1), 1987 (LANDSAT TM-5), 2000 (LANDSAT ETM+7) and 2007 (CBERS-2 CCD) were utilized to compare the evolution of the vegetation distribution over that time period. The images were georeferenced using SPRING 4.3.3 software and classified by the Bhattacharya algorithm; the maps were produced using the Global Mapper 7.4 software. Three different classes of vegetation, water bodies and exposed soil areas were distinguished for each studied year. The comparison of the generated vegetation maps showed a significant enlargement of the water bodies and a position change of the humid vegetation areas between 1976 and 1987, among other small modifications in the referred classes between 1987 and 2007. This indicates that the major river floods modified the morphology of the floodplain, and that the continuous enlargement of the exposed soil areas, along with the reduction of the vegetation areas, showed that anthropic action over the floodplain has increased over the years.",

Three different depths were measured in this study (1, 2 and 3 mm), and photoactivation methods including a halogen lamp, a LED and an argon ion laser were used. In contrast to other studies, the conditions for each photoactivation source such as the exposure time and the same power density were considered and kept the same. It was also shown that increasing the depth lowered the VHN. At each of the depths, it was observed that the three light sources behaved similarly. The correlation between the VHN and DC% is shown. However, only a weak correlation was observed, which implies that a higher DC% value does not necessarily indicate a higher VHN.",

Stock solutions of PEG 400 and 4000 (100 and 50% w w-1, respectively) and phosphate (20% w w -1 KH2PO4/K2HPO4) were prepared at the appropriate pH (6, 7, 8 and 9). For pHs 10 and 11, NaOH 1M was used in addition to the salts. The results showed that low concentrations were used to form the ATPS with high molecular mass PEG. On the other hand, there was no pH influence in the equilibrium curves – in other words, a significant shift of the binodal in different pHs.",

The dry extract ranged from 431 g L-1 for grain alcohol treatment, 446.26 g L-1 for sugar cane spirit treatment and 443.84 g L-1 for the tangerine spirit treatment, the alcohol degree ranged from 18.84, 20.01 and 19.67 &deg;GL among the treatments. We accomplished an acceptance test through sensory analysis of the following attributes: alcoholic taste, fruit flavor, sweetness and overall impression. The liquor based on grain alcohol produced the highest mean regarding all attributes (6.32, 6.66, 6.34 e 6.26 for taste alcoholic, fruit flavor, sweetness and overall impression, respectively), but without significant difference among the treatments. In conclusion, the tangerine peel liquor made using the own fruit spirit is a viable alternative for the total use of the fruit and can be a source of income for small farmers.

FE analysis was repeated while using the commonly-used commercial optimization software HEEDS, and the rates of the same material parameters were used to validate PSO outcome. In addition, the number of optimization iterations required for PSO and HEEDS were compared to assess the speed of conversion onto a global-optimum solution. Since PSO-based analyses produced similar results with little iteration to HEEDS inverse analyses, PSO capacity in controlling the inverse analysis process to determine the cornea material properties via finite element modeling was demonstrated.",

To support the study of TV newscasts under the discourse analysis perspective, this work proposes a newscast structure to recover its main units and extract relevant data, named here as newscast discursive metadata (NDM). The NDM describes aspects, such as screen time and field size of newscasts’ participants and themes addressed. Data mining and image analysis methods are used to extract and analyze the NDM of a dataset containing 41 editions of two Brazilian newscasts.

The results demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide affects the performance of the lubricant oil and engine wear. Among the metals, we observed that the copper concentration exceeded the maximum limit recommended in the literature. As for the additives, the variation in concentrations of magnesium impacted on lubricant performance.

Accordingly, strategies have emerged aiming at replacing part of the NaCl in food formulations, including the replacement of NaCl with monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is one of the compounds responsible for the fifth basic taste, also known as umami. The present study aimed to evaluate the sensory perception in the replacement of NaCl with MSG in different formulations of fish burgers through a ranking test and word association. The results indicated that it is possible to replace up to 50% NaCl with MSG without compromising the sensory quality of the fish product and that the cognitive word association technique proved to be an important tool in the perception of fish burgers formulated with different concentrations of NaCl and MSG.",

Current research developed an application to simulate the traction capacity of agricultural tractors with front wheel assist. The application was developed with Android platform, version 2.3 'Gingerbread'. The application is intuitive and easy to operate, besides showing great flexibility. It may be used in schools and in research to optimize agricultural operations. Concordance between simulated and observed results, obtained from validation process, demonstrated the prediction capacity of the traction efficiency of agricultural tractors. Further, it has been verified that input parameters associated to surface conditions are fundamental for the simulation of traction efficiency.",

Current study evaluates the replacement of wheat flour by whole perilla at 1, 3 and 5% in white bread processing and its impacts on chemical and sensorial attributes, underscoring Omega-3 amounts. The use of whole perilla increases the Omega-3 content in white bread, balances the ratio n-6/n-3, decreases the specific volume, and maintains the concentration of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. The formulation with 1% whole perilla has a better acceptability and supplies 5.63 and 8.19% of the American recommended daily intake of alpha-linolenic acid for adult males and females, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of minimally processed fruit is increasing due to its convenience, but its shelf life is reduced when compared to fresh fruit (in natura). The effects of using tragacanth gum (Astragalus gummifer) and melaleuca essential oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) as an edible coating on minimally processed pineapples (Smooth cayenne) were investigated in this study. The pineapples were sanitized, peeled, cut into standardized pieces, and immersed in the toppings, obtaining four treatments: T1 (control); T2 (0.5 tragacanth gum and 0.2% melaleuca essential oil); T3 (0.5 tragacanth gum and 0.3% melaleuca essential oil); T4 (0.5 tragacanth gum and 0.4% melaleuca essential oil), then drained and stored in PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) containers with a lid, under refrigeration at 5±1°C for 12 days. Physicochemical and microbiological analyses were performed. The samples T2 and T4 obtained less mass loss and less decrease in total soluble solids content. The T2 sample also showed promising results by reducing the loss of texture and delaying the growth of mold and yeast in relation to the control sample over 12 days of storage. The use of tragacanth gum together with melaleuca essential oil was efficient in maintaining the quality of minimally processed pineapples for a longer time.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the automotive industry has been developing applied research to meet customer’s needs; considering safety, vehicle comfort and energetic efficiency. In particular, automotive tires have a prominent position in this research area, ensuring good vehicle handling, comfort and safety. In the vehicle dynamics performance, excellent gripping and reduced rolling resistance in the tires are crucial to maximize the energetic efficiency in a reliable way. However, to ensure such a level of reliability in vehicle operation, the inherent uncertainties of tires, as well as other factors subject to variability must be taken into account in the vehicle design. In this way, the present paper analyzes in detail the effect of variations in some parameters such as ambient temperature, ground conditions, vertical load, speed and tire inflation on the analysis of vehicle dynamics. A Metamodeling approach associated with the Monte Carlo Simulation was employed to develop the mathematical models to analyze the effect of uncertain parameters on the tire rolling resistance; traction, centripetal and lateral forces, using experimental data from the literature, in the longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. Therefore, the present research brings as an innovation an integrated approach to the input parameters of the system with the rolling resistance through the developed metamodels. There was a substantial variability of up to 15% both up and down in the Maximum Traction Force of a vehicle in response to variations in the vehicle’s weight and the coefficient of tire rolling resistance. In contrast, the Lateral Force exhibited a greater variability, with a 25 downward and 10% upward variation associated with the weight and friction coefficient variability of the vehicle. Further investigations into the sensitivity analysis highlight the significant influence of the friction coefficient and temperature on the Traction Forces of the vehicle.",

This work presents preliminary mechanical analysis and materials selection of a scissor lift system with the purpose of loading and unloading pigs for transport. The scissor lift offers a simple design and is frequently used as a lifting mechanism in the automotive, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, and transportation industries due to its flexibility to adapt to different uses. The design and mechanical analysis of the proposed scissor lift mechanism were performed to carry pigs ranging from 80 to 180 kg with a working height from 1 to 1.2 m to meet the first-floor height of traditional trucks. The model and the components of the system were dimensioned to ensure the well-being of the animals, avoid injuries, and reduce the stress that negatively affects meat quality. The structural analysis of the system was developed through classical analytical calculations in association with materials selection. The proposed design is apt to load and unload pigs safely and be used with different types of trucks.",

The influence of transmembrane pressure and the enzyme pre-treatment of the juice were studied in the process of clarification by microfiltration. Tests of microfiltration for clarification of tropical juice of passion fruit were performed in a microfiltration unit built in stainless steel. The ceramic membranes used have diameter cut-off 0.3 and 0.8 &micro;m. The levels of transmembrane pressure investigated were 1.0 and 3.0 bar in an isothermal process at 35&deg;C.

The condition that resulted into a better quality of micro filtered juice was with membrane of 0.3 µm at 1.0 bar operated with juice pre-treated with 100 ppm of enzyme. In this condition, a permeate flow equal to 56 kg h-1 m-2 was obtained and resulting in 100% reduction of solid matter and 97% reduction in turbidity. The process of centrifugation with the same juice showed equivalent results, but the reduction of suspended solids was lower than the observed for microfiltration. The microfiltration allowed obtaining a juice free of suspended particles, which was the objective of this work.",

Given the various situations and variations of parameters to be analyzed, it is common to use numerical modeling for the analysis of geotechnical engineering problems. The piled rafts in this article are numerically analyzed by means of the three-dimensional finite element method using CESAR-LCPC® v.5 software. Thus, it was possible to conduct various analyses of piled rafts by varying the amount of piles and the thickness of the raft supported on the soil and piles. The results demonstrate that piled raft foundations tend to make displacements uniform, thus minimizing problems with differential settlement in structures. The thickness of the plate of the piled raft influences the load distribution in the piles under the raft when the piles are supported on the ground. The relative stiffness (Krs), which is the 'stiffness' of the piled raft combined with the soil, increases with increases in the amount of piles and the thickness of the piled raft.",

A comparison between the supported catalysts showed high activity for the ones supported with ZnO and TiO2. Zeolite NaY has broader opened channels than NaA, which reduces the dye molecules blockage, and, as a result, increased the catalyst activity.

In this study, butan-1-ol (n-butanol) and 2-methylpropan-1-ol (isobutanol) were blended with pure gasoline in proportions of up to 30% mass. The blends density, volatility and anti-knock rating were experimentally determined and compared with Brazilian commercial gasoline specifications. The results showed that the blends properties kept a strong dependency on the linear or branched butanol molecular structure and with the interaction effects of its hydroxyl groups. In the blends, a polynomial increase in density was observed, with a consequent volatility reduction, affecting the vapor pressure and distillation curve, especially for specified 50 and 90% evaporated temperatures (T50 and T90). Minor effects were observed at the T10 and FBP curve extremes. Octane rating and anti-knock index gains were observed, with noted increase of MON for 2-methylpropan-1-ol based blends. At the tested butanol content range, blends characteristics presented satisfactory compatibility with Brazilian gasoline specifications.",

    "abstract": "Vinasse is the main waste of the productive activity of fermentative processes for ethanol and cachaça production due to the large volume generated, but little is known about the composition of vinasse from alembic cachaça. The present study evaluated the influence of the sugarcane variety (RB867515, RB966928 and RB855453) and management (conventional and organic) on the mineral composition of vinasse from alembic cachaça in a randomized block design with four parcels. Vinasse samples were evaluated for pH and concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, copper, manganese and zinc and carbon/ntrogen ratio. There was a significant effect of management only on three elements of the vinasse composition, C, K and Mg. Regarding the variety, there was a significant effect only on Ca and Mg concentrations in the varieties RB867515 and RB855453. The sugarcane variety and management had little influence on the composition of vinasse from alembic cachaça. The average concentration of macro- and micronutrients of the vinasse samples indicates that it can be used in fertigation due to the rich composition in macro- and micronutrients when compared to the cachaça or ethanol vinasse compositions reported in literature, especially N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe and Cu.",

In the wine industry, the sulphur dioxide (SO2) is commonly used to control the undesirable populations of yeast and bacteria, however, this substance has not been evaluated yet in the context of the ethanol industry. This study aimed to verify the effect of different concentrations and incubation times of potassium metabisulphite (PMB), as a source of SO2, with raw sugarcane juice in order to control the growth of native bacteria and yeasts. PMB was effective to control the growth of native yeasts and bacteria from the sugarcane juice at the concentration of 800 mg L-1, reducing almost one log cycle for yeasts and 1.9-2.9 log cycles for bacteria, with incubation times of 3 and 6-9 hours, respectively. Although PMB is effective in the context of wine fermentation, it was not appropriate to the fuel ethanol production especially due to the peculiar characteristics of the substrate and also to the cost in terms of high doses of the antimicrobial and the volumes of sugarcane juice to be treated daily.",

In the developed multi-products models, different products were included (industrialized juices based on soya of different flavors and light). The linear partial least squares (PLS) method was used in the model construction and the outlier samples were evaluated. The accuracy at the 99% level, represented by the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP), was confirmed through the confidence ellipse, whereas the residuals presented random behavior, which indicates that the data fit a linear model. Sensitivity and analytical sensitivity presented adequate results in the determination of vitamin C and acidity, considering the concentration range used 0.83-16.83 mg 100 mL-1 for vitamin C and 0.17-0.34 g 100 mL-1 for total acidity. The inverse of the analytical sensitivity shows that it is possible to distinguish samples with difference in vitamin C concentration of the order of 0.73 mg 100 mL-1, and samples with difference in total acidity of the order of 6.1 x 10-3 g 100 mL- 1.The multi-product PLS model present limits of detection and quantification for vitamin C of 2.43 and 7.36 mg 100 mL-1, respectively. For total acidity, the limits of detection and quantification achieved were 0.02 and 0.06 mg 100 mL-1, respectively. The values for residual prediction deviation (RPD) presented results within the range of values, which classify the models as satisfactory. In addition, the multi-product calibration is fast, because it does not require reagents/solvents and does not generate toxic waste, being an alternative to the conventional methods and being in agreement with the requirements of green chemistry.",

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) has proved to be an efficient and environmentally less impacting tool for the selection of microorganisms with biotechnological potential. This study aimed to apply FTIR for the selection of fungal strains with potential to hydrolyze the biomass of the microalgae Desmodesmus subspicatus and Chlorella sp after lipid extraction. Eleven fungal strains were screened for residual biomass hydrolysis and FTIR was applied followed by multivariate analysis for the selection of filamentous fungi. The highest cell density was 28.7 × 106 cells mL-1 for Chlorella sp. and 15.8 × 106 cells mL-1 for D. subspicatus and the values of total carbohydrates content were 23.1 and 16.9%, respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were useful tools to screen fungal strains. After multivariate analysis, it was possible to observe that the fungi strains that presented the greatest ability to use microalgal biomass were Penicillium G12 due to the glucose and xylose sugars obtained after lipid extraction from D. subspicatus (with sugar yield of 9.4 and 6.6%, respectively) and Trichoderma auricularis for Chlorella sp.

The physical properties of density, moisture content, and thickness swelling in water immersion for 24 hour were evaluated. The mechanical properties of static bending were determined by the modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), and an internal bond test. Boards were heat-treated at 160, 180, and 200°C (433, 453 and 473 K), and panels were produced with heat-treated strands at 160 and 180°C (433 and 453 K).

    "abstract": "The use of biological prosthetic valves has increased considerably in recent decades since they have several advantages over mechanical ones, but they still possess the great disadvantage of having a relatively short lifetime. An understudied phenomenon is the flutter effect that causes oscillations in the cusps, which is associated with regurgitation, calcification and fatigue, which can reduce even more the lifetime of bioproteses. In an experimental bench that simulates the cardiac flow, the behavior of a porcine and a bovine pericardium valves was recorded by a high-speed camera to quantify the oscillations of the cusps and an experiment using particle image velocimetry was conducted to study the velocity profiles and shear stresses and their relations with flutter. Results showed that the pericardial valve has lower values of frequencies and amplitudes compared to the porcine valve. Lower velocity values were found in the cusps that did not have flutter, but no relationship was observed between shear stress values and leaflet vibrations. These results may assist in future projects of biological prosthetic valves that have less flutter and longer lifespan.",

The number of residents per census tracts lacking in water supply, sewage collection, waste collection, street lighting, electricity, and paving was found based on 2010 Census data. The spatial distribution of these data with the software ArcGIS 9.3 enabled the examination of these characteristics via the Cluster and Outlier method, through the Anselin Local Moran's I spatial analysis module, that identified hotspots and coldspots. As a result, it was found that Campo Mourão is satisfactorily supplied with electricity distribution services and waste collection with only 0.5% of absence in the census tracts. The sewage collection by the general network was the most absent service with 37% absence rate. Parque Industrial I and Jardim Isabel neighborhoods stood out as the most devoid of public services. The Cluster and Outlier Analysis is a subsidy tool for policy-making, which can increase efficiency when providing these services.",

A nonlinear first-order kinetic model has been employed to evaluate zinc availability. Studies usually employ few observations; however, inference in nonlinear models is only valid for sufficiently large samples. An alternative is the Bayesian method, where inferences are made in terms of probability, which is effective even with small samples. The aim of this study was to use Bayesian methodology to evaluate the fitness of a nonlinear first-order kinetic model to describe zinc extraction from soil with sewage sludge using seven different extraction solutions. The analysed data were obtained from an experiment using a completely randomized design and three replicates. Fifteen zinc extractions were evaluated for each extraction solution. Posterior distributions of a study that evaluated the nonlinear first-order kinetic model were used as prior distributions in the present study. Using the full conditionals, samples of posterior marginal distributions were generated using the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and implemented in R. The Bayesian method allowed the use of posterior distributions of another study that evaluated the model used as prior distributions for parameters in the present study. The posterior full conditional distributions for the parameters were normal distributions and gamma distributions, respectively. The Bayesian method was efficient for the study of the first-order kinetic model to describe zinc extraction from soil with sewage sludge using seven extraction solutions.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil there is a semi-arid region of the Bahia State where the transition between caatinga and cerrado prevails. The Bombacopsis retusa (Mart. &amp; Zucc.) A. Robyns belongs to Bombacaceae family, and is frequent in this region. Fruit of Bombacopsis retusa have seeds edible by native fauna and appreciated as appetizer nut in small local villages. With the purpose of verifying the potential application of the oil of this species in different industrial segments, the crude oil of Bombacopsis retusa seeds was extracted with Soxhlet apparatus with 55.5% yield. The physical and chemical analyses to determine the oleochemical indices showed acid value of 0.09 mg KOH-1 g-1, iodine value of 62.80 g I2-1 100 g-1, saponification index of 192.80 mg KOH-1 g-1, refractive index (40°C) of 1.468 and a melting point of 43.90°C. To determine the fatty profile of this oil was applied the CG-DIC that revealed the predominance of palmitic (59.98%), oleic (19.25%) and linoleic (8.47%) acids, besides the saturated/unsaturated fatty acids ratio equal to 2.70. These results suggested that the oil of Bombacopsis retusa is a functional, sustainable and competitive raw-material to be used in agro-energy, food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.",

It was believed one reason was the company functional layout. In this case, changing from current to cellular layout, employee synergy and knowledge about this family would increase. Due to the complexity for dimensioning a new cellular layout, mainly because of batch size and client’s demand variation. In this case, discrete event simulation was used, which made possible to introduce those effects improving accuracy in final results. This accuracy will be shown by comparing results obtained with simulation and without it (as company used to do). To conclude, cellular layout was responsible for increasing 15% of productivity, reducing lead-time in 7 days and scrap in 15% for this family.",

The interest in CD production results from the formation of inclusion complexes, which allow many important applications, especially in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The substances complexed generally have their properties modified by complexation. It is appreciated if increased solubility and higher thermal and chemical stabilities are obtained. In this work, a kinetic model was developed for the production of cyclodextrins in the presence of CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp., taking into account the reversibility of the cyclization reaction, the simultaneous production of b and g-CD and also the inhibitory influence of the substrate and products (CDs), on the enzymatic activity of the CGTase. The substrate formed from a solution of maltodextrins was treated as a single substrate. The model was compared with experimental results of 24h of reaction and this comparison demonstrated that there was a very good representation of the data throughout the test period. The model also allowed explaining the observation of different experimental values for each Michaelis-Menten constant and substrate inhibition constant for each CD, although the CDs are produced from the same substrate.",

The photo-reactors were designed to act on the liquid surface, as the lamp does not get into contact with the liquid. To increase the efficiency of UV radiation, photo-reactors were coated with aluminum foil. The lamp used in the reactors was germicidal fluorescent, with band wavelength of 230 nm, power of 30 Watts and manufactured by Techlux.

Cc-SP1 and Cc-SP2 had anticoagulant (in vitro) and anti- and prothrombotic, antinociceptive and/or anti-inflammatory (in vivo) effects. However, their structural features have not yet been investigated. This study analyzed the chemical composition, elemental microanalysis and structural features by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy of Cc-SPs. Fractionation of SPs by DEAE-cellulose yielded Cc-SP1, Cc-SP2 and CcSP3 containing differences among the relative proportions of sulfate (14.67-26.72%), total sugars (34.92-49.73%) and uronic acid (7.15-7.22%). Carbon (21.76-29.62%), sulfate (2.16-4.55%), nitrogen (0.85-1.57%) and hydrogen (4.57-5.86%) contents were obtained using a CHN equipment. Data from IR indicated occurrence of sulfate ester, galactose-6-sulfate, uronic acid and glycoside linkages. For 1H NMR spectrum of the soluble Cc-SP1 fraction, it was mainly found β-galactopyranose residues and CH3 group. The results showed that Cc-SPs fractions have some structural features similar to others studied Caulerpaceae SPs.",

The model results revealed an identical distribution of the velocity module for each month of the year. However, at the outlet of the lake, a water channel variation speed of 0.28–0.32 m s-1 was observed. Furthermore, at the inlet of the lake, vortex silting tended to occur, as verified by bathymetry. Sedimentation mainly occurred during periods of low rainfall, which is when Cosanpa increases the inflow of water to maintain the reservoir level and this leads to an increase in sediments in suspension. With the model, it was possible to identify locations with higher rates of sedimentation, and in the future, such data can serve as an effective tool for managing this water resource.",

The dehydrated fruits lost about 34.45% of water, concentrating contents of soluble solids, total and reducing sugars, when compared to control samples. The pH value remained around 3.76 for the OD fruits and 3.87 for the fresh fruits. The colour of the dehydrated fruits was more intense than the control samples’. The guava slices osmotic dehydration had 21 days of shelf life, showed physicochemical characteristics significantly superior to the control samples’, having a stable and high quality product as a result.",

This work evaluated the vibration levels on rear and front axles of an agricultural tractor working at different forward speeds and wheel drive conditions in plowing and harrowing operations. Field tests were carried out in a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (forward travel speeds x front-wheel-assist enable or disable), with three replications. Tractor vibration was measured using two single axis accelerometers fixed above the rear and front axles. The actual forward speed of the tractor was obtained by means of ultrasonic radar and the angular velocity of the wheels was measured with magnetic transducers. The drawbar force to pull the disc harrow was obtained by a load cell. The results showed that the vibration levels observed for the plowing operation were higher than observed for the harrowing operation. When the front-wheel-assist (FWA) was enabled there was a reduction in vertical vibration levels of the tractor axles. The highest vibration levels were observed in the frequency range of 2 to 4Hz for the both soil tillage operations evaluated",

For this purpose, formulation of the salad dressing was optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM) based on the rheological properties measured by steady shear (K), dynamic rheological analysis (K', K''), and three interval time test (Deformation (%) and Recovery (%)). All samples showed shear-thinning character and viscoelastic solid character. Herschel Buckley model parameters, namely, t0, K, and n values, were changed between 0.36 and 12.58 Pa, 1.67, and 27. 12 Pa.sn, 0.15 and 0.27 respectively. In all samples, the G' value was higher than G'' in all frequency range. The samples containing high RSG showed a lower percentage of deformation (Def %) and higher recovery (Rec %) values. Optimization was performed based on the rheological properties of the control samples, and the optimum formulation of low salad dressing was 3.73 % RSG, 10 % oil, and 1 % EYP. Low-fat salad dressing samples stabilized by RSG and control samples showed similar characteristics in terms of particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and emulsion stability index values.

Besides that, a reliable assessment should consider the listeners’ judgments of the sounds transmitted through floors or radiated by them. Objective ratings measured can help to foresee tenant satisfaction provided that they are well correlated with the listeners’ judgments. The main objective of this study was to compare objective and subjective evaluations, using two types of impact sources and two types of floor covers, to try and determine which objective variables could be used to predict subject evaluation and to validate the use of an alternative impact source to be used in more realistic measurements. An objective evaluation was carried out employing impact noise insulation measurements according to ISO 10140:2010, evaluating different types of floors, resilient materials, and impact sound sources (a standardized tapping machine and a calibrated tire). In the analysis of the measured samples, several parameters were evaluated according to the sound source used. Simultaneously, \"sound samples\" were recorded to be used in a subjective evaluation based on the judgments of 29 listeners about the Noise Annoyance and the Loudness Sensation in response to the two impact sources. The magnitude estimation method was used. Results demonstrate that tapping machine measurements correlate very well with the subjective evaluation measurements and the calibrated tire presents well-correlated results in a specific measurement set-up. In addition, linear regression analysis of the objective and subjective variables shows alternative single number quantities for ratings of impact noise insulation",

Anaerobically digested cattle wastewater (ACWW) was used as substrate. The experiment was carried out in batches for a period of 8 days. The maximum specific growth rate of 0.347 day-1 and the doubling time of 2.08 days were obtained under the highest illumination of the culture. Dry biomass production reached maximum values between 2.17 g L-1 and 6.52 g L-1, with volumetric biomass productivities between 0.0812 and 0.5578 g L-1 day-1. Productivity per area was equal to 47.97 g m-2 d-1, which is the highest value recorded compared to those found in the literature consulted. As for CO2 biofixation, relevant values for reducing this gas in the atmosphere were obtained, ranging from 128.52 to 882.36 mg L-1 day-1. In terms of organic matter, 16.3-77% of BOD5 and 12.6-61.6% of COD were reduced. In the reduction of TS, TSS and VSS, values of 71.3-78.5%, 79.5-84.4% and 87.0-88.3%, respectively, were reached. NH4+ reduction was 32.5-98.3%, organic nitrogen reduction was 20.3-95.9% and total phosphorus reduction was 33.5-89.9%. The reductions of thermotolerant coliforms were between 71.7% and 99.9%. In view of the results found, it can be considered that the bioremediation of the effluent reached promising efficiencies, with the advantage of producing biomass with potential to obtain bioproducts of relevant economic value",

To evaluate growth performance and protein production under different nutritional conditions, Haematococcus pluvialis was grown in different culture media: BBM, RM, BG-11, and KM2. The cultures were inoculated at 105 cells mL-1, and submitted to a temperature of 24°C, in a continous photoperiod and irradiance of 40 µmol photons m-2 s-1. The highest cell density was observed when H. pluvialis was maintained in BG-11 medium (142 ± 30 × 104 cells mL-1), but no statistical difference was observed when comparing the results with those obtained when culturing this microalga in BBM (101 ± 14 × 104 cells mL-1) and RM (105 ± 5 × 104 cells mL-1) media. Also, the lowest cell density was found when cultivating H. pluvialis in KM2 medium (57 ± 9 × 104 cells mL-1), and there was no statistical difference for doubling time, growth rate and specific growth rate results between treatments. In addition, higher protein contents in H. pluvialis were reported for RM, BG-11, and KM2 culture media at 55.1 ± 5.6, 49.3 ± 3.6 and 58.4 ± 2.8%, respectively; and lower protein content was found using the BBM medium (31.1 ± 2.9%). The highest cell density and biomass were achieved at greater nitrogen availability and a higher nitrogen to phosphorus ratio. The results suggest that H. pluvialis is a potential species for protein production, and that BG-11 is the most suitable medium for growing this microalga as it allowed the achievement of highest biomass production and protein content among the media evaluated.",

The fibers used in this study are made of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), produced from soft drink bottles, and added to the soil with 2 mm width and 1 cm length, in the content of 1% in relation to soil dry mass. Also, contents of 3% and 5% Portland cement, in relation to soil dry mass and two additives, additive 1 at a ratio of 0.25 kg m-³ dry soil and additive 2 at a ratio of 0.60 kg m-³ dry soil, were used to evaluate the possible effect of these variables on the investigated engineering behavior parameters. The compaction results indicated that the inclusion of PET fibers in soil-cement mixtures tends to decrease the maximum dry unit weight compared to fiber-free mixtures. Also, if compared to soil-cement-fiber mixtures, the incorporation of additives to soil-cement-fiber composites resulted in higher values of maximum dry unit weight and lower values of optimum moisture content, but still maintaining values lower than obtained for compacted soil. Results of the direct shear test showed enhanced shear strength with the addition of fibers to soil-cement, for both the parameter of cohesion and the internal friction angle of the material in comparison to fiber-free composites, which demonstrates the potential application of these composites in geotechnical works.",

    "abstract": "The generation of waste and/or by-products in the agro-industrial sector is inevitable and, depending on the situation, it can lead to inadequate disposal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical properties and the energetic viability of agro-industrial residues composed of the mixture of eucalyptus sawdust with turnip or corn cob cake. The experiment was set up in a completely randomized design with eight treatments, resulting from the mixture of eucalyptus sawdust with turnip/corn cob cake. Pure residues were characterized by immediate analysis, calorific value and thermogravimetric analysis. For briquettes, immediate analysis; apparent and energetic density; diametrical compression resistance, HCV, LCV and thermogravimetric analysis were carried out. For statistical analyses, the Tukey's test was applied in qualitative analyses and regression was used in quantitative analyses with the Sisvar statistical software. The volatile material content decreases as forage turnip cake is added; the composition of 50% of forage turnip cake and 50% of eucalyptus (TN50) presented 76.38% of it, while composition containing 15% of cake, 79.87%. The ash content increased from 3.25% (TN15) to 6.27% (TN50). Both HCV and LCVdecreased with the addition of turnip cake from 17.73% (TN15) to 16.96% (TN50) for HCV and from 16.38% (TN15) to 15.64% (TN50) for LCV. In thermograms, the temperature at which peaks appear is similar among the different mixtures. In the resistance test, the addition of forage turnip cake significantly influenced the addition of residues, increasing from 0.76 MPa (TN15) to 1.52 MPa (TN50). Considering the analyses carried out, and comparing them with results in literature, it is possible to verify that both, briquettes produced from forage turnip cake and those made from corn cob, have energy potential.",

    "abstract": "This research studies soil-compacted bricks using Phosphogypsum (PG) in their dosage. PG is the subproduct of the primary raw material used by the fertilizer industry, and its disposal is a challenge for the industry because of its large generation. Laboratory tests were performed to assess these bricks' physical characteristics. To obtain the bricks, two dosages were used: 4 and 7% of Phosphogypsum (PG) concentration. Bricks with no Phosphogypsum (PG) in their mixture were also assessed as a benchmark. The brick's physical characteristics were obtained for non-fired and fired bricks (900ºC for 96 hours in the oven). The results of the laboratory tests were analyzed through statistical analysis to explore the differences between the means for each studied condition (dosage and drying method). Furthermore, there was no statistical difference between the compressive strength of bricks manufactured with 4 and 0% PG, pointing out that until this percentage, the studied bricks did not show strength reduction with PG increasing. The fired bricks showed higher strength for all dosages than the non-fired ones. However, according to the Brazilian Technical Standards, all studied bricks presented enough strength for regular construction. Phosphogypsum (PG) for brick manufacturing can be an alternative way for its disposal, which can help mitigate the civil construction environmental impacts.",

    "abstract": "Ohmic heating is a promising alternative method to conventional heating for microbial inactivation. This study aimed to inactivate Listeria monocytogenes and assess some quality parameters in ready-to-consume liquid infant milk treated with different voltage gradients of ohmic heating. Different ohmic heating voltage gradients (5, 10, and 20V cm-1) were applied to the samples inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 13932) for 5 minutes. The application of 20 V cm-1 ohmic heating induced inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes at 4 minutes and resulted in approximately 5.34 log reduction; however, there was no significant reduction for the 5 and 10V cm-1 groups. Moreover, 20V cm-1 ohmic heating application did not cause any changes in pH, L*, and b* values. A significant decrease in a* value and an increase in hydroxymethylfurfural value was noted in this group. In conclusion, the effectiveness of ohmic heating in pathogen inactivation depends on the applied electric field intensity and the application time. As a result, the ohmic heating conditions must be carefully determined for the infant milk to inactivate pathogens and ensure public health protection. The results of this study contain significant and beneficial data that can be disposed of the listeriosis risk associated with the consumption of infant milk in infants.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear regression models are widespread in the literature, and one of their main applications is in the study of sigmoidal growth curves. There are several models for this purpose, and the most used are the logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, and Brody models. Each one of them has its own characteristics and is more suitable for a given curve shape. There are several criteria in the literature for selecting the most appropriate model, but there is no consensus on the best criteria. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the main selection criteria via Monte Carlo simulation, considering the logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, and Brody nonlinear regression models. Four simulation scenarios are used, each simulated with ideal curves of the logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy and Brody models. Next, the 4 models are adjusted for each of the scenarios, and the main quality criteria found in the literature are calculated to assess the ability of the criteria to identify the most appropriate model for each scenario. The results show that the criteria asymptotic index, mean absolute error and coefficient of determination choose the correct model more often than the other criteria studied. Although the measures of the Battes and Watts curvature and box bias are important for the evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the models, they are not indicated for the selection of the best model.",

    "abstract": "For residues maintained on the soil surface, microbial colonization of the substrate is slower initially due to the microbial population's adaptation phase to the substrate. Subsequently, decomposition becomes more intense due to easily mineralizable matter, and as the process progresses, there is a predominance of more resistant materials that can reduce microbial attack. Thus, the maximum rate of CO2 release occurs in the early days of decomposition, and this process is described by the Gompertz model, which is a nonlinear sigmoidal regression model. The theory for regression models is valid for sufficiently large samples, and generally, in research with carbon mineralization data, few observations are used, and parameter estimation should preferably be done using Bayesian methodology since prior information is incorporated, reducing the effect of having few observations. One way to determine objective priors is through maximum entropy prior distributions. This study aims to fit the Gompertz model to the release of carbon dioxide over time from leguminous species using a Bayesian approach with maximum entropy priors for the model parameters. The treatments (leguminous species) evaluated were Arachis pintoi, Calopogonium mucunoides, Stylosanthes guianensis, and Stizolobium aterrium. Eight observations of carbon released over time up to 480 hours from the start of incubation were made. In the soil with the addition of legumes, the abscissa of the inflection point was estimated between 4 and 5 days, meaning this was the time the microorganisms needed to reach the maximum decomposition rate. The species A. pintoi showed the average estimate of 481 mg CO2 of potentially mineralizable carbon, being the species that released the most carbon.",

    "abstract": "Energy is a resource that has become indispensable to contemporary life, as it is present in everyday life in all areas. However, this important resource is limited, and during its production, it has great potential to generate socio-environmental problems. Since buildings are one of the main energy consumers, using energy efficiency to soften consumption is essential. To this end, Brazil has the Technical Quality Regulation for the Energy Efficiency Level of Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C), developed by the National Electricity Conservation Program (PROCEL), which grants the evaluation of energy efficiency in buildings. Nevertheless, the RTQ-C includes only five levels of classification and does not consider the uncertainties associated with the analysis parameters. To broaden this assessment, fuzzy logic is an option that provides the determination of sub-levels and more scope for the classification. Thus, the present work aims to propose a fuzzy logic-based model that can assess the energy efficiency of buildings deriving from the RTQ-C parameters. A case study is used to show the applicability and functionality of the proposed model. Using the methodology provided by the RTQ-C manual and by fuzzy logic, it was possible to arrive at a rule base, which provides a more realistic perspective on the energy assessment of a building. The results showed that fuzzy modeling is feasible and more comprehensive, it can be used in other buildings and research with similar characteristics, as well as by managers of public and private companies that seek to evaluate, manage, and make more accurate decisions regarding the energy efficiency of buildings under their responsibility, bringing economic, social, and environmental benefits.",

    "abstract": "This comparative study aims to prepare alternative and cheap solvent-based paint using a waste PET-based alkyd resin synthesized from waste PET intermediate, suitable for coating applications. Waste PET flakes obtained from grinding post-consumer water bottles were depolymerized by the glycolysis reaction at atmospheric pressure. The depolymerization product was extracted by hot water, and a water-soluble crystallizable fraction (WSCF) and water-insoluble fraction (WIF) were obtained. WSCF was completely used instead of the diol component in the synthesis reaction of a four-component PET-based alkyd resin that has an oil content of 60%. Besides PET-based alkyd, reference alkyd without waste PET intermediate was also synthesized. Then, solvent-based paints were prepared using PET-based alkyd, reference alkyd, and commercial alkyd as binders. Wet paint properties and physical/chemical dry film properties of paints were determined. It was observed that the viscosity, density, hiding power, and particle size values of the paint prepared with waste PET-based alkyd were in the range suitable for paint applications, and the hiding power of waste PET-based alkyd paint was better than reference and commercial alkyd paints. Glossy, relatively soft, flexible paint films with excellent adhesion strength and impact resistance, and relatively high abrasion resistance were obtained from waste PET-based alkyd paints. It was observed that the resistance of waste PET-based alkyd paint to household chemicals was better than the paint prepared with commercial alkyd, and its resistance to ethyl alcohol, vinegar, and beverages was excellent. Waste PET-based alkyd paint was less affected by solvents than commercial alkyd paint. The environmental resistance of waste PET-based alkyd paint is excellent, and the oven-cured waste PET-based alkyd paint showed excellent resistance to corrosive conditions. The use of waste PET-based alkyd resin in the paint formulation did not cause any negative effects on the wet paint, physical/chemical surface coating properties, and chemical performance tests. As a result, PET-based alkyd paints, which are prepared using waste PET-based alkyd resins synthesized from the depolymerization intermediates of PET bottles, have the same or superior coating properties compared to commercial alkyd",

    "abstract": "During the last few decades, the Ivaí River basin, in the region of the Third Plateau of Paraná, has suffered the most varied types of aggressions. These impacts have provoked changes of physical, chemical and biological natural characteristics in the river environment. In order to observe some aspects of such modifications, five composed samples of water were collected at located stations, during six months, in the cities of Icaraíma, Herculândia and Tapira. In all samplings, at each collection, the following were measured: pH, temperature, transparency and dissolved oxygen. The collected water samples were submitted to nitric digestion with volume reduction in a water bath system. The concentrations of heavy metals were obtained through the method of flame atomic absorption. The results, intervals and median values, in µg L–1, were: Cd (not detected - nd); Pb (13.0-67.0, 20.0); Co (nd-2.0, nd); Cu (1.0-100.0, 8.0); Cr (nd-4.0, nd); Fe(90.0-4,400.0, 1,080.0); Mn (nd-130.0, 30.0); Ni (nd-6.0, nd) Zn (4.0-400.0, 10.0). It was possible to conclude that the heavy metals Pb, Zn, Cu and Fe presented a greater regularity in impacting the river environment, exceeding the concentration limit of the Conama (Brazilian Environment National Council) Resolution 357/2005, probably as a consequence of the agricultural activity in the hydrographic basin.",

    "abstract": "A subdivision algorithm is presented and applied to solving commonly found chemical engineering problems described by nonlinear algebraic systems. For this purpose, a web-based library available in the literature was used as the main source to select a wide class of one- and multidimensional problems, comprising phase and chemical equilibrium, conversion in tubular and continuous stirred tank reactors, material and energy balances, etc. The problems are classified according to the literature as low, intermediate and of high degree of numerical difficulty based on specific characteristics, like discontinuities in the functions, multiple solutions with the occurrence of false and unfeasible roots, and the presence of null derivative values. It is shown that the algorithm is efficient and robust, even for multidimensional problems of high numerical difficulty, allowing to find simultaneously all the feasible roots of nonlinear algebraic systems, naturally excluding false and unfeasible solutions, with a relatively low CPU time. These features make the algorithm an interesting alternative to deal with chemical engineering problems in contrast to some methods currently in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the ability of CCC as an adsorbent material for the acidity removal of RFO, aiming at the application of the oil in biodiesel production. For that, a RCCD was used for FFA removal by applying the CCC and CAC for comparative purposes. In the RCCD removal assays the effect of the Temperature, Agitation and Mass factors were assessed over acidity removal of the oil. Under the best conditions from RCCD, an evaluation of adsorption kinetics was performed, wherein it was observed the equilibrium was reached within 4 h, for the CCC. Also, the influence of the adsorbent dosage was performed. It was verified that 4 g was sufficient to allow the system to reach the maximum FFA removal. Overall, the CCC presented results approximately twice as high than those obtained by the CAC, mainly due to the pore size distribution which led to a “molecular sieving effect” for the CCC adsorbent. It allowed the major diffusion of the FFA molecules inside its narrow-distributed pores, whereas the CAC with a wider pore distribution (up to 260 Å) resulted in the larger molecules competition for the active sites inside the porous structure. The adsorbents’ characterization also evidenced that CCC adsorbent presented a higher content of oxygenated groups in its surface which acted as potential active sites for the FFA molecules resulting in an enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate affinity. Lastly, the wastes generated in the adsorption experiments, were evaluated as to their calorific power resulting in a value of 31,933 J g-1, suggesting that it could be further used for energetic purposes, such as a solid fuel for boilers and furnaces to generate thermal energy. Based on these results, the CCC stands out as a promising material for RFO acidity removal.",

    "abstract": "For a controlled particle size distribution, nano-silica was added to three different cements. The chemical and mineralogical compositions of the cements were characterized by fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. The granulometric distributions of cements and nano-silicas were obtained by laser granulometry and dynamic lightning scattering. The specific surface area of the raw materials was determined by gas adsorption. The effect of nano-silica and type of cement on rheological behavior was evaluated by rotational rheometry. The mechanical performance was investigated through the compression strength. The microstructural analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy. The water demand and the consumption of dispersant increases according to the nano-silica content. The reduction in the inter-particle separation, and the agglomeration of nano-silica led to an increase in the viscosity of the suspension. The mechanical performance was directly affected by the specific surface area of the cements. Microstructural analysis showed that nano-silica changed from a layered adsorbed structure, to a porous or agglomerated structure.",

To that end, the methodology and criteria were defined to identify problems and select projects, as well as applying the Six Sigma program with the use of DMAIC in a previously selected project, looking to demonstrate the development of the program. Project application is shown in six stages, through a map of reasoning for each stage or step, which shows the details of the statistics techniques used until the action plan space. The verification and standardization phases of the processes are not contemplated in this study. The final results demonstrate the benefits of using the program and the importance of maintaining the database with the involvement of people for its success.",

The validation of the model is obtained by the comparison between numerical responses and experimental ones. The model proposed by Pituba regards concrete as an initially isotropic medium that starts to present plastic deformations, bimodularity and anisotropy induced by the damage. The model proposed by Mazars considers concrete to be an elastic and isotropic medium. Next, the model proposed by La Borderie is presented. This isotropic damage model takes into account plastic deformations induced by the damage. In the second part of the work, the models are used in the analysis of reinforced concrete structures, where the numerical responses are compared with experimental ones. The results evidence the good performance of the damage models on the simulation of the behavior of reinforced concrete structures. In particular, the employment of the damage model proposed by Pituba is valid. It is noted that the simple formulations of damage models can present results with good accuracy leading to possible practical applications in Structural Engineering.",

Initially, the adjustment of propionic bacteria to higher concentrations of propionic acid was tested and kinetic parameters were determined for growth. A central composite rotational design (CCRD) with 11 experiments was carried out, using different inoculum concentrations of P. freudenreichii, which were added to the cultures of lactic bacteria at different times. The maximum specific growth rate for P. freudenreichii decreased from 0.11 to 0.03 hour-1and the growth time increased from 32h to 100h when concentration of propionic acid in lactate broth increased to 0.25%. The best result for propionic acid production was 3.78 g L-1, inoculating 5.108 CFU mL-1 of propionic bacteria after 6 h. For lactose consumption, the best conditions were inoculum concentration above 5.108 CFU mL-1 and inoculation time of P. freudenreichii after 6 hours. Therefore, it was demonstrated that skimmed whey can be used as a renewable, low-cost raw material for propionic acid production by mixed culture.",

The proposed fuel cell model involves ohmic, activation and concentration voltage losses, thermal dynamics, methanol reformer, fuel utilization factor and power limiting module. A power conditioning unit (PCU), which consists of a DC-DC boost converter and a DC-AC voltage-source inverter (VSI), their controller, transformer and filter, is designed for grid-connected systems. The voltage-source inverter with six Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switches inverts the DC voltage that comes from the converter into a sinusoidal voltage synchronized with the grid. The simulations and modeling of the system are developed on Matlab/Simulink environment. The performance of SOFC with converter is examined under step and random load conditions. The simulation results show that the designed boost converter for the proposed thermal based modified SOFC model has fairly followed different DC load variations. Finally, the AC bus of 400 Volt and 50 Hz is connected to a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) through a transmission line. The real and reactive power managements of the inverter are analyzed by an infinite bus system. Thus, the desired nominal values are properly obtained by means of the inverter controller.",

Our results show that the best-performing firms are those that lead on capabilities like quality and innovativeness rather than on cost. Much of the available literature on manufacturing strategy emphasizes only four key competitive priorities: cost, flexibility, quality and delivery. Consequently, our results confirm innovativeness as an important, fifth capability for small and medium sized firms in Brazil to maintain or develop.

Models of the filtration phenomenon describe the mass balance in bed filtration in terms of particle removal mechanisms, and allow for the determination of global particle removal efficiencies. This phenomenon is defined in terms of the geometry and the characteristic elements of granule collectors, particles and fluid, and the composition of the balance of forces that act in the particle collector system. This type of resolution is well known as the trajectory analysis theory. Particle trajectory analysis by mathematical correlation of the dimensionless numbers that represent fluid and particle characteristics is considered the main approach for mathematically modeling the initial collection efficiency of particle removal in water filtration. The existing initial collection efficiency models are designed for downflow filtration. This study analyzes initial collection efficiency models, and proposes an adaptation of these models to direct upflow filtration in a granular bed of coarse sand and gravel, taking into account the contribution of the gravitational factor of the settling removal efficiency in the proposal of initial collection efficiency models.",

Frozen cooked breast meat supplied from a poultry-processing industry was used. Fillets were stored at a prescribed temperature (7°C) for 15-17 days and the sample’s chemical composition and initial pH was determined. Color, texture and microbiology were analyzed to determine the shelf-life of the cooked chicken breast meat. Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli were not detected. The highest values of Chroma a* were observed at 312 and 360 hours, exhibiting an intense red color resulting from meat deterioration. Chroma b* failed to show any significant difference between the first and last day of storage. Lightness (L*) was decreased with storage time and revealed a darker color caused by microbial spoilage. Texture decreased from 2.93 to 1.12 kgf. It may be concluded that shelf-life attended to expectations with regard to texture, color and microbiology of cooked chicken breast meat stored at7°C during 13 days.",

Initially temperature variations at different positions in the casting and in the mold were measured during solidification using a data acquisition system. These temperature variations were introduced in a numerical method in order to determine the variation of heat transfer coefficient at metal/mold interface by inverse method. The primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing variations were measured through optical microscopy.

ADC is expected to be used within a temperature sensor which provides analog data output having a range of 360 mV to 560 mV. The complete system consisting of three main blocks, which are the threshold inverter quantization (TIQ)-comparator, the encoder and the parallel input serial output (PISO) register. The TIQ-comparator functions as quantization of the analog data to the thermometer code. The encoder converts this thermometer code to 6-bit binary code and the PISO register transforms the parallel data into a data series. The design aims to get a flash ADC on low power dissipation, small size and compatible with the temperature sensors. The method is proposed to set each of the transistor channel length to find out the threshold voltage difference of the inverter on the TIQ comparator. A portion design encoder and PISO registers circuit selected a simple circuit with the best performance from previous studies and adjusted to this system. The design has an input range of 285 to 600 mV and 6-bit resolution output. The chip area of the designed ADC is 844.48 x 764.77 µm2 and the power dissipation is 0.162 µW with 1.6 V supply voltage.",

A fluid flow experimental unit was built to determine the kinetics of the dissolution of salt particles in a brine flow. Fluid samples free from particled solid material retrieved through the flow line at several predefined points were collected to determine salt dissolution profile.

    "abstract": "The major problem on geotechnical work is to ensure that no settlements occur during the life cycle of the construction. This involves proper design of foundations and their bearing capacity. The Brazilian standard for design and execution of foundations, ABNT (2010) NBR 6122 imposes the utilization of field tests when designing building foundations. The Standard Penetration Test, SPT, ABNT (2001) NBR 6484, is still the most common in-situ test for those purposes. Ranzini (1988) suggested supplementing the conventional SPT with the measurement of the torque (SPT-T) required to turn the split spoon after driving, in order to provide a 'static' component to a 'dynamic' test. The adhesion between the soil and the sampler, obtained by the torque measurement, could be used to calculate the lateral skin friction of piles. This paper describes the SPT-T procedure including both a supplementary equipment and practical aspects. Also it presents an accurate torque measurement, a prediction method to calculate the bearing capacity of piles used in building foundations using the SPT-T test and a comparison between the estimated bearing capacities of building foundations with instrumented load tests in order to validate the method.",

The lesions were clinically evaluated on 0 - 21st days, when histopathological analysis was also performed. In this study, the clinical analysis showed that although the rate of contraction of the lesions in EG was lower than in PCG, there was significant reduction in the wound of the group treated with ointment obtained from the powder of L. ferrea. Furthermore, the morphometric data showed that from the 3rd to 21st day after operation, the EG presented significant reduction in the rate of contraction of the skin lesions.

The approach divides each dorsal image into five overlapping regions; consequently, five different training and test sets are obtained for each image, modeling a multi-modal biometric system while using only one trait. The test outputs are combined by score-level fusion. Experimental results on FYO, Bosphorus and Badawi datasets indicate the efficiency of the proposed method and its comparability with other recognition systems. The results are also compared with the state-of-the-art dorsal hand vein recognition systems to show the ability of the proposed biometric architecture to perform well in different conditions that may affect dorsal vein pattern acquisition and have con-sequent effect on the efficiency of the recognition system.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of intense rainfall in engineering projects is fundamental, mainly regarding the estimate of design flows necessary for designing hydraulic works. Intense rainfall events are commonly measured by Equations and curves that relate their intensity, duration, and frequency. Such relations, known as IDF, enable the hydrological characterization of a given region. This article presents a methodological design and results from both determination and spatialization of IDF curve parameters for the state of Maranhão. Historical series of maximum daily rainfalls obtained from National Water and Sanitation Agency (ANA) were used in 126 rainfall gauge stations and the Gumbel probability distribution estimated the maximum daily rainfall for 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, and 100 return periods. The Isozonal Method obtained the IDF correlations of intense rainfall events for 0,1. 1, and 24 h durations, and their performance were conducted by Nash-Sutcliffe R2 coefficient and Root Mean Square Relative Error (RMSE). “K, a, b, and c” parameters of intense rainfall equations were determined by optimization and convergence processes and their spatialization was carried out by interpolation by Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), which enabled to determine the values of each parameter in regions without physical measurements of rainfall. Similarly, rainfall intensity was spatialized for the entire state. According to the results, the rainfall distribution in the state of Maranhão shows a variation in the indexes of precipitation, with the highest values found in areas located in central-southern, southwestern, and southeastern regions.",

    "abstract": "As in the rest of the world, the impact of climate change is clearly felt in Turkey, while the effects of global warming, drought and flood-induced disasters continue to increase day by day. At the same time, water consumption is crucial for the survival of people. Efficient water use and conservation, facilitated by water resources management, should be recognized as a pressing contemporary concern. Recently, floods that cause a great deal of damage have started to occur frequently in Turkey. A possible flood that may occur in the demolition of Gökçe Dam has been a matter of curiosity. This dam is the most important water source for Yalova province and has been in service for a long time. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the flood risk situations of settlements in case of a possible Gökçe Dam failure or basin flooding. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the damages that may occur in houses of flooded areas. Piping and overtopping methods were used in HEC-RAS program to create flood maps, and the Van Eck and Kok damage curves were used to assess the damages. While water level varies between 0-1 meters in the most affected buildings in the overtopping method, this level is 2-3 meters in the piping method. The damage to buildings with a water level of 4 meters and above is quite high in the piping method, and it has been observed that greater damage may occur for lower water levels in the overtopping method. The total damage and number of affected buildings are higher in the piping method. Accordingly, a possible Gökçe dam failure would cause significant losses in both methods, especially in the piping method.",

    "abstract": "Steel-concrete composite girders have non-uniform stress distribution on the slab, presenting maximum stresses next to the webs of the girder. This phenomenon is known as shear lag effect. To understand this effect, there is the effective width concept, in which only a portion of the slab width is considered effective in contributing to the composite element’s resistant capacity. However, in the technical standards, there is no recommendation for calculating the effective width in steel-concrete composite box girder bridges. In view of this situation, the purpose of this paper is to carry out a systematic review on effective width and/or the shear lag effect in steel-concrete composite bridges, in order to raise the main existing recommendations and compare them. Through a bibliometric scan with carefully chosen keywords, it was found that of all research on shear lag or effective width in steel-concrete composite structures, only 31.19 are on bridges and 14.97% are on bridges with box girders. Among the papers, those that have a method for calculating the effective width of steel-concrete composite girder bridges have been compared quantitatively and qualitatively with the procedures of AASHTO and EN 1994-2-2. In these procedures were also identified that the, for the boundary conditions of the present paper, the parameters that most influencing the effective width are, in that order, the span length, the distance between girders, the concrete slab height, the longitudinal position and the type of load.",

    "abstract": "The assumption of perfect supports (fixed or pinned foundations) for the boundary conditions of reinforced concrete buildings has been used for many years by structural engineers. This fact is mainly attributed to the great difficulties faced in the past, when designers needed to calculate buildings by using manual methods. Nowadays, realistic analysis that takes into account the deformability of the adjacent soil foundation is possible, based on the development of powerful computers and computational software packages. However, many structural engineers still use the same simplified boundary conditions widely used in the past. The main explanation for this problem may be the lack of information and models available in the literature, as well as the lack of interaction between structural engineers and foundation engineers. In this context, the present paper aims to present practical recommendations for applying the soil-structure interaction. Additionally, based on some practical examples, this paper shows that the rigid support hypothesis may lead reinforced concrete columns to significant force distortions.",

Treatments here investigated included precipitation of silver from fixing bath and adsorption in zeolites and activated carbon. The highest silver removal for the first treatment (around 84%) was obtained with 0.17 mol L-1 of H2O2. Concerning the adsorption process, it was concluded that zeolites A, X and mordenite were inefficient to retain the silver complex.

    "abstract": "Most methods employed to estimate the height of waves generated by the wind require the surface length over which the wind blows. The choice of method depends on the nature of the water body, being applicable to ocean areas or interior water bodies, such as bays, lakes and reservoirs. One of the usual solutions has been the direct usage of the method validated in ocean waters for interior waters, therefore, not taking into consideration the effect of the restriction imposed by the shores. Nevertheless, the excessive quantity of operations of the method applied to interior water bodies (where the shore is a restraint condition) may not assure a satisfactory precision degree, unless an accurate enough graphic base of the shore with the addition of the operator’s subjectivity is used. Thus, this scientific community brings this discussion to light, proposing a classic solution based on the application of the adequate method to interior waters (Saville et al., 1954), via automatized processing. Therefore, a program in AutoLISP, a computational language, has been developed. The application of the program has determined the maximum wind fetches in Ilha Solteira, state of São Paulo, reservoir as being between 9.5 and 12.5 km, in contrast with a previous study which has predicted far longer fetches (factor of three).",

The green roof remained for 7 days within the relative humidity range considered comfortable whereas the conventional roof remained for 4 days. The green roof caused a mean reduction of 4.96°C, proving that green roofs contribute to reducing indoor room temperature and thermal lag promoted by the green cover, where the heat input takes longer to occur when compared to the conventional roof. Regarding the behavior of the vegetation cover and substrate, the larger the green cover, the lower the substrate temperature transmitted to the indoor environment.",

All HSSF-CWs were filled with gravel # 0 and received sanitary sewage (SW) during a period of 90 days, in which the BOD and COD, in the total and soluble forms, were monitored in the influent and effluents from the system. These units were subject to tracer tests, before and after the HSSF-CWs received the SW, to obtain d. The MFOKM was adjusted to the COD and BOD experimental data. In all cases, an inverse relation was observed between n and the parameters d or with the organic matter decay rate obtained in the initial part of the HSSF-CWs.",

The current thermal system has a steam generator that provides heating utility for the soluble coffee production, including a refrigeration plant using ammonia/water absorption, while the electricity is bought from the energy concessionary. The proposal is to include an extraction-condensing steam turbine providing 5100 kW of electricity to the industrial plant, besides keeping the same energy demands in the current plant. Heat, cold and power were evaluated for their costs per unit of exergy in the current plant and compared to the proposal of the trigeneration system. The results show that the proposal to integrate a turbo-generator is technically and economically viable, resulting in reduction in the costs for heating, cooling and electricity of up to 72% in a payback period of only 24 months.",

However, this technique has not been used for studies in structures susceptible to corrosion. In addition to changing the microstructure, it is expected that this technique increases the corrosion resistance of the edge of the weld bead which is a vulnerable region to corrosion. Moreover, the machining technique has been widely used to improve the workpieces finishing and/or structures that have been subjected to repair by welding, improving the surface roughness, increasing the corrosion resistance of these structures when subjected to aggressive environments. Thus, this work will study the effects of finishing techniques using machining and welding on the edge of the weld bead joints of 410D ferritic stainless steels, making an evaluation by mass loss in the samples which will be subjected to corrosion by immersion in NaCl containing medium. It is expected that the finishing techniques can relieve tensile stresses increasing the corrosion resistance.",

The AC-MDD framework was elaborated based on related works that present Agile Model Driven Development processes (AMDD), but it deals with issues not yet considered by these researches. To adopt the AC-MDD framework, some visual elements from a novel Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile named Web-AML was designed, allowing to represent agile models of web applications. Besides that, in order to apply the proposed framework using these new models, a method was defined providing steps to transform agile models into web application source-codes. A case study was performed successfully in a real project that gives support to the population of a city located in the State of São Paulo (Brazil) to deal with the real flood problem they have been facing in recent years. This project was developed at the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo to verify and validate the AC-MDD framework. Finally, a comparative analysis between the AC-MDD Framework and other AMDD processes was presented and highlighted the main aspects of the proposed framework.",

Some tumors may be best diagnosed by evaluating body temperature distribution, for instance, it is observed that local temperatures of the skin over a tumor are higher than the average skin temperature. Certainly, it is expected from medical diagnostics to be, early, fast and very precise. Especially if the health problem is a tumor, it is necessary to know the shape and the size of the cancer. Thermal images can provide further information about the tumor, generally, the thermal diagnostic is made comparing images of the region with a bioheat model. In this context, the present study shows interesting results about the multigrid method applied to solve the Pennes bioheat equation in two dimensions, using a non-stationary and steady state cases for the skin heath and with melanoma. The multigrid method presented itself as an extremely efficient and fast tool to solve the bioheat equation with refined grids that provide good spatial precision.",

Open-loop experiments were carried out to collect experienced-based knowledge of the process. PID and Fuzzy logic (FLC) real-time-based controllers were designed to perform food drying tests and compared without controllers’ retuning.

Current study proposes a bootstrap algorithm that allows the use of measures of influence in the calculation of re-sampling probabilities. The method was reproduced in simulation scenarios taking into account the logistic growth curve model and the CovRatio measurement to evaluate the impact of an influential observation in the determinacy of the matrix of the co-variance of parameter estimates.

The GAGs were extracted with papain in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing cystein and EDTA (5 mM), followed by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column using a NaCl gradient. The obtained fractions were lyophilizated and submitted to 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The anticoagulant activity was assessed by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) using normal human plasma and HEP standard (193 IU mg-1). The chromatographic profile separated into two different GAGs fractions (F I and F II) eluted at 0.50 and 0.75 M of NaCl, respectively, revealing fractions pattern distinct in the charge densities, but both showing GAGs with mobilities similar to standard dermatan sulfate (DS), suggesting the preliminary identification of this GAG. The GAGs modified the APTT, whose activities were, respectively, 4.72 (F I) and 23.80 (F II) IU mg-1, and expressed themselves dose-dependent.

    "abstract": "Ferroresonance is an electrical phenomenon in nonlinear character, which frequently occurs in power systems containing saturable transformers and single or more-phase switching on the lines for the disjunction of the loads. In this study, the ferroresonance phenomena are considered under the modeling of the West Anatolian Electric Power Network of 380 kV in Turkey. The ferroresonance event is carried out using the switching to remove the loads at the end of the lines. In this sense, two different cases are considered. Firstly, the switching is applied at the 2nd second and the ferroresonance effects are observed between the 2nd and the 4th second of the voltage variations. As a result, the ferroresonance and non-ferroresonance cases observed before the ferroresonance, are compared with each other using the Fourier transform techniques. Hence, the properties of the ferroresonance event, which are defined between the 100 and 200 Hz, are presented in the frequency domain.",

As a proof of concept, the sheets were applied to pack sliced cooked ham for 7 days at 10°C. Migration of metallic silver from the sheets to the sliced ham was detected in a considered safe concentration, according to literature data, by ICP-MS. The sheets coated with AgNPs were able to significantly hinder psychrotrophic and mesophilic bacteria growth during 7 days of storage when compared to the control sample (sheets without AgNPs). Furthermore, lipid oxidation occurred in a higher proportion in the ham packaged with AgNPs, probably due to the catalyst effect of silver. It may be concluded that the sheets composed by starch and PLA acted as an effective support for the AgNPs, as well as an active packaging for sliced cooked ham.",

    "abstract": "Martensitic steels have been successfully employed in resource-based industries where components must endure aggressive conditions. In industrial practice, many parts of these components are joined by welding techniques. The aim of this work was to understand the influence of welding on the wear resistance of quenched and tempered carbon martensitic steel subjected to dry linear reciprocating sliding micro-wear tests. Weld-joints were produced using autogenous Gas Tungsten Arc Welding process (GTAW). Micro-wear tests were performed at base metal (BM), weld metal (WM), coarse grained heat affected zone (CG-HAZ) and lowest hardness region of heat affected zone (LHR-HAZ). LHR-HAZ was softened during welding process so plastic deformation was facilitated, and consequently adhesion, material displacement and micro-ploughing. WM and CG-HAZ presented a similar martensitic structure, which explain the similarities found on wear behavior. These regions presented the lowest worn volume average values (w). It was interesting to note that despite its highest microhardness value, the highest w was observed for BM. For some BM samples, debris had a key role promoting material loss by micro-cutting which causes great extent of material removal compared to other micro-wear mechanisms as micro-ploughing and adhesion. Due to debris action BM also presented a great dispersion in w results. The results suggest that material loss of welded joint and BM was strongly controlled by micro-wear mechanisms.",

The plant growth-promoting ability of the mutant was also investigated. Further, 41.17% of the evaluated endophytes presented promising results for in vitro assays (C. karstii SL10, C. karstii SL28, C. karstii SL57, C. karstii SL59, C. karstii SL12, C. karstii SL40, and C. karstii SL24).

Bromate-resistant mutant C. karstii SL57 increased in vitro phosphate solubilization (23%) and chlorophyll levels (Chlb 0.607 mg g-1 and Chlt 0.973 mg g-1) of bean plants when compared to the wild-type strain (Chlb 0.551 mg g-1 and Chlt 0.881 mg g-1).

The performance evaluation of different probability distribution models was assessed by the quality of fit of the selected probability distributions for precipitation data. Quality tests as chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Darling (AD), the information criteria as Akaike (AIC) and the Bayesian criterion (BIC) were used. Then the mean root square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were applied. The analyzes were made monthly, annually and by seasons. The 3-parameter Lognormal distribution performs the best for all twelve months and provides the best-fit to the monthly rainfall data. Thus characterizing a dry period that runs from May to September and a rainy period between the months of October and April, it was observed that the 3-parameter Lognormal distribution has best adjustment for spring and summer, and for winter and autumn the 2-parameter Gamma and 3-parameter Gamma distribution performed better.

Strategies have been carried out to increase the productivity of tacrolimus, since many compounds have in their composition tacrolimus precursors, and bacteria Streptomyces depend on a carbon source for their growth. One strategy is to change the carbon source of the fermentation medium. The present study aims to evaluate the use of coconut oil for the production of tacrolimus via Streptomyces tsukubaensis, as an alternative in the face of glucose, a traditional source of carbon. The batch fermentation process was done in an orbital shaker at 28°C and 130 rpm. Quantification of tacrolimus was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The sugars and proteins, present in the medium, were measured from Somogyi-Nelson and Bradford methods, respectively. According to the results, coconut oil achieved the production of tacrolimus higher than glucose. This is due to the presence of a portion of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids that act as precursors to tacrolimus. On the other hand, glucose is a quick carbon source for the bacteria and helps in its growth, but in high amounts it inhibits the production of the drug.",

In the first stage, the concentration of ascorbic acid that best provided stability to the dough (300 ppm) was determined. In the following stage, three different concentrations of tannic acid were used: 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30%, with the purpose of verifying the ascorbic acid retention in the dough. The breads were elaborated with the standard formulation. After the elaboration of the breads, the ascorbic acid retention was evaluated in the previously determined concentration. The results showed that the bread elaborated with standard dough (300 ppm of ascorbic acid), presented ascorbic acid concentration of 41.50 mg 100 g-1 of bread.",

    "abstract": "Alginate is a polysaccharide extracted from cell walls of brown algae and used in the food, pharmaceuticals and biotech industries. Production is concentrated on the cultivation of brown seaweed, but several bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas and Azotobacter produce alginate. The chemical structure of alginates produced by algae is similar to those synthesized by A. vinelandii. The bacteria also produce intracellular polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), known as bioplastic. This work studied the simultaneous alginate and PHB production by A. vinelandii using sucrose and different parameters of fermentation in an orbital shaker. The optimal values for the production of these compounds were determined by the MSR. The first experiment was a 26-2 factorial design. The second was based on significant variables of the first, resulting in a full 33-0 factorial design. From the first to the second, an increase was observed in the PHB productivity from 12 to 45 mg g-1 cell h-1 and alginate from 100 to 1,600 mg g-1 of cell h-1. The productivity of both compounds was in the maximum incubation temperature of 62&ordm;C, in the shortest time of incubation (18h) and the sucrose concentration, 11 g L-1. In both experiments the PHB extracted presented purity of 94%.",

Additionally, several interactions among the factors were also significant. Analyzing the contribution of each factor, it was verified that the best operational conditions were obtained for eluents H2SO4/MgSO4, at the highest tested concentration, highest nickel load and lowest solid:liquid ratio. In this configuration, the results obtained with the desorption (%) was greater than 95%, making the biosorption process very interesting in the treatment of nickel solutions.

Center-less grinding is widely used in the production of auto parts e.g. roller bearings, valve stem and stem of shock absorbers. Center-less grinding is used in large-scale production due to shorter time and higher flexibility. However, the set-up of the grinder is complex and slow, and depends on the operators’ ability. The choice of the best parameters in the process is important to define exactly the cutting strategy and to optimize the process. Current study analyzes the input parameters: feed rate and type of materials on the responses G-ratio, surface roughness, and roundness. Thus, stems of shock absorbers were used as work pieces on the shop floor. Cutting speed and grinding wheel type were constant. The input parameters comprised feed rate and type of materials (1025 and 1045). Responses were surface roughness, roundness error and G-ratio. Results demonstrated that the kinds of tested material was the parameter that most influenced G-ratio and surface roughness. Moreover, feed rate had little influence on the quality of the work pieces, mainly on roundness error.",

The drift phenomenon and its effects are clearly demonstrated in this paper. The ability of the proposed P&O method to address this issue is proved by comparing the conventional P&O algorithm in different modes of operation. The performance assessment includes peak overshoot, settling time, MPP ratio and stability. The experimental validation was implemented using DSPIC30F4011 microcontroller. From the analysis and results, it could be seen that the modified P&O showed better performance in terms of accuracy in tracking the maximum power, less tracking time, high MPP ratio and reduced drift in the changing weather conditions.",

Here, a fictitious crack approach is adopted for estimating the equivalent effect of the fracture process zone of concrete in shear-cracked. Based on equilibrium equation in the beam notch cross section, shear force was expressed in terms of fracture process zone length. Then, in a double notch four-point beam, Mode II of the stress intensity factor due to the external load is determined. Finally, this process presents the relationship between the shear capacity and the fracture process zone length and expresses the fracture resistance as a function of fracture process zone length.The predicted results of loading capacities are then shown.",

The average yielding of the extracted seed oil was 50.6%, a value similar to those presented in literature. Moreover, its density presented a value of 931.5 g L-1 and its acid index, 4.5 mg KOH g-1. In the last step of this study, biodiesel was produced by basic methyl route using potassium hydroxide. The specific mass of the produced biodiesel was 909.2 kg m-3 at 20°C; its acid index was 0.473 mg KOH g-1 and its flash point was 178°C. The values of heating values in natura and the low level of ashes in the residual biomass makes the Tung’s fruits a promising renewable clean source of energy of second generation fuel.",

However, this hypothesis cannot be applied for some special regions, denominated 'D regions' or 'Discontinuity regions'. Deep beams are usually classified into this category and, for this reason, the Brazilian structural code (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas [ABNT], 2014) proposes the design of these elements using Strut-and-Tie Method (STM), which is based on forces acting in hypothetical truss models. Different from the Strut-and-Tie Method (STM), the Stress Field Method (SFM) is based on the knowledge of the stresses acting inside of a structure. Both methods have the same purpose, identify the load carrying mechanisms inside of a complex region. In order to evaluate the potential of the so-mentioned methods, the Jconc software package, which is based on the Non-Linear Elastic-Plastic Stress Fields (NL-EPSF), was applied for the design and analysis of some deep beams. Based on some validations and comparisons, it was possible to propose a solution based on the SFM for the analysis, design, and detailing of deep beams. Finally, the parameters established by the ABNT (2014) for the deep beams were evaluated based on the simulations.",

Cardiovascular diseases have become the primary cause of deaths and disabilities across the globe. Therefore, this problem needs to be addressed with urgency. The disintegration of blood clots requires fibrinolytic agents, which are involved in thrombolysis. Streptokinase and urokinase are fibrinolytic enzymes; the former is primarily produced from microbial sources and the latter is isolated from urine, respectively. Streptokinase and urokinase have been in use for a long time to treat cardiovascular diseases. This review explains in detail the comparison of employing streptokinase and urokinase for the said purpose in a cost-effective manner. The recombinant production of both the agents has been discussed in detail. Furthermore, the efficacy of both the agents has been compared based upon their side effects and retention time in the body. A thorough study has been made to compare the influence of using both the agents on the health of cardiovascular patients in the last decade.",

    "abstract": "Irrigation is a practice that increases productivity and enables the expansion of agricultural borders. This practice should be well managed to ensure the efficient use of water by plants, and such management requires specialized labor, which increases operating costs. Therefore, the main objective of this study is the implementation of an automated irrigation system that considers factors ranging from water demand to the operation of the system. Because the daily water demand is determined by crop evapotranspiration, a low-cost weather station was developed to acquire data daily. Such data can be used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using the Penman-Monteith model of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Thus, by combining the amount of water required by a crop with the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil and the hydraulic properties of the irrigation system, it was possible to determine the daily frequency and amount of time required for the system to operate to meet the water requirements of the crop without undergoing stress from a deficit or an excess of water. The management/monitoring system was designed and implemented to allow the user to access data remotely through an online application. This application enables the real-time transmission of irrigation-related data, such as weather station data and system logs, obviating the need for the user to be present at the crop site. This allows the supervision of many areas simultaneously with low cost",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a biostimulant and the plant extract (Cyperus rotundus) on the growth forage, and grain production in millet (cultivar IPA BULK 1BF) submitted to salt stress conditions. The research was carried out at the Serra Talhada Academic Unit, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, in the Semiarid region of the Northeast of Brazil, from February to April 2017. The experiment was installed in randomized blocks, in a 3x4 factorial scheme, composed of a biostimulant (ACADIAN®), nutsedge extract, and the control, in four salinity levels of the irrigation water, electrical conductivities of 0, 1, 2 and 4 dS m-1, with four repetitions. Biometric analysis of all plants was carried out weekly to monitor crop growth. At 77 days after emergence, measures of net CO2 assimilation and transpiration rates were obtained. The harvest occurred with the maturation of the grains (ED9), being analyzed the dry mass of the different morphological components of the plant. The biostimulant at the level of 2 dS m-1 promoted an increase of 66% in the leaf area of millet compared to the control. With 4 dS m-1, the nutsedge extract provided an increase of 253% in the leaf area compared to the control. These expressive results obtained with the use of these compounds reflected in a production of dry leaf blade mass. The IPA BULK 1 BF millet cultivar has tolerance to the salinity levels studied in this research. The nutsedge extract and the biostimulant are alternatives capable of stimulating the growth and the production of forage of millet under the presence of salts in the irrigation water, however, these compounds have no influence on grain production",

Due to the geometric characteristics, the manufactured heat pipes can be used in electronics cooling. The heat pipes are used to enhance the heat transfer and are based on phase change. The sintered metal powder structures have a high capillary pumping, low pores, and good thermal conductivity. The heat pipes were manufactured from a straight copper pipe with an external diameter of 9.45mm, an inner diameter of 7.75mm, and a length of 200mm. The capillary structure was made of sintered copper powder with three different thicknesses (2.125mm, 1.500mm, and 0.875mm). Distilled water was used as the working fluid. Each thickness was analyzed with four different filling ratios related to the evaporator volume: 60, 80, 100, and 120%. The condenser was cooled by forced convection of air, the adiabatic section was insulated, and the evaporator was heated by an electrical resistor and was insulated from the environment with aeronautic insulation. The heat pipes were tested horizontally under different low heat loads (from 5 up to 45W). The experimental results showed that all sintered heat pipes worked satisfactorily. However, Type #3 Heat Pipe with a filling ratio of 100% showed the best thermal performance.",

For the applicability of the method, firstly, the basin physical characteristics are compiled in Arc-GIS environment. Then, parameters related to the physical properties of the land are processed via HEC-GeoHMS, and continuous rainfall-runoff simulations are estimated by the HEC-HMS. The simulation parameters are conducted with five different objective function methods, and evaluations of the model performance are explained in addition to graphical methods with different metrics including NSCE, MRE and PCC. Results show that the HEC-HMS simulations capture time of the peak although predictions slightly underestimate value of the peak flows and runoff volume. Nevertheless, runoff fluctuation is simulated well respect to observed hydrographs over the watershed during both calibration and verification periods. In addition, the obtained simulation values with this study show that the hydrograph values of the rivers in the Ballikaya Watershed have the potential to be predicted via computer environment without any need from gauging measurements. Results can be used to investigate potential drought and flood risks over the region based only on the weather forecasts for the future studies.",

The secondary congestion problem arises from the pooling of the trucks at the port gates because of the delays of the port operations. The absence of the truck parking areas inside the port causes additional truck trips between the port and auxiliary truck servicing areas around the port. For reducing the impacts of the associated problems of the port induced truck traffic, truck parking areas can be used as buffer zones between the port and city. The purpose of this study is to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) with using multimethod simulation and cost optimization model for the capacity design of a truck parking area for a city port. The preliminary design of the parking area is used to estimate the development cost and outputs of the simulation model is coupled for the capacity optimization for truck arrival scenarios. The methodology is implemented for a case study of the İzmir city port in Turkey. The results of the study indicated that significantly different parking area capacities are required for different truck dwell times for the time restricted and unrestricted truck arrivals",

    "abstract": "The retina is an eye layer that incorporates light- and color-sensitive cells as well as nerve fibers. It collects light and distributes it to the brain for image processing through the use of the optic nerve. Diseases that end up causing vision loss and blindness are generated by retinal ailments. As a result, it is imperative to diagnose and treat certain disorders as early as possible. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an angiography imaging technique, is operated to help diagnose retinal disorders. Deep learning approaches, which are extensively utilized, have now become a convenient way for diagnosing retinal illnesses through OCT images as a result of their effective outcomes in interpreting medical images. To diagnose retinal disorders utilizing OCT scans, this investigation developed a hybrid methodology based on image pre-processing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (a deep learning method). Image pre-processing techniques including background filling, resizing, noise reduction, and highlighting are exercised at the pre-processing stage. The segmentation process provides a new CNN architecture with five convolution layers that does have a low computational cost. Compared to other publications using the same data set, the proposed method seems to have a success rate of 99.48 percent in the detection of retinal disorders, closing a significant gap in the literature. The proposed approach has the advantage of maintaining low computing costs in comparison to other studies in the literature. When the conclusions are regarded, it is noticed that the suggested method might be exerted as a decision support system to assist physicians in the clinical context during the diagnosis of retinal disorders.",

The area was chosen because the municipality is the most important of its microregion, being an attractive pole of work due to the presence of several companies, with emphasis on the mining company Kinross Gold Corporation, which is one of the largest open pit mines and gold producers in Brazil. Images of LANDSAT-5 and 8 satellites were used, which underwent a resampling and standardization of pixels to become the same size. The satellite choice and the period of analysis was based on the beginning of mining activity in the municipality, and a year that was able to represent its current state. Subsequently, the LST calculations made available by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were applied. When comparing the results of both areas of the first and last year of the series, there was an increase in the variation of the mean, minimum and maximum LST, a fact that is related with the suppression of vegetation for the growth of both areas. Such suppression, together with anthropic occupation, is responsible for one of the neighborhoods (28) that present the highest average variation of LST over the years. On the other hand, the neighborhood that presented the smallest variation on this parameter (47) was recently incorporated as a neighborhood in the city’s Master Plan because it is currently being occupied by the construction of an allotment, evidencing that the temporal variability of LST in the municipality occurs in relation to anthropic presence and its magnitude.",

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the conservation of frozen strawberries using gelatin as a coating and of the probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii. Strawberries were selected, sanitized and subjected to the following treatments: Treatment 1 - control 1 (strawberries stored at -18ºC); Treatment 2 - control 2 (strawberries stored at -80ºC); Treatment 3 - strawberries added with citric acid, calcium chloride and S. boulardii stored at -18ºC; Treatment 4 - strawberries with gelatin, citric acid, calcium chloride, glycerol and S. boulardii stored at -18ºC. Drip loss, soluble solids, titratable acidity, color, firmness, ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds, monomeric anthocyanins, antioxidant activity, polyphenoloxidase activity and viability of S. boulardii were analysed. The gelatin coating added with citric acid and calcium chloride, in combination with freezing at -18ºC, reduced the drip loss, the metabolic reactions and exerted a protective effect on bioactive compounds, making it possible to use them instead of deep-freezing, mainly for agribusinesses that do not have the equipment. The use of gelatin coating on strawberries minimized the effects of freezing and promoted the protection of S. boulardii, obtaining in up to 60 days of storage the minimum viable concentration of the microorganism to exercise its functional property. On the other hand, in the absence of gelatin, S. boulardii had a negative influence on the physical-chemical parameters, in addition to showing less viability. Thus, the study demonstrated that the coating composed of gelatin, citric acid and calcium chloride can represent an interesting alternative for application on frozen strawberries enriched with S. boulardii.",

Among all extraction methods investigated, extracts obtained by the Soxhlet method using ethanol as solvent showed a higher total polyphenol content, 2.83% of gallic acid equivalent/g plant material, as well as higher antioxidant activity. A correlation between rutin content and antioxidant activity was found. Soxhlet extractions revealed samples with the highest rutin content of 0.130 ± 0.003 g g-1, what may explain the high antioxidant activity of the obtained A. muricata leaf extracts.",

Based on this context, our research aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and bioactive compounds and characterize for the first time the phenolic profile in yellow puçá, brown puçá, and black puçá by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection (HPLC–DAD). The three puçá varieties contained considerable quantities of important food constituents, such as high concentrations of vitamin C, carotenoids and phenolic compounds. These fruits are mostly composed of phenolic acids, with p-coumaric acid being the major compound in all varieties, while ellagic acid was detected only in the brown puçá. Moreover, (−)-epicatechin was found only in the yellow puçá. This study is the first to report the identification of the phenolic profile in puçá. Moreover, our data indicate that the three fruit varieties present a promising chemical composition, suggesting that they may serve as potential sources of natural antioxidants.

    "abstract": "This was a study on the mechanical behavior of hot asphalt mixtures with regard to permanent deformation, considering static creep tests and the parameters derived from the Superpave compaction curve. For the asphalt mixture production, mineral aggregates and two types of asphalt binder (CAP 50/70 and AMP 60/85) were used. These mixtures were designed using the Superpave methodology and compacted in the content and number of gyrations according to the design. For the design condition, asphalt mixtures using the conventional CAP 50/70 asphalt binder showed better workability and lower deformation than asphalt mixtures with the AMP 60/85 polymer binder. Furthermore, the influence of asphalt binder content on the behavior of asphalt mixtures in relation to permanent deformation and compaction indices was studied, considering the maximum number of gyrations in the design. Regarding this investigation, asphalt mixtures with higher asphalt binder content tend to show higher permanent deformation and better workability. Complementarily, the compaction curve indices (Construction Densification Index, CDI; modified Traffic Densification Index, TDIm and Locking Point, LP) were correlated with parameters obtained from static creep tests (total deformation after the recovery period, Dt; creep modulus, CM and curve inclination, Icurve) through curves obtained by the correlation between these indices. Based on this analysis, a good correlation was found between the results of static creep tests and compaction indices, showing the potential of these indices for predicting the mechanical behavior of the analyzed mixtures in relation to the development of permanent deformations.",

Apple juices are an interesting alternative of using the fruits. The aromatic components are distributed in the fruit and the processing can influence their composition. Besides, the responsible enzymes for darkening and off-flavor must be inhibited or eliminated to improve the quality of the juices. Apples of the Fuji and Gala varieties were processed with the peel and without the peel to obtain clarified juices through pectinolytics enzymes and treatment with gelatin and bentonite. The apples and the obtained juices were submitted to physical-chemistries, microbiological, sensorial and yield analyses. Results of the microbiological analyses showed the efficiency of the processing and of the thermal treatment adopted. Due to the fact that the physical-chemical attributes and the acceptance have not differed in a significant way in the juices with and without the peel, it can be concluded that the processing of clarified juices with the peel is the most suitable, once they allow a higher yield.",

    "abstract": "The propagation of soliton waves is simulated through splices in quadratic optical media, in which fluctuations of dielectric parameters occur. A new numerical scheme was developed to solve the complex system of partial differential equations (PDE) that describes the problem. Our numerical approach to solve the complex problem was based on the mathematical theory of Taylor series of complex functions. In this context, we adapted the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to approximate derivatives of complex functions and resolve the algebraic system, which results from the discretization, implicitly, by means of the relaxation Gauss-Seidel method. The mathematical modeling of local fluctuations of dielectric properties of optical media was performed by Gaussian functions. By simulating soliton wave propagation in optical fibers with Gaussian fluctuations in their dielectric properties, it was observed that the perturbed soliton numerical solution presented higher sensitivity to fluctuations in the dielectric parameter β, a measure of the nonlinearity intensity in the fiber. In order to verify whether the fluctuations of β parameter in the splices of the optical media generate unstable solitons, the propagation of a soliton wave, subject to this perturbation, was simulated for large time intervals. Considering various geometric configurations and intensities of the fluctuations of parameter β, it was found that the perturbed soliton wave stabilizes, i.e., the amplitude of the wave oscillations decreases as the values of propagation distance increases. Therefore, the propagation of perturbed soliton wave presents numerical stability when subjected to local Gaussian fluctuations (perturbations) of the dielectric parameters of the optical media.",

The characterization analysis (TPR, DRS, acidity, FTIR and textural analysis) indicated a synergic effect and differentiated interaction between the oxides and the formation of a new phase in the catalystic Nb 2 O 5 -TiO 2 . Decolorization and mineralization results showed that the color reduction is not directly related to the COD reduction and that the efficiency of the photocatalytic process depends on both, the effluent to be treated and the photocatalyst worked, showing that the use of Nb 2 O 5 and visible irradiation on the photo degradation of the textile effluents is promising.",

    "abstract": "High productivity and meantime perishability of in natura eggs, make powdered egg attractive for patisseries and pasta industries. Water reduction in 65%, extends shelf life from 1 to 12 months, preventing also Salmonella. Maximum powdered egg moisture allowed by Brazilian law is 6.0% (w w-1). However, its determination by reference technique (oven at 105ºC for 8 hour) is lengthy for processing industry. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of several spectral pre-processing techniques in the application of near-infrared spectroscopy associated with chemometrics models for determination of moisture content in powdered egg, without the need of sample preparation and destruction, held at 0.5 min. Several pre-treatment techniques were evaluated to ensure spectral data reliability such as: standard normal variation; multiplicative scatter correction; smoothing and detrend. The principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) were evaluated with and without pre-treatment. The best results were observed in NIR/PLS model (49 samples), providing an adequate correlation (r) of 0.96, for cross-validation. Using 21 samples as prediction set, NIR/PLS showed relative error (RE) &lt; 2.0%, compared to primary methods oven and thermobalance, indicating to be suitable for industrial quality control.",

    "abstract": "This paper sets out to examine a small absorption chiller that uses the pair LiBr/ H2O with a 4.5 kW nominal capacity, using theoretical modeling and the characteristic equation method. The idea is to compare two ways of simulating and evaluating absorption systems by analyzing the temperatures and flow rates of external hot, chilled and cold water circuits, as well as the values of the overall heat transfer coefficients of each component. Energetic analysis is based on conserving mass and energy by taking into consideration the overall heat transfer coefficients and their respective areas via the UA products of the 5 components of the absorption chiller. The characteristic equation method is based on Duhring’s rule of the internal temperature which is founded on saturation mean temperatures and the Duhring coefficient (B). The results of comparing the activation of thermal power and the cooling capacity of the Rotartica absorption chiller, obtained by theoretical modeling and from the characteristic equation values, were good since the mean relative errors found were 4% lower for most of the operating conditions examined.",

Rainfall data from ECMWF were obtained from pixels corresponding to 24 meteorological stations of the state of São Paulo. The consistency of the surface data was evaluated by the following tests: Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), Buishand and Pettitt. In order to evaluate the agreement between the surface data and the ECMWF data, for cumulative rainfall and SPI values, the following measures of accuracy were used: Willmott index of agreement (d2), modified Willmott index of agreement (d1), and mean absolute error (MAE). Higher concordances were found in the dry period (June to September). In the wet period (December to March), the ECMWF overestimated rainfall data in up to 75% of localities when compared to meteorological station data. The results indicated that the use of SPI increases the agreement between data from the ECMWF and the meteorological stations, compared to rainfall series. The highest correlations were found in the dry period leading to the conclusion that the ECMWF performs better during this period.",

In the digital modeling, small differences were found in the contour, both in the mesh and the final product. There was no difference in the results for the horizontal layout between softwares. For vertical layout, there was a slight difference in the terrain profile possibly caused by the digital modeling of the programs. In superwidth, TopoGRAPH and TCP-MDT were the ones that best met the Brazilian standards. To calculate the superwidth, the best results were found with AutoCAD Civil 3D and TCP-MDT. Besides, there were small differences between the respective land volumes computed by the softwares, which may have larger magnitude for a project with greater longitudinal extension. Therefore, it is concluded that the choice of the software can affect since the technical parameters until the planning of the work, with implications on the overall cost.",

    "abstract": "Seeking renewable energy sources has been a very important aspect in the development of human society, with many authors regarding hydrogen as a rather promising energy source. There are several forms of obtaining hydrogen, including steam reforming of hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers. Some characteristics of methanol, such as processing at mild temperatures from 250 to 350oC under atmospheric pressure and production from biomass – no competition for food production – have distinguished it from other alcohols for steam reforming. The great disadvantage of this technology when applied in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is that the process of methanol steam reforming involves not only hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but also the production of a small amount of carbon monoxide, which is sufficient to affect the functionality of the fuel cells. This work presents the characterization of the catalyst HiFUEL R120 and shows how water/methanol molar ratio in the feed stream of an integral methanol steam reforming reactor influenced the conversion and the hydrogen selectivity in relation to carbon monoxide. This made it possible to identify the best operational conditions for lowering carbon monoxide content in the reactor effluent, avoiding the use of a CO purification unit.",

This research considers the down stream of the Karun River in southwest of Iran as case study. For calibration of Fluvial-12 model, the deformations of river cross sections from 1996 to 2013 were measured by surveying. Using of the Ackers – White (1973) equation eventuates the best fitness between calculated deformations by Fluvial-12 model and observed deformations. This equation is an appropriate sediment transport equation for river beds and banks that their materials are silt or fine sand such as the most of tidal rivers in the world. For design return period N years, the highest erosion occurs at flood return period N years and tidal flow return period 1 year. At cross sections near the mouth of the river the highest sedimentation occurs at flood return period 1 year and tidal flow return period N years but at cross sections far from the mouth of the river the highest sedimentation occurs at flood return period N years and tidal flow return period 1 year. Because sedimentation occurs at flood cycle of tide at near the mouth of the river, tidal flow that its velocity is low causes sedimentation. On the other hand, erosion occurs at ebb cycle of tide and fluvial flow intensifies ebb velocity toward the mouth of the river therefore fluvial flow causes erosion at the whole length of the river.",

The free lipase showed an optimum pH close to neutrality, while the biocatalysts displaced the pH to the alkaline region (optimum pH 9.0 and 11.0 for PES-ADS-lipase and PES-COV-lipase, respectively). The optimum temperature of free lipase was 55°C; however, a higher thermal stability occurred at 37°C. The PES-ADS-lipase and PES-COV-lipase showed lower optimum temperatures (37 and 45°C, respectively) but higher thermal stabilities at 45 and 55°C, respectively. The lower thermal inactivation constant and higher half-life of PES-COV-lipase at 55°C confirmed the efficiency of covalent bonding in maintaining the thermal stability of the enzyme. The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) and maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) were also determined, and the biocatalysts showed higher affinities to substrates (lower Km values) than free lipase. In this work, the biocatalysts showed good catalytic properties with future potential applications in hydrolysis reactions.

This study evaluated the biodegradation of PHEs from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film, aiming to mitigate damage to the environment. Therefore, 23 microorganisms were prospected and isolated from the Serra do Ouro Branco State Park (Minas Gerais, Brazil), where screening was carried out by growth in enriched microbial medium and esterase-activity was monitored by diffusion in solid agar. Three microorganisms were selected. Bacterium (I) presented the highest esterase activity, as evidenced in the diffusion tests in solid medium. Further, evidence of this is given by the biodegradation of PHEs into phthalic acid, because changes the acid concentration from 0 to 3.10 ± 0.07 mol L-1 and 28 % mass reduction of PVC film after 24 days. Furthermore, after six days of biodegradation the number of viable cells and ammonia concentration showed no significant change. This indicates that the survival of the Bacterium (I) cells is independent of ammonia consumption, but rather depends on PHEs consumption. The detection of the organic functions of -COOH and –COOR proved the biodegradation of PHEs by Bacterium (I), thus demonstrating its potential to be used in bioremediation of soils and rivers from PHEs contaminants.",

Most of the spent yeast is sold at low prices, or disposed as waste or used as animal feed. Spent yeast biomass is predominantly composed of proteins, and it has a high biological value, being an excellent source of high-quality protein, comparable in value with soy protein. Therefore, spent yeast biomass has great potential for use in foodstuffs for human consumption. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of cell rupture over the drying kinetics of spent yeast biomass using mathematical models (Lewis and Page). Also, to verify the influence of cell rupture method over the amount of protein. The cellular rupture was performed by two methods (chemical method and physical method: ultrasound). The drying process was performed by freeze-drying, and the parameters of the models were obtained using the non-linear regression (Generalized Reduced Gradient Nonlinear Optimization Code). Mathematical models of drying kinetics showed a strong correlation with the experimental data, R² &gt; 0.96. The disruption process did not significantly affect the drying time and protein content. But the cellular autolysis improves the protein digestibility since the proteins will be totally available to the digestive enzymes and also increase the bioavailability of nutrients.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses Property Value Map updating, specifically when it comes to the absence of methods that allows for efficiency, agility and transparency in estimating property value in Brazilian municipalities. In many cities, the Property Value Map is not being updated due to use of complicated methodologies that require several people and a great amount of time to be applied. For the cities, all properties have a significant importance, since they provide financial resources for city maintenance, considering that the value of the property serves as reference for the Municipal Property Tax and the Property Conveyance Tax to be collected. A failure to update the Property Value Map has been favoring the establishment of a condition of maladjustments in the sphere of public administration concerning property value, as well as tax collection, triggering situations intrinsic to this condition, such as the updating need for promotion of social equity and fair taxation. The present investigation also questions the use of single-family building values, resulting from Mass Appraisal, in substitution of market values, to update the Property Value Map. The modelling was designed through the Regression Method based on variables from appraisal studies in other countries. This procedure will speed up property value updating, bringing about fiscal sustainability and transparency to the Public Administration.",

The effect of salt concentrations (NaCl) of 0.0, 0.29, 0.59, 1.17, 1.76, and 2.34% (w v-1) when mixed with egg white concentrations of 0.50, 1.00 and 1.50% (w v-1) were studied using corn and soybean vegetable oils. Globally, one observed that emulsifying activity and emulsion stability increase with the enhancement of salt concentration. However, the increase of the egg white concentration did not present a significant influence on emulsifying activity, causing an increment only in emulsion stability.",

The present study aims to isolate bacteria from the aquatic environment and evaluate their potential tolerance to copper metal, aiming at bioremediation processes. Also, compare co-resistance to heavy metal and antibiotics. The morphology of isolates was observed, and sequence analysis (16S ribosomal DNA) revealed that isolated strains were closely related to species belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Bacillus. Bacterial isolates were resistant to CuSO4, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.78 mg ml-1. Enterococcus lactis was resistant to a combination of copper and tetracycline. The other tested isolates were sensitive to the tested antimicrobials. The metal removal ability of these isolates was assayed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and the strains 27, 23, and E. lactis were best at removing heavy metals, at 87.7%. Enterococcus casseliflavus EC55 was 62%, followed by Bacillus aerius (18.4%), E. casseliflavus EC70 (10%) and Bacillus licheniformis (10%).

    "abstract": "Forage cacti can contribute to increases in biomass yields in agricultural areas, improving the use efficiency of local natural resources. Forage cactus stands out as a forage alternative in semi-arid regions due to its high potential of phytomass production and energy value, large water reserve and easy propagation. The objective of this study was discriminate as morphometric characteristics of Nopalea cochenillifera cladodes in relation to Little and Giant Sweet clones. This research was conducted from March 2016 to July 2019. The design used was randomized blocks with five replicates using the forage cactus clones Little and Giant Sweet of Nopalea cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck. The experimental unit was an area of 126.0 m2 (12.6 x 10.0 m). Study sample is composed of 1018 cladodes (581 of Little Sweet clone) and (437 of Giant Sweet clone), randomly collected. Variables evaluated were the cladode length, width, thickness, area weight. T-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, discriminant analysis and canonical variables analysis were used to evaluate, compare and discriminate the morphometric characteristics of forage cactus clones. The Giant Sweet clone presented the highest means for the variables length, width, area and weight. Fisher's discriminant function verified a 99.41% hit rate to differentiate groups of forage cactus clone. The hit rate for Little Sweet clone was of 98.97%, while for Giant Sweet clone was of 100.00%. With two canonical variables the explanation rate of the morphometric characteristics for the behavior of forage cactus clones is higher than 90%. Morphometric characteristics of cladodes can be used as parameters that help in the identification of Nopalea cochenillifera clones with high discriminatory power.",

The addition of ABTS as a mediator increased eight-fold the amperometric response. The electrode was sensitive to pH variation with best response at pH 4.0. Studies on different concentrations of laccase and ABTS at different pH rates revealed that the composition 187 U mL-1 in laccase and 200 µL of ABTS obtained the highest amperometric response.

    "abstract": "The reduction of the fuel consumption of the vehicles driven by combustion engines is a target of the automakers, governments and drivers. The literature asserts that the adjustment of the driver behavior results in a substantial fuel economy. Specifically, the gear shifting is one aspect of the driver behavior that can be changed by the use of support systems installed in the vehicle that indicate the right moment that the gear must be shifted. The interested community is focused on the development of the algorithms that are implemented in these support systems. These algorithms must be able to arbitrate between two antagonistic objective functions simultaneously: the maximization of the performance and the fuel economy. Thus, this paper demonstrates that it is possible to calculate the trade-off threshold between performance and fuel economy of a vehicle by means of the multiobjective optimization of the gear shifting considering a known driving cycle. To reach this objective, it is created a dynamic model of an automobile base on the literature data; the optimization algorithm implemented is Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm - II and the driving cycle used is described by the standards ABNT NBR6601:2012 and FTP-72.",

Sampling sufficiency of fibre length, fibre diameter, lumen diameter and fibre wall thickness were determined. Three scenarios of sampling sufficiency evaluation were used: general, segregation between juvenile and mature wood, and accumulation throughout the life of the tree. The segregation of juvenile and mature wood showed that sampling sufficiency in juvenile wood was higher than in mature wood, up to three times for the fibre length. In general, results indicated higher values than suggested in specific standards and by other authors.

Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to represent the column equilibrium data. A phenomenological model was used to represent the breakthrough curves. The mathematical model was obtained by means of mass-balance equations applied to an element of the column in the liquid phase and solid phase. The overall mass-transfer coefficient was estimated using the experimental data of the breakthrough curves.

Standard compounds mapped in the analysis comprised fructose, lactic acid, acetic acid, glycerol, glucose and ethanol. The yeast showed ethanol productivity between 0.75 and 1.91 g L-1 h-1, respectively, without the addition of supplementary nutrients or detoxification.

The monthly hourly asymmetry coefficients were also used to characterize the distributions. The largest or smaller degree of adjustment of the hourly wind speed data to the appraised models were influenced by the hour of the day, and, in the night period, between zero and five hours, the distribution of Weibull presented the best adjustment, followed by Beta and Gama distributions.

Although twenty-eight bean samples obtained in the southern region of the state of Minas Gerais,Brazil, were analyzed, they failed to match any of the OPPs under analysis. The absence of OPPs in the samples could be due to the degradation that occurred between the use of OPPs and bean commercialization, levels below the detection /quantification limits and the non-use of OPPs in bean cultivation.",

The main objective was to promote the geotechnical evaluation of soil samples from four cut slopes in residual soil profiles of highways and local secondary roads in order to assess the potential of the anthropic impact on the soil susceptibility to accelerated erosion processes. Soil samples were named: red residual soil (RRS); pink residual soil (PRS); yellow residual soil (YRS); and white residual soil (WRS). The methodology used consisted of geotechnical characterization tests, infiltration rate and modified mass loss by immersion tests performed on soil samples from these profiles, using the physical parameters and indirect assessment of erodibility proposed in 2000 by Bastos et al. The results of indirect assessment of erodibility, which were derived from tests based on the MCT methodology, highlighted the different susceptibility of the investigated soils to hydric erosion. The parameters proposed by the referred authors were complementary to conventional criteria for an adequate classification of tropical soils into their respective classes of erodibility. Among the tested soil samples, the highest erodibility was associated with the YRS and PRS, respectively, in the natural and pre-moistened conditions, as well as it was not detected erodibility in the RRS and WRS.",

The model evaluates the influence of the main HVAC operating parameters of the chilled water system when operating under three different configurations. The results showed that the system with a differentiated compression presents a COP equal to that of the system with screw chillers in the range 0-300 RTs, and a COP hat is on average 9% higher in the range 400-800 RTs.",

Current paper considers the above scenario and evaluates the fitness of some robust functions in solving in steady state chemical processes data reconciliation problems represented by linear and nonlinear systems in the presence of gross errors. Traditional Cauchy, Fair, Contaminated Normal and Logistic robust functions are used in the reconciliation problem where their estimates are compared to those obtained with the use of the latest features, such as New Target and Alarm. Rates for gross errors in tests were limited between 4 and 10σ of the measured current and elaborated a region of outliers.

Thus, the modeling of the intra-individual dependency is required through the choice of a covariance structure that is able to receive and accommodate the sample variability. However, the lack of methodology for correlated data analysis may result in an increased occurrence of type I or type II errors and underestimate/overestimate the standard errors of the model estimates. In the present study, a Gaussian mixed model was adopted for the variable response latency of an experiment investigating the memory deficits in animals subjected to cerebral ischemia when treated with fish oil (FO). The model parameters estimation was based on maximum likelihood methods. Based on the restricted likelihood ratio test and information criteria, the autoregressive covariance matrix was adopted for errors. The diagnostic analyses for the model were satisfactory, since basic assumptions and results obtained corroborate with biological evidence; that is, the effectiveness of the FO treatment to alleviate the cognitive effects caused by cerebral ischemia was found.",

Additionally, centrality measures of nodes were obtained to identify situations where the insertion of an edge significantly increased the reliability of the network. Results showed that the reliability of the co-authorship network focusing on edges is more sensitive to changes in individual reliabilities than the reliability of the network focusing on nodes.

Current legislation, as enacted by Contran (National Traffic Council), has increased the axle weight limit for cargo vehicles by up to 10%. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine a cost-benefit ratio by using different types of structures, asphalt binders and load intensities. Typical pavements were determined and then analyzed by the software AEMC (SisPav) to obtain the horizontal tensile strain (εt) values at the bottom of the asphalt concrete layer and, later, the NFATIGUE value. It was found that the increase in weight, within values covered by legislation, might result in a reduction of approximately 50% in the NFATIGUE value for the pavement structures analyzed. As for economic impact, the same weight increase caused a mean increase of 120% in the cost of repeated loading on pavement structures (R$ NFATIGUE-1). It was also observed that structures with more robust asphalt concrete layers can provide the best R$ NFATIGUE-1 ratios. The best results for granular materials were found with thinner layers, associated with a thicker coating. The benefits of modified binders were shown by the analyses of the best structural options: both the polymer-modified binder and the rubber asphalt binder offer significant structural and economic improvements to the structure.",

A prototype was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the model using archetypes in the biomedical field, the Foundational Model of Anatomy and the Unified Medical Language System as domain knowledge and the Scientific Electronic Library Online database as a document repository. The use of visual representations in archetypes facilitates the dissemination of knowledge, because these are part of the world view of users and can easily be related with prior knowledge. Visual representations are processed quickly in the brain and require less effort than the processing of textual information.",

The effects of particle size (0.5 or 1.0 cm cubes and triturated mushroom), mushroom mass (10, 20, 40, 60 or 80 g in 250 mL of solution) and different mushroom tissue treatments were analyzed regarding color removal efficiency of dyes Reactive Yellow 37, Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Red in a synthetic solution of 13.3 mg L-1 concentration of each dye. The best results were found with larger superficial contact area between mushroom particle (triturated mushroom) and colored effluent under continuous aeration. Acetone addition during mushroom trituration process followed by a freezing step contributed to decolorization improvement, leading to best results: 73% after 6h, with 20 g of biocatalyst 250 mL-1 of effluent. The use of different mushroom batches and brands resulted in different enzymatic activities and similar levels of color removal, such result confirmed that decolorization does not have any direct relation with enzyme activity.",

Daily variations of surface climate factors in Maringá and their relationships with atmospheric systems which cause different types of weather during autumn and winter of 1996 have been investigated. The relationship between the activities of the Atlantic Polar Front (APF) and local rainfall has also been analyzed. The year 1996 has been chosen because of the absence of the El Niño and La Niña phenomena. The analysis was based on the dynamic concept of climate and on the rhythmic analysis methodology. Results show that during the period under analysis rainfall has been directly or indirectly an APF-caused result. Rainfall has been more related to the duration of front systems than to the number of occurrences of these systems within the region. Low temperatures were chiefly caused by the incursions of interior polar systems and, as a rule, when fronts failed to cause any rain.",

COD total, fixed and volatile solids, density, pH, and the presence of metals were analyzed.

The results demonstrated that in the cement/sludge paste, the values of mechanical resistance of 28 days can be superior to 10 MPa. The beginning of curing period was retarded when the proportion of sludge addition to the cement increases, but maintaining its same order of greatness. Also, the leaching found in the samples of paste without incorporating sludge is about the same order of greatness of that found in samples containing sludge. This allows concluding that the paste permits a safe incorporation of the metals detected in the textile sludge.

    "abstract": "Hydrosedimentological studies are fundamental for the adequate management of water resources. The Jordão River, the research study area, has the potential to generate electricity to serve a region of the TriânguloMineiro and Alto Paranaíba. In this sense, the understanding of sediment transport resources is important, since it represents a fundamental contribution for ensuring adequate management of water resources in the region. This research study has the general objective of examining sediment transport in the Jordão River, with the aim of obtaining a preliminary understanding into the dynamics of solid particles in this water body. To this end, the determination of the key curves of Flow vs Sediment concentration, the characterization of the sediment granulometry and the hydraulic and geometric aspects of the studied stations, as well as the analysis of the factors that influence the dynamics of sediments in the river, will be carried out. For this purpose, four sampling stations were established, fourteen campaigns were carried out for flow measurements and water and sediment collections for the analysis of suspended and bed sediments in dry and rainy seasons from August 2017 to December 2018. A relationship between suspended sediment concentration and liquid discharge is found in the literature as Css = α·Qβ, at the four stations on the Jordan River during the measured period, with a value of 14.593 &lt;α &lt;26.904 and 0.6722 &lt;β &lt;0.9462, along with the graph representing all values Css = 22.944·Q0.6991. Noteworthy from the collections carried out is the relationship between rainy and dry seasons, where there is no increase verified in the filming of sediments with the increase in the flow of the river. Regarding the bed solids obtained through granulometric curves, there is a noted deposit of sediments with less granulometry in the dry season, mainly in seasons 3 and 4.",

    "abstract": "The cost of electricity in hospitals represents a significant portion in its context of operating expenses. Therefore, it is important to constantly think about ways to reduce this cost without losing the quality and reliability required for hospital care activity. It is well known, that reducing electricity consumption has a direct impact on the effective management of hospital cash flow, so it is imperative to rationalize this resource. In this context, the objective of this paper focuses on analyzing the economic feasibility of purchasing and using a diesel generator to find the peak hour demand and verifying financial uncertainty by applying a Monte Carlo simulation approach to risk analysis. The target hospital of this research is located in southeastern of Brazil and it is part of a foundation that covers educational and assistance activities, serving the local population and thousands of patients during the year. Finally, the economic risk analysis applied through the Monte Carlo simulation found that the acquisition of the aforementioned diesel generator has a very high probability of viability. Therefore, it is verified that the investment is viable and attractive from the hospital's economic and operational point of view, while the Net Present Value remains positive, with the expected value of R$ 868,358.84, considering the risk and uncertainty analysis having an attractive internal returning rate of 78.76% per year.",

Its application in fermented sausages is considered promising, as its processing does not use heat treatment and with that there is no considerable loss of these microorganisms. In this study, the application of microencapsulated Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB12) was carried out in coppa. Three treatments were developed, consisting of control (C) without probiotic, BB1 with the addition of probiotic and 0.02% curing salt, and BB2 with probiotic and 50% reduction in curing salt (0.01%). Subsequently, possible changes in the physicochemical and sensory characteristics were analyzed, as well as the viability of the culture in the fermented product. All samples were presented according to the Brazilian legislation for the attributes of moisture, protein, and lipids. Probiotics showed a positive influence on the stabilization of lipid oxidation and microencapsulated probiotics proved to be viable after the ripening period of 30 days in treatment BB2. There was no significant difference between the samples for sensory analysis, so it is possible to state that the addition of BB12 is an alternative to obtain a product with all the benefits of functional foods.",

Drying technology is an effective process, used to increase the shelf life of these products. It also can provide an effective method of consumption of fruits in food products. In this study, the influence of the maturation stage and drying method on the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of Japanese grape pseudo-fruits (Hovenia dulcis T.) were studied. The centesimal composition, reducing sugars and nonreducing sugars, ratio, color, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the unprocessed pseudo-fruits, at different maturation stages (immature, in maturation and mature), were analyzed. Two drying methods were employed in the pseudo-fruits (oven with air circulation and freeze drying) obtaining flour from which moisture content, instrumental color, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were determined. The unprocessed pseudo-fruits of Japanese grape showed significant content of phenolic compounds at the early stages of maturation and high antioxidant capacity when mature (at the final stages of maturation). In addition, they showed a high content of fibers and sugars, and can be used as raw material in the food industry. After dehydration, the freeze-drying process provided a more stable color, because this process minimizes the enzymatic browning reactions, and preserved a greater number of phenolic compounds. The antioxidant activity, however, showed to be associated with the drying method, being higher in the flour obtained from lyophilized immature pseudo-fruits.",

Image artifacts, related to the presence of antenna towers, were observed in the west of Sao Paulo and a method of digital processing was successfully developed for their suppression. The resulting altimetric images presented mean positional error less than 2km. The mean altimetric error (around 75m), calculated by cartographically sampling elevation data, was explained by the combination of the positional errors with the slope angle distribution, among other effects. Despite a slight data dispersion, the correlation between the elevation of both image and topographical maps, with determination coefficient of r 2 =0.90, did not indicate the need for systematic fits on the images.",

Goal programming was used in order to minimize energy and labor costs, and to use of the full capacity of each piece of equipment, as far as possible. Constraints imposed were not to mix different types of products in each lot, dependence of lot assignment on the lots already assigned, the requirement to have a positive global contribution margin, and that each available dryer should be used within a specified capacity range. The independent variables were the numbers of items in each lot, according to product type. The Mixed Integer Linear Programming model developed was solved using GAMS and was applied to an industrial laundry located in Maringá, Paraná State, Brazil. The study demonstrated that it was possible to establish plans for efficient production and optimal allocation of resources. The existing global contribution margin of the industrial laundry ($295,405.50) was significantly smaller than the one that could be achieved with optimal operation ($647,770.00), because the existing operation did not make use of full capacity. The tool developed proved to be useful for assisting production planning in this kind of industrial process.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to estimate the suspension stiffness and damping coefficient of a tracked vehicle by using an inverse problem technique based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and on Random Restricted Window (R2W). The tracked vehicle has ten road wheels. Each road wheel is linked to a passive and independent suspension. A half car model with seven degrees of freedom describes the bounce and pitch dynamics of the chassis and the vertical dynamics of the wheels. Bounce and pitch accelerations are evaluated when the vehicle traverses a bump terrain. The inverse problem approach minimizes the total quadratic error between estimated and pseudo-experimental data for bounce and pitch accelerations. The viability of a field experiment to estimate the suspension parameters is analyzed, as well as the performance of the employed optimization methods and the effects of the noise on pseudo-experimental data.",

    "abstract": "The high cost of biodiesel production is mainly linked to the price of raw material.This factor has favored the use of alternative fats and oils such as those used in frying. Since biodiesel can be obtained from several vegetable and animal raw materials, the physicochemical characteristics of the fuel may vary considerably. One of these characteristics is the fatty acid composition. It directly affects the oxidative stability of biodiesel, which can be impaired when the fuel undergoes exposure to sunlight, metals, oxygen and high temperatures. In order to improve the oxidative stability of biodiesels produced from waste frying oil some studies involving blends of different raw materials have been carried out. In this sense, this work aimed to assess the characteristics resulting from the blending of soybean waste frying oil with other waste biodiesels in what concerns to oxidation. The blends of fatty materials were obtained by means of a 2² factorial design. The induction periods of biodiesel blends were enough to meet the ASTM D6751 standard. Swine fat was responsible for the increase in the induction period values.",

In addition, an ergonomic inspection was performed on the site by applying Bastien and Scapin´s ergonomic criteria. After analyzing results by descriptive statistics and content analysis, the ergonomic and usability problems were detected, or rather, feedback deficits, minimum action (navigation), flexibility and experience impaired the excellence of website´s functionality, causing dissatisfaction or abandonment of the website by the users. After the analysis of the results, ergonomic adjustments were suggested for the website. They may be a help in new website projects or adjust products in which usability has not been incorporated to the development process.",

Physical stability refers to the maintenance of fine texture, without the appearance of ‘grittiness’ given by large lactose crystals which are slowly formed during storage, causing great inconvenience in the product preservation. This work was carried out with the objective to verify the storage time effect on physical, physicochemical microbiological and sensory characteristics of the ‘Dulce de leche’ with coffee added whey and modified starch. It was found that the storage time has a significant effect on color variables b* and L* and in parameters texture (hardness, adhesiveness, elasticity, cohesiveness and gumminess). There was no formation of lactose crystals and microbiological quality was maintained throughout ‘Dulce de leche’ storage time. The time did not influence in the ‘Dulce de leche’ acceptance in relation to flavor, texture and overall impression, which shows that variations of color and instrumental texture did not affect the product sensory quality, providing an alternative for the use of whey and coffee in ‘Dulce de leche’ production, thus obtaining a new product.",

    "abstract": "Frying oil is one of the major environmental problems in urban centers, causing blockage of sewer pipes and pollution of rivers. Producing biodiesel with frying oil is an alternative to reduce the environmental impacts generated in the undue discarding of the same. Because it has high calorific power, great availability, low emission of pollutants when burned, besides being renewable, which guarantees its uninterrupted supply. This study evaluated the use of diesel blends with biodiesel from frying oil, in proportions varied by 10% for each treatment, ranging from B0 with 0% to B100 with 100% biodiesel, at room temperature and after heating at an average temperature of 50.63°C. The blends were evaluated through measurements of density, viscosity, calorific power and fuel consumption, which were useful for determining the power supplied. Without preheating, there was a gradual increase in fuel consumption, when the percentage of biodiesel in blends increased. However, preheating resulted in a decrease in consumption. Thus, without preheating, there was a low decrease of the power supplied by biodiesel compared to diesel oil. With preheating, this reduction was significantly higher.",

In all cases, it was used the peach-palm residue. In the SSF strategy, the decolorization process and laccase production were enhanced by increasing the concentration of final effluent. Even though the highest decolorization percentage (80%) was attained after 10 days of fermentation with G. lucidum EF 31 applied in the treatment of a final effluent, no significant differences were found in relation to the other two fungi. The decolorization efficiency obtained in the SF was lower compared with SSF, however, the presence of final effluent in the SF process improved the laccase activity. It was noted that the addition of peach-palm residue in this system provides a habitat for the fungus as well as a suitable source material for laccase production with the consequent decolorization of the effluent.",

Water sorption and desorption isotherms for BRS Elis and BRS Cauê barley cultivars were evaluated at 40, 50, and 60°C. Data were analyzed by the GAB, Freundlich, Halsey, Henderson, Langmuir, Oswin, and Smith models. The BET model was also fitted to determine the moisture content. All models were submitted to five tests to determine whether the model was statistically significant. Then, the models were ranked using corrected Akaike information criterion. At all temperatures, the equilibrium moisture content increases as water activity increases and temperature decreases. Data showed no hysteresis in both cultivars. The statistical parameters evaluated indicate the goodness of the fit for all models except for the GAB model for BRS Elis cultivar at 60°C. The analysis with the corrected Akaike information criterion revealed that the Oswin and Henderson models showed best results at 40 and 50°C for both cultivars studied. At 60°C, the Freundlich model was the best for both cultivars. For both cultivars, the value of isosteric heat decreases with an increase in moisture content.",

FT-IR/ATR, FT-Raman, TGA, and DSC analyses of the complexation products confirmed that MeJa/HPβCD complexes were formed by the four different examined methods of inclusion. FT-IR/ATR supported the inclusion, mainly based on the reduction of intensity of absorption at the wavelength of maximum absorbance of free MeJa (1733 cm-1), which was 27.69 au before inclusion. From these results, M3 (2.29 au) and M4 (0.90 au) were the most efficient techniques for complexation. TGA, and DSC analyses pointed out that the complexes formed by the methods M3 and M4 had the least loss of mass below approximately 305°C (the temperature that free HPβCD starts to decompose thermally). Except for M1, the results of antioxidant activity (AA) based on the DPPH assay revealed that the AA of the inclusion compounds were higher than that of free MeJa (α = 0.05).

We applied the sample entropy (SampEn) method on wind speed temporal series for each month of 2010, in order to analyze the intra-annual variability of complexity for wind dynamics and its relation with the wind potential. The results showed that wind speed fluctuations are more regular when comparing consecutive data sequences over one hour periods. Although the average wind speed was higher at 50m, indicating higher wind potential, the values of SampEn were also higher between June and September indicating a greater complexity of wind dynamics and consequently lower efficiency in wind energy capture. In the months of February, October, and November, when the average wind speed exceeded the minimum value for generation of wind power (3.5 m s-1) at both heights, the average wind speed increased and the entropy decreased with height. This indicates a higher wind potential and more regularity of wind dynamics at a height of 50 m, both favorable for wind energy production. For the rest of the year the wind power generation was possible only at height of 50 m.",

One was used as a reference beam and six were strengthened through the application of CFRP, with some variations regarding the strengthening, with the aim of verifying the efficiency of each system compared to the reference beam. For the computational analysis, the software ANSYS was used along with the plugin ACP (ANSYS Composite PrepPost), by comparing the results obtained in the simulation of the experimental results. Through the laboratory tests and the finite element simulation, it was concluded that the strengthening was efficient in all situations, but it was less efficient in cases where the strengthening was extended to the regions of simple flexure without proper anchorage. It was also possible to notice that the behavior of the simulated beams properly represented the reality, with the beams behaving comparably to the beams of the experimental test.",

This work explains the the streamline simulation concept and then a real oil field is studied using this technique, the streamline simulation is conducted by a commercial simulator, i.e., FrontSim streamline simulator and then the model was analyzed to find the optimum location of infill wells. In this work, 34 different cases were studied using Streamline simulation method and FrontSim software by considering different arrangement of infill wells. It was concluded that a significant enhancement in the ultimate recovery factor of the oil reservoir could be attained by considering different arrangement of the infill horizontal and vertical wells. It was highlighted that the ultimate recovery factor could be increased significantly, i.e., 13%. Additionally the water cut of the field could be reduced significantly. The novelty of this work is to capture the impact of both vertical and horizontal wells on the ultimate recovery enhancement simultaneously using the concept of streamline simulation and optimization of the field performance using streamline simulation concept.",

As a result, the VRF system showed an annual saving in air-conditioning of 42.08% related to the mini-split system. The annual electricity savings were 32.01, 2.14 and 32.80% for the VRF, solar control films, and both options together, respectively. The feasibility analysis of the VRF, considering financing and for a scenario consistent with the historical average growth of the electricity prices and inflation rate, showed that the use of a VRF instead of the splits units recovers the initial investment in 14 years. The application of solar control films proved to be economically unfeasible.",

The combination of yeasts may influence in the metabolic pathways of microorganisms and increase the yields and production rates of some compounds. In biotechnological processes with co-culture, one microorganism can prevail over the other. Therefore, the knowledge about how the population dynamics occurs during fermentation allows modifications in the process in order to obtain higher yields and to achieve greater fermentative efficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation with synthetic sugar cane broth in co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains CAT-1 and PE-2 followed by molecular fermentation monitoring. The concentration of biomass, ethanol, glycerol, acetic acid and residual sucrose were monitored to verify the influence of different combinations during the fermentation. The mixture of CAT-1 and PE-2 presented the highest ethanol production, with higher performance of fermentative parameters than pure cultures",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the post-harvest behavior of gabiroba fruit by maturity stage and storage temperature. The fruits were divided into two lots and stored at temperatures of 6, 12, 24 and 30°C. The first batch was used for the physical and chemical analysis of acidity, soluble solids, firmness, percentage of green color, and visual analysis; this batch was composed of green and yellow-green fruit. The second lot was intended for breath analysis, composed of green, yellow-green, and yellow fruits. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with five replications. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Considering the evaluated characteristics, the gabiroba soluble solid/titratable acidity ratio values should be approximately 4.0 for the fruits to be considered acceptable for consumption. For the preservation of the post-harvest quality of gabiroba, it is indicated that the harvest is carried out at the green stage of maturation and that they are stored at a temperature of 6°C. The highest respiratory rates were observed in fruits harvested at the yellow stage, not being recommended its storage.",

In recent years, obesity has become among the risk factors of hyperglycemia and oxidation stress. This study aims to investigate the potential of plants in Sabah, North Borneo to inhibit the key enzymes involved in obesity, hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. A total of 46 plant extracts were subjected to anti-pancreatic lipase, α-amylase inhibition and antioxidant assays. It was observed that S43 (Lantana camara) exhibited the greatest IC50 of anti-pancreatic lipase activity (mean of IC50 (±S.D.) = 0.20 mg mL-1 ± 0.010). Cinnamomum sp. (S42) has the most substantial α-amylase activity with a mean IC50 (±S.D.) = 2.68 mg mL-1 ± 0.471. S19 (Glochidion rubrum) was the most effective antioxidants (mean of IC50 (±S.D.) = 0.011 mg mL-1 ± 0.004) among all the investigated samples. Interestingly, three plant extracts were found (S6-Buchanania sp.; S22-Vitex negundo and S42-Cinnamomum sp.) to exhibit inhibition activity in anti-pancreatic lipase, α-amylase and antioxidant assays. The bioactivities of plant extracts have been closely related to the content of phytochemicals, as in earlier studies. Thus, plants have the potential to serve as supplements and nutraceuticals for obesity and other related complications.",

    "abstract": "Measurement techniques of nanoscale parameters have been vastly explored nowadays. In systems such as wood that possess anisotropic surfaces, these techniques provide reliable data on the surface morphology and related parameters. The atomic force microscope (AFM) and optical microscope were used to investigate the roughness and surface morphology of Dinizia excelsa. Cuts were made in different directions generating three distinct surfaces: radial, tangential and transverse. The samples went through a sanding process to reveal the original morphology of the steering. Both techniques show that the surface texture is different according to the analysed surface. The lowest roughness was observed on the transverse plane while the highest occurred on the radial. The comparison of the morphology evaluation by the two techniques allowed us to see that the AFM technique revealed the most sensitive images in smaller scales. These results confirmed that the AFM can provide satisfactory results for the surface parameters of Dinizia excelsa depending on the cut direction. This type of analysis can be useful in laboratory species identification processes and in deforestation inspection processes in the Amazon",

    "abstract": "The microencapsulation of benzoic acid by spray drying can provide amorphous characteristics, which is necessary for its application in foods. In addition, it facilitates the use of this component in a food matrix and prolongs the shelf life of the product. Thus, wall materials with high encapsulation efficiency should be used, such as modified starch and maltodextrin and their combinations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of modified starch (MS) and/or maltodextrin (M) used as encapsulating agents on the chemical and physical properties, morphological parameters, and thermal stability of spray-dried benzoic acid. Three treatments were evaluated: modified starch (MS), maltodextrin (M), and a blend containing modified starch and maltodextrin (MS/M). In general, the variables studied have a significant effect on the responses. The highest efficiency was observed for the treatment MS/M (82.65%); although it presented a lower drying process yield (50%). It was observed that the use of maltodextrin contributed to improving the wettability and solubility of the microparticles since this component is highly water-soluble. The largest microparticle diameter was 19.15 μm (MS/M), and the Span ranged from 1.94 to 2.15 for all treatments, indicating good homogeneity in relation to the particle size distribution. Concerning the particle morphology, the treatment MS/M exhibited partially rough microparticles, while the treatments MS and M led to a higher amount of brittle microparticles. The GAB model was chosen as the best model to explain the isotherm behavior. In addition, the adsorption isotherms of the samples using blend showed a Type-III behavior (non-sigmoidal), common for many foods rich in soluble components. The treatment MS/M has proven to be the most suitable for the encapsulation of benzoic acid being a good and viable option for the food industry",

The performance of the PEF technology can vary as a function of several process parameters and the conditions and procedures applied. The physicochemical characteristics (pH, total soluble solids, electrical conductivity) of the pumpkin juice were also evaluated. The juice showed 5.01 ± 0.01 of pH, 10.70 ± 0.11 (mS cm-1) of electric conductivity and 9.85 ± 0.07 of soluble solids while in nectar, these parameters were changed to 5.11 ± 0.01 of pH, 8.54 ± 0.21 of electric conductivity and 6.40 ± 0.12 of soluble solids. The use of a temperature of 40°C and pumpkin nectar (70:30, juice: distilled water) showed no difference in the bacterial reduction compared to 20°C and using 100% pumpkin juice, since in non-thermal processes it is better to use lower temperatures for less energy expenditure and less possibility of changes in raw material.

The current study describes the production kinetics of cellulases in stirred tank reactor by using mutant and wild strains of T. dupontii. The fermentation span of both the strains in bioreactor was examined. It is was found in mutant strain of T. dupontii fermentation time required for optimum production was reduced to 48h as compared to 72h in wild strain. The kinetic studies also exhibited greater value of µ (h-1) in case of mutated strain in comparison with wild strain. The effects of some other critical factors like agitation intensity dissolve oxygen, aeration, temperature, size of inoculum and pH was estimated on enzyme production kinetics. The results shows maximum activity of cellulases was attained at 220 rpm, 15% dissolve oxygen, aeration rate 1.5 vvm, 55°C, 8 % inoculum size and pH 5.5 for both strains respectively. The higher values of enzyme production kinetics i.e. Yp/x, Qp, Qx and qp in STR in case of mutant strain indicates its superiority over wild strain of T. dupontii. Thus mutant thermophilic T. dupontii might be a potential candidate for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Consumers preference for healthier foods is increasing, especially regarding sugar intake as it is related to many diseases such as obesity and diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different types of sugar (white crystal, icing, raw, brown, and coconut) on the physical, physicochemical, and sensory attributes of guava jam in order to evaluate the feasibility of replacing traditional sugars by alternative and more nutritious ones. Physicochemical attributes, rheological properties, texture profile, microbiological risk and sensory acceptance of guava jams were assessed. Coconut and brown sugars gave rise to darker jams with an intense reddish-brown coloration and higher hardness. The jams with higher sensorial quality were the traditional formulations produced with typical sugars - white crystal and icing sugars -, and with raw sugar. It was observed that the sugar used influenced the consumers perception of the product. In general, the most nutritious sugars, brown and coconut, did not produce to jams with good sensory acceptance. White crystal, icing, and raw sugars were more convenient to make the jams since it presented better sensory results. Clear appearance, less sweetness, more acidic, and softer jams are the features that most pleased the consumers.",

A simple technical and scientifically based technique is the sequent peak method, which has been widely disseminated, but presents limitations with respect to the length of the available data series. The objective of this study was to propose modifications to the sequent peak method to overcome the limitations related to the impossibility of associating the reservoir storage capacity with return periods different from the length of the data series. Storage capacities were estimated for every year, considering gauge stations located in the Urucuia River Basin, based on the sequent peak method. In order to associate such capacities with a frequency factor (return period), the Gumbel distribution was applied to the estimated storage values. This association with return periods which differ from the number of years in the data series showed great applicability",

    "abstract": "The impact evaluation of exogenous policies over time is of great importance in several areas. Unfortunately, an adequate time-series analysis has not always been taken into account in the literature, mainly in health problems. When regression models are used in the known interrupted time-series approach, the required error assumptions are in general neglected. Specifically, usual linear segmented regression (lmseg) models are not adequate when the errors have nonconstant variance and serial correlation. To instigate the correct use of intervention analysis, we present a simple approach extending a linear model with log-linear variance (lmvar) to estimate linear trend changes under heteroscedastic errors (lmsegvar). When the errors are autocorrelated, the Cochrane-Orcutt (CO) modification is implemented to correct the estimated parameters. As an application, we estimate the impact in temporal trend of the Brazilian Rede Mãe Paranaense (RMP) program in gestational syphilis occurrences in the state of Parana, Brazil. The comparison of the proposed linear segmented model (lmsegvar+CO) modeling both the average and variance, with the usual segmented linear model (lmseg), where just the average is modeled, shows the importance of taking heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation into account.",

In addition to the requirement to consider many quality attributes, there are usually large number of producers, who need daily milk evaluations. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of fuzzy logic in decision making for the classification of milk. In the fuzzification stage, physical and chemical characteristics of the milk were considered as input linguistic variables. For each linguistic variable, pertinence functions were created, and these were made considering the trapezoidal forms. In the inference stage, rules were established for the association of linguistic variables and output variables (adulterated, inadequate and adequate). To verify the efficiency of the modeled system, 1,000 adulterated, inadequate and adequate milk samples were computationally simulated. Precision was verified when automating decision making in the classification of milk by the fuzzy logic, totaling 100% of correctness. Therefore, the fuzzy system is an efficient tool for the classification of milk and can be used advantageously by professionals in the field in order to reduce human and financial resources.",

    "abstract": "Within the modern information, communication and technology (ICT), seeking high efficient and accurate corpus-based approaches to process natural language data (NLD) is critical. Traditional corpus-based approaches for processing corpus (i.e. the collected NLD) mainly focused on quantifying and ranking words for assisting human in extracting keywords. However, traditional corpus-based approaches cannot identify the meanings behind the words to properly extract terminologies nor their information. To address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to propose an integrated linguistic analysis approach that combines two corpus-based approaches and a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract and identify terminologies and create the text database for extracting deeper domain-oriented information by using the terminologies as channels to retrieve core information from the target corpus. Military domain is an uncommon research field and often classified as confidential data, which caused little researches to focus on. Nevertheless, military information is vital to national security and should not be ignored. Hence, to verify the proposed approach in extracting terminologies and information of the terminologies, the researchers adopt the US Army field manual (FM) 8-10-6 as the target corpus and empirical case. Compared with AntConc 3.5.8 and Tongpoon-Patanasorn’s hybrid approach, the results indicate that from the perspectives of terminology identification, texts database creation, domain knowledge extraction, only the proposed approach can handle all these issues.",

    "abstract": "Among the freshwater benthic macroalgae found in Brazilian rivers and streams, species of Oedogonium (Chlorophyta) have shown great ability to produce high biomass in several environmental conditions. Their resilience to eutrophic habitats provides an opportunity to assess the use of Oedogonium biomass for applications in different fields, especially those related to the extraction of biologically active compounds of interest for health, food, and cosmetic applications. Thus, this study assessed the effects of different organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, and methanol) and their mixtures when combined with water (20% v/v), on the extraction efficiency of total phenolic compounds (TPC), and their antioxidant capacity (AC), from Oedogonium sp. biomass, using simplex-centroid mixture design. TPC ranged from 90 to 150 mg of gallic acid equivalent per 100 g dry weight (DW), while AC ranged from 1 to 8 µM of Trolox equivalent per gram (DW). The highest TPC and AC were found for extracts using an ethanol/acetone (50:50) binary aqueous solvent mixture, while the lowest values for both TPC and AC were found for the methanolic aqueous solvent. Considering the relatively low-cost and less adverse environmental impacts of the ethanol and acetone aqueous mixture, our results suggest that the use of this specific mixture of organic solvents may have significant advantages in an eventual industrial process for the extraction of phenolic compounds from Oedogonium species.",

A significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05) in exhaustion time of the adsorption column was verified as a result of the increase in the flow rate. On the other hand, a significantly increase (p ≤ 0.05) in the rupture time and the mass transfer zone (MTZ) were observed when the bed depths rise. Furthermore, the experimental data were satisfactory described by the Yoon-Nelson model due to high values of correlation coefficient (R2).

    "abstract": "The dynamics of organic waste decomposition in the soil can be described by nonlinear regression models, however, the theory for regression models is valid for sufficiently large samples, and in general, in small samples, these properties are unknown. One of the methods for data analysis that has been widely used to overcome this problem is the bayesian inference, as it has the advantage of being able to work with small samples, in addition to allowing the incorporation of information from previous studies, and even having a probability distribution for the parameters, consequently, to present a direct interpretation for the credibility interval. However, criticism has been made because of the effect that a prior subjective distribution can have on posterior distribution. One way of determining objective prior is through of maximum entropy prior distributions. For data of organic waste decomposition in the soil, little is known about the probability distributions of the parameters. The present study aimed to use of maximum entropy prior distributions to the parameters of the Stanford &amp; Smith nonlinear model. In addition, using simulated data, to understand the effect that hyperparameters of prior distribution has on the posterior curve, and also to apply the methodology in the description of CO2 mineralization data from swine manure applied to the soil surface. Data analyzed came from an experiment conducted in a laboratory that evaluated the carbon mineralization of swine manure on the soil surface over time. The posterior distributions were obtained, so the bayesian methodology with maximum entropy prior was efficient in the study of the Stanford &amp; Smith nonlinear model to the data of carbon mineralization of swine manure on the soil surface.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at qualifying and quantifying the time spatialization of the continental Tropical mass participation in the state of weather in the west part of Brazil’s South Center, from 2002 to 2010, with special focus on 2003 and 2008, years of El Niño andLa Niña, considering that, beyond sparse studies, the region is close to this system’s center of action. As the origin of this air mass is continental, during its period of performance, days present low relative humidity, intense heating and lack of rain. In South Brazil, the performance is more intense in the hottest months, and on the west part of theWestCenterregion there are no studies. For this reason, it were chosen for this study the cities of Campo Mourão, in the State of Paraná, South of Brazil, and Cáceres, in the Sate of Mato Grosso, west part ofBrazil’sWestCenter. By analyzing the synoptic maps and satellite images, the participation of this system in a daily scale was quantified. The system showed itself more active for the region of Campo Mourão in the hottest months and for Cáceres during the winter.",

Any change in the shape of the cell membrane may affect directly the properties and abilities. In this article, we study how defects in the liquid crystalline organization of a membrane can change its shape. For performing this, we consider a membrane with orientational order, i.e., a nematic membrane, which can happen in biological membranes, nematic films and other systems and study how a defect in this order can change the shape of the membrane when the bending rigidity is considered. We find that depending on the ratio of rigidity and elastic constant, buckling of this membrane may happens and turn it into pseudo-spheres.",

Besides soybean, other foods of vegetal origin have been studied and incorporated in healthy formulations, such as quinoa and linseed. Current assay comprises a sensorial analysis of a product of vegetable origin, a soy product, based on quinoa and flaxseed, considered to be functional food, for its organoleptic characteristics acceptable by a sample group of 80 individuals. Several tests were conducted to reach an adequate formulation for the product, characterized by 11.1 g of protein content, 9.6 g of dietary fiber and low levels of lipids, since it had only 1.4 g. The resulting product revealed adequate microbiological conditions when subjected to microbiological analysis (coliforms at 45ºC; coliforms at 35ºC and Staphylococcus aureus). According to scores in the sensory analysis, it may be assumed that the product was accepted by the sample group. The favorable results indicate the possibility of consumers adhering to a processed diet rich in food derived from vegetables, with functional properties, to replace animal-derived food which is rich in saturated fats and low in fiber.",

On such background, this study aimed to indicate under which conditions (sample size and tail behavior) the Conditional Density Network (CDN) leads to better GEV quantile estimates than the widely used Maximum likelihood method (MLE) does. With Monte Carlo simulations and rainfall series of several Brazilians regions, we highlight the following results: the return period and the tail behavior of the GEV (specified by the shape parameter) are two of the main factors affecting the quantile estimates. For -0.1 ≤ shape ≤ 0.1 and sample size ≤ 50, the CDN outperformed the MLE. For shape ≥ 0.20 the CDN outperformed the MLE for all sample sizes (30-90). The results also suggested that the CDN is more suitable than the MLE for fitting the GEV parameter to the Brazilian extreme rainfall series. We conclude that when the shape parameter are equal to or greater than -0.1 the CDN should be preferred over the MLE.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian semi-arid region is recurrently affected by the scarcity of water that marks the landscape as it prints periods of severe drought. Therefore, rainfall in this region greatly influences plant growth in regional hydrological processes that affect droughts or floods. It is of practical interest to assess how changes in rainfall patterns occur to anticipate hydrological dynamics. However, this is not easy as climate change reshapes global hydrology. Thus, assertive forecasting has become rare and imputed estimates of a reasonable degree of uncertainty. The objective of this work was to verify from the mixture of exponential, gamma, beta, log-normal, Weibull, normal, log-logistic, and exponentiated log-logistic distributions, which best fits the monthly rainfall of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The data used came from 133 monthly rainfall series (1950 to 2012) distributed over the state of Pernambuco. The Maximum Likelihood Method estimated all parameters. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov adherence test was applied at 5% probability to assess the adjustments. The least rejected distributions in the adherence test were Weibull, gamma, and beta; October presented the smallest number of distributions considered adequate to model monthly rainfall. More than 99% of the rain gauge stations had some adequate probabilistic distribution to model monthly rainfall in March. For most months, except for March, the Weibull distribution was the most suitable for modeling the monthly rainfall in the vast majority of rain gauge stations of Pernambuco.",

However, current measurements of PA are mainly subjective and tend to underestimate or overestimate the PA level of a person. This article intends the result of a pilot cross-sectional feasibility study that pretends to classify the PA level through direct and objective measurements. For this, direct measurements such as anthropometric and postural sway (PS) features from fifteen participants (8 Male and 7 Women) were obtained. To predict the level of PA machine learning technique of Support Vector Machines SVM was used. The classifier showed high F1, recall, and precision scores around 80%, and after feature importance selection and hyperparameter were tunned, they reached 100%. Results suggest that the use of direct measurements to classify the PA level is feasible and that there is a correlation between direct measurements and the IPAQ-SF, an indirect measurement that is typically used to assess the level of PA. This classifier intends to be a tool that helps trainers and physicians to endorse or adjust their physical training and rehabilitation procedures based on the objective evaluation of patients.",

    "abstract": "The floor plan layout (FPL) is conceptualized as an ill-defined problem, due to the identification and formulation of objectives not being fully clear in the conceptual phase of the design. A solution to this issue is to convert the ill-defined problem into a well-defined problem. That is, to make the problem explicit, already in the initial phase of the design process, so that it readily allows the architects to know the requirements and constraints, to formulate the goals, and to apply solution strategies they can manage while solving the problem. This conversion makes it possible to solve the problem by a scientific method, through mathematical modeling of the decision-making problem, rather than by a drawn method, via sketches. It allows the architect to establish a relationship between design variables and house performance attributes, and to know the limits within which the solution, or solutions, can be found, aiding him in generating optimized solutions. In order to contribute to the solution of this issue, we present the computational tool ARLE GPS (geometric planning solver). The tool acts as a physical-biological model of the FPL of house. The physical model is structured by a sophisticated mathematical model, which provides a set of metrics for objective (mathematical) analysis and evaluation, simulation, optimization, rating, and solution selection. The biological model collects, stores, transcribes, and retrieves genetic information from the FPL. The functionality of the physical-biological model allows to construct and explore physical-biological design spaces of FPL, and to establish their value spaces.

    "abstract": "Studying new microbial sources and evaluating the growth kinetics behavior to predict large-scale production become essential. Besides, research with low-cost culture media has gained interest due to the need to decrease enzyme production costs. The literature concerning the use of macromycetes as a source of amylases, and applying mathematical models to predict their behavior is scarce. In this study, four growth kinetics in different compositions of culture media were carried out: two of them using different concentrations of Low-Grade Flour (LGF), one wheat mill by-product and two synthetic ones. In the kinetics mathematical models were used to evaluate the bioprocesses and their scaling feasibility. Mathematical models, such as modified Logistic, modified Gompertz, Baranyi, and Roberts, and modified Luedeking-Piret, were applied to predict mycelial growth, enzyme production, and substrate consumption. The results showed the model’s capability to predict mycelial growth (biomass) and substrate consumption (starch concentration). On the other hand, the mathematical models efficiently describe only the maximum enzymatic activity (α-amylase), not the process's other parameters, because of the complexity and diversity of biomolecules synthesized by Coprinus comatus. The wheat mill by-product was efficient as an ingredient in the culture media composition. Furthermore, it was concluded that B2 formulation (culture medium with 48.5 g/L of LGF) is the batch with the highest potential for the α-amylase production from C. comatus and the expansion of this process on an industrial scale. This study is important and valid for the scientific community since modeling studies for macromycetes are scarce in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that can be employed to monitor several sectors, mostly precision agriculture, where environmental data can be used to better manage resources, reduce costs, and improve the use of natural resources. This work proposes the application of cloud-based IoT for monitoring irrigation water in rice fields. Southern Brazil was chosen as a case study because it suffers from water pollution problems due to urban activities, coal mining, and the inflow of saline water into the Araranguá River estuary. All these factors can compromise the water quality for irrigation. The presence of salt in irrigation water can compromise rice growth, making its monitoring essential for successful cultivation. Currently, the rice farmer needs to travel to the riverbank to assess the water quality using a manual sensor. This procedure demands time and resources and is not always efficient. The technology helps indicate whether the water is of quality to irrigate crops, helping the farmers decide whether to use that water to irrigate their fields. The solution is based on low-cost wireless sensor network devices, with subsequent transmission of data from the gateway using the network mobile phone cloud. Data collected were also accessed by the smartphone through a mobile application. This system was implemented for testing in the Araranguá River estuary, southern Santa Catarina, Brazil. Also, it appears as an option for farmers who need to monitor the quality of the water channel of the crop, thus avoiding the loss and reduction in crop productivity because the system can be continuously monitored and show notifications to the user. The highlights of this work were prototyping a complete solution to help the farmer using a smartphone application.",

    "abstract": "Innovative materials for the encapsulation of bioactive compounds are a permanent challenge. In this sense, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of Ora-pro-nobis mucilage (MOPN) as a wall material to replace Arabic gum (AG), in microencapsulation by complex coacervation of bocaiuva (Acrocomia aculeata) pulp oil. The MOPN was obtained from green leaves, and the pH, color, water activity, humidity, fixed mineral residue, proteins, lipids, and extraction effectiveness were determined. MOPN was employed as a partial or total replacement of AG in the microencapsulation of bocaiuva pulp oil. Dehydrated and wet mucilages were used to emulsion formation. The interaction between biopolymers, the effectiveness, efficiency of microencapsulation, and the morphological characteristics of microcapsules were confirmed. In addition, the bioactive compounds (chlorophyll and β-carotene) and antioxidant activity were evaluated. The microcapsules were produced using moist mucilage. Microcapsules obtained with AG/gelatin/ bocaiuva oil were considered as control samples. MOPN showed brown color and chlorophyll content of 72.44±5.74 mg 100 g-1. The interaction between AG and MOPN in microcapsule formation was proven for the formulations with 25 and 50% MOPN substitution. The effectiveness was 74.83 and 75.22%, and encapsulation efficiency was 79.18 and 74.59%, respectively, verified through optical micrograph. In addition, the microcapsules with 25 and 50% MOPN as wall material showed three times more antioxidant activity against ABTS, and two times more β-carotene compared to the control microcapsule.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the high consumption of fossil fuels is causing problems, perhaps, irreversible to the planet, investing in green energy is an essential point for the sustainable development of any country. Concomitant to this, biomass fuels, in particular natural vegetable oils, appear as an option for the total or partial replacement of these fuels in the production of energy in the current world energy matrix. Corroborating this pretext, the objective of this work is to analyze the effects of using different mixtures of Brazilian commercial diesel oil (92% diesel, 8% biodiesel) with refined soybean oil from the effective cylinder pressure of a stationary diesel generator set. To achieve this purpose, the generator set of the Branco brand, model BD-6500, was used, with the aid of the pressure acquisition system of the Austrian company AVL. Analyzes of the requested fuels were carried out in addition to the experimental tests. The results presented show that the use of mixtures with volumetric ratios of soybean oil may show a drop in the cylinder pressure.",

    "abstract": "Due to its advantages, Prestressed Concrete has been used as a structural element in many buildings worldwide. In order to overcome large spans, limiting the formation of cracks, its application can be visualized, for example, in bridges, viaducts, and building slabs. These structures are executed by stretching steel cables with a subsequent release, introducing compressive stresses in the concrete. However, during this process, stress losses occur in the active reinforcement, requiring forecast by the designers. Quantifying these losses in certain cases is a long and iterative process. The present work aimed to present the computational implementation of an alternative method for determining the loss due to deformation of the anchorage in post-traction. In order to prove its effectiveness, this method was contrasted with two conventional methodologies established in the literature. To this end, two models of beams of the same cross-section were simulated, however, with different spans and cable paths. Both proposed simulations aimed to cover all possible situations for the development of prestressing stress along with the tensioned cables. The alternative method showed minor differences in all measurements compared to the conventional methods, proving its effectiveness. Furthermore, the computational tool, entitled vProt, proved to be reliable in the two proposed simulations, allowing its use in the elaboration and verification of structural projects.",

    "abstract": "One of the most prevalent clean and sustainable forms of energy produced worldwide is the power created from wind runoff. Wind turbines ought to be installed in areas with favorable circumstances to transform mechanical wind energy into electricity. Finding appropriate ways to predict the energy produced by a wind farm using the Weibull distribution is the main goal of this work. Theoretical techniques have been applied to calculate Weibull selected characteristics using experimental data gathered at the campus of Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) in Brazil. These data were gathered 10 meters above the surface. The effectiveness of four statistical techniques that are frequently used in the energy industry are compared: the standard energy factor method; the least squares regression method; the moment method; and the mean standard deviation method in estimating Weibull parameters. The root mean square error, Chi-square error, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and coefficient of determination are used to contrast the statistical methodologies. The results demonstrated that the least squares regression approach performs less well than other methods. The standard energy factor approach, the moment method, and the mean standard deviation method are the most effective techniques when modifying Weibull distribution curves for the assessment of wind speed data. The data analysis confirms that these three strategies are fully applicable if the wind speed distribution closely matches the Weibull distribution.",

The time constants were evaluated by linear regressions of the sensor mathematical model. Both the mathematical model and the technique used for the adjustment of the time constants were satisfactory. Each thermocouple from the ring-shaped sensor has presented distinct time constants. The external ring-shaped thermocouple, r = 0,027m, and the central thermocouple, r = 0m, has presented the higher and the lower value of time constant, respectively, independent of the volumetric gas flow.",

This work evaluated the vibration levels on rear and front axles of an agricultural tractor working at different forward speeds and wheel drive conditions in plowing and harrowing operations. Field tests were carried out in a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (forward travel speeds x front-wheel-assist enable or disable), with three replications. Tractor vibration was measured using two single axis accelerometers fixed above the rear and front axles. The actual forward speed of the tractor was obtained by means of ultrasonic radar and the angular velocity of the wheels was measured with magnetic transducers. The drawbar force to pull the disc harrow was obtained by a load cell. The results showed that the vibration levels observed for the plowing operation were higher than observed for the harrowing operation. When the front-wheel-assist (FWA) was enabled there was a reduction in vertical vibration levels of the tractor axles. The highest vibration levels were observed in the frequency range of 2 to 4Hz for the both soil tillage operations evaluated",

The methodological procedures consisted of daily weighing of the RSW along with readings of water and electricity consumption in three multi-family buildings and two single-family houses in the city of João Pessoa. Results have shown that the RSW generation rate was 0.526 kg capita-1 day-1 in apartments (multi-family buildings) and 0.794 kg capita-1 day-1 in houses (single-family residence). Results also indicated that water consumption was highly correlated with RSW generation and that it is possible to estimate the amount of RSW generated in a residence considering its population and water consumption. Based on this model, a new methodology for the WCT calculation was proposed: an alternative which relies on the estimated amount of RSW rather than on the constructed area.",

    "abstract": "This study deals with the proposal of damage variables related to structural behavior of the concrete subjected to shear stress. It is also addressed the laws of evolution and their incorporation into the formulation of a constitutive model for the concrete. Originally, this model considers the anisotropy and bimodularity induced by damage. Initially, the formulation of the damage model is briefly described. The material is assumed to behave as an elastic isotropic medium that start to present anisotropy and bimodular response (distinct elastic responses for prevailing states of tension or compression). Afterwards, we discussed some proposals of damage variables related to the structural behavior of the concrete when subjected to shear stress and their respective laws of evolution. The chosen proposal is then incorporated to the original model and implemented in a finite element code to perform plane analysis. Finally, the numerical responses of the model are compared with the experimental of reinforced concrete beams with different reinforcement rates. The results are presented and discussed aiming to verify the improvements presented by the new version of the model and to show the contribution of the energy dissipation due to shear in the cracked concrete behavior for the analyzed examples.",

When asphaltic materials are used, the stress/strain relationships and the dependencies of load-time and temperature are key parameters for understanding flexible pavement performance. In this study, we employed the finite elements method to calculate stress/strain in flexible pavements structures considering temperature variation. The input data includes material stiffness, which is function of temperature and changes with position and time. The pavement temperature is obtained through the heat transfer differential equation, applying the Laplace transform and its numerical inversion. The finite elements grid was generated by the software ANSYS&reg; and imported by the software MATLAB&reg;. In order to determine the stiffness of the first layer (asphalt concrete) we used the average of four nodes, depending on the each node temperature. The result evidences the importance of thermal gradients for the pavement analysis, both for the fatigue cracking and the accumulation of plastic deformations. The use of unique modulus for asphalt concrete layer generates results far from reality.",

Bathymetry of lake Bolonha was undertaken by digitalizing the data provided by COSANPA (the local Sanitation and Water Supply Company) dating back to 1983, and from a 2007 field study. Both bathymetries produced two terrain elevation models which were used for morphological analysis and hydrodynamic simulations. The morphological analysis showed that between 1983 and 2007, no significant relief changes occurred on the bottom of lake Bolonha, except for the formation of the outflow channels between the interconnecting channel and Bolonha Water Treatment Plant (WTP). The hydrodynamic model was able to simulate depths and velocities. The velocities, ranging between 1.8 and 9.0 cm s-1, showed a subtle current between the outlet of the canal connecting the lakes Bolonha and Água Preta and the water intakes of the Bolonha and São Braz WTPs. This fact demonstrated that lake Bolonha reservoir is a passage for waters from lake Água Preta.",

However no one knows precisely the amount of zero observations that these models support. Depending on the sample size and null observations number the Poisson model can be used. Based on this question, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the properties of Type I error and power of the score test (proposed by Van Den Broek (1995) to discriminate the Poisson and Zero-inflated Poisson models) and ascertain the most appropriate model to represent a sample with excess zeros without compromising the statistical inference. Through Monte Carlo simulation we concluded that when considering a sample of size at least n = 40 with 30% of the null observations, the score test had a high discriminatory power between the ZIP and Poisson model indicating that in fact is relevant the use of the ZIP model.",

The assays were carried out measuring the enzymatic activity of the pure bromelain and of the extract of fruit residues, using casein as substrate. The extract was obtained by crushing the peel and core of the fruit. The activity was expressed as mmol tyrosina (L min.-1) through the absorbance at 280 nm of aromatic amino acids generated from the casein hydrolysis. Two pH ranges were studied: 5.5 to 6.5 and 3.3 to 3.5 and temperatures from 25 to 62°C. The inactivation parameter (ki) was determined plotting the activity as a function of time for each temperature. The thermal decomposition showed to be of first order and the activation energy higher for the fruit enzyme than the purified bromelain when the pH ranged from 3.3 to 3.5. A pH between 5.5 and 6.5 should be applied in order to recover the enzyme from the fruit residues, due to the negligible thermal decomposition in the studied temperature range (up to 62°C).",

The experiments were performed in a laboratory scale unit in a temperature range from 40°C to 60°C and pressure from 176.7 to 250 bar. The results indicated that particle diameter, temperature and pressure were important variables for CO2 extraction yields. The extracted oils were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of their fatty acid compounds, and the results showed the presence of essential fatty acids. The main fatty acids were linoleic acid (about 40%), palmitic acid (about 20%) and oleic acid (about 16%); approximately 5% of linolenic acid is reported. No significant differences were found in the fatty acid analysis for the range of variables investigated.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elaborate a mathematical model to estimate the amount of residential solid waste (RSW) generated and thus, to propose an alternative methodology for calculating the waste collection tax (WCT) for the city of João Pessoa, in Northeast region of Brazil, based on the estimated amount of RSW generated rather than on the constructed area of the residence, as is the case for this city. The methodological procedures consisted of daily weighing of the RSW along with readings of water and electricity consumption in three multi-family buildings and two single-family houses in the city of João Pessoa. Results have shown that the RSW generation rate was 0.526 kg capita-1 day-1 in apartments (multi-family buildings) and 0.794 kg capita-1 day-1 in houses (single-family residence). Results also indicated that water consumption was highly correlated with RSW generation and that it is possible to estimate the amount of RSW generated in a residence considering its population and water consumption. Based on this model, a new methodology for the WCT calculation was proposed: an alternative which relies on the estimated amount of RSW rather than on the constructed area.",

The intrinsic objectives are the application of the elimination of signal noise by the Wiener filter, and the processing of data-Wiener data using experimental statistics.

Both processes happen simultaneously and are directly associated with the heat and mass transfer coefficients involved, which are affected by the ambient humidity and temperature. Several runs were made in several ambient conditions by exposing a cold bottle of beer to varied temperature and humidity and measuring the temperature of beer and the mass of water condensed on the bottle surface over time. From these measures, a theoretical and experimental methodology was developed and applied for the evaluation of the heat and mass transfer coefficients that govern this process. Both the relative humidity and ambient temperature exert a significant influence on the convective heat transfer coefficient. However, the mass transfer coefficient is affected only by the temperature. heat and mass transfer coefficients; condensation; natural convection; beer",

    "abstract": "Gross wastes of the steel industry were evaluated as catalyst for the reduction of nitrous oxide. The wastes were obtained from steel mill residues (MS), lamination (LA), quenching (QC) and blast furnace powder (BF) and characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). Results revealed Si, Ca, S, Rh, Fe, Cr, Mn and Cu for all wastes, with iron featuring the greatest amount. H2-TPR analyses showed H2 consumption peaks associated with rhodium oxide, also detected by XRF. The content of comparative rhodium oxide in samples was: MS &gt; LA &gt; QC &gt; BF. N2O conversion increases with increase in temperature for all catalysts. The activity of the catalysts MS &gt; LA &gt; QC &gt; BF was related to rhodium oxide rate in the wastes.",

    "abstract": "Environmental impact reduction has been a growing concern of the automotive industry. One of the main challenges is to implement Cleaner Production as a tool to reduce environmental impacts and provide financial profits. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the environmental impact and economic gains by implementing Cleaner Production, using an unexplored approach, in a company of the automotive sector. The research approach used was a case study, carried out by observation and semi-structured surveys. The production process chosen was updated, so technologies were changed to reduce biotic and abiotic disposal. For the analysis of environmental impacts, the 'Material Input Per Unit of Service' tool (MIPS) was used, in which data was used to calculate: annual net profit; return on investment (%) and return on investment for a period. The results showed that Cleaner Production implementation focusing on changing technology in the production process caused a 75% reduction in environmental impact, and a 62.7% decrease in production costs. Although of this study considers only one case to test the procedure applicability, it can be easily repeated in other more complex systems, by merely making the necessary adjustments due to the complexity of the processes involved.",

Results showed that high TSS contents were reported in the tree´s peripheral area in the two analyzed thirds due to a high solar radiation. Highest AA rates were reported in the apical third. In the case of quadrants, higher AA levels were found in SE and NE (morning sun) with regard to the apical third and in SW and SE (afternoon sun) with regard to the basal third. The three-dimension interpolation method displays the spatial variability of the fruit’s physical attributes by three-dimensional maps.",

Studies on processing of roes from E. lucunter are nonexistent, thus, this study is a pioneer in Brazil. The roes were processed following the steps: wash in a solution of potassium alum, drainage, separation by color, packaging and storage under refrigeration (0-4°C). Following, batches of the roes were characterized by physical, chemical and microbiological analyses, and subjected to sensory analysis to check acceptance and preference of potential consumers. The methodology of potassium alum used was efficient for E. lucunter roes and the color attribute was more relevant in the acceptance, preference and purchase intent from processed fresh roes. The extraction process might be improved in order to minimize rupture of the gonads. For managers of fisheries and sea food quality we recommend the implementation of public policies that result in the sustainability of sea-urchin species and food safety for the consumers.",

The classifier showed that perceptron could be used on branch prediction, because the action of classifying is similar to the action of predicting. Based on this previous analysis, we also simulated the use of perceptron on branch prediction using branch traces automatically generated. The predictor presented satisfactory results. In all cases, we concluded that simulation is a good strategy to measure performance of branch predictor based on perceptron before its implementation in hardware.",

It will be presented the main requirements for the implementation of an object-relational database for the representation and analysis of indoor environments, which considers the solutions for both type of representations, floor plan and schematic map. These representations consider the high number of information found in an indoor environment and the fact that they are disposed in different floors of the structure. The relationship between objects and their attributes defines the links and restrictions between them. Hence, the model should describe the entities and their interrelationships, as well as the attributes of the elements and their characteristics. After the database was developed, it was implemented an algorithm that calculates routes between points in the indoor environment, considering not only the shortest distance but also the floor change. The model was tested by Antunes and Delazari (2019) using an application and some interviews with users to evaluate the elements included in the database considering a navigating task. Some results pointed out the need to insert new information in the database regarding physical characteristics (color, material) of elements found in the indoor environment to assist users during orientation and navigation tasks. Moreover, it is necessary to include elements from the outdoor environment used as reference points in the cartographic representation.",

For a repair yard to be economically viable, in times of crisis, cost reduction is essential to make a sustainable business, so this comparative study aims to check the technical and economic feasibility of this change in the type of dry-docking. The present work deals with a comparative study between the use of the longitudinal slipway and the airbags for dry-docking and repair of river barges. The study sought to identify data from the vessels used for this project, to verify the average displacement of these vessels to analyze the airbags' carrying capacity, as well as the size of the winch to perform the dry-docking service. Since most repair yards use leased areas, the flexibility achieved with the use of airbags, as well as the reduced need for investments in the area, are benefits provided by using them. This work presented satisfactory results for the use of river barge docking airbags as a competitive alternative in repair services.",

The second design evaluated the wheat flour and water partial replacement by pequi husk flour (x1) and pequi pulp (x2), respectively. At the same time, a control test was conducted (without the addition of pequi flour and pulp) for comparison. The evaluated dependent variables of the bread quality characteristics were: dough volume; expansion rate; specific volume and density; texture profile and gluten content. It was possible to verify that only the gluten content was influenced by the replacement of wheat flour by pequi husk flour, whereas, only the specific volume was influenced by the replacement of water by pequi pulp. In general, the best replacement range was obtained with the formulation using between 0.75 to 2.5% pequi husk flour; up to 20% pequi pulp flour and between 5 and 35% of pequi pulp.",

During the industrial processing of jaboticaba, as in the production of juices, only the pulp is used, and the peel is discarded. This work aimed to produce sequilho biscuits with different concentrations of jaboticaba peel flour (JPF) and evaluate the technological and sensory properties of the products. Biscuits with four concentrations of JPF (B1= 0.75%, B2= 1.5% B3= 2.25% and B4= 3.0%) were prepared. The physicochemical analysis, instrumental texture, color, total flavonoids, and total anthocyanins were evaluated. Sensory perceptions were investigated using the check-all-that-apply (CATA) questionnaire, hedonic scale, and purchase intention scale. Jaboticaba peel flour had high levels of total flavonoids (227.9±14.6 mg 100 g-1) and total anthocyanins (114.2±4.2 mg cyanidin-3-glycoside 100 g-1). Specific volume and bite force were not affected by the addition of JPF. The global impression for all biscuits elaborated with JPF ranged from approximately 6.5 to 7.5. It positively influenced the global impression of the biscuits, with associations with the CATA terms of fruit flavor, jaboticaba flavor, and fruit aroma. However, terms related to the texture, such as fibrous and hard, negatively influenced the global impression. It is recommended to produce sequilho biscuits with JPF addition up to 1.5%. This study demonstrated that the food industry could better exploit the jaboticaba peel, meeting consumer demand for products with differentiated sensory characteristics",

A way to overcome this limitation is the proper use and operation or a in bench scale, experimental setup from which experimental data can be obtained in controlled conditions. In this context, experiments were carried out in an integral reactor of steam reform, in different experimental conditions. Thermocouples were placed along the catalyst bed to allow for temperature monitoring in six equally spaced and distinct positions of the reactor, the composition of the effluent of the reactor was determined by gas chromatography. These experimental data were compared with the theoretical results of a pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional, dynamic mathematical model. The results indicate that the model can successfully describe the experimental data set and the catalytic activity and the conversion are sensitive to variations of the operational temperature, while the temperature of the bed is practically constant to the flow variations in the explored experimental conditions.",

The nonlinear terms present in the diffusion equation are consequence of employing a nonlinear generalization of Darcy's law or a nonlinear absorbent term, which may be related to a reaction diffusion process. Particularly, we will obtain new classes of solutions, analyze the effects produced by these terms and the relation of the results presented here with anomalous diffusion.",

The selected admixtures are calcareous filler and basalt filler, which are industrial residues, thus contributing to sustainable development. The paste is made up of cement, silica fume, calcareous filler or basalt filler, water and superplasticizer additive. For this study, the water/cement ratios are fixed = 0.40 L kg-1; silica fume/cement = 0.10 kg kg-1; the filler/cement and superplasticizer/cement ratios are determined through Marsh cone and mini-slump tests. The results show that for same filler/cement ratios, the ratios of superplasticizer to paste with calcareous filler are significantly lower than those of paste with basalt filler. The results show that the specific area, mould and surface texture of these admixtures significantly influence the rheological behavior of HPSCP.",

In order to evaluate the marginal influence of urban form variables on modal choice, two logit-type models were calibrated. The first model (basic) includes only a socioeconomic variable (automobile availability) and the trip length. The second model (expanded) includes, in addition to the variables of the basic model, information on the characteristics of urban form in the areas of trip origin. As expected, the models suggest that a greater diversity of soil uses and better permeability in the areas of trip origin increase the probability of foot travel. On the other hand, occupation density in the area of trip origin showed no significant effect over the choice for walking.",

To control floods it's necessary an empty volume able to absorb an accidental flood without causing damage in the areas downstream. On the other side, to generate energy it's desirable to place the smallest volume of possible protection, whereas to control floods it's desirable to have a reliable estimate in case the reservoir fails when a given volume of protection is placed. The objective of this work was to construct the Volume Curve x Length, used to estimate the waiting volume, through the adjustments of the series of the affluent maximum volume using the distribution GEV and moments LH. Affluent volumes were used and observed in several fluviometrics stations of rivers in Paraná state, Brazil. All the adjustments of affluent maximum volumes were accepted through quality tests of proposed adjustments by Wang (1998). The volume curve x length was built properly using values of affluent maximum volumes observed in different fluviometrics stations.",

In each discharge, a crater is formed in the material and a small crater is formed in the electrode. Of every melted material produced in each discharge, only 15%, or minus, it is removed through the dielectric liquid. The remaining of the melted material solidifies forming a wrinkled surface. The characteristics of the surface obtained, overlap of craters, globules of sullage, “chimneys \", bubbles (formed when the gases arrested are liberated through the material resolidificado), they are revealed through an analysis by scanning electron microscope. O proposed work, has for objective to study the effect of the addition of powder of SiC in several dielectric fluids, on microcrack generation, in workpiece of the high speed steel (ABNT M2), during the electrical discharge machining. The presented results show that the samples machined with the addition of powders of SiC presented significant reduction of the number of microcrack in the surface machined, when compared with the machined with conventional EDM.",

In this work this exponent is obtained by fluctuations analysis of temperature time series in Cascavel area, from 1972 to 2004. It is applied the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis - DFA method, which becomes useful to detect long range correlations and allows to obtain the exponents for local scale rules.

Trial motivation came from the increasing interest in supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide, a solvent with highly desirable features: non-toxicity, non-flammability, moderate critical pressure and low boiling points. The high costs related to this kind of process, with energy consumption representing the most expensive item, demands for rapid economic analysis. Aspen-Plus allows for calculating the involved energy amount in a fast and efficient way, despite the simulator models' limitations.

    "abstract": "The laundries and industrial dry cleaner's generate liquid effluents that, after treatment for matter in suspension floculation, produce sludge. This residue has varied chemical composition, due to the products used in the process. Such residue is considered inadequate for in natura disposition in the environment, and it should have, as final destination, an industrial landfill. In the studied case, such industrial landfill is not available and the residues are truck-driven for about 400 Km, causing a strong financial impact over the production of an emergent local textile industry market. This work presents the physical-chemical characterization of the sludge produced by an industrial laundry, studying its final disposition in the process of E/S addition in Portland cement, seeking its re-utilization in civil construction materials, to minimize this residue's final disposition costs. The analysis contemplated: COD total, fixed and volatile solids in the sludge, sludge density, pH and metals presence. The presence of the metals: Fe, Mg, Al, Sn, Ca, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn and Zn was detected in the sludge. The incorporation of this sludge in mortar was studied as residue final destination. Samples of this mortar were submitted to compression resistance analysis. Results demonstrate that the mortar with sludge contents lower than 25% in relation to the cement mass, after 28 days, shows mechanical resistance values larger than 10 Mpa, being fit to be used as civil construction secondary material, without structural function. Posterior studies will be necessary to evaluate the organic matter influence in the composite's durability.",

The eutrophycation of water occurs in an accelerated rhythm due to industrial pollution coupled to domestic and agricultural waste.

In this type of study, the data are collected over time, which can provide correlated errors; in addition, the collection is not always done in an equidistant way, which may influence the estimation of model parameters. One way of modelling the dependent errors in a regression model is to use an autoregressive process that assumes that the observations are performed at equidistant intervals. However, the definition of the independent variable is often performed at irregular intervals, causing a reduction of information obtained from the dataset. One possible improvement in the adjustment quality of these models is the use of the irregular autoregressive process. The objective of this work was to compare the estimates of isotherm parameters with different irregular and regular autoregressive error structures, considering the positive autocorrelation in different sample sizes, error autocorrelation values and positioning of non-equidistant observations. It was found that there is a need to respect the assumptions of the model. The irregular autoregressive model is more appropriate because it is mostly more precise and accurate, especially when non-equidistance occurs in the initial third.",

In general, continuous response variables occur frequently in these situations and tend to present asymmetric characteristics, as well as being restricted to the set of positive real numbers. Therefore, using the normal model would be incorrect. In this conjecture, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are used to analyze data characterized in this way, aiming to accommodate inter- and intra-individual variations. Thus, we propose a mixed gamma model (LGMM) with a log link function and random effects normally distributed to evaluate data from a longitudinal experiment, where the effects of cerebral ischemia associated with diabetes on the performance of long-term retrograde memory were evaluated in rats. Based on the results obtained, the random intercept model presented a good fit and accommodated the correlation inherent to the data. It was possible to observe that normoglycemic animals, when compared to hyperglycemic animals, whether submitted to ischemia or not, had their cognitive capacity partially preserved, indicating that hyperglycemia (‘diabetes’) aggravates the cognitive effects of brain ischemia.",

As a function of the mathematical restrictions imposed on such designs, rotationality is obtained by following a specific algebraic procedure, thus preserving the constant prediction variance in all experimental points. When it comes to mixture problems, a response may show extreme alterations when a part of such components tends to the edge of zero and the models may not be suitable to deal with that. The adequate alternative to deal with such response alterations is to include inverse terms into the models. Given the assessed scenarios, the optimum designs were more robust and more promising than the rotational ones, when evaluating the precision of residual mean squares (RMS) in all such scenarios. When a part of the components tends to the edge of zero, RMS was more precise under the D-optimum designs with inverse terms in the components of the normal lineal model.",

Extractive activities include plenty of oily plant species, with potential use as biofuel for ICE (Diesel cycle) to obtain power generation together with pollutant emission reduction in comparison to fossil fuel. Experimental tests were carried out with five fuel blends (crude palm oil) and diesel, at constant angular speed (2,500 RPM – stationary regime), and four nominal engine loads (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in a test bench dynamometer for an engine-driven generator for electrical-power, 4-Stroke internal combustion engine, Diesel cycle. Main conclusions are: a) SFC and torque are at the same order of magnitude for PO-00 (diesel) and PO-xx at BHP50/75/100%; b) O2 emissions show consistent decreasing behavior as BHP increases, compatible to a rich air-fuel ratio (λ &gt; 1) and, at the same BHP condition, O2 (%) is slightly lower for higher PO-xx content; c) The CO emissions for PO-00 consistently decrease while the BHP increases, as for PO-xx those values present a non-linear behavior; at BHP75%-100_loads, CO emissions are higher for PO-20 and PO-25 in comparison to PO-00; d) The overall trend for NOX emissions is to increase, the higher the BHP; In general, NOx emissions are lower for PO-xx in comparison to PO-00, except for PO-10 which presents slightly higher values than PO-00 for all BHP range; e) Assessment on-trend costs indicates that using palm oil blends for Diesel engine-driven generators in the Amazon region is economically feasible, with an appropriate recommendation for a rated power higher than 800 kW.",

    "abstract": "In this work, plane stress free vibration is performed using four-node elements formulated using strain gradient notation. Accurate results are sought, and the effects of parasitic shear are investigated. By applying strain gradient notation, which is a physically interpretable notation, parasitic shear terms are identified a priori in the shear strain expressions of the four-node plane element. Parasitic shear is the source of shear locking in that element, and the a priori removal of the parasitic shear terms corrects the element for locking. Several studies in the literature show that this modeling error causes improper behavior of the element in bending, which affects the computed results of stress and displacements of the structure. Based on this, this work applies strain gradient notation to examine the effects of parasitic shear on the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of plane stress structures. The results are compared with literature results, and with the isoparametric FEM formulation modeled by ANSYS software. It is observed that parasitic shear has a higher preponderance in coarse meshes of flexural vibration modes. Furthermore, the deleterious effects are emphasized as bending deformation becomes more important in the model. Strain gradient notation shows advantages in the numerical aspect and successfully eliminates the parasitic shear terms from the four-node element. The problems studied here display accurate results.",

A face detection application was adapted to run on an IoT device and the AWS Serverless Lambda service. Through experimentation, some metrics like latency, execution time and energy consumption were collected to evaluate the impact of serverless technology on the scope of IoT systems development. Results show that serverless technology is superior to the IoT device used in terms of performance, but it is directly related to the quality of the network connection to which the device is connected.

In general, anomaly detection methods are compatible with numerical data and ignore categorical data. However, in real-time problems, both numerical and categorical data are to be considered to obtain accurate results. There are several methods available for the outlier detection of high dimensional data in numerical data. In this paper, a feature grouping algorithm for anomaly detection is proposed that considers the categorical data also. This algorithm correlates the features of categorical data and forms feature clusters and detects the outliers. The features are assigned feature weights based on their levels of appearance and the outlier scores are determined. The performance of the feature grouping algorithm is then compared with the traditional algorithms like LOF and Isolation Forest algorithm and state-of-the-art methods like WATCH on UCI datasets. From the experimental evaluation of the results obtained, it is found that the proposed algorithm is comparatively better than the existing algorithms for categorical data.",

The buildup of salts in the soil promotes an unfavorable environment for the development of plants, as it negatively alters the growth of crops, reducing the productivity of forage plants in agricultural areas.

This research was conducted from September 2021, to August 2022, in the forage farming sector of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco. The design used was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme, being composed of two clones of cactus (Clones Giant and Little Sweet), two levels of water irrigation (0.5 and 1L weekly), five levels of saline stress (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 dS m-1), with four replications. The lifetime of forage cactus was evaluated using the statistical methodology of survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier method. The plant mortality rate of N. cochenillifera clone Giant Sweet at 257 days after planting was of 20%, while the clone Little Sweet showed a mortality rate of 15%. When irrigated with 0.5 liter of water, the plants of the clone Giant Sweet presented a mortality rate of 5.0%, whereas the clones Little Sweet showed no mortality. When using 1.0 liter of irrigation water, the clones Giant and Little Sweet showed a mortality rate of 35.0 and 30.0%, respectively.",

The samples were analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction, FEG-SEM (Field Emission Gun - Scanning Electron Microscopy), Raman spectroscopy, and electrical measurements. Results confirmed the formation of rutile-type tetragonal cassiterite phase, with quasi-spherical particles a moderate degree of heterogeneity in particle size 30-90 nm). Raman vibrational modes and infrared spectrum also confirmed the presence of tin oxide in high purity rutile phase. Sensorial measurements showed high sensitivity, response, and recovery time in tests with biodiesel/ethanol mixtures, allowing to distinguish between blends with a wide range of composition and serving as a potential device to detect adulterated fuel.",

The results showed that the mutant A. welwitschiae UELAs 15.262/35 produced great amount of citric acid in the fourth day of solid-state fermentation using total and reducing sugars and producing cellulases. On the other hand, there was no production of citric acid by wild A. welwitschiae UELAs 15.262. The use of total and reducing sugars and the production of cellulases by A. welwitschiae UELAs 15.262 were detected, suggesting the use of carbon sources for the production of other metabolites. The great use of reducing sugars and cellulases production by A. welwitschiae UELAs 15.262/35 indicated the consume of carbon sources from the orange residue to produce citric acid at early times of fermentation.

The demulsification conditions of water/oil emulsion were simulated by using the two-fluid model and the water evaporation model, and the turbulence effect was considered by using the Reynolds stress model. The results show that the established model could provide a convenient way to study the effects of the different water concentrations in oil; the turbulence intensity in VOF increases with the increase of water concentration in oil; The separation efficiency has been influenced by the inlet water concentration reaching values between 20.65-22.62% in the center axis, while 33.18-42.24% in the plate column; the vapor concentration ranged from 0 - 23.64% in the center axis, while 0 - 41.02% in the plate column.

    "abstract": "The utilization of dry yeast is increasingly becoming established in the brewing context, owing to the ease of storage and handling, the long shelf life and the convenience of dispensing a delicate and costly propagation process for fresh liquid cultures, which would need specialized labor and equipment. Dried yeasts undergo a procedure that removes nearly all liquid contents from the cell, and rehydration is then recommended prior to inoculation into the wort. Hydration is a nuanced procedure that allows yeasts to regain their vitality and viability, however, if carried out improperly, it can adversely affect fermentation. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of four hydration techniques on the viability and vitality of dry commercial yeast cells, preliminarily evaluating the influence of hydration using distilled and filtered water. Two different methodologies were employed, including the assessment of viability, by counting live and dead cells in the Neubauer chamber and the evaluation of vitality, by measuring the CO₂ released after inoculation. The hydration techniques tested included hydration in water without stirring, hydration in water with stirring, and these two techniques replicated in dry malt extract (DME) wort with Specific Gravity (SG) 1040. Firstly, it was found that rehydrating the yeast in distilled water has a negative impact on cell viability. Also, the results indicated that initial agitation has a negative effect on yeast viability and vitality, while hydration in water without agitation produced the best results. Correct hydration of dry yeast is crucial for avoiding off-flavors due to accelerated or delayed fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured zero valence iron (nZVI) has been applied in advanced oxidative processes aimed at the treatment of water contaminated with Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP). Considering that such compounds cannot be eliminated by traditional treatment methods, this study proposes the synthesis of nZVI by the reduction of Iron Chloride III by sodium borohydride in the absence of O2, in ultrasound bath. The material obtained has only a wide diffraction halo at 45.13º of 2θ, with an average diameter of the crystallite calculated at 8.3 nm. The method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET method) analysis infer that the synthesized material is classified as mesoporous and showing a large surface area of 91.48 m2.g-1. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) the compound exhibits a core-shell type structure being the average size smaller than 50 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates that the compound is thermally stable, exhibiting only a thermal event close to 70º C in which there is a loss of approximately 25% of mass related to water loss. The synthesis was efficient because there is no formation of metal oxides and no residue from the synthesis process according to FT-IR analyzes. To evaluate the effectiveness and present the parameters that most positively contributed to the degradation of water contaminated with 24 of the most common POPs, a chemometric study was applied considering the following variables: reaction time, concentration of applied iron nanoparticles and pH values. The approach reduces costs, time, and waste generation. Among the variables, reaction time is crucial, mainly due to solubility differences between compounds. Kinetic tests show increased efficiency after one hour, emphasizing a direct correlation between degradation rate and water solubility for the studied POPs.",

PLE results were compared with those obtained by Soxhlet extraction. The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of extracts were determined. Longer extraction times resulted in higher extraction yields (30.42 wt%). Higher temperatures also increased extraction yield, enhancing the recovery of phenolic compounds and, consequently, resulting in higher antioxidant activity. PLE demonstrated selectivity in phytochemical extraction compared with Soxhlet extraction. The PLE extract obtained under the best conditions for total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (80°C and 45 min.) and the Soxhlet extract consisted predominantly of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and sesquiterpenes. The major components of the lipid fraction were linoleic and oleic acids. The extracts showed antibacterial activity, attributed to the presence of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and phenolic compounds.",

For the analyses, three time-series were used, 1913 to 2020 for the relationship between rainfall and sunspots; and both 1950 to 2020 and 1982 to 2020 for the relationship between rainfall and teleconnections (El Nino Southern Oscillation – ENOS, Atlantic Dipole and sunspots). For the data analysis, basic statistical techniques, nonparametric statistical tests such as the Mann-Kendall and the Pearson correlation coefficient were used. Results have shown that the correlation between sunspots and rainfall was -0.2, indicating a weak negative correlation (1913-2020), with a confidence level of 95%. For rainfall and ENSO (Niño 1+2 and Niño 3) it was 0.4, with a 99% confidence level for Niño 1+2, 0.3 for Rainfall and North Atlantic (TNA), and 0.3 for sunspots and rainfall with a 95% confidence level (1982 to 2020). There was no trend in rainfall values in the last century. It was concluded that the patterns of sunspots, ENSO, and the Atlantic dipole were correlated with precipitation levels in the IGRC, and studies on teleconnections and extraterrestrial factors need to be further explored to try to understand the genesis of rainfall in various parts of the globe.",

The paper considers systems of quasilinear hyperbolic equations in partial derivatives of the first order with two independent variables. The main results of the paper are: 1) high-frequency asymptotic solutions of small amplitude for quasilinear hyperbolic systems of the first order were obtained. For fixed values of t and , values of the modulus are limited by р→∞, because the transfer equations depend on p. Thus, the moduli of the decomposition coefficients are bounded at p→∞ and at fixed u and ; 2) It has been established that for ui0= const, , , independent of t, the solution of the equation is greatly simplified because the coefficient а0 is constant. For the linear function , is also constant.

However, there is a gap in understanding the principles of mass transport (water) and its changes during the hydration phases, especially in rye, which has yet to be studied. A kinetic study was carried out to investigate moisture transfer and changes in starch during oats, rye, and wheat hydration. During the process it was observed that the mass transfer was directly affected by the system's temperature, which indicates changes in the absorption capacity over time. The tracer pigment indicated that water entered the grains by diffusion through the grain coating and capillarity through the fissures. Thermal analyses revealed that the starch remained unchanged at hydration temperatures below 50°C. Mathematical models describe the moisture gain in the different conditions studied, while the generalized model allows the experimental moisture to be predicted. This study contributes to understanding the time/temperature relationship in cereal hydration by presenting a kinetic model and examining changes in starch. This provides valuable insights to optimize the industrial operation of this stage and guides new project development.",

From this scenario of need for evolution and modification of market relations, the use and implementation of outstanding projects of logistics integration centers as a way of improving the logistics reality. Corroborating this reality, the main objective of this research was to verify the feasibility and benefits generated from the implementation of a Logistics Integration Center in the State of Pará - CILOG, from the perspective of the demand for production flow, availability of modal and location. To verify the feasibility of production for implementation, foam consulted without data regarding load states and load locations in adjacent areas, as well as potential, functionalities and resources of the implementation systems, with flow as the main centers of selection and, systematic and systematic way, of the feasibility and evaluation of the benefits generated from the implementation of the needs of the demand for services of attendance of the neighboring states, as well as of the entrances for the attendance of the neighboring states demand of flow of the production, availability of modals and geographic location. For this, an A-SWOT hybrid methodology was applied to define the HP location criteria and the decision factors that characterize the implementation of logistics such as the Logistics Integration Center (CILOG) in the Amazon Region, as well as the definition of the best for this implementation, based on three local alternatives: Santarém, Alça Viária and Miritituba. With the evaluation, Santarém (on the banks of the Amazon River) was listed as the best location for the installation, from the perspective of locational, operational, relating to capacity and territories",

The discretization is performed using the Finite Difference Method, weighted in time by an established parameter. The parallelization of the algorithms is ensured by employing the Waveform Relaxation method, where numerical stability is achieved by applying the method of subdomains in time. The primary innovation of this work lies in the development of a high-order method that harnesses the parallelizability and robustness of the Multigrid method, enabling efficient solutions to the 2D wave equation. These methods also effectively mitigate oscillations that would otherwise significantly increase the maximum residual, a concern arising from the application of the standard Waveform Relaxation method.",

    "abstract": "In the digital age, preserving and effectively retrieving historical academic records has a significant challenge, especially when these documents only exist in deteriorated physical formats. We propose an approach to recover data from scanned documents of grade records, by using image processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in these documents, essential for the preservation of digital records. Our three-step methodology: first, improves the quality of the scanned image; then, extracts text using OCR and NLP techniques to retrieve data from old physical grade cards; and finally, the extracted data is corrected using Chat-GPT and prepared for upload. The results are assuring, showing an impressive Character Error Rate (CER) of 2.15% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.05%, demonstrating the high accuracy of the OCR system used and its ability to precisely extract text from scanned documents. These low error rates achieved, as a result to the successful implementation of pre-processing and post-processing techniques, as well as the use of an advanced OCR tool, underscore the potential of this OCR approach to effectively extract information from documents.",

Casts in place piles are often used for small buildings in the region and are fully embedded in this soil layer. Therefore, this type of foundation is subjected to the lateritic and occasionally collapsible influence of soil. Brazilian pile bearing capacity methods may yield conservative results when applied to tropical soils, as far as the lateritic origin in concerned. On the other hand, it can be unsafe if collapsibility prevails. This paper evaluates coefficients to adjust both point and lateral resistance of cast in place small diameter piles in the situation described. The work was carried out at the Londrina State University Geotechnical Experimental Site, and back analysis from static compression load tests data was done",

Treatments 1 and 2 were added K2S2O5 in the proportion of 6 g 100 L-1 of must and also sucrose in the proportion 3.56 kg 100 L-1 of must. Treatment 3 was added sucrose in proportion of 2.5 kg 100 L-1 of must. After the wines stabilization, the following evaluation parameters were considered: coloration, alcoholic graduation, pH, titratable acidity, volatile acidity, dry extract, total soluble solids, turbid and sensorial characteristics. The ‘Bordô’ red wine, elaborated by artesanal vinification process, showed flavor characteristics somewhat timber and lightly sourish. The microvinification, with four days of maceration, showed higher acidity and lower coloration intensity. In conclusion the best chemical characteristics and sensorial characteristics were found in the ‘Bordô’ wine which was elaborated by microvinification with seven days of maceration",

Due to the specialization of the existing models, each one can be better applied to a specific application domain. Nevertheless, when there is no solution for applications in a specific domain, heterogeneous models have been used. In this context, this paper discusses a heterogeneous model called Extended Dataflow. It is an extension of the dataflow model with support to event handling. This paper also addresses how software can be synthesized from extended dataflow specifications and discusses the development of a code generation tool prototype. This takes into account the possibility of component reuse for developing digital signal processing applications. A case study of adaptative applications using digital filters is used to illustrate our approach",

The studied case was accomplished in the city of Maringá, State of Paraná, South of Brazil. Technical visits were accomplished \"in loco\", where the impacts of final solid residue disposal in the environment were appraised. The obtained data showed the urgent need of an adapted handling of the final disposal of the urban solid residue in the city. This fact was observed by the qualitative evaluation of the environmental impacts caused by inadequate final disposal and confirmed by means of the Embankments Index Quality (Índice de Qualidade de Aterros de Resíduos - IQR). The evaluation shows the degradation intensity of both environmental and human existence in that universe, considering that all the generated dejections in the city are indiscriminately thrown in a rubbish dump site. Results show that a final disposal site for the residue is urgently needed, so that such impacts are minimized. Thus, some parallel improving actions were taken in order to adapt the area, suggesting the interruption of the residue disposal in the site as well",

By way of contrast, the fractional derivative applied to the spatial variable results in a anomalous diffusion where the second moment is not finite.

    "abstract": "In the present work, different immobilization procedures were evaluated: direct addition of the lipase on zirconium phosphate (ZrP), and simultaneous addition of lipase and stabilizing agent (polyethylene glycol, MM-1500) on the same support. The selection of this additive was based on its compatibility with the lipase from Candida rugosa according to data previously obtained using controlled pore silica as support. The methodology of lipase immobilization on ZrP in the presence of PEG-1500 supplied more active immobilized derivatives (310.6 U mg-1) when compared with those obtained without addition of PEG-1500 (162.8 U mg-1), providing high activity recovery in the immobilization step (88.7%). Better performance of the immobilized derivative prepared in the presence of PEG was also verified in organic medium (synthesis of butyl butyrate), in terms of activity and operational stability. These results can be attributed to the enzyme coated by the additive that probably increased the access of the substrate to the active site of the lipase",

The rotated pulsed fluidized bed (RPFB) can be used to pulse the gas flow through the distributor plate to minimize difficulties. In this work, the used gas is at T ambient and the parameters used during the fluid dynamics studies were: C solids and F disk rotation. The fluid dynamic curve was analyzed with the variation of these parameters, and the best condition for the pulse fluidization of the bed was determined. The fluid dynamic curve obtained for the RPFB was compared with the conventional fluid dynamic bed curve. A smoothness of the curve for the RPFB was observed, and as a consequence, a decrease of the APbed during the process. A comparison between the RPFB and the mechanically agitated fluidized bed (Ambrosio, 1999) was also done and it was verified that the pressure drop in both systems are very close during the process",

The input data was collected in the metadata generated by the backup system, with 2 years data window. For the implementation of the models, the simple univariate linear regression technique was employed in conjunction, in some cases, with the simple segmented linear regression. In order to discover the breakpoint, a targeted approach to residual analysis was applied. The results obtained by the iterative implementation of the proposed algorithm showed adherence to the characteristics of the analyzed series, with accuracy measures, regression significance, normality residual through control charts, model adjustment, among others. As a result, an algorithm was developed for integration into automated backup systems using the methodology described in this study.",

    "abstract": "Solar thermal systems consist of water heating from the global solar radiation. Increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases tend to increase the earth's surface temperature. The main objective of this work was to estimate the solar fraction obtained by means of solar heating systems for dwellings, for eight locations in the State of Paraná, in scenarios of possible climate changes projected until the end of the 21st century. F-Chart method was used to simulate the performance of solar heating systems based on the monthly average of solar radiation data, which determines the annual solar fraction or percentage of the energy demand that is covered by the solar installation. The results showed that with the impact of the climate changes, the decrease in the percentage of energy demand average that is covered by the solar installation was on average 14.3%, for both scenarios. The simulated values showed a slight decrease trend of radiation data and an increase of the solar fraction. All localities presented a characteristic seasonal behavior, with annual values of solar fraction between 82.4 and 129.8%, according to the studied localities. In relation to the monthly solar fraction, the values between November and March presented averages of solar fraction between 104 and 147.2%. But from May to August, the percentage of energy demand served by the solar installation does not reach the totality, with values between 53.6 and 99.9%. The results prove that the State of Parana has favorable climatic conditions for the installation of solar heating systems, even if it is installed for aggregation purposes, in order to reduce the electric power consumption.",

Wide and significant differences among the yeasts were observed. Based on the statistical analysis, ten yeasts were selected, excluding all the strains exhibiting a too high pigment adsorption. The research proposes a simple analytical method to characterize yeasts for their pigment adsorption, thus allowing the enhancement of the table olive colour. The two media may be prepared using any olive cultivar, thus allowing a specific screening of the yeasts. The selection of those yeasts unable to adsorb olive pigments may allow the production of more pigmented table olives.",

However, this second step called post-extrusion flavouring increases the lipid content and the caloric value of the snack, reasons why these products are highly criticized. Thus, the study of pre-extrusion flavourings is an interesting way of finding corn snacks with better nutritive value. Therefore, we aimed to explore pre-extrusion flavouring using different substances, investigating the odour and flavour on the extrudates and the impact of such substances on their expansion ratio, density, and colour. To do this, vitamins, amino acids, essential oils, natural aromas and seasonings were added to corn grits and extruded. The addition of different substances, especially the essential oils, natural aromas and seasonings, produced odour and flavour in the extrudates, as well as having little negative impact on their physical properties of the extrudates, no impact or even a small positive impact. Therefore, this study provides a range of possibilities to be explored, using pre-extrusion flavouring as a way of reducing the use of lipids and improving the nutritive value of expanded snacks.",

    "abstract": "Multicollinearity is detected via regression models, where independent variables are strongly correlated. Since they entail linear relations between observed or latent variables, the structural equation models (SEM) are subject to the multicollinearity effect, whose numerous consequences include the singularity between the inverse matrices used in estimation methods. Given to this behavior, it is natural to understand that the suitability of these estimators to structural equation models show the same features, either in the simulation results that validate the estimators in different multicollinearity degrees, or in their application to real data. Due to the multicollinearity overview arose from the fact that the matrices inversion is impracticable, the usage of numerical procedures demanded by the maximum likelihood methods leads to numerical singularity problems. An alternative could be the use of the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, however, it is demanded that the observed variables are built by assuming a positive correlation with the latent variable. Thus, theoretically, it is expected that the load signals are positive, however, there are no restrictions to these signals in the algorithms used in the PLS method. This fact implies in corrective areas, such as the observed variables removal or new formulations of the theoretical model. In view of this problem, this paper aimed to propose adaptations of six generalized ridge estimators as alternative methods to estimate SEM parameters. The conclusion is that the evaluated estimators presented the same performance in terms of accuracy, precision while considering the scenarios represented by model without specification error and model with specification error, different levels of multicollinearity and sample sizes.",

One of these applications is emerged in agricultural applications as precision agriculture studies. The use of technology in agriculture has lots of benefits such as energy saving, yield increase, time saving and etc. In this study, a novel learning based, pixel-wise segmentation method which uses Common Vector Approach (CVA) for the first time in the literature for segmentation is proposed. In the proposed method, first of all color regions belong to both vegetation and soil are manually cropped and then three different color space representations such as HSV, Lab and Luv of RGB images for each color region are encoded as 3rd color tensors. Then by unfolding the color tensor in the mode-3 direction, 2-D color matrix is obtained. The columns of this 2-D color matrix are the dimensional vectors that include (H, S a, b, u, v) components of HSV, Lab and Luv color spaces of an image pixel, and each column vector is accepted as an object. By applying CVA in object space consisting of column vectors of 2-D color matrix, a common color vector which represents common properties of that color region is obtained and used for segmentation purposes. In the experimental studies two different datasets proposed for open computer vision tasks in precision agriculture before in the literature are used. Three different experimental studies are performed for different dataset combinations in terms of training set and the test set. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with the performance of a deep learning method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based semantic segmentation method. In all of the three experimental studies proposed method achieves extremely high performance according to CNN, especially in the second and in the third experimental studies where dataset combinations include the two of the datasets.",

The results indicated that soils with predominant sandy or clayey characteristics are compatible to obtain a stable CSCE.

This study sought to evaluate the enzymatic mechanism involved in the protection of the metabolism of Pontederia parviflora Alexander caused chromium absorption stress. The experiment was carried with solution of chromium (III) in three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 ppm) in the period of four days and evaluations daily. The concentration of chromium in the solution influenced the form of storage of metal in the tissues of plants. In 24 hours, there was increase of glutathione in the root in 10ppm solution and in 50 and 100 ppm the accumulation of glutathione occurs in the stem, coinciding with the peak absorption metal (48 hours). The activity of the catalase was higher in the roots, the peroxidase showed higher activity at the 50 ppm concentration, and the guaiacol had similar activity to catalase. The tolerance of P. parviflora in response to chromium stress occur for complex mechanisms, phytohormone-producing as significantly regulated under Cr stress and the formation of phytoquelatins was in sync with the absorption of metal. Due to the tolerance shown by P. parviflora, it becomes important for the environmental treatment of contaminated water.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to reflect on the impacts of COVID-19, a disease responsible for the pandemic worldwide status in 2020, on urban housing policies in Brazil, which has faced structural problems since the turn of the century. These problems were accentuated and evidenced with the onset of the pandemic. The paper sought to highlight the dismantling scenario and the setbacks of human rights that are expressed in the manner in which the federal government behaves in the face of the collapse caused by the health crisis. In addition to highlighting that, the housing problem has been sewn with patches that are not effective to supply the gigantic demand for housing in the country currently, besides they do not guarantee the security of tenure to the majority of families in socioeconomic vulnerability. In this context, the focus of the discussion is on the removals and evictions that have occurred during the pandemic, putting at risk an entire population historically neglected by the neoliberal policies of capitalism. Moreover, these policies have been accentuated as a reflection of the recent democratic inflection in the country, which has strongly threatened human and social rights, legitimized by necropolitics, during the pandemic (Mbembe, 2018). The text is presented as a theoretical study carried through an exploratory methodological structure, based on a bibliographic review and documentary analysis of the subject matter. This article does not intend to bring conclusions or final answers, but to present new elements for the debate on the dismantling of Brazilian housing policies, evidenced in the current scenario through the lack of access to decent housing or difficulty in keeping it, mainly for the lowest-income populations.",

WDN can be formed by reservoirs, pipes, nodes, loops, and pumps and its complete design can be formulated as an optimization problem. The majority of published papers in the open literature use meta-heuristics for problem solution, as well as hydraulic simulators to calculate pressures and velocities. In the present study, a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model was developed to the synthesis of WDN considering the minimization of the WDN total cost, given by the sum of installation and operational costs, which is the novelty in the paper. All the hydraulic calculations were included in the model (mass and energy balances and velocity and pressure upper and lower bounds), avoiding the use of additional software. Reformulation techniques are applied to the model considering the use of logarithms and disjunctive programming. Two case studies extracted from real WDN were used to test the model and global optimization techniques were employed to achieve the results. The results obtained show that the operational costs play an important role in the WDN system design.",

    "abstract": "The results of sensory evaluations of coffees are associated with latent factors, such as the particular subjectivity of each individual. Based on the foregoing, assessing the quality of a sensory panel for product discrimination basically depends on the statistical methodology to be used in data analysis. Following this argument, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the EM - Expectation Maximization algorithm in discriminating groups of individuals, characterized by the degree of experience and knowledge in sensory analysis of coffees of different varieties, produced in the Serra da Mantiqueira micro-region, with different processing and altitudes. The main advantage of this algorithm is the fast convergence, when the current solution approaches the optimal solution with high precision. The disadvantage is because it is a deterministic optimization technique, which can only achieve a local optimization depending on the initialization, i.e., initial values input in the iterative procedure. It can be concluded that estimates of the correlation matrices obtained by the EM algorithm showed that the final grade has a greater influence of sweetness, in addition to discriminating groups of consumers with different sensory perceptions and in situations where the number of individuals in each group is unknown, the EM algorithm was accurate in estimating the proportion of individuals belonging to each group, assuming that the correlations of sensory responses follow a bivariate normal distribution.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification is a crucial and very difficult task. Meanwhile, extracting features that are representative and able to discriminate different types of EEG signals is a complex task. Such features are usually fed to machine learning algorithms to classify the EEG signals based on the extracted features. This paper proposed a highly accurate and real-time features extraction method that can be used to help physicians in detecting different types of seizures and states in EEG signals characterized by a set of features extracted from the power spectrum of the EEG window. This is achieved by applying the following four steps. First, the EEG signals dataset contains different classes of EEG signals: Normal Eye Closed, Normal Eye Opened, Focal Seizure, Non-Focal Seizure, and Ictal Seizure activities. Second, each EEG signal has a length of 4097 samples sampled with a sampling frequency of 173.6 Hz which resulted in 23.6 seconds in length, this signal will be truncated into windows (Sub-signals) with a length of 349 samples (Approximately 2 seconds) with a total number of 12 windows for each signal. Afterward, the Fourier Transform (FT) based power spectrum will be computed for each window, then a set of different features are extracted from each window's FT power spectrum, and these features are classified using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The results showed that the proposed methodology yields around 98% accuracy for the five different classification scenarios using different ML algorithms. The suggested method is hence robust, fast, real-time, accurate, and simple.",

This study aimed to determine the ideal conditions for the development of a goldenberry powder. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was adopted to obtain response surfaces. For processing, different temperatures (50 - 70ºC) and times (27.18 - 32.82 hours) were used for dehydration of the fruits, evaluating the content of total carotenoids as a response and the moisture content around 15%. Data obtained were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and fitted to a second-order polynomial equation using multiple regression analysis. An optimization study was carried out and the desirability function methodology was applied to find the ideal process condition. The optimization was determined at 52ºC and in a time of 27.18 hours, in which the experimental value obtained for total carotenoids was 12656.5 ± 527.22 mg 100 g-1 and moisture content of 15.00 ± 0.26%. In this condition, the global desirability value was 1.000 and the experimental values agreed with the predicted ones. Second-order polynomials were able to predict the carotenoids content in goldenberry powder, as well as the moisture content of the powder. The CCD and response surface tools were effective in optimizing the process. The production of goldenberry powder under these experimental conditions represents a viable alternative for adding value to the fruits, enabling the production of a potential food ingredient with carotenoid retention.",

    "abstract": "Tomatoes are one of the most prominent vegetables globally, with significant cultural and economic relevance in various nations, including Brazil. The term ‘safe food’ is becoming more popular as consumer preferences and supply chain dynamics become evolved in these processes. In light of these issues, the use of safety and quality management methods for fruits and vegetables have increased dramatically, with traceability being one of these solutions worth highlighting. When it comes to traceability, evaluation of tomato seedlings, plants, and fruits to identify groups or hybrids becomes particularly crucial throughout the marketing process, since the consumer of seedlings or fruit has difficulties recognizing whether that product truly belongs to the group indicated by the merchant. Thus, the potential of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with the PC-LDA and PLS-DA algorithms was tested for the discrimination of two significant commercial groups, Salada and Saladete, as well as eleven cultivars belonging to these groups, which were tested for this purpose. The results show that, by using the PLS-DA model, the portable NIR equipment is capable of differentiating tomato seedlings in nurseries of the Salada and Saladete groups, with an accuracy of 99.7% and sensitivity of 100%. The technique showed to be efficient for individual models of tomato seedlings in the Salada group, with accuracy over 90% and sensitivity above 93% for all models. For the Saladete group's individual models, the technique proved effectiveness for the hybrids Parma, BS-110012, Giácomo, Guara, and Tyna.",

    "abstract": "Dimensional stability of wood can be determined by measuring the total swelling percentage between 0% and FSP moisture content according to the ABNT NBR 7190 (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas [ABNT], 1997). Wood dimensional variation by the moisture content modifications must influence both structural elements and connections into timber structures. The wood swelling procedure according to the Brazilian code for saturation of wood samples can take more than a month, but the use of autoclave devices may accelerate this activity, making easier the dimensional stability determination. This paper aims to investigate the possibility of accelerating the wood swelling activity using an autoclave device, considering the Brazilian code for thirteen Brazilian commercial wood species. Contrast test for comparison between accelerated process (Stage 4 – 225 min. at 0.49 MPa pressure) and the conventional procedure for wood swelling resulted in p-value equal to 0.0730 and the average difference between groups about 1.1307% (varying between -0.0541 and 2.3156 with 95% confidence level). According to results, 225 min. at 0.49 MPa pressure provides an equivalent wood swelling compared to the conventional procedure, which can make faster the wood dimensional stability evaluation according to the ABNT NBR 7190 (ABNT, 1997).",

In this study, we evaluated a prototype of a biofilter for biogas desulfurization made of coconut chips as packing media and digester effluent as a nutrient source. The composition of inlet and outlet biogas was evaluated through gas chromatography in five tests. The maximum desulfurization efficiency observed was 75.80%, but with a considerable variation (mean of 43.08%). Microscopy analysis of the packing media before and after the experiments demonstrated the accumulation of substances and the presence of new elements.

This study was carried out at the sewage treatment plant in the Instituto Federal Goiano campus, in Rio Verde city, Goias, Brazil. The treatment system consists of a septic tank followed by a hybrid system of constructed wetlands (CW). Sewage monitoring was performed at 3 points: PTS (previously treated sewage), TS1 (VS-CW output) and TS2 (HS-CW output). Water quality analysis were carried out weekly, between May and December 2021, in two types of operation: no recirculation (10 weeks) and 100% recirculation (17 weeks). In this research, three kinetics models were evaluated (1st Order, Monod and Monod Multi) combined with two types of idealized dynamic flow: PFR and CSTR. Results show that the water behavior of the recirculation system increasing by 335% and 59.25% in inlet and outlet flows, respectively, from the VS-CW. The overall efficiency in BOD removing was 89.26% in linear system and 83.95% in the recirculating system. In the case of COD, an overall removal system was 69.7% in the linear and 25.7% in the recirculating system. The Monod kinetic model was the most representative to describe the BOD removal in the linear system (R² = 0.80) and in the recirculation (R² = 0.61). None of the models were included in the description of the linear COD removal processes in the system. In the recirculating system, the Monod kinetic model (R² = 0.81) was the most representative in terms of concentration. Sewage recirculation brought new treatment dynamics and was efficient in BOD reducing (concentration). It is noteworthy that the BOD and COD removal efficiency was lower than in the recirculation by sewage dilution in the suction well.",

    "abstract": "Temporins are small antimicrobial peptides which have cytotoxic effects against different cancerous cell lines. However, their cytotoxicity against normal cells has been reported in some studies. Designing new temporin analogs with selective cytotoxicity against cancerous cell lines is considered a goal in drug development. In this regard, four new temporin-1CEa analogs (either C-terminally α-amidated or not) with increased net positive charge, as well as the potential of hydrogen bond formation were designed and their selective cytotoxicity against prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCaP) was evaluated. MTT assay was employed to test the simultaneous effects of the modifications on the cytotoxicity of the analogs against both normal (HFFF2) and cancerous (LNCaP) cell lines. Then, the in vitro selectivity index of each analog was determined using the equation of selectivity index (SI= IC50 of peptide against normal cell line / IC50 of peptide against cancerous cell line). The structural modifications of temporin-1CEa (increasing the net positive charge and removing C-terminally amidated group, as well as the potential of hydrogen bond formation on the non-polar face of α-helical structure) reduced the cytotoxicity of K2K3W15-COOH analog against both cancerous (LNCaP) and normal (HFFF2) cell lines. However, the modifications resulted in improving the in vitro selectivity index of K2K3W15-COOH compared to the temporin-1CEa (1.67 vs. 1.33, respectively). The results of the present study indicated that some structural modifications may lead to a diminution in the cytotoxicity of new analogs against cancerous cells. However, the same modifications can be associated with better selectivity indexes of new analogs due to a further decrease in their cytotoxicity against normal cells.",

This paper presents and discusses the influence of the unsaturated condition in CPTs performed on tropical soil site. Four CPT campaigns and gravimetric water content profiles have been determined in different periods over two years. Soil-water retention curves (SWRC) were used to estimate in situ soil suction. It was observed that the CPT data were influenced by soil suction up to 6.0 m depth. Two semi-empirical approaches based on bearing capacity theory and effective stress principle were used for data interpretation. These approaches allowed to assess the soil suction influence on CPT and to define the typical test profile with no suction effects. The importance of considering soil suction in the CPT interpretation on unsaturated soils is highlighted, and the effective stress approach is suggested as a starting point.",

When the current traffic accidents are examined, the negative effect of lane line quality and level of visibility related on the accidents comes to the forefront in underdeveloped and developing countries. In this study, the effect of lane line visibility level on drivers' lane utilization was investigated in detail. For this aim, a total of 17 different points in Türkiye were selected and the lateral positions of the vehicles on the road surface at these points were determined with the help of the screen scaling technique. In order to determine the level of lane line quality for an expert group and driver perspective, a face-to-face survey was conducted. From the analysis results, the lane line quality was determined low in urban and intercity roads, and the average maximum evaluation score was determined as 4.7 and the lowest score was determined as 1.42 where the best line quality was 5. This result showed that the level of lane line quality had significant differences at different points. Although, it was observed that the lateral position distributions in the examined points fit the normal distribution, the distribution of both the right/left wheels and their gravity center skewed to the right or left and deviated from the ideal conditions on road surfaces. It showed that the vehicles do not center the lanes exactly, but usually move close to the right or left edge of the lane. This situation also clearly revealed that the lane utilization disciplines of drivers are quite weak with the effect of the low lane line quality on road surfaces.",

Consequently, this energy can be used as an alternative source and contribute to managing industrial residues. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate biogas production from industrial residues in a dietary supplement industry located in the municipality of Estrela, state of Rio Grande do Sul. The methodology is based on the Automated Biogas Measurement System (ABMS), described by Konrad, Hasan, Marder, Zulian, and Guerini Filho (2021), using triplicate samples, and carried out at the Energy and Sustainable Technologies Research Center (ESTRC), located in the Scientific and Technological Park inside the Taquari Valley University - Univates (Tecnovates). The analyzed samples had different characteristics, such as solid and liquid residue. Results showed that the oily, liquid residue presents a higher potential for biogas production, and, in the same way, other substrates also showed positive results for potential biogas and methane production (BBP and BMP). The highest methane percentage reached by the samples was 63.94, 71.83; 70.55; 71.24; and 67.38% (for SR, GLR, OLR, Mix 50/50 RL and Mix S/L 96/4, respectively). Residues from dietary supplements showed positive potential for the production of biogas and methane.

The performance of this technique is explored by means of two demanding practical applications related to bridge structures with constant and variable deck thicknesses. The first application deals with the static truck load test of the Caynarachi Bridge, located in Peru, and for which measured field data exists, while the second application is related to the construction stage analysis of a box bridge structure including time effects due to concrete creep, shrinkage and steel relaxation. The results demonstrate that the studied technique acceptably correlates with the measured field data,expressed in terms of vertical displacements,with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.94.Additionally, the outcomes align well with the results of other numerical techniques, allowing applicants to use this simplified modeling approach in daily design office.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates and explains the behavior of an acoustic meta-structure based on different coupled Helmholtz resonators (HR). The analytical formulation of the Maa model is used to represent both the acoustic impedance and the sound absorption mechanism of the absorber. The structures are numerically modeled using finite element method and validated experimentally in an impedance tube considering sound waves of normal incidence. The absorber samples were manufactured in ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) polymer material with the additive manufacturing technique by extrusion of material. The results of the impedance tube, numerical and theoretical tests showed agreement and the sound absorber showed a sub-wavelength scale with perfect sound absorption ( 0.97) and broadband of 292 Hz in the low frequency region (200 - 600 Hz). We deduced that the excellent experimental result obtained is due to the high resolution used in the sample manufacturing (± 0.1 mm) which minimized manufacture errors. Finally, the influences of the main parameters of the HR panel (width and depth of the micro-slit) on the sound absorption coefficient of the absorber were also analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Due to the increased availability of low cost network technology, the use of networks to interconnect sensors, actuators and controllers is becoming widely accepted for the implementation of feedback control systems. Such type of feedback implementation, wherein the control loops are closed through a real-time network, are called Network Controlled Systems (NCS). When implementing a NCS, the underlying communication network must provide a timely communication service, which must be the adequate to fulfil the control application requirements. Therefore, the assessment of the network responsiveness to the real-time requirements of the control application is a fundamental issue. Both PROFIBUS and CAN networks are usually considered suitable to support small-scale NCS, due to their real-time capabilities. However, their temporal responsiveness is highly dependent on both the timing characteristics of the supported message streams, such as its periodicity and the related message lengths. In this paper, we compare the timing properties of both CAN and PROFIBUS control networks. Basically, we assess their capability to support Network Controlled Systems, through the evaluation of the related worst-case message’s response time. A small example of a NCS is then used to assess the capability of the CAN control network to fulfil control application requirements.",

A three-dimensional numerical analysis was developed using a software based on the finite element method (FEM), which considered the nonlinear physical behavior of the materials. It was found that for strut angle inclination close to 45º, the pile caps showed the same behavior, independent of the wall interfaces. The results indicated that the presence of a locking beam has no significant influence on the pile caps behavior and that the socket wall is able to effectively transfer the force from the beam to the piles.",

With the improvement of internal combustion engines the turbulence intensity and internal pressure have risen, demanding more efficient and powerful ignition systems. In direct injection engines, the stratified charge resultant from the wall/air-guided or spray-guided system requires even more energy. The Paschen’s law shows that spark plug gap and mixture density are proportional to the dielectric rupture voltage. It is known that larger spark gaps promote higher efficiency in the internal combustion engines, since the mixture reaction rate rises proportionally. However, the ignition system must be adequate to the imposed gap, not only on energy, but also on voltage and spark duration. For the reported study in this work two test benches were built: a standard inductive ignition system and a capacitive discharge high energy ignition system, with variable voltage and capacitance. The influence of the important parameters energy and ignition voltage on the spark duration, as well as the electrode gap and shape were analyzed. It was also investigated the utilization of a coil with lower resistance and inductance values, as well as spark plugs with and without internal resistances.",

Pr6O11 doping modifies the electrical behavior of the ceramics.

The system with 0.05% in mol Pr6O11 had the same non-linearity coefficient α as the system with 0.10% in mol. However, breakdown electrical field and voltage per barrier rates were lower (EB = 708 V cm-1 and Vb = 0.98 V barrier-1). The low rates in the breakdown electrical field enabled the varistor systems under study to be used in protection systems for low-voltage energy grids. In the case of Pr6O11 concentrations above 0.10% in mol, the presence of the dopant became deleterious to the varistor’s electrical characteristics. This effect was due to an increase in praseodymium stannate (Pr2Sn2O7) secondary phase.

A completely randomized 2 x 2 factorial mode design was employed to evaluate the following factors: (1) substrate for periphyton and (2) the C/N ratio of water. Dry molasses were applied weekly in the tanks to raise C/N ratio of water to 20:1. The addition of molasses to the culture water significantly lowered DO2 and pH levels of water, and raised nitrite concentration. Fish stocked in the control tanks (no periphyton, no C/N ratio balance) attained a final body weight significantly higher than those observed for other treatments after 6 weeks of culture. In spite of the correction of C/N ratio of water to 20: 1, low DO2 concentrations avoided the suitable development of bioflocs.",

Compositions with regard to Types and Configuration Patterns were verified. Transformations occurred as from the original plan, with the maintenance of the former structure and the main axes. Initial imprints preserving the primary stratum of the city may be identified. By employing Munizaga’s Urban Structures, the analyses of the maps revealed the beginning of disarticulation of the planned city, back in 1938. These transformations were more evident in 1949.

The same experimental design was applied to this trial, that is, a randomized block design with split-plots (5 x 3), corresponding to the residual effect of water salinity and nitrogen, and four replications. The variables determined were: the plant height on six dates after the sowing, and the dry mass of the shoot, root and the whole plant. The data were firstly subjected to the variance analysis of the residual effects and to the study of spatial variability through geostatistics. The variance analysis did not show significant residual effects of the levels of salinity and nitrogen doses in the soil on the height and dry mass of Sunn Hemp.

Conventionally, for induction heating load, the output power control is achieved using the pulse with modulation based converters. The conventional converters do not guarantee the zero voltage switching condition required for the minimization of the switching losses. In this paper, pulse mask control scheme for the power control of induction heating load is proposed. This power control strategy allows the inverter to operate closer to the resonant frequency, to obtain zero voltage switching condition. The proposed high frequency AC power conversion circuit has lesser total harmonic distortion in the supply side. Modeling of the IH load, design of conversion circuit and principle of the control scheme and its implementation using low cost PIC controller are briefly discussed. Simulation results obtained using the Matlab environment are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the pulse mask scheme. The obtained results indicate the reduction in losses, improvement in the output power and lesser harmonic distortion in the supply side by the proposed converter. The hardware results are in good agreement with the simulation results.",

In the strengthening in beams, the tensile zone is found damaged for several reasons (cracking and corrosion, for instance), which demands, in the practice of engineering, its preliminary retrofitting. It should be considered that the good performance of the material used in this retrofitting is fundamental for a higher efficiency of the strengthening. Therefore, it is proposed a methodology that consists of the reconstitution of the tensile zone of the beams with a cement-based composite of high performance (CCAD), which acts as a substrate for the application of CFRP and as an element for the transfer of efforts to the part strengthened. The retrofitting of this tensile zone was performed only in the shear span, as well as throughout of the zone with a view to evaluating the influence of this aspect on the performance of the beams. The CCAD, produced from Portland cement, steel fibers and microfibers, was evaluated using the Rilem (2002), showed to be able to delay the cracking. Tests performed in the beams with the tensile zone retrofitting by CCAD and strengthening using the technique NSM showed the efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

Different symmetric and asymmetric link functions were considered by means of Bayesian inference. The support of more accurate inferences regarding the parameters of the model will provide biological interpretations that are more reliable and consistent with the reality. The model that presented, significantly, the lowest value for the deviance information criterion (DIC = 398.8), was the binomial with power logit (PL) link function, whose median posterior value estimated and significant for the parameter asymmetry was l = 0.25 (0.14;1.17). This significance is observed in all other models of the power family, however with very different values ​​and significantly higher DIC values, indicating less parsimonious models. The Bayesian methodology proved to be flexible. Additionally, the results show that such model shows an accuracy = 97.4% and area under the ROC curve AUC = 89.4% in the prediction of neonatal deaths based on the weight of children at birth. Specifically, for 2.500g, a value predicted in the medical literature for low weight, the model predicts a probability of 1.43%.",

Scales were removed from the humeral region of each fish and the fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out with two excitation wavelengths: at 360 nm (UV-A) and 405 nm. The broad emission covers all visible regions and it is related to the organic fraction of scale, basically composed from type I collagen. By interpreting the experimental fluorescence spectra with multivariate statistical analysis, it was possible to discriminate the investigated populations. By exciting the inner face of scales at 405 nm, for instance, the obtained Wilk’s lambda was 0.143, and the ten sampled streams could be statistically differentiated with 85.2% of explanation. This fluorescence interpretation exhibits very good correlation with the diet composition, which was also investigated for the same fishes from which the scales were removed. The applied methodology was capable to analyze the scales of A. lacustris, and to provide meaningful and enlightening results for the differentiation of populations. This methodology is very important for aquatic environmental study, mainly because small fishes, non-migratory or with small migration rate, can exhibit differences among habitats, as response to genetic isolation and adjustment to local conditions.",

Also, is the main source for energy storage in horticultural products. The starch from soursop fruits can be used as an alternative source with functional properties and a wide field of application in the food industry. The use of emerging technologies such as ultrasound-assisted extraction has improved sensory attributes and functional properties. To the best of our knowledge, extraction of starch by ultrasound from soursop fruits has not to date been documented. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the functional properties of soursop fruit starches by ultrasound-assisted method and determine the presence of acetogenins. Three times (10, 15 and 20 minutes) and three ultrasonic amplitudes (UA) of 20, 30 and 40% for the ultrasound-assisted extraction were used. Total yield, gelatinization temperature, water absorption and solubility index, swelling index, amylose and amylopectin content, presence of acetogenins and starch granule morphology were recorded. The highest extraction yield (ultrasound) was reached using 10 min and 40% UA (6.34%). For the gelatinization temperature, 10 min and 30% UA (82.33°C) were the best conditions. Water Solubility Index (WSI) values of 6.13 ± 0.00% using 10 min and 20% UA were recorded. Water Absorption Index (WAI) as well as Swelling index (SI) values of 3.34 ± 0.12% and 3.26 ± 0.00% were obtained by conventional extraction, respectively. Starch granules morphology showed different size with circular shapes and truncated geometries. Finally, positive qualitative results for the presence of acetogenins by all the extraction methods were obtained.",

Therefore, enabling the generation of subsidies for genetic-molecular studies in algabora (Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC). The amplification profile was characterized. It was generated from 17 pairs of RGA primers (Resistance Gene Analogs) in 20 samples of genomic DNA of P. juliflora extracted from specimens collected in the city of Itapetinga, Bahia. The amplifications were performed according to previously published laboratory routines and the amplification profiles analyzed from the photodocumentation of the electrophoresis results in 2% agarose gels. Based on the amplification profiles the primer pairs were classified as: Suitable: amplifications in the whole samples and with easy visualization; Reasonable: amplification in parts of the samples and/or difficult to visualize or Inadequate: absence of visible amplification products. Descriptive analyzes associated with the number of generated markers, percentage of polymorphism, expected heterozygosity (He) and the content of polymorphic information (PIC) were also performed. In a nutshell, 12 out of the 17 pairs of RGA primers generated amplification products with easy visualization and only two of these 12 pairs of primers were monomorphic. The percentage of polymorphism varied from 60% to 100%, He and PIC presented an average of 0.21 (ranging from 0 to 0.38) and 0.17 (ranging from 0 to 0.29), respectively. The results confirm that the RGA primers present adequate characteristics for genetic studies in P. juliflora, making it possible to prioritize 12 pairs of primers, which are subject to genetic improvement studies.",

    "abstract": "The Finite Element Method analysis of machining processes has become a ubiquitous feature to the area, however, there sometimes occur considerable deviations between experimental and simulated results due to the inherent complexity of the process. The basis for such may conceivably be related to imprecisions in the material and friction modelling, besides improper setup of mesh parameters. Elements should be small enough to allow for the proper representation of the chip formation, but taking into account that the computational time increases accordingly with mesh downsizing. Simulations of the milling process of Inconel 718 were conducted using the software Thirdwave AdvantEdge under different cutting conditions for three different meshes. Power and temperature output were compared to experimental results, most of which were measured via Hall-effect sensors and thermographic camera, respectively. The tool cutting edge radius was found to be an important factor and was estimated using Scanning Electron Microscope images. The influence of the finite element mesh size was higher for harsher cutting conditions, with effects felt on machining power only. In this case, finer mesh produced results that showed a higher agreement with experimental data, but at higher computational cost as shown by analysis of elapsed processing time. Although errors higher than 40% were observed, power and temperature trends from simulations were always in accordance with that found in experimental tests. Comparisons with experimental data from other studies showed the errors tend to grow for higher feed and cutting speed, which indicates the constitutive model of the material is more adequate for softer machining conditions. Simulation time seemed to be exponentially proportional to the inverse of minimum element size, and measured values might serve as a reference for other users.",

    "abstract": "Due to the increase in the PWW production level by the high concentration of animals per area, the intensification and concentration of pig farming in certain regions has resulted in the intensive application of swine manure (PWW) in the same terrain, which may provide the soil accumulation and the transference of elements may compromise the productive capacity of the territorial space of that region. In this sense, this work aimed to evaluate the elements concentration present in the soil and in swine waste, in relation to the values stipulated by CONAMA Resolution n. 420 (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente [CONAMA], 2009) and also by CETESB n. 195/2005 (Companhia de Tecnologia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo [CETESB], 2005), which provides for criteria and values guiding soil quality and groundwater for chemicals presence, and, based on the reference element, adapt to the technical standard P 4,231/2015 (Companhia de Tecnologia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo [CETESB], 2015) proposed by CETESB for the dose calculation of vinasse application, in PWW application in pasture cultivation. The work accomplished at Fazenda Talhado Cinco de Março rural area - Rio Verde Municipality – Goiás state. Samples were performed to determine the soil physicochemical attributes and PWW chemical analysis of the soil, submitted to statistical analysis of Analysis of Variance and Tukey’s Test 5%. The results made it possible to verify that the used management is not the most appropriate, and it is necessary to review the procedures currently adopted, such as performing more constant soil and PWW analyzes, to avoid that their continual application in a disorderly manner and with possible negative impacts on the environment.",

    "abstract": "Blueberry is a fruit consumed fresh and as an ingredient in formulations such as jam, juice, and wine. Wine is a widely consumed beverage and produced from different berries and fruits. Blueberry wine contains bio-compounds that could have a beneficial effect on health. Therefore, this study aimed to optimize blueberry wine by two response variables (total soluble solids and fermentation time) to obtain the highest alcohol percentage, pH, and lightness. In order to optimize the fermentation process, a central composite design was used. The optimized blueberry wine was obtained at total soluble solids of 25°Brix and fermentation time of 16 d. The optimized blueberry characteristics estimated were: alcohol percentage of 11.91%, pH of 2.98, and lightness (L*) of 26.22, and the optimized blueberry characteristics experimental were: alcohol percentage of 11.93±0.02%, pH of 2.97±0.01, and L* of 25.42±1.80. The optimized blueberry wine had a total phenolic content of 360.27±18.09 mg of gallic acid equivalents L-1, total anthocyanin content of 46.27±3.66 mg cyanidin-3 glucoside L-1, antioxidant capacity by ABTS and DDPH assays of 1,539.8±92.18 and 1,688.07±57.57 mM Trolox equivalent L-1, respectively. The results suggest that optimized blueberry wine can be considered a drink with potential health applications.",

This investigation partially characterized a pyruvate fraction with in vitro and ex vivo effects on an intrinsic/extrinsic pathway-induced thrombin generation (TG) continuous model using 36 or 60-fold diluted mice or defibrinated, normal human plasma. Fraction separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography exhibited charge homogeneity and non-sulfated polysaccharides (&lt;100 kDa) by agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, using Stains-all alone. Fourier Transform Infrared and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies indicated a 4,6-pyruvated agaran-structure. The fraction and heparin had no effect on prothrombin time, but there was a preponderant intrinsic rather than extrinsic pathway inhibition in TG assay; themselves, acting on both free and fibrin bound thrombin activity without chromogenic substrate interaction. Both fractions, desulfated and native, anticipated and induced thrombin formation in activators-devoid or normal plasma. In addition, mice pretreated with fraction (20 mg kg-1, intraperitoneally) reduced intrinsically plasma TG ex vivo after 2h. Heparin suppressed TG in vitro, but induced it ex vivo. Therefore, agaran from A. muscoides blocks TG on in vitro and ex vivo studies, suggesting to evaluate the blood coagulability status.",

    "abstract": "Laccase is an important enzyme in terms of its versatile applicability, but its commercial use is limited by factors such as high production cost, low activity and/or stability under given conditions. The objective of this study was to screen xylophagic bacteria isolated from termites for the production of extracellular and intracellular laccases. Six laccase-positive strains were isolated, namely CA, A3, A5, A6, A7 and A8. They were molecularly identified by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and classified under the genera Bacillus (A7, A8, CA) and Pseudomonas (A3, A5, A6). Laccase was produced by these bacterial isolates by submerged fermentation and was optimized at 37°C, pH 5.5, 6.2 and 7.0, with agitation and 0.5 mM guaiacol (as carbon source). Laccase activity was determined by measuring the oxidation of guaiacol and ABTS (2,21-azino bis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate]). Strain A5 produced extracellular laccase titers ranging from 123 to 168 U ml-1. Guaiacol was identified as a better substrate for the quantification of laccase. In conclusion, bacteria harboring the gut of termites can produce extracellular laccase with activity at medium to moderate acidity.",

The electronic device characteristics and the different communication protocols to transfer data are also reported. Research obtained the hip and knee angles to analyze the lower limb kinematics during multiple gait cycles. Results showed that the movement patterns, found in the analysis made on people from central Mexico, were cyclical and alternating. The knee described a one third curve in flexion-extension movements just before the start of the flexion-extension curve in the swing phase. Moreover data obtained showed a correlation of movement between hip and knee during walking.",

An alternative to reduce such natural disasters will occur when landslides-susceptible areas are mapped, with restrictions or conditions for the occupation of areas with natural fragility to landslide occurrences. Current analysis determines the slopes´ potential degree for the occurrence of landslide susceptibility in the Caeté catchment, municipality of Alfredo Wagner, in the highlands of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The Shallow Stability model (SHALSTAB) identified the slopes´ instability index by hydrological factors, hillside stability and soil.

Web providers must be prepared to support this growing demand for information and communication. In this sense, the use of web server clusters together with the balancing of requests has been an important strategy for distributing the services among several processors in a balanced way. This paper describes and discusses architectural and operational issues of request balancing, especially dynamic balancing, covering concepts, techniques and solutions. Real experiments were performed in different configurations on a cluster of Apache servers non dedicated exclusively to web service. The mod_proxy_balancer load balancing module was used with intensive synthetic overloads and a new balancing method called byalltraffic was proposed and evaluated. The results show that the balancing in this type of system will be more efficient if the external network workload to the web service is detected and used in the balancing factor.",

Five different repose periods were evaluated: 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 days after the first filtration, carrying out three batches. The SWW filtration rate decreased with the operating time of the filters, which can be attributed to clogging of pores resulting from high concentrations of suspended solids (SS) present in this type of wastewater. In the three batches, it was observed that the repose periods of 1, 2 and 4 days were not sufficient to unclog the pores, however, repose periods of 8 and 16 days for the filter medium resulted in increases of the filtration rate, only 59 and 72% of the initial rate, respectively.",

However, RFID is lagging behind due to vendor specific solutions and excessive reader cost. A WiFi compatible IEEE 802.11 RFID tag can eliminate the reader. A digital modulator and demodulator for the reader-less RFID tag in IEEE 802.11 protocol employing Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and Barker code are proposed in this paper. To generate the 11-bit Barker code, MOD-11 synchronous counter and encoder are designed by utilizing only four D flip-flops instead of preloading the code sequence in multiple registers. For modulation, data are multiplied with this Barker code and for demodulation, the received data are multiplied with the same Barker code. Designed in 0.18 µm CMOS technology, the minimum, average and maximum power consumptions are 3.64 nA, 17.64 µA and 7.61 mA, respectively. The simulation results show the correct functionality of the modulator and demodulator where 1 bit is spread to 11 bits and 11 bits received data are de-spread to 1 bit, respectively. The design would help to implement the modulator and demodulator for the reader-less RFID tag with resistance to multi-path fading and interference and covering the highest distance with lower Bit Error Rate (BER).",

This article describes the implementation of an onboard reactive control architecture for a multi-agent system, equipped with local vision camera and local sensors. This multiple agent system is applied in robot soccer environments. The work describes the digital image processing techniques as well as the proposed control architecture that satisfy the constraints related with this kind of application.",

    "abstract": "The intention of this work was to evaluate the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (C1 LBPVMA-UFAL) on lubricant oil and verify the production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant. Tests in solid medium containing lubricant oil supplemented with different sources of nitrogen were used to evaluate the growth of P. aeruginosa. The growth medium used for production of rhamnolipid was (g L-1): yeast extract, 0.1; NaCl, 1.0; MgSO4, 0.2; MnSO4.H2O, 0.02; 0.5% lubricant oil (w v-1). The biosurfactant concentration was detected 24h after the inoculation, during the exponential phase, with the maximum value obtained up to 120h, although no drastic alteration of pH had been verified. The emulsifier activity was also first detected after 24h of incubation, with maximum production after 120h. The characterization of the produced biosurfactant was performed through thin layer chromatography, which showed the presence of two spots with Rf values equal to 0.71 and 0.5, revealed by reagents specific to rhamnolipids. These results suggested that two types of rhamnolipidic biosurfactant are produced by the strain of P. aeruginosa in limited conditions of nutrients, able to use lubricant oil as main carbon source. This bacterium, isolated from agro-industrial effluent, showed potential to bioremediation assays of contamination with petrol and his derivates.",

The different types of waste produced by man in several areas represent a serious environmental problem when incorrectly discharged.

Assays were performed through liquid culture implemented with Pleurotus sajor-caju and advanced oxidative process (AOP - System UV/H2O2). Efficiency verification of these processes was carried out through monitoring color removal and aromatic compounds by spectrophotometric analysis (UV-vis), and also by controlling the reduction of organic matter (Chemical Oxigen Demand analysis), as well as by performing toxicity bioassays with Escherichia coli and seeds of Lactuca sativa. Results indicated that the combined process – liquid culture followed by peroxidation with ultraviolet radiation, proved to be the most effective treatment for color removal (90-95%) and degradation of aromatic compounds (16-20%). Bioassays showed that the raw dye waste samples did not inhibit E. coli growth, but showed potential toxicity to the species of L. sativa, inhibiting seeds germination by 30 to 57%.",

Afterwards, the biodegraded chips were extracted with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) supplemented with 0.01% Tween 60. High activities of manganese peroxidases (MnPs) were observed in all the extracts, both in the absence (430, 765 and 896 UI kg-1, respectively) and in the presence of co-substrates (1,013; 2,066 and 2,323 UI kg-1, respectively). The extracts presented a high ratio between absorbances at 280 and 405 nm, indicating a strong abundance of aromatic compounds derived from lignin over heme-peroxidases. Adsorption into activated charcoal showed to be an adequate strategy to reduce the absorbance at 280 nm in all the extracts. Moreover, it allowed to maximize the capacity of an anion exchange resin bed (DEAE-Sepharose) used to concentrate the MnPs present in the extracts. It was concluded that the use of activated charcoal followed by adsorption into DEAE Sepharose is a strategy that can be used to concentrate MnPs in extracts obtained during the biodegradation of E. grandis by C. subvermispora.",

The non-linear behavior of concrete is modeled by the Mazars model, which is based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM) and has an easy parametric identification, while the reinforcement is governed by the uniaxial elasto-plastic model with constant hardening. Initially, the different types of damage models and their parametric identification are discussed and the Mazars model is presented. Then the BEM formulation is discussed, which is based on the initial moment technique, where the remaining domain integrals are evaluated by approaching the initial moment field over internal cells. The stress distribution over the plate thickness is obtained by using a Gauss scheme in which the adopted criterion is verified in each Gauss point defined along the plate. Then, the internal values of moments are approached by numerical integrals along the plate thickness. Finally, some numerical examples of reinforced concrete plates are analyzed, where the potentiality of the Mazars model is verified despite the difficulties of the parametric identification",

Based on midpoint potential [Em = (Eap + Ecp)/2] and separation of cathodic and anodic peaks (ΔE), it was not observed interaction of different eletrolytes (LiCl, KCl, BaCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4 and NaClO4), with the cationic dyes by an ion exchange reaction and, as a consequence, absence of leaching of cationic dyes to the solution phase. The kinetics of electron transfer on the surface electrode was not sufficiently fast showing a fairly resistence of carbon nanotube paste modified with the cationic dyes. The midpoint potential and ΔE also were insentive to the pH range (4-8), confirming the protective effect of carbon nanotubes matrix, owing to strong interaction of between the latter and the nitrogen of nitrogen of cationic dyes with carbon nanotube matrix, minimizing the proton interaction under cationic dye. This result is very important for sensor/biosensor preparation, because the eletrooxidation behavior of the analyte will be only affected by its formal potencial shifting. Carbon nanotubes proved to be an efficient solid matrix for the adsorption of mediator electron in comparison to the electrochemical behavior of free cationic dyes in solution phase.",

Surface meteorological data on daily variables of climatic elements have been employed for the creation of a table for each month under analysis. They were chosen as dry May samplings. Tables were analyzed concomitantly with an investigation on daily surface meteorological synoptic charts and on satellite photos, so that the atmospheric systems causing different types of climate might be identified. Results show that scanty rainfall in Maringá during the periods under analysis was caused by cold anti-cyclone activities which followed after frontal systems and by the activities of Atlantic Tropical System on the South American subcontinent. The latter normally blocks out cold fronts near latitude 30°S which, in turn, displace themselves towards the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the investigated area.",

It presents the results of experimental tests on floor diaphragms subjected to lateral loads. This is the first time this kind of test is performed in Brazil. Thus, it brings up valuable information about this subject, giving technical information that may contribute to the design and construction of floor diaphragms employing local materials that come from planted forests. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the resistance and rigidity of wood light-frame floor diaphragms, when subjected to monotonic lateral forces acting in the plane of the floor. Full-scale floor diaphragm specimens (2.50 x 5.00 m) were tested with different constructive arrangements, and the influence of the following variables were examined: blocked vs. unblocked diaphragms, rigidity of the nailed joints between I-joists and sheathing; and distance between nails around the perimeter of the OSB boards. The tests showed that the blocked floor diaphragms enable nailing the whole perimeter of the boards, thus increasing its resistance and rigidity.",

Linear PVA-Ma with several DS were obtained through the chemical reaction of PVA with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The DS of various PVA-Ma were determined through 1H NMR spectroscopy. Two steps were used for preparation the PVA-Ma/PNIPAAm membrane hydrogels. In the first step the PVA-Ma hydrogels (using PVA-Ma with different DS) were prepared by reaction of double bonds on PVA-Ma, using the persulfate/TEMED system. Using a photoreaction pathway in the second step, PNIPAAm network was prepared within the parent PVA-Ma network at different PVA-Ma/NIPAAm ratios. The studies show that degree of swelling ratio (SR) of PVA-Ma/PNIPAAm IPN hydrogels is dependent of temperature. The LCST for each IPN-hydrogel was determined by measuring the intensity of light transmitted through the hydrogel. The LCST of the IPN hydrogels ranged from 34.6 to 38.1oC. The elastic modules of swollen IPN hydrogels increased from 25 to 35oC but decreased by further warming to 45oC. The LCST, swelling ratio and mechanical properties of PVA-Ma/PNIPAAm IPN hydrogels can be tailored by tuning the PVA-Ma/NIPAAm ratio.",

The aim of the present study was to design experiments to examine the effects of operational variables, humic acid, temperature, pH and contact time that may affect the solubility of total mercury as dental amalgam residue in reduction process. Based on the factorial design of experiments, the humic acid concentration was the most significant factor in this process, followed by other factors. The parameters affecting the solubility of total mercury showed that when the [HA], T and CT increases and pH decreases there is an important increase of total mercury concentration in process. For the tested conditions, the high total mercury concentration was obtained using the humic acid concentration = 1.0 g L-1, temperature = 35oC, pH = 4.0 and contact time = 10 days.",

The efficiency of nitrification reached 90% in both operation conditions. Results obtained by the kinetic activity assays were better adjusted by the kinetic model of Andrews, which includes the inhibition constant by the substrate (Ki), than the Monod model. However, an increase was observed in the inhibition constant (Ki) of the sludge after the operation of the reactor as compared with the inoculum. This effect demonstrates an adaptation of the biomass to the new nitrification conditions (loading rate).",

The cost of completing a housing project, represented by the cost of the whole building as a function of the least number of project variables, follows a worldwide effort for product cost definition during the initial stage of development. The proposed model quantifies costs as a function of five geometrical variables that define physical arrangement. The advantage of this methodology is that it allows the planner to obtain the project solution cost once the physical arrangement and the construction’s finishing touches have been decided upon. Based on the cost value as computed by the model, coupled with a value representative of quality in the geometrical solution of the physical setup, a cost/quality index of the project’s geometrical solution is given. Definitive parameters are thus provided to evaluate and select the project’s several possibilities aiming at optimization. Custo da solução de arranjos físicos de habitações",

This model considers the physical non-linearity of the reinforced concrete through momentum-curvature diagrams of a cross-section. The momentum-curvature diagram presented in the CT-301 (2003) uses medium deformation in the reinforcement, in which the tension stiffening of the reinforced concrete is taken into account. Using programming language Fortran Power Station, the expression given by the code for the contribution of the tension stiffening of the reinforced concrete was implemented. Finally, some results are presented to check the validity of the employed calculation process",

The columns have cross section area of 15 x 30 cm at the test region, and an effective length of 174 cm. Six columns were tested. The main variables are the stirrup volumetric ratio and the longitudinal steel ratio. Articulation devices and load application devices were mounted in order to approach the proposed theoretical model as much as possible. The columns with smaller stirrup volumetric ratio showed a brittle mode of failure accompanied by the buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement. Differently, the columns with larger stirrup volumetric ratio presented ductile failure accompanied by concrete crushing on the most compressed side of the column. Theoretical models were used to obtain values of the maximum axial loads and ultimate flexural moment. The results were compared with the experimental ones obtained in the tests.",

The results show that the savings in processing time obtained due to the parallel algorithms, in comparison to its sequential equivalents, is a function that depends on the resolution of the image and the complexity of the involved calculation; that is, efficiency is greater the longer the processing period is in terms of the time involved for the communication between the network points.",

However, the high cost around high reactivity, explosion risks and extremely low energy density, make it unfeasible to be used as fuel in large quantities scale. There are some possibilities to circumvent these limitations, including obtaining and converting energy through fuel cells, which is very promising. Research in this field has been summarized in recent decades, motivated by the environmental problems faced due to the dependence on non-renewable energy matrices. From this, this study aimed to improve the steam methanol reforming using CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy, N2 physisorption and XRD. Catalytic tests were carried out in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor at 300°C, atmospheric pressure and in differential conditions (methanol conversion &lt; 10%); a previous run for catalyst synthesis validation in relation to the results obtained in the literature for the same conditions was evaluated. Subsequently, it was found that the thermal degradation of methanol at 300°C without the presence of the catalyst was negligible, and then operational conditions were established to obtain methanol conversions lower than 10%. Then, the initial deactivation of the catalyst over 31h.

Irrigation treatments were based on the trees’ development stage: T1, irrigation supplying 100% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) in three production stages: fruit set stage (SI), fruit expansion stage (SII), and physiological maturation stage of the fruits (SIII); T2, 50% ETc in SI and 100% ETc in SII and SIII; T3, 100% ETc in SI and SIII and 50% ETc in SII; T4, 100% ETc in SI and SII, and 50% ETc in SIII; and T5, without irrigation in all three stages. Physiological data were measured once per stage. After harvesting the second cycle, roots were collected, following a completely randomized design, with five treatments and three replications, to determine the total root length density. Total or partial water deficit in ‘Tommy Atkins’ mango trees was identified by decreasing transpiration (E) and photosynthesis (A) and increasing leaf temperature (Tleaf). The total root length density is similar in all irrigation strategies up to 1 m horizontal distance and 0.10 m depth.

    "abstract": "Dehydrated cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are dried fruits known for their high antioxidant potential. Changes in their mechanical and rheological properties occur when cranberries are exposed to certain conditions, such as drying or immersion in a liquid medium (rehydration). To evaluate the rheological behavior of solid suspensions made from dehydrated cranberries, the effects of different temperatures and concentrations of dissolved solids were evaluated using a factorial experimental design (22) with three replications at the center point. Five models were used to investigate the suspensions' flow behavior: Ostwald de Waelle, Newton, Herschel-Bulkley, Casson, and Bingham. The rheometry of the suspensions showed that the fluids presented non-Newtonian behavior, with a satisfactory fit for the Casson model (R² &gt; 0.94) in all evaluated temperature and concentration ranges. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and solid concentration of cranberry suspensions on the rheological parameters of the fitted model, Casson's initial shear stress (K0c), and Casson's plastic viscosity (Kc) were evaluated. From the response and the contour surfaces, it was found that increasing the concentration of the suspension above 20% resulted in higher initial shear stress, which was influenced by temperature, whose increase resulted in a significant reduction in the shear stress at a concentration of 30%. The plastic viscosity (Kc) was highly influenced by the solid’s concentration, and higher temperatures caused a decrease in the value of this parameter. So, the highest value of plastic viscosity was found for concentrations above 20% and at lower temperatures. Therefore, considering the results and for practical purposes, it can be concluded that the flow of the suspensions is facilitated if rehydration is conducted at high temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Portfolio analysis is widely used by financial investors to find portfolios producing efficient results under various economic conditions. Markowitz started the portfolio optimization approach through mean-variance, whose objective is to minimize risk and maximize the return. This study is called Markowitz Mean-Variance Theory (MVP). An optimal portfolio has a good return and low risk, in addition to being well diversified. In this paper, we proposed a methodology for obtaining an optimal portfolio with the highest expected return and the lowest risk. This methodology uses Mixture Design of Experiments (MDE) as a strategy for building non-linear models of risk and return in portfolio optimization; computational replicas in MDE to capture dynamical evolution of series; Shannon entropy index to handle better portfolio diversification; and desirability function to optimize multiple variables, leading to the maximum expected return and lowest risk. To illustrate this proposal, some time series were simulated by ARMA-GARCH models. The result is compared to the efficient frontier generated by the traditional theory of Markowitz Mean-Variance (MVP). The results show that this methodology facilitates decision making, since the portfolio is obtained in the non-dominated region, in a unique combination. The advantage of using the proposed method is that the replicas improve the model precision.",

There is a lack of available technologies for collecting fruit in bulk cargo at any time from transport to industries. A limiting factor is the loading of fruits that are at the base of the cargo. This study was carried out to develop a detailed design of a bulk cargo fruit sampler that can collect fruits in any position of the x, y and z axes. A methodology was applied and adapted to execute the design. This methodology was divided into the following stages: design planning, informational design, conceptual design, preliminary design and detailed design. The variant considered the most appropriate was selected for the preliminary design and detailed design. The concepts were divided into chassis or support, sample collector and support for sample removal. The removal of fruits was carried out to maintain as much of their interaction with the environment outside the collector as possible. With the conclusion of the detailed design, it was possible to file, at the National Institute of Industrial Property, the patent for the collector of fruit samples in bulk cargo. Results obtained from fruits in the collector were used in doctoral theses.",

In the textile recycling industry, mostly petroleum-based synthetic fibers are used as carrier fibers. In an environmentally important activity such as recycling spinning, it is necessary to reduce the use of synthetics used as carrier fibers. When considered from this point of view, hemp fibers come to the fore with their important performance and environmental features. Based on this fact, in this study, in addition to the standard production conditions in the recycling yarn production facility, hemp fibers in different proportions were added to the blends to reduce the ratio of polyester as carrier fiber and the effects of this situation on yarn quality were examined. According to the results, it was observed that adding hemp fiber to the recycle yarn blend increased yarn tenacity, yarn unevenness and yarn hairiness while decreased yarn elongation properties.",

    "abstract": "Damage detection methods based on changing modal parameters have received considerable attention in engineering applications due to the satisfactory results and the low associated cost compared with other techniques. The Mode Shape Data Based Indicator (MSDBI) is a damage indicator available in the literature, being used to identify damage in beam structures from the mode shape, mode shape slope and mode shape curvature, in the undamaged and damaged configurations of the element under study. However, in some situations, the configuration of the displacement mode shape of the ith mode, of the undamaged structure compared to the damaged one, presents mirroring. The damage identification algorithm could be a better indicator when these situations occur. Them, this paper presents a proposal to modify this method, called MSDBIM. The proposed modified method (MSDBIM) and the traditional method (MSDBI) were applied in two numerical examples that were elaborated in commercial software of finite elements, namely a simply supported concrete beam and a fixed-end steel beam in different single and multiple damage scenarios with sensitivity studies. A new discretization for the fixed-end beam was performed to assess whether there is a direct influence on the damage identification method. The results show that the proposed method (MSDBIM) performs better than the traditional method (MSDBI).",

Based on structuring of the GIS, spatial analyzes of location and distribution of fish farms were carried out in relation to highway network; to drainage; to microregions of Rondônia and the verification of the density. Methodological procedure consisted of modeling the Database (DB), whose information was obtained from Secretaria do Estado de Rondônia para Desenvolvimento Ambiental (SEDAM/RO), which holds the references of licensed fish farms processed in SPRING and ARCGIS 9 Arcmap 9.3 software. For spatial statistics, the Kernel density estimator was applied. The main result is the fact that GIS made it quick and easy to search for data and information about the fish farms studied. The highest density was 4937.64 fish farms per unit area in Ji-Paraná microregion, which is located in the Central region of Rondônia state. In thematic mapping, the fish farms showed some spatial dependencies, as follows: I – They depend on main access, highway BR 364. II – The cluster of fish farms is arranged where there is greater availability of water, that is, they depend on water courses. Therefore, positioning and distribution of fish farms take place in the three main microregions, Ji-Paraná 40.30% of licensed fish farms, followed by microregions of Cacoal 16.02% and Ariquemes 15.87%.",

This research presents protocols for ecological soap production from the determination of the saponification index (SI) using the principles of Green Chemistry. The chemical greenness of the produced soap was assessed using mass and holistic metrics. The SI measurement ensured a final product without residues, aligning with the principles of Green Chemistry: principle 1 (waste prevention) with a Factor E of 0 and an Atomic Economy of 100%. Additionally, the Green Matrix and Green Star analyses demonstrated a more sustainable experimental approach for bar soap production, with 45% higher greenness compared to traditional soap and 95% greenness for ash soap. The changes in the saponification process by the principles of green chemistry allowed ecological soap production without residues, an innocuous product to health and the environment. The methodology proposed in this research can contribute to minimizing an environmental problem related to the incorrect disposal of non-biodegradable oil.",

Therefore, if carryover effects are present in the model, inferences about the treatments effects become difficult. Furthermore, repeated measures of the response variable can be taken over time in the same experimental unit; however, these measures may be correlated. In this way, we aimed to analyze a 2 x 2 crossover design with repeated measures within the treatment period, using a Bayesian approach. A simulation study was performed to evaluate the performance. The posterior estimates of the model parameters were obtained under non-informative prior distributions and the normal likelihood function. The model performed well with a sample size of 20 subjects, showing even better results with samples of 100 subjects. With larger samples, exact tests for the differences in carryover effects and time effects were obtained. However, the test of time effect proved to be powerful even with small samples. In turn, considering carryover effects different from zero did not influence the estimates of treatment differences, although biased estimates of the period effect were obtained.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence of good performance against large magnitude earthquakes, of the buildings built with the I-464 system in Armenia and Chile. This is a system made up of prefabricated panels and slabs, which are joined through wet joints; rigid at the level of the superstructure and articulated in a continuous foundation of cast-in-situ reinforced concrete. However, the possibility of the appearance of potential seismic damage in buildings built in Santiago of Cuba is not ruled out, due to the state of deterioration of the elements and joints, as well as the structural transformations carried out by the residents. That is why this research is designed as a purpose, to analyze the seismic behavior in relation to the structural joints. To meet this objective, 16 hypothetical variants are evaluated, which are prepared based on the statistical analysis of the diagnosis made to a sample of 200 buildings, as well as 4 variants that correspond to the original typologies. Multi-mass models are used for the dynamic analysis by SAP 2000 v20, where the joints between the precast elements were not explicitly modeled and were assumed to be rigid. The calculation requests in the joints were obtained through 442 ‘section cuts’ in each of the five-level variants and 367 ‘section cuts’ in the four-level variants. Then, both the resistance of the concrete to shearing and the resistance of the weld seams that join the protruding steel bars are evaluated, as well as checking the possibility of creep of these bars. It is concluded that only in the 5-level variants, where pathological damage is contemplated, there is a danger of failure of horizontal joints because the steel can reach the design stress and flow. Likewise, vertical joints can fail due to shear and due to the creep of the steel.",

Experimental methods for predicting the turbomachinery performance involve greater time consumption and financial resources compared to the CFD approach. For the centrifugal pump the impeller is the main component, as it transfers energy to the fluid. The pump flow rate and the total head are directly associated with the impeller rotation speed. The purpose of this paper is to present the analysis and comparison of numerical simulation results using Computational Fluid Dynamics of a centrifugal pump impeller under three different rotation speeds: 3500 rpm (nominal), 3100 rpm and 2700 rpm. The software used was ANSYS-CFX®, the turbulence model adopted was the Shear Stress Transport (SST). Eight operating points were simulated for each rotation. The simulation provided the characteristic curves, pressure distribution, and total and static pressure at the inlet and the outlet of the impeller. The degree of reaction was calculated. The results were compared by application of affinity laws, and showed agreement with them. The results also showed that the degree of reaction increased with increasing flow rate, and it was coherent with the backward curved blade impeller. The simulations show that the energy portions that make up the total energy transferred by the impeller agree with the affinity laws.",

Adulteration concentrations were 10, 30, 50, 60, and 80% for analysis by NIR and 10, 30, 50, 60, 70, and 90% for FTIR.

Anomalous samples were identified in discrimination models obtained with a portable NIR spectrometer in the outlier detection step. The methodology evaluated is direct, fast, and non-destructive, in which the PLS-DA models obtained from the sets of spectra by FTIR presented superior results than those evaluated with the portable NIR spectrometer; however, the latter was also efficient in discriminating as adulterated, reinforcing the feasibility of using spectroscopic techniques and chemometric tools.",

Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) analyses were performed non-invasively using three-dimensional image reconstruction to evaluate new bone formation; in addition, conventional histological analysis was used. The µ-CT results showed that Bio-Oss resulted in higher volume, density and bone percentage than the other materials. Based on the three-dimensional reconstructed images, the lowest resorption rates were observed in the Bio-Oss group, and the materials remained in larger quantities inside the defect at thirty days. In the synthetic hydroxyapatite group, intense resorption of the material and slight bone formation on the defect margins were noted, yielding an irregular edge. The mineralized bovine tendon group showed discrete new bone formation, and the material was fully resorbed. The Bio-Oss and synthetic hydroxyapatite groups yielded similar amounts of blood vessels and osteoblastic cells, and these were higher than the amounts found in the mineralized bovine tendon group. Synthetic hydroxyapatite was present within the defect and exhibited osteoconductive properties that were similar to the commercial brand, Bio-Oss. Mineralized bovine tendon did not exhibit good osteoconductivity and is contraindicated for maintaining bone space. Moreover, µ-CT yielded lower specificity; that is, µ-CT was not able to distinguish bone tissue from Bio-Oss, although it exhibited high sensitivity. Based on these results, it appears that synthetic hydroxyapatite has great potential for use in filling bone defects, unlike mineralized bovine tendon",

Therefore, improving its efficiency has the potential to reduce electricity consumption and emission of polluting gases. The objective of the present study was to assess an office lighting system retrofit of an existing building from the 1990s, verify the light levels in relation to standards of the Brazilian requirements, and to explore new systems with potential for luminous and energy improvement. The analyzes were carried out through computer simulations using the DIALux evo software, which allows the evaluation of artificial and natural illuminations simultaneously. The results indicated that the existing lighting system does not meet the average illuminance standard value for office environment. From simulations with new arrangements and types of luminaires and lamps, two more efficient lighting systems were designed. The first presented savings of 15.5% in lighting energy when replacing T12 fluorescent lamps with LED luminaires. The second system considered the use of natural light and was complemented by artificial lighting with the aid of a dimming system linked to the availability of daylight, and presented up to 67% less electric energy consumption when compared to the existing lighting system in the environments. Therefore, it was possible to propose actions to the existing lighting system retrofit and, thus, offer better visual comfort to users and at the same time save energy.",

The aim of this work was to evaluate consumers' perception of the differences between yogurt and fermented whey beverage using word association and check-all-that-apply (Cata). Untrained assessors (n = 100) evaluated samples of three commercial brands of liquid or stirred yogurt and whey beverage, of strawberry flavor. Chemical and physical parameters (pH, acidity, total solids, color, texture and syneresis) were determined to assist in the interpretation of the results. The study showed that physical and chemical characteristics were inherent to each product, with no homogeneity within each category. The texture was the parameter that most influenced consumer responses. Yogurt is not necessarily always more viscous than fermented whey beverages. In addition, sensory acceptability was not linked to the product category, pointing to the importance of the individual characteristics. Word association and Cata were able to access the main differences between both products and brought important qualitative and quantitative information regarding consumers’ opinions. This study contributed to demystifying the perception that fermented whey beverages have attributes considered inferior, such as lower viscosity and greater syneresis when compared to yogurts. It was found that there is a demand for information about yogurt and fermented whey beverages, which can influence consumers' opinions at the time of purchase.",

The analysis of a factual remediation operation in an industrial site in the city of Resende, Rio de Janeiro state, show that traditional site investigation techniques are still being applied as main tools of characterization, data collection and decision-making in the management of the area. The site has had its investigation start in the late 90’s through multiple soil sampling and monitoring wells installation, pointing DNAPLs (dense non-aqueous phase liquids) among the chemicals of interest. The industrial site has undergone remediation for over 10 years now and has not been closed yet. More recently, the efficiency reduction of the primary remediation system, a dual-phase extraction system with over 50 installed wells, led to the implementation of in-situ stimulated bioremediation. Performance reports show lower efficiency than expected, hinting that a lackluster CSM (conceptual site model) might be leading to poor decision making. Despite being adequate remediation techniques, previous efforts and literature indicate that the site must undergo new investigation steps employing high-resolution site characterization (HRSC) techniques such as the MIP (membrane interface probe), allowing the refinement of the current CSM and the optimization of current remediation efforts.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the toponyms of the public squares of the city of Maringa PR Brazil, based on a historical research from primary sources. Toponymy sought the non- linguistic historical significance for the names of the squares, which totaled ninety-nine on January 2000, contextualizing them within the period these public places were given their names. It has been observed that names did not mean much to the population, since, in most cases, the community did not even know who was the person concerned whose name had been given to the public space. Denomination of public squares in Maringa squares should not merely be an unknown item in the municipal archives, but a consciousness endeavor work to perpetuate the public person honored in a public space.",

The methodology proposed has as base a Model presented by Soares (2001, p. 66), with necessary modifications to fit to the company under study. The data were analyzed by X and AM Control Graphs in several parts of the transformer. Many improvement plans resulted from the analysis and some of them in the statistics control. After achieving statistics control of the process, control limits were established and they will allow to monitor those processes from now on, as well as to calculate their capacity rates.

The global heat transfer coefficient (U) was evaluated fitting an unidimensional pseudo-homogeneous model to the fixed bed measured temperatures. Results show that both the techniques of adjustment and the model used are adequate. The analysis of the global heat transfer coefficient indicates that this parameter varies linearlly with water flow rate, but does not influence significantly the diameter at the range of experimental conditions explored. U as a function of water flow rate ( ) could be represented by the following linear equation: U = 232645 +1182.2 (R2 = 0.99).

There were control tanks without mechanical aeration. In the nocturnal tanks, the aeration was provided daily from 22:00 h up to 06:00 h. The diurnal tanks were provided with aeration daily from 10:00 h up to 18:00 h. In the nocturnal and diurnal tanks, the culture water was aerated from 10:00 h up to 06:00 h. The concentration of NH3 was significantly lower in the diurnal aerated, and nocturnal + diurnal aerated tanks when compared to the non-aerated tanks. The best water quality management to attain simultaneously high DO2 and low NH3 concentration was the nocturnal + diurnal aeration of water. The nocturnal + diurnal aeration of water has not shown any clear advantage on fish growth performance after 10 weeks when compared to the nocturnal aeration of water. It was concluded that the nocturnal + diurnal aeration of water is a water quality management superior to the nocturnal aeration because it achieves a better water quality",

    "abstract": "Structural optimization has received increasing attention in several different areas of engineering and has been identified as the most challenging and economically rewarding task in the field of structural design. In this context, the current paper proposes a methodology based on Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) that corresponds to an evolutionary procedure applied for topological optimization in which the finite elements with the lowest stress levels are progressively removed from a structure. The optimization studies are applied for structures subjected to a transient dynamic response where different damping ratios are applied in the physical models, since its determination is extremely hard and can even change the structural stiffness in case of elastoplastic regime. Thus, a nonlinear behavior is considered to evaluate the effects for each damping ratio, and elastoplasticity theory for small strains is extended for a von Mises material with linear, isotropic work-hardening. For this purpose it is possible to evaluate a combination of different optimal topologies for the different damping ratios through an algorithm developed in the Python programming language. The stress levels present such a difference for each linear and nonlinear response, which characterizes a marked change in the structural stiffness of each analyzed model.",

Then, measurements of water surface displacements using the two-fixed probe method and considering the presence of submerged rectangular obstacles provided reflection coefficients for different wave parameters and submergence conditions. Dimensional analysis was conducted and a dimensionless relationship was obtained to describe the reflection coefficient as a function of the wave slope and the water-to-shelf depth ratio.

The bamboo splints are prepared from the stems of the Bambusa vulgaris species and are reinforced in the nodal regions. To examine the strength of adhesion between the bamboo splint and concrete, pull out tests are performed for the specimens. The results of the pullout tests of the test samples show the strengthening of the nodes leading to an increase in the normal tension and rupture of the splint instead of its slip. According to the results of the bending beams, the presence of bamboo splints increases their load capacity when compared with the reference beams. This fact indicates a reduction in the amount of steel required as the structural element. Strengthening the nodes of the bamboo splints provides better performance in terms of deflection and also leads to a slight increase in the beams load capacity. It is worth mentioning that the beams additionally reinforced with bamboo splints reinforced in the nodal region present the same cracking pattern as that of reference beams.",

For the Pb-2.5% Sb alloy thin slabs were obtained in cooled mold without reduction and with 10 and 20 mm reductions. It was found that the degree of deformation applied tends to increase the equiaxed region by the breakage of the dendrites as well as the possibility of the formation of equiaxed dendritic structures.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an OI measurement instrument that has sound psychometric properties and recognize a key feature on the field.

The problem arises when a group of agents with incomplete information needs to reach consensus on the decision.

Each formula receives votes indicating either support or rejection. When a formula receives more supporting votes than rejection ones, that is, it is accepted by the majority, it becomes common knowledge. In this case, there is a consensus about that information, which influences the strength of the argument comprising the formula. The framework for decision-making permits to analyze the arguments related to every decision alternative and rank them based on the strength of the arguments. This framework is an alternative for existing ones based on preferences expressed by numerical values, allowing agents to explain the rationale behind the decisions.",

This water has no commercial value and requires treatment, due to potential contaminants in its composition, in order to be destined for disposal or reinjection during recovery methods. In this way, the produced water management needs specific process support it, becoming costly. Therefore, the present work proposes a continuous monitoring methodology of the water-oil ratio, aiming to subsidize the field viability analyses. Once that the water-oil ratio data are auto-correlated, some adjustments are needed before the application of the control charts. Therefore, ARIMA models were adjusted to the data, evaluating the accuracy of the models, then, the control charts were built based on the residues.

In general, continuous response variables occur frequently in these situations and tend to present asymmetric characteristics, as well as being restricted to the set of positive real numbers. Therefore, using the normal model would be incorrect. In this conjecture, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are used to analyze data characterized in this way, aiming to accommodate inter- and intra-individual variations. Thus, we propose a mixed gamma model (LGMM) with a log link function and random effects normally distributed to evaluate data from a longitudinal experiment, where the effects of cerebral ischemia associated with diabetes on the performance of long-term retrograde memory were evaluated in rats. Based on the results obtained, the random intercept model presented a good fit and accommodated the correlation inherent to the data. It was possible to observe that normoglycemic animals, when compared to hyperglycemic animals, whether submitted to ischemia or not, had their cognitive capacity partially preserved, indicating that hyperglycemia (‘diabetes’) aggravates the cognitive effects of brain ischemia.",

In human beings, the emission of sounds allows an even more specialized communication, because it possibly render a wide exchange of ideas and knowledge. The most important process related to voice emission is the movement of vocal folds. Therefore, their proper functioning is essential for the emission of sounds. Vocal folds possess a muscular tissue, and are located inside the larynx. When air passes through them, they vibrate, thus emitting the sound by which we communicate. The vocal folds are elastic fibers that distend or relax under the action of the larynx muscles, thus modulating and modifying the sound as we speak or sing, for example. This complex process is modeled by a system of differential equations. In this paper, we present a study about asymmetric vocal folds, where a difference in their stiffness is considered. The objective of this study is to synchronize the movement of vocal folds caused by that asymmetry through the optimal linear control method, showing their functioning for different values of stiffness for each vocal fold. In this way, the control design has shown to be efficient, producing a good functioning of the vocal folds and rendering the emission of sound possible even in diseased vocal folds.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze the flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) welding parameters and microhardness levels on surface quality of 410 NiMo martensitic stainless-steel coatings. The parameters of the FCAW process applied to the coating, included pulsation frequency, voltage, welding speed, average current and contact tip to work distance. The welding was carried out by the pulsed tubular wire process with pulsed current, constant voltage, Ar+2% O2 shielding gas and short-circuit metal transfer for the deposition of EC410 NiMo Martensitic Steel Deposits alloy coatings on a SAE 1020 steel substrate. For the statistical analysis, the Taguchi experimental planning was applied to test the influence of the parameters of the FCAW process (average current, CTWD, pulsation current and welding speed) on the coating properties. The best configuration with respect to the increased microhardness of the fusion zone in the coating welding process is: Average Current 200 A; CTWD 40 mm; Pulsation Frequency 26.31 Hz and Welding Speed 300 mm min.-1. The lowest microhardness of the melting zone in the coating welding process is: Average Current 170 A; CTWD 30 mm; Pulsation Frequency 23.26 Hz and Welding Speed 400 mm min.-1.",

    "abstract": "There is a large interest on random number generation for its importance in several areas as statistics, simulation, optimization by mean of heuristic process, etc. This paper in particular was developed based on a research where it was necessary to produce random points in a cube of Rn. The initial idea to produce a random point was to generate n random real numbers x1, x2, ..., xn uniformly distributed in the [-L/2, L/2] interval, where L is the measure of the edges, and to build the point X = (x1, x2, ..., xn). However, it was noticed that most of the points produced on this manner were too near to the frontier of cube, what was not of interest to the research. This paper aims to show the reasons why this problem occurs and to present a single algorithm to solve it. Several sequences of 4000 points each in cubes of Rn were generated utilizing this algorithm, for different values of n. The analysis of data showed that the algorithm had a good performance, generating well distributed points in these regions.",

    "abstract": "With a great potential yet to be explored in Brazil, the grid-connected photovoltaic system, besides supplying the active power, can also contribute to improve the voltage level grid providing reactive power. Therefore, this work proposes to use a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System (GCPVS) equipped with a control that uses the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) to balance the injection of the active and reactive powers, thus softening the short-duration voltage variation, more specifically the momentary voltage dip. For this purpose, the GCPVS was connected in part of a real distribution grid that attend the block 1106 South of Palmas city, state of Tocantins, northern region of Brazil. It is shown that the active and reactive power delivered to the grid can be controlled to help the power quality of the main grid during a disturbance. During a short-circuit situation, the active power is reduced, freeing up space from the inverter capacity for maximum supply of reactive power, in this way, helping the main grid to return to an adequate voltage level. The simulation results show that such voltage profile improvement is possible. Therefore, they confirm that photovoltaic systems, even though considered small, can also provide ancillary services to the low voltage distribution grid during abnormal conditions, adding to the actions normally performed by conventional power plants",

The mathematical model studied refers to the two-dimensional laminar flow of an isothermal time-dependent incompressible fluid modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, with , solved iteratively with the projection method and the Finite Volume Method. The extrapolation methods used were: Aitken, Empiric, Mitin, scalar Epsilon, scalar Rho, topological Epsilon, and topological Rho. A two-step application was performed: first, extrapolators methods were applied individually after the use of the multigrid method. Then, the best-performing extrapolation techniques were used in the second step, where they were applied between the cycles of the multigrid method. The methods that presented the best convergence properties in the first stage were topological and scalar Epsilon. In the second stage, both methods maintained their performance, however, the topological Epsilon method presented more significant convergence rates than the scalar Epsilon. The other parameters analyzed were: the storage memory peak, the dimensionless norm of the residual based on the initial estimate, and the error norms of iteration. Thus, it was possible to state which extrapolation technique performed best and to compare it with the multigrid method with no extrapolation, which in this study was the topological Epsilon method.",

The data used consisted of measurements collected from HIV male subjects aged 26 to 69 years, with body mass index (BMI) values between 15.47 and 36.98 kg m-2 and the fat mass values between 1.00 kg and 16.70 kg. The bivariate linear regression analyses showed that weight, waist-hip ratio, BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and HIV viral load value were significant risk factors associated with the body fat mass in male HIV patients. Furthermore, an in-depth non-linear analysis has been performed using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict fat mass by using the significant predictors as input. ANN model with four hidden neurons obtained the highest mean predictive accuracy percentage of 85.26%. The finding of this study is able to help with the evaluation of the fat mass in the male HIV patients that consequently reflects the patients metabolic-related irregularity and immune response. It is also believed that the outcome from the analysis can help future HIV-related study on the prediction of body fat mass in male HIV patients especially in settings where dual energy X-ray absorptiometry assessments, the standard measurement method for fat mass are not available or affordable",

OPVW is a cost-effective technology with reduced environmental impact, suitable for application in a multi-story office building due to its potential to adapt to different architectural configurations, lightness and transparency, etc. In an earlier study developed by the authors, an experiment was conducted with a generic office room scale model. Three window materials were compared under real sky conditions (overcast and clear): 3 mm single glass (A scenarios); single glass with OPV (B scenarios); and single glass with application of solar control film (C scenarios). In the present study the same parameters from the experiment were used as input for simulations on Radiance, whose results were compared to previous (work plane illuminance, Daylight Factor and model interior photographs). We found similarities between them. Thus, further results were produced: isolux curves, Daylight Glare Index and render images. The rendered images show a brighter view at A scenarios, and at B and C scenarios. Even if average illuminance is reduced, a better daylight distribution and a reduction in glare are achieved. DGI indicates perceptible glare for some of A scenarios. On the other hand, at most of B and C scenarios, glare was below the perceptible range. Furthermore, the scenarios with OPVW (B scenarios) still show one more advantage: the energy production for artificial lighting when illuminance values are not sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the causal relationships between observable and unobservable variables. Among the assumptions considered, but not essential, for the application of the SEM are the presence of multivariate normality between the data, and the need for a large number of observations, in order to obtain the variances and covariances between the variables. It is not always possible to have access to a sufficiently large number of observations to enable the calculation of parameters, and the convergence of the iterative algorithm is one of the problems in obtaining the results. This work investigates the convergence of iterative algorithms, which minimize the variation of parameters, through a stipulated convergence rate, using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimation methods on structural equation models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and regression models. Convergences were evaluated in relation to the number of observations, in order to obtain a minimum quantity sufficient for a convergence rate above 50%. The calculations were performed in the statistical environment R® version 3.4.4, and the results obtained showed a convergence rate above 50% for models estimated by GLS, even with the data showing lack of multivariate normality, kurtosis and accentuated asymmetry. Thus, it was possible to define a minimum number of observations necessary for an adequate convergence of the iterative algorithms in obtaining the necessary parameters.",

    "abstract": "The School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP) is widely discussed in the operations research literature and can be solved by several exact methods and heuristics. This problem seeks to designate the most efficient routes for a fleet of school buses, minimizing the total distance covered and considering variables such as bus stop locations, number of passengers, and the assigned destination for each of them. This study aims at solving a real case SBRP of a small-sized county located in the state of Paraná. The proposed method is based on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) combined with a heuristic correction that guarantees sequence constraints, in which the student has to be collected before visiting their destination school. It was possible to obtain two routes of 30.76 km and 17.42 km respectively and both with the total vehicles’ capacity of 24 students, which corresponds to the reduction of about 10% in the daily distance covered by two buses.",

The experimental design involved testing three injection angles: 26°, 28°, and 30°; and four biodiesel blends: B0, B8, B15, and B20. The effects of variations in these factors were evaluated in terms of the maximum power, rotation at maximum power, torque at maximum power, maximum torque, rotation at maximum torque, specific fuel consumption, engine elasticity index, torque reserve, and rotation reserve. The engine fueled with the biodiesel blends showed a lower specific consumption without losing power or torque, when the crank angle of the injector pump was changed from its original configuration of 26° to 28°.",

One of these limitations is the fact that the thermal effects derived from component manufacturing processes are normally disregarded in the analysis. Thus, the main goal of this study is to evaluate strains near the weld beads of a geometric model for a truck tow hook using numerical simulations by finite element method, considering thermal loads applied before the field loading. To validate the simulation results, an experiment was performed using a tow hook found in a commercial truck. Strain gauge rosettes were placed on the body base plate, and a load of 181.050 N was applied to the hook. This loading was the result of a commercial truck being pulled on level terrain, simulating a normal operation condition of the tow hook. The Von Mises stress found in simulations was approximately 302.23 MPa at the same position where the strain gauges were glued, when the load was applied. The difference between the simulated and experimental values of the equivalent specific strains in the area of the weld beads was 19.2%, and the difference between the permanent displacement values, resulting from plastic strain, in the X-direction was 0.1%. These results justify conducting new studies involving numerical simulations and considering thermal effects on static and dynamic loads in the automotive industry.",

Moreover, a new cost algorithmic structure was developed and the economically recoverable water amount was determined by applying calculation tool developed to make detailed analyzes systematically and accurately. The most important advantage of this study is the development of an economic analysis model and algorithmic structure for basic reduction methods according to field data.

PVC patterns are very hard to be recognized since their waveforms can be confused with other heartbeats, such as Right and Left Bundle Branch Blocks. This work proposes a new approach for PVC recognition, based on Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm and AMUSE (Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signal Extraction), which is a method for the blind source separation problem. This approach provides a set of attributes that are combined by Linear Discriminant Analysis, allowing the training of an ensemble learning. The Analytic Hierarchy Process weights each learned model according to its importance, obtained from the performance metrics. This approach has some advantages over baseline methods since it does not use a pre-processing stage and employs a simple machine learning model trained using only two parameters for each feature. Using a standard dataset for training and test phases, the proposed approach achieves 98.75% accuracy, 90.65% sensitivity, and 99.46% specificity. The best performance was 99.57% accuracy, 98.64% sensitivity, and 99.65% specificity for other datasets. In general, the proposed approach is better than 66% of the state-of-the-art methods concerning accuracy",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 7190 (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas [ABNT], 1997) recommends adopting the mean value of the modulus of elasticity to compression in the direction parallel to the grain (Ec0,m) in the calculation of displacements. The values of wood stiffness vary considerably, and they can generate displacements above the limit (L 200-1, where L is the span) established by the referred standard, which contributes to the appearance of pathologies in the structure. To evaluate the influence of the adoption of Ec0,m in the calculation of displacements, mechanical properties of wood species were obtained experimentally. With the aid of numerical models and experimental values, ten types of trusses were analyzed (Porch, Inclined Chord, Top Inclined Chord, Parallel Chord, Bowstring, Fink, Howe, K Truss, Pratt, Scissor), three spans (5, 10, and 20 m) and two species (Hymenolobium petraum Ducke e Hymenolobium sp). Initially, adopting Ec0,m for all members and performing a linear analysis, the maximum loads for the displacement L 200-1 were determined. Subsequently, experimental stiffness values were randomly assigned to each bar, and the maximum displacements were determined through nonlinear geometric analyses. Based on 1260 numerical simulations, deflections of approximately 17% (span of 5 m), 30% (span of 10 m), and 34% (span of 20 m) were observed to be higher than the result considering Ec0,m. This problem can be overcome by using non-destructive methods in the pre-classification of the structure bars, positioning the elements rationally in the regions of the highest demand.",

Given the above, the present study aims verify which is the curve that best adjusts to the mass loss during the dehydration process through the proposition of Boltzmann nonlinear regression model in face of classical dehydration curve models, as well measure in frozen flowers centesimal composition of Viola × wittrockiana flowers.

For these reasons, it is necessary to evaluate the lifetime of forage plants under water stress conditions. The design used was a factorial scheme, consisting of two types of grasses, and five levels of water replacement, with ten replications. During the experimental period, grasses were evaluated daily, with more than 70% of leaf area in senescence being considered a dead plant the one with more than 70% of leaf area in senescence. Urochloa mosambicensis lifetime was of 61 days for grasses that were not irrigated, 131 and 195 days for those that received 25% and 50% of field capacity, and greater than 240 days for those that were irrigated with 75 and 100% of field capacity.

Four different configurations were evaluated, including impulse and reaction turbines at two steam pressure/temperature levels (43 bar / 450 °C and 68 bar / 520 °C).

The technical analysis pointed out the reaction turbine at 68 bar / 520 ºC as the best alternative, leading to the highest overall efficiency. In addition, this plant configuration showed economic advantages represented by an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 21%, a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 10.93 million, and a payback time of 6 years, enabling a reduction on the industrial cost with energy in the slaughterhouse to 19 US$/ton of product (-30% in comparison to the base case). Finally, the calculated LCOE of 73 US$/MWh was lower than the current price of the electricity in the market, indicating potential economic feasibility of the proposed concept.",

    "abstract": "Blood glucose is conventionally determined by the level of sugar present in our blood. Lesser known to the public that antioxidants in our body are also said to influence the level of blood glucose. Glutathione (GSH) as the main antioxidant parameter in our body helps in reducing the production of oxidative stress caused by a high blood glucose level. Particularly in women, high antioxidant activities are reported due to the presence of oestrogen hormone. However, in Malaysia limited study was done on the significance of GSH in influencing the blood glucose level. Thus, this study focuses on finding the significance of GSH and some other health predictors in affecting the blood glucose level of women volunteers. This study was carried out on 118 Malaysian women volunteers and blood samples were collected for GSH analysis and blood glucose. All data were trained and tested for the development of prediction models in classifying the blood glucose into normal and abnormal levels. The model construction is using three different classifiers: namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour classifier and decision tree. Five predictors that were used are GSH, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and groups (oral supplementation dosage). Results showed all predictors are significantly correlated with the blood glucose level at p &lt; 0.10. The model with a combination of GSH, BMI, WHR, weight and supplementation dosage (groups) as predictors gave the best performance. The k-nearest neighbour classifier model displays the best accuracy (84.7%) in predicting the normal and abnormal level of blood glucose. This finding shows that by altering the amount of GSH via oral supplementation and other significant predictors in women, there are chances to modify the blood glucose level from abnormal to normal",

    "abstract": "Water is an essential natural resource that is being impacted by climate change. Thus, knowledge of future water availability conditions around the globe becomes necessary. Based on that, this study aimed to simulate future climate scenarios and evaluate the impact on water balance in southern Brazil. Daily data of rainfall and air temperature (maximum and minimum) were used. The meteorological data were collected in 28 locations over 30 years (1980-2009). For the data simulation, we used the climate data stochastic generator PGECLIMA_R. It was considered two scenarios of the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a scenario with the historical data trend. The water balance estimates were performed for the current data and the simulated data, through the methodology of Thornthwaite and Mather (1955). The moisture indexes were spatialized by the kriging method. These indexes were chosen as the parameters to represent the water conditions in different situations. The region assessed presented a high variability in water availability among locations; however, it did not present high water deficiency values, even with climate change. Overall, it was observed a reduction of moisture index in most sites and in all scenarios assessed, especially in the northern region when compared to the other regions. The second scenario of the IPCC (the worst situation) promoting higher reductions and dry conditions for the 2099 year. The impacts of climate change on water availability, identified in this study, can affect the general society, therefore, they must be considered in the planning and management of water resources, especially in the regional context",

    "abstract": "Medicine and engineering sciences have been working in close contact for common purposes. Machine learning algorithms are used in the medical field for early diagnosis prediction. The major aim of this study is to evaluate machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms using computed tomography scan (CT-scan) images for automated detection of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We obtained seven hundred and fifty-seven (757) CT-scan images from a public platform. We applied four automated traditional classification methods to predict COVID-19 using deep learning and machine learning. These algorithms are SVM, AdaBoost, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3. Comparative analyses are presented among the four models by considering metric performance factors to find the best model. The results show that the InceptionV3 model achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa, F1- score, root mean squared error (RMSE), and receiver operating characteristic- area under the curve (ROC-AUC), in comparison with the other Covid-19 classifiers. Accordingly, the InceptionV3 approach is recommended for the automatic diagnosis of Covid-19 and assessments. This research can present a second point of view to medical experts and it can save time for researchers as the performance of standard machine learning methods in detecting COVID-19 is evaluated.",
