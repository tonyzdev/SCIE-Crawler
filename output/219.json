    "abstract": "This article describes a novel method of achieving load balancing in telecommunications networks. A simulated network models a typical distribution of calls between nodes; nodes carrying an excess of traffic can become congested, causing calls to be lost. In addition to calls, the network also supports a population of simple mobile agents with behaviors modeled on the trail-laying abilities of ants. The ants move across the network between randomly chosen pairs of nodes; as they move, they deposit simulated pheromone as a function of their distance from their source node and the congestion encountered on their journey. They select their path at each intermediate node according to the distribution of simulated pheromone at each node. Calls between nodes are routed as a function of the pheromone distributions at each intermediate node. The performance of the network is measured by the proportion of calls that are lost. The results of using ant-based control (ABC) are compared with those achieved by using fixed shortest-path routes, and also those achieved by using an alternative algorithmically based type of mobile agent previously proposed for use in network management. The ABC system is shown to result in fewer call failures than the other methods, while exhibiting many attractive features of distributed control.",

    "abstract": "Notions of embodiment, situatedness, and dynamics are increasingly being debated in cognitive sci ence. However, these debates are often carried out in the absence of concrete examples. In order to build intuition, this paper explores a model agent to illustrate how the perspective and tools of dynam ical systems theory can be applied to the analysis of situated, embodied agents capable of minimally cognitive behavior. Specifically, we study a model agent whose “nervous system” was evolved using a genetic algorithm to catch circular objects and to avoid diamond-shaped ones. After characterizing the performance, behavioral strategy and psychophysics of the best-evolved agent, its dynamics are analyzed in some detail at three different levels: (1) the entire coupled brain/body/environment sys tem; (2) the interaction between agent and environment that generates the observed coupled dynam ics; (3) the underlying neuronal properties responsible for the agent dynamics. This analysis offers both explanatory insight and testable predictions. The paper concludes with discussions of the overall picture that emerges from this analysis, the challenges this picture poses to traditional notions of rep resentation, and the utility of a research methodology involving the analysis of simpler idealized mod els of complete brain/body/environment systems.",

Unfortunately, designing controllers with these properties is a very difficult task. In this article, we demonstrate that continuous-time recurrent neural networks are a viable mechanism for adaptive agent control and that the genetic algorithm can be used to evolve effective neural controllers. A significant advantage of this approach is that one need specify only a measure of an agent's overall performance rather than the precise motor output trajectories by which it is achieved. By manipulating the performance evaluation, one can place selective pressure on the development of controllers with desired properties. Several novel controllers have been evolved, including a chemotaxis controller that switches between different strategies depending on environmental conditions, and a locomotion controller that takes advantage of sensory feedback if available but that can operate in its absence if necessary.",

    "abstract": "The concept of agency is of crucial importance in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and it is often used as an intuitive and rather uncontroversial term, in contrast to more abstract and theoretically heavily weighted terms such as intentionality , rationality, or mind. However, most of the available definitions of agency are too loose or unspecific to allow for a progressive scientific research program. They implicitly and unproblematically assume the features that characterize agents, thus obscuring the full potential and challenge of modeling agency. We identify three conditions that a system must meet in order to be considered as a genuine agent: (a) a system must define its own individuality, (b) it must be the active source of activity in its environment ( interactional asymmetry), and (c) it must regulate this activity in relation to certain norms ( normativity). We find that even minimal forms of proto-cellular systems can already provide a paradigmatic example of genuine agency. By abstracting away some specific details of minimal models of living agency we define the kind of organization that is capable of meeting the required conditions for agency (which is not restricted to living organisms). On this basis, we define agency as an autonomous organization that adaptively regulates its coupling with its environment and contributes to sustaining itself as a consequence. We find that spatiality and temporality are the two fundamental domains in which agency spans at different scales. We conclude by giving an outlook for the road that lies ahead in the pursuit of understanding, modeling, and synthesizing agents.",

    "abstract": "Several researchers have demonstrated how complex action sequences can be learned through neuroevolution (i.e., evolving neural networks with genetic algorithms). However, complex general behavior such as evading predators or avoiding obstacles, which is not tied to specific environments, turns out to be very difficult to evolve. Often the system discovers mechanical strategies, such as moving back and forth, that help the agent cope but are not very effective, do not appear believable, and do not generalize to new environments. The problem is that a general strategy is too difficult for the evolution system to discover directly. This article proposes an approach wherein such complex general behavior is learned incrementally, by starting with simpler behavior and gradually making the task more challenging and general. The task transitions are implemented through successive stages of Delta coding (i.e., evolving modifications), which allows even converged populations to adapt to the new task. The method is tested in the stochastic, dynamic task of prey capture and is compared with direct evolution. The incremental approach evolves more effective and more general behavior and should also scale up to harder tasks.",

Our focus is the problems of developing sensorimotor control systems for mobile robots, but we also discuss the applicability of our approach to the study of biological systems. We argue that, for agents required to exhibit sophisticated interactions with their environments, complex sensorimotor processing is necessary, and the design, by hand, of control systems capable of such processing is likely to become prohibitively difficult as complexity increases. We propose an automatic design process involving artificial evolution, wherein the basic building blocks used for evolving cognitive architectures are noise-tolerant dynamical neural networks. These networks may be recurrent and should operate in real time. The evolution should be incremental, using an extended and modified version of a genetic algorithm. Practical constraints suggest that initial architecture evaluations should be done largely in simulation. To support our claims and proposals, we summarize results from some preliminary simulation experiments in which visually guided robots are evolved to operate in simple environments. Significantly, our results demonstrate that robust visually guided control systems evolve from evaluation functions that do not explicitly require monitoring visual input. We outline the difficulties involved in continuing with simulations and conclude by describing specialized visuorobotic equipment, designed to eliminate the need for simulated sensors and actuators.",

Using a combination of elementary analysis and numerical studies, this article begins a systematic examination of the dynamics of continuous-time recurrent neural networks. Specifically, a fairly complete description of the possible dynamical behavior and bifurcations of one- and two-neuron circuits is given, along with a few specific results for larger networks. This analysis provides both qualitative insight and, in many cases, quantitative formulas for predicting the dynamical behavior of particular circuits and how that behavior changes as network parameters are varied. These results demonstrate that even small circuits are capable of a rich variety of dynamical behavior (including chaotic dynamics). An approach to understanding the dynamics of circuits with time-varying inputs is also presented. Finally, based on this analysis, several strategies for focusing evolutionary searches into fruitful regions of network parameter space are suggested.",

Then, we summarize four of the major formalization proposals for the affordance term.

We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain – variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference – what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control – the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies – and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.",

Unlike other simulations, the evolutionary task (finding food in the environment) and the learning task (predicting the next position of food on the basis of present position and planned network's movement) are different tasks. In these conditions, learning influences evolution (without Lamarckian inheritance of learned weight changes) and evolution influences learning. Average but not peak fitness has a better evolutionary growth with learning than without learning. After the initial generations, individuals that learn to predict during life also improve their food-finding ability during life. Furthermore, individuals that inherit an innate capacity to find food also inherit an innate predisposition to learn to predict the sensory consequences of their movements. They do not predict better at birth, but they do learn to predict better than individuals of the initial generation given the same learning experience. The results are interpreted in terms of a notion of dynamic correlation between the fitness surface and the learning surface. Evolution succeeds in finding both individuals that have high fitness and individuals that, although they do not have high fitness at birth, end up with high fitness because they learn to predict.",

Our mechanisms, used to invoke the group behavior, allow the system of robots to perform tasks without centralized control or explicit communication. We have constructed a system of five mobile robots capable of achieving simple collective tasks to verify the results obtained in simulation.

Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity.

One of the major challenges they face concerns the question of how to assess the fitness of evolving controllers when each evolutionary run typically involves hundreds of thousands of such assessments. This article outlines new ways of thinking about and building simulations upon which such assessments can be performed. It puts forward sufficient conditions for the successful transfer of evolved controllers from simulation to reality and develops a potential methodology for building simulations in which evolving controllers are forced to satisfy these conditions if they are to be reliably fit. It is hypothesized that as long as simulations are built according to this methodology, it does not matter how inaccurate or incomplete they are: Controllers that have evolved to be reliably fit in simulation still will transfer into reality. Two sets of experiments are reported, both of which involve minimal look-up table-based simulations built according to these guidelines. In the first set, controllers were evolved that allowed a Khepera robot to perform a simple memory task in the real world. In the second set, controllers were evolved for the Sussex University gantry robot that were able to distinguish visually a triangle from a square, under extremely noisy real-world conditions, and to steer the robot toward the triangle. In both cases, controllers that were reliably fit in simulation displayed extremely robust behavior when downloaded into reality.",

    "abstract": "A key element in the solution of reinforcement learning problems is the value function. The purpose of this function is to measure the long-term utility or value of any given state. The function is important because an agent can use this measure to decide what to do next. A common problem in reinforcement learning when applied to systems having continuous states and action spaces is that the value function must operate with a domain consisting of real-valued variables, which means that it should be able to represent the value of infinitely many state and action pairs. For this reason, function approximators are used to represent the value function when a close-form solution of the optimal policy is not available. In this article, we extend a previously proposed reinforcement learning algorithm so that it can be used with function approximators that generalize the value of individual experiences across both state and action spaces. In particular, we discuss the benefits of using sparse coarse-coded function approximators to represent value functions and describe in detail three implementations: cerebellar model articulation controllers, instance-based, and case-based. Additionally, we discuss how function approximators having different degrees of resolution in different regions of the state and action spaces may influence the performance and learning efficiency of the agent. We propose a simple and modular technique that can be used to implement function approximators with nonuniform degrees of resolution so that the value function can be represented with higher accuracy in important regions of the state and action spaces. We performed extensive experiments in the double-integrator and pendulum swing-up systems to demonstrate the proposed ideas. '",

The basis behavior set we propose, consisting of avoidance, safe-wandering, following, aggregation, dispersion, and homing, is constructed from behaviors commonly observed in a variety of species in nature. The proposed behaviors are manifested spatially but have an effect on more abstract modes of interaction, including the exchange of information and cooperation. We demonstrate how basis behaviors can be combined into higher-level group behaviors commonly observed across species. The combination mechanisms we propose are useful for synthesizing a variety of new group behaviors, as well as for analyzing naturally occurring ones.",

    "abstract": "To study learning as an adaptive process, one must take into consideration the role of evolution, which is the primary adaptive process. In addition, learning should be studied in (artificial) organisms that live in an independent physical environment in such a way that the input from the environment can be at least partially controlled by the organisms' behavior. To explore these issues, we used a genetic algorithm to simulate the evolution of a population of neural networks, each controlling the behavior of a small mobile robot that must explore efficiently an environment surrounded by walls. Because the environment changes from one generation to the next, each network must learn during its life to adapt to the particular environment into which it happens to be born. We found that evolved networks incorporate a genetically inherited predisposition to learn that can be described as (1) the presence of initial conditions that tend to canalize learning in the right directions; (2) the tendency to behave in a way that enhances the perceived differences between different environments and determines input stimuli that facilitate the learning of adaptive changes; and (3) the ability to reach desirable stable states.",

    "abstract": "This article examines some of the methods used by animals and humans to adapt their environment. Because there are limits on the number of different tasks a creature can be designed to do well in, creatures with the capacity to redesign their environments have an adaptive advantage over those who can adapt only passively to existing environmental structures. To clarify environmental redesign, l rely on the formal notion of a task environment as a directed graph in which the nodes are states and the links are actions. One natural form of redesign is to change the topology of this graph structure so as to increase the likelihood of task success or to reduce its expected cost, measured in physical terms. This may be done by eliminating initial states, hence eliminating choice points; by changing the action repertoire; by changing the consequence function; and, lastly, by adding choice points. Another major method for adapting the environment is to change its cognitive congeniality. Such changes leave the state space formally intact but reduce the number and cost of mental operations needed for task success; they reliably increase the speed, accuracy, or robustness of performance. The last section of the article describes several of these epistemic or complementary actions found in human performance.",

Tantalizing results from neuroscience are shedding light on the mixed motor and sensory representations used by the brain during reaching, grasping, and object recognition. We now know a great deal about what happens in the brain during these activities, but not necessarily why. Is the integration we see functionally important, or just a reflection of evolution's lack of enthusiasm for sharp modularity? We wish to instantiate these results in robotic form to probe the technical advantages and to find any lacunae in existing models. We believe it would be missing the point to investigate this on a platform where dextrous manipulation and sophisticated machine vision are already implemented in their mature form, and instead follow a developmental approach from simpler primitives. We begin with a precursor to manipulation, simple poking and prodding, and show how it facilitates object segmentation, a long-standing problem in machine vision. The robot can familiarize itself with the objects in its environment by acting upon them. It can then recognize other actors (such as humans) in the environment through their effect on the objects it has learned about. We argue that following causal chains of events out from the robot's body into the environment allows for a very natural developmental progression of visual competence, and we relate this idea to results in neuroscience.",

Natural agents—for instance, desert ants—solve the homing problem mainly by using path integration within an egocentric frame of reference. When employing such a mechanism, compass information for determining direction is necessary, and the precision of the compass will have a crucial effect on the precision of homing. For deriving compass information, certain insects use the pattern of polarized light in the sky that arises due to scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere (polarized light compass). The analysis of skylight polarization is mediated by specialized photoreceptors and neurons in the visual system. Inspired by the insect's polarized light compass, we have constructed a polarization compass that was employed successfully on the mobile robot Sahabot. Three models for extracting compass information from the polarization pattern of the sky were tested. In this article, we describe the navigation system and report results of experiments performed with the Sahabot in one of the natural habitats of the desert ant Cataglyphis in North Africa.",

We then consider the action selection problem for robots and vertebrates and argue that, in addition to subsumption- like conflict resolution mechanisms, the vertebrate nervous system employs specialized selection mechanisms located in a group of central brain structures termed the basal ganglia.

Instead, we suggest that cognition is better explicated as a much more general biological phenomenon, allowing the lower bound of cognition to extend much further down the phylogenetic scale. We argue that elementary forms of cognition can already be witnessed in prokaryotes possessing a functional sensorimotor analogue of the nervous system. Building on a case-study of the Escherichia coli bacterium and its sensorimotor system, the TCST-system, we home in on the characteristics of minimal cognition, and distinguish it from more basic forms of ontogenetic adaptation. In our view, minimal cognition requires an embodiment consisting of a sensorimotor coupling mechanism that subsumes an autopoietic organization; this forms the basis of the growing consensus that the core of cognition revolves around sensorimotor coupling. We discuss the relevance of our interpretation of minimal cognition for the study of cognition in general",

In this article we argue that sports provide rich ecological constraints for representative task design in modeling the complex interactions of human performers with their environments. Adopting a functionalist perspective enriched by ideas from ecological psychology and nonlinear dynamics, we consider data from exemplar movement models in basketball and boxing to support this contention. We show that this preference for movement models from sports, although not completely novel, has accelerated over recent years, mainly due to the theoretical re-emphasis on studying the interaction of individual and task constraints. The implications of using such applied models of move ment behavior in studying the design of natural and artificial systems are also discussed.",

They receive environmental information from their sensors as input, subsequently process or adjust this information, and use the result to control effectors, providing output. Through-conducting activity is here the key organizational feature of nervous systems. In this paper, we argue that this input–output interpretation is not the most fundamental feature of nervous system organization. Building on biological work on the early evolution of nervous systems, we provide an alternative proposal: the skin brain thesis (SBT). The SBT postulates that early nervous systems evolved to organize a new multicellular effector: muscle tissue, the primary source of animal motility. Early nervous systems provided a new way of inducing and coordinating self-organized contractile activity across an extensive muscle surface underneath the skin. The main connectivity in such nervous systems runs across a spread out effector and is transverse to sensor-effector signaling. The SBT therefore constitutes a fundamental conceptual shift in understanding both nervous system operation and what nervous systems are. Nervous systems are foremost spatial organizers that turn large multi-cellular animal bodies into dynamic self-moving units. At the end, we briefly discuss some theoretical connections to central issues within the behavioral, cognitive and neurosciences.",

    "abstract": "In flocking, a swarm of robots moves cohesively in a common direction. Traditionally, flocking is realized using two main control rules: proximal control, which controls the cohesion of the swarm using local range-and bearing information about neighboring robots; and alignment control, which allows the robots to align in a common direction and uses more elaborate sensing mechanisms to obtain the orientation of neighboring robots. So far, limited attention has been given to motion control, used to translate the output of these two control rules into robot motion. In this paper, we propose a novel motion control method: magnitude-dependent motion control (MDMC). Through simulations and real robot experiments, we show that, with MDMC, flocking in a random direction is possible without the need for alignment control and for robots having a preferred direction of travel. MDMC has the advantage to be implementable on very simple robots that lack the capability to detect the orientation of their neighbors. In addition, we introduce a small proportion of robots informed about a desired direction of travel. We compare MDMC with a motion control method used in previous robotics literature, which we call magnitude-independent motion control (MIMC), and we show that the swarms can travel longer distances in the desired direction when using MDMC instead of MIMC. Finally, we systematically study flocking under various conditions: with or without alignment control, with or without informed robots, with MDMC or with MIMC.",

Second, we focus on ‘‘plant neurobiology’’ and introduce the resurfacing of Darwin’s idea that plants have a control center for behavior dispersed across the root tips (a root-brain). We then discuss minimal forms of cognition, and consider motility and having a dedicated sensorimotor organization as key features for designating the domain of minimal cognition.

    "abstract": "Enactive approaches to cognitive science aim to explain human cognitive processes across the board without making any appeal to internal, content-carrying representational states. A challenge to such a research programme in cognitive science that immediately arises is how to explain cognition in so-called 'representation-hungry' domains. Examples of representation-hungry domains include imagination, memory, planning and language use in which the agent is engaged in thinking about something that may be absent, possible or abstract. The challenge is to explain how someone could think about things that are not concretely present in their environment other than by means of an internal mental representation. We call this the 'Representation-Hungry Challenge' (RHC). The challenge we take up in this article is to show how hunger for representations could possibly be satisfied by means other than the construction and manipulation of internal representational states. We meet this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that integrates key ideas drawn from enactive cognitive science and ecological psychology. One of our main aims is thus to show how ecological and enactive theories as non-representational and non-computational approaches to cognitive science might work together. From enactive cognitive science, we borrow the thesis of the strict continuity of lower and higher cognition. We develop this thesis to argue against any sharp conceptual distinction between higher and lower cognition based on representation-hunger. From ecological psychology, we draw upon our earlier work on the rich landscape of affordances. We propose thinking of so-called representation-hungry cognition in terms of temporally extended activities in which the agent skilfully coordinates to a richly structured landscape of affordances. In our framework, putative cases of representation-hungry cognition are explained by abilities to coordinate nested activities to an environment structured by interrelated socio-material practices. The RHC has often figured in arguments for the limitations of non-representational approaches to cognitive science. We showcase the theoretical resources available to an integrated ecological-enactive approach for addressing this type of sceptical challenge.",

The main objective of the review is to compare computer-based learning environments according to their implementation of feedback and to identify open research questions in adaptive feedback implementations. The review resulted in categorizing these feedback implementations based on the students’ information used for providing feedback, the aspect of the domain or pedagogical knowledge that is adapted to provide feedback based on the students’ characteristics, the pedagogical reason for providing feedback, and the steps taken to provide feedback with or without students’ participation. Other information such as the common adaptive feedback means, goals, and implementation techniques are identified.

By means of a graph theoretical reconstruction method, the view graph is shown to carry complete information on the topological and directional structure of the maze. Path planning can be carried out directly in the view graph without actually performing this reconstruction. A neural network is presented that learns the view graph during a random exploration of the maze. lt is based on an unsupervised competitive learning rule translating temporal sequence (rather than similarity) of views into connectedness in the network. The network uses its knowledge of the topological and directional structure of the maze to generate expectations about which views are likely to be encountered next, improving the view-recognition performance.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is a fundamental process by which organisms learn to achieve goals from their interactions with the environment. Using evolutionary computation techniques we evolve (near-)optimal neuronal learning rules in a simple neural network model of reinforcement learning in bumblebees foraging for nectar. The resulting neural networks exhibit efficient reinforcement learning, allowing the bees to respond rapidly to changes in reward contingencies. The evolved synaptic plasticity dynamics give rise to varying exploration/exploitation levels and to the well-documented choice strategies of risk aversion and probability matching. Additionally, risk aversion is shown to emerge even when bees are evolved in a completely risk-less environment. In contrast to existing theories in economics and game theory, risk-averse behavior is shown to be a direct consequence of (near-)optimal reinforcement learning, without requiring additional assumptions such as the existence of a nonlinear subjective utility function for rewards. Our results are corroborated by a rigorous mathematical analysis, and their robustness in real-world situations is supported by experiments in a mobile robot. Thus we provide a biologically founded, parsimonious, and novel explanation for risk aversion and probability matching.",

Because this adaptability is so critical for survival, all vertebrates have sub-cortical structures, which comprise the neuromodulatory systems, to regulate fundamental behavior and drive decision making in response to environmental events. In the vertebrate, there are separate neuromodulators that respond to threats, reward anticipation, novelty, and attentional effort. However, each of these neuromodulatory systems has a similar effect, that is, to cause an organism to be decisive when environmental conditions call for such actions, and allow the organism to be more exploratory when there are no pressing events. In this article, it is proposed that principles of the neuromodulatory system could provide a framework for controlling artificial agents that may improve current artificial agent behavior. These agents would operate autonomously, effectively explore their environment, and be decisive when environmental conditions call for action.",

Individual robots use internal cues (successful food retrieval), environmental cues (collisions with team-mates while searching for food) and social cues (team-mate success in food retrieval) to dynamically vary the time spent foraging or resting. Simulation results show that the swarm demonstrates successful adaptive emergent division of labor and robustness to environmental change (in food source density), and we observe that robots need to cooperate more when food is scarce. Furthermore, the adaptation mechanism is able to guide the swarm towards energy optimization despite the limited sensing and communication abilities of the individual robots and the simple social interaction rules. The swarm also exhibits the capacity to collectively perceive environmental changes; a capacity that can only be observed at a group level and cannot be deduced from individual robots.",

Thus, we analyze several forms of minimal adaptivity, including the special case of motility.

A definition of cognition as adaptive-autonomy in the embodied and situated neurodynamic domain is provided: the compensatory regulation of a web of stability dependencies between sensorimotor structures is created and pre served during a historical/developmental process. We highlight the functional role of emotional embodiment: internal bioregulatory processes coupled to the formation and adaptive regulation of neurodynamic autonomy.

The biological implementation of memory shares little with memory in synthetic cognitive systems where it is typically regarded as a passive storage structure. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that memory is neither passive nor centralized. A review of the relevant literature in the biological and computer sciences is conducted and a novel methodology is applied that incorporates neuroethological approaches with general biological inspiration in the design of synthetic cognitive systems: a case study regarding episodic memory provides an illustration of the utility of this methodology. As a consequence of applying this approach to the reinterpretation of the implementation of memory in synthetic systems, four fundamental functional principles are derived that are in accordance with neuroscientific theory, and which may be applied to the design of more adaptive and robust synthetic cognitive systems: priming, cross-modal associations, cross-modal coordination without semantic information transfer, and global system behavior resulting from activation dynamics within the memory system.",

In this article, we demonstrate that the restriction of the self-amplified aggregation behavior to distinct zones in the environment can explain the emergence of a collective decision at the level of the group. This hypothesis is tested with robotics experiments and dedicated computer simulations. We show that the collective decision is influenced by the available spaces to explore and to aggregate in, by the size of the population involved in the aggregation process and by the probability of encounter zones while the robots explore the environment.

Emotions are states of an individual’s body and brain that allow the motivational decision mechanism of the individual to function more properly, that is, in ways that increase the individual’s survival and reproductive chances. The article describes five different simulated robots which, unlike current ‘‘emotional’’ robots, can be said to have emotions. The robots may need to eat and drink, eat and fly away from a predator, eat and find a mating partner, eat and take care of their offspring, or eat and rest in order to heal from physical damage. We show that adding a special emotional circuit to the neural network controlling the robots’ behavior leads to better motivational decisions, and therefore to higher fitness, and we describe how in many circumstances the robots endowed with an emotional circuit behave differently than those lacking the circuit.

We implement view familiarity as a means of navigation by training a classifier to determine whether a given view is part of a route and using the confidence in this classification as a proxy for familiarity. Through the coupling of movement and viewing direction, a familiar view specifies a familiar direction of viewing and thus a familiar movement to make. We show the feasibility of our approach as a model of ant-like route acquisition by learning a series of nontrivial routes through an indoor environment using a large gantry robot equipped with a panoramic camera.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of artificial agents is typically used to produce behavioral responses as a function of the reward obtained by interaction with the environment. When the problem consists of learning the shortest path to a goal, it is common to use reward functions yielding a fixed value after each decision, for example a positive value if the target location has been attained and a negative value at each intermediate step. However, this fixed strategy may be overly simplistic for agents to adapt to dynamic environments, in which resources may vary from time to time. By contrast, there is significant evidence that most living beings internally modulate reward value as a function of their context to expand their range of adaptivity. Inspired by the potential of this operation, we present a review of its underlying processes and we introduce a simplified formalization for artificial agents. The performance of this formalism is tested by monitoring the adaptation of an agent endowed with a model of motivated actor–critic, embedded with our formalization of value and constrained by physiological stability, to environments with different resource distribution. Our main result shows that the manner in which reward is internally processed as a function of the agent’s motivational state, strongly influences adaptivity of the behavioral cycles generated and the agent’s physiological stability.",

    "abstract": "This article develops generalizations of empowerment to continuous states. Empowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated by hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological organisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiosity-driven learning. Empowerment measures, for agent—environment systems with stochastic transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant properties, for example, it allows us to identify salient states using only the dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities were assumed to be known. The goal of this article is to extend empowerment to the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The continuous state space is addressed by Monte Carlo approximation; the unknown transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of well-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by empowerment and include an application to exploration and online model learning.",

Evidence shows that the perception of human interaction starts with an innate perception mechanism, where the interaction between different entities is perceived and categorized into two very clear directions: positive or negative. While the person is developing during childhood, the perception evolves and is shaped based on the observation of human interaction, creating the capability to learn different categories of expressions. In the context of human-robot interaction, we propose a model that simulates the innate perception of audio-visual emotion expressions with deep neural networks, that learns new expressions by categorizing them into emotional clusters with a self-organizing layer. The proposed model is evaluated with three different corpora: The Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) database, the visual Bi-modal Face and Body benchmark (FABO) database, and the multimodal corpus of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) challenge. We use these corpora to evaluate the performance of the model to recognize emotional expressions, and compare it to state-of-the-art research.",

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previously acquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while it learns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similarity that is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of the value functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resulting map is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previously acquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empirically validate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and also demonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobile micro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of this approach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growth mechanism. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements and extensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real world scenarios in the context of continual learning.",

    "abstract": "The term ‘nexting’ has been used by psychologists to refer to the propensity of people and many other animals to continually predict what will happen next in an immediate, local, and personal sense. The ability to ‘next’ constitutes a basic kind of awareness and knowledge of one’s environment. In this paper we present results with a robot that learns to next in real time, making thousands of predictions about sensory input signals at timescales from 0.1 to 8 seconds. Our predictions are formulated as a generalization of the value functions commonly used in reinforcement learning, where now an arbitrary function of the sensory input signals is used as a pseudo reward, and the discount rate determines the timescale. We show that six thousand predictions, each computed as a function of six thousand features of the state, can be learned and updated online ten times per second on a laptop computer, using the standard temporal-difference( λ) algorithm with linear function approximation. This approach is sufficiently computationally efficient to be used for real-time learning on the robot and sufficiently data efficient to achieve substantial accuracy within 30 minutes. Moreover, a single tile-coded feature representation suffices to accurately predict many different signals over a significant range of timescales. We also extend nexting beyond simple timescales by letting the discount rate be a function of the state and show that nexting predictions of this more general form can also be learned with substantial accuracy. General nexting provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for a robot to acquire predictive knowledge of the dynamics of its environment.",

Gibson’s concept of affordance, one of the central pillars of ecological psychology, is a truly remarkable idea that provides a concise theory of animal perception predicated on environmental interaction. It is thus not surprising that this idea has also found its way into robotics research as one of the underlying theories for action perception. The success of the theory in this regard has meant that existing research is both abundant and diffuse by virtue of the pursuit of multiple different paths and techniques with the common goal of enabling robots to learn, perceive, and act upon affordances. Up until now, there has existed no systematic investigation of existing work in this field. Motivated by this circumstance, in this article, we begin by defining a taxonomy for computational models of affordances rooted in a comprehensive analysis of the most prominent theoretical ideas of import in the field. Subsequently, after performing a systematic literature review, we provide a classification of existing research within our proposed taxonomy. Finally, by both quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the data resulting from the classification process, we highlight gaps in the research terrain and outline open questions for the investigation of affordances in robotics that we believe will help inform future work, prioritize research goals, and potentially advance the field toward greater robot autonomy.",

    "abstract": "“Minimal cognition” is used in certain sectors of the cognitive sciences to make a kind of ontological claim that may be unique in the biological sciences: that a function operating in organisms living today is not a fully fledged version of that function (the nature of which remains unspecified), but, rather, exhibits the minimal requirements for whatever it is, properly conceived. Evidence suggests that elsewhere in the life sciences, deployment of minimizing qualifiers relative to a biological function appears largely restricted to two scenarios: first, attenuated functioning and, second, evolution of the function, real or synthetic. The article argues that “minimal cognition” and “proto-cognitive” were introduced at the turn of this century by cognitive researchers seeking to learn directly from evolved behavior, ecology and physiology. A terminological straitjacket imposed on the central object of cognitive science at its beginning necessitated the move. An alternative terminology is proposed, based on a phyletically neutral definition of cognition as a biological function; a candidate mechanism is explored; and a bacterial example presented. On this story, cognition is like respiration: ubiquitously present, from unicellular life to blue whales and every form of life in between, and for similar reasons: staying alive requires it.",

In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: naïve, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.",

I argue that embodiment is not just a philosophical mantra empty of empirical content. I draw attention (section 4) to some of the recent ways in which principles underlying embodied cognition have begun to be applied in different fields (contemporary psychology). I review some of these interventions and suggest that discussing these applications not only provides additional evidence against any poverty claim but can also help moving the field forward in important ways.

This article argues that archaeologists who study lithic artefacts and their transformations over the course of human evolution are uniquely well positioned to contribute to the ongoing debate about the marks of the mental. Adopting the material engagement approach, I propose to replace the internalist vision of mentality, that is, the vision of a brain-bound mind that is using the body to execute and externalise preconceived mental plan through the stone, with an ecological-enactive vision of participatory mentality where bodily acts and materials act together to generate rather than merely execute thought processes. I argue that the latter participatory view changes the geography of the cognitive and offers a better description for the continuity of mind and matter that we see in the lithic record.",

But these alone do not explain how various activities are coordinated and performed versatilely. We argue that this depends on a specific type of mechanism, a control mechanism. We develop an account of control by examining several extensively studied control mechanisms operative in the bacterium E. coli. On our analysis, what distinguishes a control mechanism from other mechanisms is that it relies on measuring one or more variables, which results in setting constraints in the control mechanism that determine its action on flexible constraints in other mechanisms. In the most basic arrangement, the measurement process directly determines the action of the control mechanism, but in more complex arrangements signals mediate between measurements and effectors. This opens the possibility of multiple responses to the same measurement and responses based on multiple measurements. It also allows crosstalk, resulting in networks of control mechanisms. Such networks integrate the behaviors of the organism but also present a challenge in tailoring responses to particular measurements. We discuss how integrated activity can still result in differential, versatile, responses .",

Although moth maneuvers are well documented, the mechanisms underlying sensory perception and navigation are not fully understood; therefore, a key objective was to define sensor, signal-processing, and actuation algorithms for autonomous vehicles. The strategies presented do not precisely mimic insect orientation to odors. Optimizing performance, however, suggests orientation strategies that may have biological counterparts. The results demonstrate the importance of cross-plume counterturning strategies for maintaining intermittent contact with the chemical plume, given noisy sensory information. It is important for the searcher to maintain intermittent contact with the plume because flow direction while detecting odor is the main indicator of the instantaneous desired direction of motion.",

Having replicated Wilson's results, we extend ZCS in a manner suggested by Wilson: The original formulation of ZCS has no memory mechanisms, but Wilson (1994b) suggested how internal \"temporary memory\" registers could be added. We show results from adding one-bit and two-bit memory registers to ZCS. Our results demonstrate that ZCS can exploit memory facilities efficiently in non-Markov environments. We also show that the memoryless ZCS can converge on near-optimal stochastic solutions in non-Markov environments. We then present results from trials using ZCS in Markov environments that require increasingly long chains of actions before reward is received. Our results indicate that inaccurate overgeneral classifiers can interact with the classifier-generation mechanisms to cause catastrophic breakdowns in overall system performance. Basing classifier fitness on accuracy may alleviate this problem. We conclude that the memory mechanism in its current form is unlikely to scale well for situations requiring large amounts of temporary memory. Nevertheless, the ability to find stochastic solutions when there is insufficient memory might offset this problem somewhat.",

We will present a set of experiments in which neural networks with different architectures have been trained to control a mobile robot designed to keep an arena clear by picking up trash objects and releasing them outside the arena. Controller weights are selected using a form of genetic algorithm and do not change during the lifetime (i.e., no learning occurs). We will compare, in simulation and on a real robot, five different network architectures and will show that a network that allows for fine-grained modularity achieves significantly better performance. By comparing the functionality of each network module and its interaction with a description of the simple behavior components, we will show that it is not possible to find simple correlations; rather, module switching and interaction are correlated with low-level sensorimotor mappings. This implies that the engineering-oriented approach to behavior-based robotics might have serious limitations because it is difficult to know in advance the appropriate mappings between behavior components and sensorimotor activity for complex tasks.",

The experiments showed that after the robot learns multiple cyclic movement patterns as embedded in the RNNPB, it can regenerate each pattern synchronously with the movements of a human who is demonstrating the corresponding movement pattern in front of the robot. Further, the robot exhibits diverse interactive responses when the user demonstrates novel cyclic movement patterns. Those responses were analyzed and categorized. We propose that the dynamics of coherence and incoherence between the robot’s and the user’s movements could enhance close interactions between them, and that they could also explain the essential psychological mechanism of joint attention.",

Results show that social behaviour benefit the agents in two circumstances: (1) agents capable of following one another, and in this way imitating each other's movements, develop faster and better a common understanding of the language; (2) furthermore, the agents' capability of communicating with one another via a common vocabulary benefits to the group and to each agent individually as it speeds up the transmission of information. We use a connection ist model, based on Hebbian associative learning, for the learning of the word-signal pairs. This work follows robotic experiments [6, 5, 7] in which a physical autonomous robot was taught a vocabulary to describe its perceptions of objects, movement, inclination and orientation. The robot was taught either by a human instructor or by another robot. The teacher-learner robot experiments were based on an imitative strategy whereby the learner robot followed the teacher robot. The work of this paper demonstrates scaling up of this movement imitative strategy for transmitting a vocabulary across a group of robotic agents, i.e. from a teacher agent to several learner agents. In particular, it shows that imitative behaviour is necessary for the grounding of the agents' proprioceptions and speeds up the grounding of exteroceptions. These studies stress the importance of behavioural social mechanisms in addition to general cognitive abilities of associa tivity for grounding communication in embodied agents. In particular, it shows that a simple movement imitation strategy is an interesting scenario for the transmission of a language, as it is an easy means of getting the agents to share a common context of perceptions, which is a prereq uisite for a common understanding of the language to develop. It is thus suggested that a behav iour-oriented approach might be more appropriate than a pure cognitivist one which is dominat ing in related studies of the mechanisms involved in grounding communication.",

Maes, among others, has argued against mechanisms of this type because of the top-down control and lack of robustness inherent in these hierarchical decision structures, or rigid switching mechanisms, in which decisions are made at every level. Two alternatives exist to these hierarchical decision structures: Maes and others have designed non-hierarchical action selection mechanisms, and Rosenblatt and Payton have outlined a hierarchical mechanism that does not make decisions at every level. In this article, use of the two types of hierarchies for action selection is discussed, and the Rosenblatt and Payton approach—with free flow of information, combination of evidence, and the ability to select compromise candidates—is supported. It is also argued that the problem of action selection is, by nature, intrinsically hierarchical, and so Rosenblatt and Payton-like hierarchies (free-flow hierarchies) are more suitable for action selection than non-hierarchical mechanisms. Evidence from observation of animal behavior and from computer simulation testing is used to lend support to these claims.",

    "abstract": "The study of adaptive behavior, including learning, usually centers on the effects of natural selection for individual survival. But because reproduction is evolutionarily more important than survival, sexual selection through mate choice (Darwin, 1871) can also have profound consequences on the evolution of creatures' bodies and behaviors. This article shows, through simulation models, how one type of learning-parental imprinting—can evolve purely through sexual selection, to help in selecting appropriate mates and in tracking changes in the phenotypic makeup of the population across generations. At moderate mutation rates, when population tracking becomes an important but still soluble problem, imprinting proves more useful and evolves more quickly than at low or high mutation rates. We also show that parental imprinting can facilitate the formation of new species. In reviewing the biological literature on imprinting, we note that these results confirm some previous speculations by other researchers concerning the adaptive functions and evolutionary consequences of imprinting. Finally, we discuss how sexual selection through mate choice may have great scientific implications for our understanding of the interactions among evolution, learning, and behavior, and potentially important engineering applications for increasing the efficiency of evolutionary search and optimization methods.",

This behavior occurs in birds and fish, but much of our knowledge of it derives from flying insects, especially moths. It is a highly integrative behavior, requiring not only the integration of olfactory information with a behavioral strategy to maintain contact with the odor plume, but also an ability to detect the direction of fluid flow that is carrying the odor cue. The temporal-spatial structure of the odor plume is determined by the fluid dynamics of the environment, and it profoundly affects the behavior. Thus, the success of animals (or artificial agents) is determined by an interaction between sensory input and internally generated behaviors. We have implemented behavioral-level simulations of odor-modulated moth flight to understand how the properties of the odor stimulus and the behavioral system interact to result in successful source location. Even simple reflexive models can track predictable, laminar-flow plumes, but only models with internally generated behaviors can track unpredictable, turbulent plumes. The \"best\" behavioral strategy depends on both the structure of the odor stimulus and an agent's performance limits.",

The average fitness of the population and the organization of its use of signals are compared under three conditions: communication suppressed, communication permitted, and communication permitted in the presence of learning. Where communication is permitted, the fitness increases approximately 26 times faster than when communication is suppressed; with communication and learning, the rate of fitness increase is nearly 100-fold The second series of experiments illustrates the evolution of a syntactically simple language, in which a pair of signals is required for effective communication.",

Various types of hierarchical control structures have been introduced and shown to be effective in past artificial agent models, but few studies have shown how such structures can self-organize. This study describes how such hierarchical control may evolve in a simple recurrent neural network model implemented in a mobile robot. Topological constraints on information flow are found to improve system performance by decreasing interference between different parts of the network. One part becomes responsible for generating lower behavior primitives while another part evolves top-down sequencing of the primitives for achieving global goals. Fast and slow neuronal response dynamics are automatically generated in specific neurons of the lower and the higher levels, respectively. A hierarchical neural network is shown to outperform a comparable single-level network in controlling a mobile robot.",

The model demonstrates persistent evolution of high-cost sexual ornaments through mutual mate choice, even under strict monogamy, as long as the phenotypic condition is sufficiently heritable, and the monomorphic ornament reflects condition with sufficient accuracy to allow positive assortative mating.

    "abstract": "The overlapping fields of adaptive behavior and artificial life are often described as novel approaches to biology. They focus attention on bottom-up explanations and how lifelike phenomena can result from relatively simple systems interacting dynamically with their environments. They are also characterized by the use of synthetic methodologies, that is, building artificial systems as a means of exploring these ideas. Two differing approaches can be distinguished: building models of specific animal systems and assessing them within complete behavior—environment loops; and exploring the behavior of invented artificial animals, often called animats, under similar conditions. An obvious question about the latter approach is, how can we learn about real biology from simulation of non-existent animals? In this article I will argue, first, that animat research, to the extent that it is relevant to biology, should also be considered as model building. Animat simulations do, implicitly, represent hypotheses about, and should be evaluated by comparison to, animals. Casting this research in terms of invented agents serves only to limit the ability to draw useful conclusions from it by deflecting or deferring any serious comparisons of the model mechanisms and results with real biological systems. Claims that animat models are meant to be existence proofs, idealizations, or represent general problems in biology do not make these models qualitatively different from more conventional models of specific animals, nor undermine the ultimate requirement to justify this work by making concrete comparisons with empirical data. It is thus suggested that we will learn more by choosing real, and not made-up, targets for our models.",

Yet neuroevolution, that is, automatically creating artificial neural networks (ANNs) through evolutionary algorithms, has sometimes focused on static ANNs that cannot change their weights during their lifetime. A profound problem with evolving adaptive systems is that learning to learn is highly deceptive. Because it is easier at first to improve fitness without evolving the ability to learn, evolution is likely to exploit domain-dependent static (i.e., nonadaptive) heuristics. This article analyzes this inherent deceptiveness in a variety of different dynamic, reward-based learning tasks, and proposes a way to escape the deceptive trap of static policies based on the novelty search algorithm. The main idea in novelty search is to abandon objective-based fitness and instead simply search only for novel behavior, which avoids deception entirely. A series of experiments and an in-depth analysis show how behaviors that could potentially serve as a stepping stone to finding adaptive solutions are discovered by novelty search yet are missed by fitness-based search. The conclusion is that novelty search has the potential to foster the emergence of adaptive behavior in reward-based learning tasks, thereby opening a new direction for research in evolving plastic ANNs.",

However, the mechanisms that lead to various patterns of escape maneuvers in fish schools are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of startle stimulus characteristics (distance and orientation) on the escape maneuvers of schools of a highly gregarious fish species, the Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. We quantified information transfer of the onset of startle responses by analyzing the speed of the waves of their propagation ( U w = 6.7 ± 1.6 m/s; mean ± SD). U w was found to be positively correlated with the number of early responders (i.e., individuals reacting with a latency &lt;50 ms). In addition, we identified the rules determining two different evading maneuvers: highly aligned maneuvers (i.e., all individuals oriented in a relatively uniform direction) and “split” maneuvers (i.e., individuals escaping with low directional uniformity). The pattern of escape maneuvers was dependent on stimulus direction (α s ). Lateral stimulation (30° &lt; α s &lt; 120°) elicits highly aligned maneuvers away from the stimulus, while frontal stimulations (α s &lt; 30°) causes split maneuvers, which are followed by realignment about 1 s after stimulation. These simple rules suggest that certain stimulus characteristics are important factors determining the variability of antipredator maneuvers observable in schooling fish.",

We then describe the implementation of one part of the affordance formalism for the learning and perception of traversability affordances on a mobile robot equipped with range sensing ability. Through experiments inspired by ecological psychology, we show that the robot, by interacting with its environment, can learn to perceive the traversability affordances. Moreover, we claim that three of the main attributes that are commonly associated with affordances, that is, affordances being relative to the environment, providing perceptual economy, and providing general information, are simply consequences of learning from the interactions of the robot with the environment.",

Here we address explicitly this issue, characterizing the dynamics emerging from a population of intention recognizers. We derive a Bayesian network model for intention recognition in the context of repeated social dilemmas and evolutionary game theory, by assessing the internal dynamics of trust between intention recognizers and their opponents. Intention recognizers are then able to predict the next move of their opponents based on past direct interactions, which, in turn, enables them to prevail over the most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in presence of noise.

The results indicate that shape-related adjectives are best learned using features related to affordances, whereas nouns are best learned using appearance features.

In this article, I argue for an instrumentalist take on models in FEP. I shall argue that models used as instruments for knowledge by scientists and models as implemented by organisms to navigate the world are being conflated, which leads to erroneous conclusions. I further argue that a realist position is unwarranted. First, it overgenerates models and thus trivializes the notion of modelling. Second, even when the mathematical mechanisms described by FEP are implemented in an organism, they do not constitute a model. They are covariational, not representational in nature, and precede the social practices that have shaped our scientific modelling practice.

    "abstract": "Adaptation to their environment is a fundamental capability for living agents, from which au tonomous robots could also benefit. This work proposes a connectionist architecture, DRAMA, for dynamic control and learning of autonomous robots. DRAMA stands for dynamical recur rent associative memory architecture. It is a time-delay recurrent neural network, using Hebbian update rules. It allows learning of spatio-temporal regularities and time series in discrete se quences of inputs, in the face of an important amount of noise. The first part of this paper gives the mathematical description of the architecture and analyses theoretically and through numerical simulations its performance. The second part of this paper reports on the implementation of DRAMA in simulated and physical robotic experiments. Training and rehearsal of the DRAMA architecture is computationally fast and inexpensive, which makes the model particularly suitable for controlling 'computationally-challenged' robots. In the experiments, we use a basic hardware system with very limited computational capability and show that our robot can carry out real time computation and on-line learning of relatively complex cognitive tasks. In these experiments, two autonomous robots wander randomly in a fixed environment, collecting information about its elements. By mutually associating information of their sensors and actuators, they learn about physical regularities underlying their experience of varying stimuli. The agents learn also from their mutual interactions. We use a teacher-learner scenario, based on mutual following of the two agents, to enable transmission of a vocabulary from one robot to the other.",

    "abstract": "Instrumental (or operant) conditioning, a form of animal learning, is similar to reinforcement learning (Watkins, 1989) in that it allows an agent to adapt its actions to gain maximally from the environment while being rewarded only for correct performance. However, animals learn much more complicated behaviors through instrumental conditioning than robots presently acquire through reinforcement learning. We describe a new computational model of the conditioning process that attempts to capture some of the aspects that are missing from simple reinforcement learning: conditioned reinforcers, shifting reinforcement contingencies, explicit action sequencing, and state space refinement. We apply our model to a task commonly used to study working memory in rats and monkeys—the delayed match-to-sample task. Animals learn this task in stages. In simulation, our model also acquires the task in stages, in a similar manner. We have used the model to train an RWI B21 robot.",

Theoretical concepts concerning social behavior are presented from a systemic per spective and their usefulness is evaluated in interpreting the results obtained. Two agents moving in an unstructured arena must locate each other, and remain within a short distance of one anoth er for as long as possible using noisy continuous acoustic interaction. Evolved dynamical recurrent neural networks are used as the control architecture. Acoustic coupling poses nontrivial problems like discriminating 'self' from 'non-self' and structuring production of signals in time so as to minimize interference. Detailed observation of the most frequently evolved behavioral strategy shows that interacting agents perform rhythmic signals leading to the coordination of movement. During coordination, signals become entrained in an anti-phase mode that resembles turn-taking. Perturbation techniques show that signalling behavior not only performs an external function, but it is also integrated into the movement of the producing agent, thus showing the difficulty of separating behavior into social and non-social classes. Structural congruence between agents is shown by exploring internal dynamics as well as the response of single agents in the presence of signalling beacons that reproduce the signal patterns of the interacting agents. Lack of entrainment with the signals produced by the beacons shows the importance of transient periods of mutual dynamic perturbation wherein agents achieve congruence.",

Experiments were carried out to investigate this hypothesis in a simulated learning robot. For this purpose, a non-symbolic emotion model was developed that takes the form of a recurrent artificial neural network where emotions both depend on and influence the perception of the state of the world. This emotion model was integrated in a reinforcement-learning architecture with three different roles: influencing perception, providing reinforcement value, and determining when to reevaluate decisions. Experiments to test and compare this emotion-dependent architecture with a more conventional architecture were done in the context of a solitary learning robot performing a survival task. This research led to the conclusion that artificial emotions are a useful construct to have in the domain of behavior-based autonomous agents with multiple goals and faced with an unstructured environment, because they provide a unifying way to tackle different issues of control, analogous to natural systems' emotions.",

A genetic algorithm is used for evolving the architecture of a connectionist model which determines the muscular activity of a simulated body in interaction with water. This work is inspired by the biological model developed by Ekeberg which repro duces the central pattern generator observed in the real lamprey (Ekeberg, 1993). In evolving artificial controllers, we demonstrate that a genetic algorithm can be an interesting design tech nique for neural controllers and that there exist alternative solutions to the biological connectiv ity. A variety of neural controllers are evolved which can produce the pattern of oscillations necessary for swimming. These patterns can be modulated through the external excitation ap plied to the network in order to vary the speed and the direction of swimming. The best evolved controllers cover larger ranges of frequencies, phase lags and speeds of swimming than Ekeberg's model. We also show that the same techniques for evolving artificial solutions can be interesting tools for developing neurobiological models. In particular, biologically plausible controllers can be developed with ranges of oscillation frequency much closer to those observed in the real lamprey than Ekeberg's hand-crafted model.",

The study came as support for the well-established framework of Bernstein (1967), namely that of an initial freezing of the distal degrees of freedom, followed by their progressive release and the exploitation of environmental and body dynamics. In this paper, we revisit our study by introducing a nonlinear coupling between environment and system. Under otherwise unchanged experimental conditions, we show that a single phase of freezing and subsequent freeing of degrees of freedom is not sufficient to achieve optimal performance, and instead, alternate freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom is required. The interest of this result is twofold: (1) it confirms the recent observation by Newell &amp; Vaillancourt (2001) that Bernstein’s (1967) framework may be too narrow to account for real data; (2) it suggests that perturbations that push the system outside its postural stability or increase the task complexity may be the mechanism that triggers alternate freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom.",

These methods do not capture the role of environmental complexity in shaping the selective pressures that control the adaptive process. Ecological simulations enabled by computational tools such as the latent energy environment (LEE) model allow us to characterize more closely the effects of environmental complexity on the evolution of adaptive behaviors. LEE is described in this article. Motivation for the development of the LEE model arises from the need to vary complexity in controlled and predictable ways, without assuming the relationship of these changes to the adaptive behaviors they engender. This goal is achieved through a careful characterization of environments in which different forms of \"energy\" are well defined. A genetic algorithm using endogenous fitness, and local selection is used to model the evolutionary process. Individuals in the population are modeled by neural networks with simple sensorimotor systems, and variations in their behaviors are related to interactions with varying environments. We outline the results of three experiments that analyze different sources of environmental complexity and their effects on the collective behaviors of evolving populations.",

This controller robustness was demonstrated by inducing a wide variety of lesions (severing of connections) and performing parameter sensitivity studies.",

Population learning allows popula tions as a whole to evolve over time, typically through a Darwinian model of natural selection. Lifetime learning allows individuals to acquire knowledge during their lifetimes and cultural learning allows indi viduals to pass this knowledge to their peers or subsequent generations. This work examines the effects of cultural learning on both the fitness and the diversity of a population of neural network agents. A population employing population learning alone and one employing both population and cultural learning are assigned three benchmark tasks: the 5-bit parity problem, the game of tic-tac-toe and the game of connect-four. Each agent contains a genome which encodes a neural network controller used by the agent to perceive and react to environmental stimuli. Results show that the addition of cultural learning promotes improved fitness and significantly increases both genotypic (the genetic make up of individuals) and phenotypic (the behavior of individuals) diversity in the population.",

They employ templates (or pat terns) in the environment to guide construction tasks and robot swarms can use similar mechanisms. Early work examined how a spatio-temporal varying template can be utilized by a swarm of minimalist robots to build the framework for a linear wall. From this, it became clear that a method for regulating construction in a variable environment was needed. To this end, a social insect inspired distributed feedback mechanism is proposed and verified. Direct and indirect transfer of information between individuals, through the use of signals and cues, is shown to facilitate closure of a feedback loop allowing the system to operate close to optimally. Perturbation experiments demonstrate the robotic swarm's ability to adapt to environmental changes.

Group transport can even be performed by robots that behave as in solitary transport. Still, robots engaged in group transport can benefit from behaving differently from robots engaged in solitary transport. The best group transport behaviors yielded by half of the evolutions let robots organize into self-assembled structures. This provides evidence that self-assembly can provide adaptive value to individuals that compete in an artificial evolution based on task performance.

An agent-based model has been used to study the role of small-world social network topologies on general opinion change in the presence of extremists. It has been found that opinion convergence to a single extreme occurs only when the average number of network connections for each individual is extremely high. Here, we extend the model to examine the effect of positively skewed degree distributions, in addition to small-world structures, on the types of opinion convergence that occur in the presence of extremists. We also examine what happens when extremist opinions are located on the well-connected nodes (hubs) created by the positively skewed distribution. We find that a positively skewed network topology encourages opinion convergence on a single extreme under a wider range of conditions than topologies whose degree distributions were not skewed. The importance of social position for social influence is highlighted by the result that, when positive extremists are placed on hubs, all population convergence is to the positive extreme even when there are twice as many negative extremists. Thus, our results have shown the importance of considering a positively skewed degree distribution, and in particular network hubs and social position, when examining extremist transmission.",

The results show that males have a greater variance in reproductive success than females; they tend always to be very active looking for the ‘‘scarce resource’’ constituted by reproductive females and eating any food they are able to find while they are looking for reproductive females. Reproductive females are less active than males and they adopt the reproductive strategy of waiting for males to find and mate with them. In contrast, nonreproductive females are as active as males, but they only look for food and are not interested in anything else.

A review of our present knowledge about the comparative distribution of play suggests that such an approach that leads to claims that the “adaptive value of play is” are misplaced. Play is relatively rare in the Animal Kingdom, indicating that it arose multiple times and that different lineages that have evolved play have transformed it in both divergent and convergent ways. Moreover, some forms of play, especially in its earliest appearance, may have no functional value, with novel functions emerging later as play has been co-opted and transformed for utilitarian purposes. Thus, when it comes to modeling play, care must be taken to differentiate between attempts to explain the origins of play from its current functions, and when current functions are considered, then their variety and likely diverse distribution need be taken into account. Attention to these nuances in the empirical literature, and so developing more targeted models, will provide more focused theoretical developments that can, in turn, stimulate more precise empirical tests. Examples of such models are presented in this issue of the journal.",

This can be based on contingencies of phenomena at various scales ranging from correlations between sensory signals (e.g., motor-proprioceptive loops) to high-level conceptual links (e.g., vocabulary grounding). Multiple cortical areas contain neurons whose receptive fields are tuned for signals co-occurring in multiple modalities. Moreover, the hierarchical organization of the cortex, described within the Convergence Divergence Zone framework, defines an ideal architecture to extract and make use of contingency at increasing levels of complexity. We present an artificial neural network model of the early cortical amodal computations, which we have demonstrated on the humanoid robot iCub. This model explains and predicts findings in neurophysiology and neuropsychology along with being an efficient tool to control the robot. In particular, through exploratory use of the body, the system learns a form of body schema in terms of specific modalities (e.g., arm proprioception, gaze proprioception, vision) and their multimodal contingencies. Once multimodal contingencies have been learned, the system is capable of generating and exploiting internal representations or mental images based on inputs in one of these multiple dimensions. The system thus provides insight on a possible neural substrate for mental imagery within the context of multimodal convergence.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation is one of the most fundamental behaviors and has been studied in swarm robotic researches for more than two decades. Studies in biology have revealed that the environment is a preeminent factor, especially in cue-based aggregation. This can be defined as aggregation at a particular location which is a heat or a light source acting as a cue indicating an optimal zone. In swarm robotics, studies on cue-based aggregation mainly focused on different methods of aggregation and different parameters such as population size. Although of utmost importance, environmental effects on aggregation performance have not been studied systematically. In this paper, we study the effects of different environmental factors: size, texture and number of cues in a static setting, and moving cues in a dynamic setting using real robots. We used the aggregation time and size of the aggregate as the two metrics with which to measure aggregation performance. We performed real robot experiments with different population sizes and evaluated the performance of aggregation using the defined metrics. We also proposed a probabilistic aggregation model and predicted the aggregation performance accurately in most of the settings. The results of the experiments show that environmental conditions affect the aggregation performance considerably and have to be studied in depth.",

    "abstract": "In this theoretical review article, our primary goal is to contribute to the post-cognitivist understanding of learning to perceive and perceiving as learning, by discussing a framework for perception and perceptual learning initiated by James J Gibson, and extended by Eleanor J Gibson and others. This Ecological Psychology has a coherent set of assumptions based on the concept of mutualism between the perceiving organism and its surroundings, and the idea of affordances as action possibilities of the surround that are perceptible by the organism. At the same time, Ecological Psychology, broadly construed, consists of different perspectives that take different routes to address questions related to the core concepts of perceptual learning. In this article, we focus on three theoretical stances within Ecological Psychology on the issue of perceptual learning: that of Eleanor J Gibson, the current theory of direct learning by Jacobs and Michaels, and the “organicist” approach based on ideas of organicist biology and developments in evolutionary biology. We consider perceptual learning as embedded in development and evolution, and we explore perceptual learning in more depth in the context of tool use and language development. We also discuss the relation between Ecological Psychology and Enactivism on the nature of perception. In conclusion, we summarize the benefits of Ecological Psychology, as a robust but still developing post-cognitivist framework, for the study of perceptual learning and cognitive science in general.",

Inspired by the effective use of pheromones in social insects, pheromonal communication has been adopted to swarm robotics domain using diverse approaches such as alcohol, RFID tags and light. COSΦ is one of the light-based artificial pheromone systems which can emulate realistic pheromones and environment properties through the system. This article provides a significant improvement to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel artificial pheromone system that simulates pheromones with environmental effects by adopting a model of spatio-temporal development of pheromone derived from a flow of fluid in nature. Using the proposed system, we investigated the collective behaviour of a robot swarm in a bio-inspired aggregation scenario, where robots aggregated on a circular pheromone cue with different environmental factors, that is, diffusion and pheromone shift. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed pheromone system for use in swarm robotic applications.",

    "abstract": "Many insects use view-based navigation, or snapshot matching, to return to familiar locations, or navigate routes. This relies on egocentric memories being matched to current views of the world. Previous Snapshot navigation algorithms have used full panoramic vision for the comparison of memorised images with query images to establish a measure of familiarity, which leads to a recovery of the original heading direction from when the snapshot was taken. Many aspects of insect sensory systems are lateralised with steering being derived from the comparison of left and right signals like a classic Braitenberg vehicle. Here, we investigate whether view-based route navigation can be implemented using bilateral visual familiarity comparisons. We found that the difference in familiarity between estimates from left and right fields of view can be used as a steering signal to recover the original heading direction. This finding extends across many different sizes of field of view and visual resolutions. In insects, steering computations are implemented in a brain region called the Lateral Accessory Lobe, within the Central Complex. In a simple simulation, we show with an SNN model of the LAL an existence proof of how bilateral visual familiarity could drive a search for a visually defined goal.",

However, these models were usually tested in different tasks, and it is then difficult to compare their efficiency for an autonomous animat. We present here the comparison of four architectures in an animat as it per forms the same reward-seeking task. This will illustrate the consequences of different hypotheses about the management of different Actor sub-modules and Critic units, and their more or less autono mously determined coordination. We show that the classical method of coordination of modules by mixture of experts, depending on each module’s performance, did not allow solving our task. Then we address the question of which principle should be applied efficiently to combine these units. Improve ments for Critic modeling and accuracy of Actor–Critic models for a natural task are finally discussed in the perspective of our Psikharpax project—an artificial rat having to survive autonomously in unpre dictable environments.",

This article models the taxon system, the map-based system, and their interaction, and argues that the map-based system involves the interaction of hippocampus and other systems. We relate taxes to the notion of an affordance. Just as a rat may have basic taxes for approaching food or avoiding a bright light, so does it have a wider repertoire of affordances for possible actions associated with immediate sensing of its environment. We propose that affordances are extracted by the rat posterior parietal cortex, which guides action selection by the premotor cortex and is influenced also by hypothalamic drive information. The taxon-affordances model (TAM) for taxon-based determination of movement direction is based on models of frog detour behavior, with expectations of future reward implemented using reinforcement learning. The specification of the direction of movement is refined by current affordances and motivational information to yield an appropriate course of action. The world graph (WG) theory expands the idea of a map by developing the hypothesis that cognitive and motivational states interact. This article describes an implementation of this theory, the WG model. The integrated TAM-WG model then allows us to explain data on the behavior of rats with and without fornix lesions, which disconnect the hippocampus from other neural systems.",

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with training an agent to perform sequential behavior. In previous work, we have been applying reinforcement learning techniques to control a reactive agent. Obviously, a purely reactive system is limited in the kind of interactions it can learn. In particular, it can learn what we call pseudosequences—that is, sequences of actions in which each action is selected on the basis of current sensory stimuli. It cannot learn proper sequences, in which actions must be selected also on the basis of some internal state. Moreover, it is a result of our research that effective learning of proper sequences is improved by letting the agent and the trainer communicate. First, we consider trainer-to-agent communication, introducing the concept of reinforcement sensor, which lets the learning robot explicitly know whether the last reinforcement was a reward or a punishment. We also show how the use of this sensor makes error recovery rules emerge. Then we introduce agent-to-trainer communication, which is used to disambiguate ambiguous training situations—that is, situations in which the observation of the agent's behavior does not provide the trainer with enough information to decide whether the agent's move is right or wrong. We also show an alternative solution to the problem of ambiguous situations, which involves learning to coordinate behavior in a simpler, unambiguous setting and then transferring what has been learned to a more complex situation. All the design choices we make are discussed and compared by means of experiments in a simulated world.",

Prior quantitative models of these trade-offs, however, have addressed only morphological phenotypic traits, such as body size. We argue that the development of behavioral skills prior to reproductive maturity also constitutes an advantage of delayed maturation and thus should be included among the factors determining the trade-off for optimal age at maturity. Empirical support for this hypothesis from animal field studies is abundant. This article provides further evidence drawn from simulation experiments. Latent energy environments (LEE) are a class of tightly controlled environments in which learning organisms are modeled by neural networks and evolve according to a type of genetic algorithm. An advantage of this artificial world is that it becomes possible to discount all nonbehavioral costs of early maturity in order to focus exclusively on behavioral consequences. Despite large selective costs imposed on parental fitness due to prolonged immaturity, the optimal age at maturity is shown to be significantly delayed when offspring learn from their parents' behavior via imitation.",

The core of the article is devoted to a careful analysis of the complex evolutionary dynamics demonstrated by our simple simulation.

Various aspects of the ecological and social environment influence the success of each of these strat egies. These findings suggest that recognition memory can play a role in promoting the evolution of cooperation, but that the effectiveness of such a simple recognition memory strategy depends on the fit between that strategy and the (ecological and social) environment in which that strategy is employed. The D-Mem strategy is able to invade only when the memory size of these agents is close to the total number of defectors in the population. However, the C-Mem strategy can invade a popula tion of defectors when memory size is one, as long as the population size is relatively small and the ecological environment promotes longer intervals between each reproductive opportunity.",

The region from which agents can successfully reach home is therefore limited to the goal's visual locale, that is, the area around the goal where the visual scene is not radically different to the goal position. Ants are known to navigate over large distances using visually guided routes consisting of a series of visual memories. Taking inspiration from such route navigation, we propose a framework for linking together local navigation methods. We implement this framework on a robotic platform and test it in a series of environments in which local navigation methods fail.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to learn such policies given only positive and negative rewards. Two contrasting approaches to RL that are currently in popular use are temporal difference (TD) methods, which learn value functions, and evolutionary methods, which optimize populations of candidate policies. Both approaches have had practical successes but few studies have directly compared them. Hence, there are no general guidelines describing their relative strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there has been little cross-collaboration, with few attempts to make them work together or to apply ideas from one to the other. In this article we aim to address these shortcomings via three empirical studies that compare these methods and investigate new ways of making them work together. First, we compare the two approaches in a benchmark task and identify variations of the task that isolate factors critical to the performance of each method. Second, we investigate ways to make evolutionary algorithms excel at on-line tasks by borrowing exploratory mechanisms traditionally used by TD methods. We present empirical results demonstrating a dramatic performance improvement. Third, we explore a novel way of making evolutionary and TD methods work together by using evolution to automatically discover good representations for TD function approximators. We present results demonstrating that this novel approach can outperform both TD and evolutionary methods alone.",

In this comprehensive review of extreme morphological weaponry in mammals, I explore specific hypotheses regarding the ecological, morphological, and behavioral correlates of different types of weaponry in order to explain why some taxa have evolved elaborate weapons while others have not. I provide evidence demonstrating that several types of defensive weaponry (e.g., spines, quills, armor, noxious anal secretions) have evolved directly in response to significantly increased potential predation risk. Further, other structures that evolved primarily for intrasexual competition (e.g., cranial weaponry, tusks) or foraging (e.g., enlarged claws) but have additional defensive benefits are more likely to be found in larger species that are able to defend themselves in physical combat.

Furthermore, we show that this methodology allows learned affordances to be dynamically redefined, depending on object similarity, resource availability, and the rhythms of the agent’s internal physiology. For example, if a resource becomes increasingly scarce, the value assigned by the agent to its related effect increases accordingly, encouraging a more active behavioral strategy to maintain physiological stability. Experimental results also suggest that a combination of motivation-driven and affordance learning in a single architecture should simplify its overall complexity while increasing its adaptivity.",

This article investigates the evolution of such combinatorial phonology with a simulated population of agents. We first argue that it is a challenge to explain the transition from holistic to combinatorial phonology, as the first agent that has a mutation for using combinatorial speech does not benefit from this in a population of agents that use a holistic signaling system. We then present a solution for this evolutionary deadlock. We present experiments that show that when a repertoire of holistic signals is optimized for distinctiveness in a population of agents, it converges to a situation in which the signals can be analyzed as combinatorial, even though the agents are not aware of this structure. We argue that in this situation adaptations for productive combinatorial phonology can spread.",

    "abstract": "Copepods are important grazers on microplankton in marine food webs and are, in turn, preyed upon by a wide range of predators with diverse feeding adaptations. Although copepods have evolved numerous adaptations to help them avoid predation, their escape behavior sets them apart from many other planktonic organisms. Mechanoreception is widely used by copepods to detect hydrodynamic disturbances created by approaching predators. When these disturbances are detected, copepods respond quickly with escape jumps that can accelerate them from a stationary position to speeds of over 600 body lengths per second within a few milliseconds. Myelinated nerves may improve the escape behavior of some copepods through faster conduction of nerve impulses. The differences in response latencies between myelinate and amyelinate copepod species are greatest in larger copepod species, where nerve signals must be conducted over longer distances. Environmental variability such as turbulence may affect the ability of both prey to detect predators and predators to capture their planktonic prey. Small amounts of turbulence favor the predator, while too much turbulence reduces predation. Understanding the sensory physiology of copepods and their behavioral adaptations for avoiding predation will increase knowledge of the factors affecting the structure and function of marine pelagic food webs.",

    "abstract": "The notion of a universal intelligence test has been recently advocated as a means to assess humans, non-human animals and machines in an integrated, uniform way. While the main motivation has been the development of machine intelligence tests, the mere concept of a universal test has many implications in the way human intelligence tests are understood, and their relation to other tests in comparative psychology and animal cognition. From this diversity of subjects in the natural and artificial kingdoms, the very possibility of constructing a universal test is still controversial. In this paper we rephrase the question of whether universal intelligence tests are possible or not into the question of how universal intelligence tests can be, in terms of subjects, interfaces and resolutions. We discuss the feasibility and difficulty of universal tests depending on several levels according to what is taken for granted: the communication milieu, the resolution, the reward system or the agent itself. We argue that such tests must be highly adaptive, i.e. that tasks, resolution, rewards and communication have to be adapted according to how the evaluated agent is reacting and performing. Even so, the most general expression of a universal test may not be feasible (and, at best, might only be theoretically semi-computable). Nonetheless, in general, we can analyze the universality in terms of some traits that lead to several levels of universality and set the quest for universal tests as a progressive rather than absolute goal.",

    "abstract": "Efficient skill acquisition is crucial for creating versatile robots. One intuitive way to teach a robot new tricks is to demonstrate a task and enable the robot to imitate the demonstrated behavior. This approach is known as imitation learning. Classical methods of imitation learning, such as inverse reinforcement learning or behavioral cloning, suffer substantially from the correspondence problem when the actions (i.e. motor commands, torques or forces) of the teacher are not observed or the body of the teacher differs substantially, e.g., in the actuation. To address these drawbacks we propose to learn a robot-specific controller that directly matches robot trajectories with observed ones. We present a novel and robust probabilistic model-based approach for solving a probabilistic trajectory matching problem via policy search. For this purpose, we propose to learn a probabilistic model of the system, which we exploit for mental rehearsal of the current controller by making predictions about future trajectories. These internal simulations allow for learning a controller without permanently interacting with the real system, which results in a reduced overall interaction time. Using long-term predictions from this learned model, we train robot-specific controllers that reproduce the expert’s distribution of demonstrations without the need to observe motor commands during the demonstration. The strength of our approach is that it addresses the correspondence problem in a principled way. Our method achieves a higher learning speed than both model-based imitation learning based on dynamics motor primitives and trial-and-error-based learning systems with hand-crafted cost functions. We successfully applied our approach to imitating human behavior using a tendon-driven compliant robotic arm. Moreover, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our approach in a multi-task learning setup.",

Task partitioning impacts tasks execution and associated costs. Our approach is characterized by the use of a cost function, mapping the size of sub-tasks to the overall task cost. The robots model the cost function and use the model to select sub-tasks to perform, aiming to minimize costs. Our approach separates the task partitioning process from task-specific actions and it does not require a priori assumptions to be made about the best partitioning strategy to employ. We study a foraging scenario in which object transportation is performed by different robots, each moving objects for a limited distance. The robots autonomously decide the distance traveled on the basis of our approach. The robots use odometry for navigational purposes; we show that task partitioning reduces the impact of odometry errors and improves performance. We validate our approach using simulation-based experiments. We study how the swarm partitions transportation under a number of experimental conditions characterized by different levels of odometry accuracy, size of the environment and the swarm, and total transportation distance. Our approach leads to partitioning solutions that are appropriate for each condition.",

However, concepts like structural coupling and autonomy are not strong enough to throw light on language and human problem solving. The argument is presented though a case study where a person solves a problem and, in so doing relies on non-local aspects of the ecology as well as his observer’s mental domain. Like Anthony Chemero we make links with ecological psychology to emphasize how embodiment draws on cultural resources as people concert thinking, action and perception. We trace this to human interactivity or sense-saturated coordination that renders possible language and human forms of cognition: it links human sense-making to historical experience. People play roles with natural and cultural artifacts as they act, animate groups and live through relationships drawing on language that is, at once, artificial and natural. Thus, while constrained by wordings, interactivity is able to fine-tune what we do with action-perception loops. Neither language nor human problem solving reduce to biological sense-making.",

With this rich concept, we open the way to new ways to understand the multimodal and complex nature of emotional mechanisms. Based on the grounded emotional mechanisms of human cognition and behaviour (that is, based and result of the bodily structure and its coupled relationship with the natural and/or social environment), the purpose of this paper is focused on the definition of a framework for the design of a taxonomy of emotional affordances, useful for a modal and improved understanding of the domains of emotional interactions that can emerge between humans and robots. This process will make possible in next research steps to define processing modules as well as to elicit visual display outputs (expressing emotions). Consequently, with this project we provide robotic experts with a unified taxonomy of human emotional affordances, useful for the improvement of HRI projects.",

These two established findings, however, are rarely related within a single framework. This article bridges this gap via the development of a very simple evolutionary algorithm that tracks both directional selection and the evolution of plasticity under various synthetic climatic regimes. The output of the model allows for the construction of a dispersal index that provides a measure of population-level dispersal potential under each particular climatic regime. The output thus establishes both the timing and extent of selection for plasticity and the consequences of that plasticity for the timing of probable dispersal events in the context of climatic instability. Results suggest that periods of low climatic instability abruptly following extended periods of higher climatic instability are particularly conducive to dispersal, leading to the formulation of the Accumulated Plasticity Hypothesis. These results, and the hypothesis they support, are discussed in relation to the varied manifestations of plasticity in biological systems and their relevance to human evolution.",

    "abstract": "To ensure cooperation in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, individuals may require prior commitments from others, subject to compensations when agreements to cooperate are violated. Alternatively, individuals may prefer to behave reactively, without arranging prior commitments, by simply punishing those who misbehave. These two mechanisms have been shown to promote the emergence of cooperation, yet are complementary in the way they aim to promote cooperation. Although both mechanisms have their specific limitations, either one of them can overcome the problems of the other. On one hand, costly punishment requires an excessive effect-to-cost ratio to be successful, and this ratio can be significantly reduced by arranging a prior commitment with a more limited compensation. On the other hand, commitment-proposing strategies can be suppressed by free-riding strategies that commit only when someone else is paying the cost to arrange the deal, whom in turn can be dealt with more effectively by reactive punishers. Using methods from Evolutionary Game Theory, we present here an analytical model showing that there is a wide range of settings for which the combined strategy outperforms either strategy by itself, leading to significantly higher levels of cooperation. Interestingly, the improvement is most significant when the cost of arranging commitments is sufficiently high and the penalty reaches a certain threshold, thereby overcoming the weaknesses of both mechanisms.",

We discuss evidence for memory, basic forms of learning and economically irrational choice in P. polycephalum. We compare P. polycephalum’s behaviour with a number of other non-neuronal organisms in order to question the evolutionary need for complex nervous systems to develop cognitive traits. By highlighting a few examples of common mechanisms, we conclude that all organisms contain the building blocks for more complex information processing.

While the study of perceptual learning in terms of perceptual information and perceiver–environment interactions is common in the ecological literature, ecological psychology still lacks a story regarding the way perceptual information is detected by perceptual systems and the plasticity of such detection in learning events. In this article, I propose the ecological notion of resonance—along with biophysical resonance, non-linear resonance, and metastability—as a plausible foundation to account for the process of detection of perceptual information both in perceptual events and in events of perceptual learning.",

    "abstract": "Upon starting a collective endeavour, it is important to understand your partners’ preferences and how strongly they commit to a common goal. Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for different selection intensities. Overall, our analysis provides new insights into the complexity and beauty of behavioural evolution driven by humans’ capacity for commitment, as well as for the design of self-organised and distributed multi-agent systems for ensuring coordination among autonomous agents.",

Our initial aim is to discuss how to frame the affordance concept to make it attractive for the study of creativity. We propose a dialectic position that reconciles aspects of the realism of ecological psychology with the constructivist view more typical of creativity scholars. We stress that novel options frequently depend on constructive actions; novelty cannot always simply be “found” or just waits to be used. Many creative opportunities only emerge from how person actively engages with the ecology. Our second aim is to explore specific ways that creativity is mediated through affordances, based on illustrations from crafts and dance. These suggest that affordances span various timescales and mediate in multiple ways, from noticing existing potentials, via active affordance shaping, to background activities that indirectly invite or enable novelty. In conclusion we discuss how a person’s creative “vision,” imagination and combinatoric ability, all fundamental creativity mechanisms, relate to affordances and how fruitful creative directions may be perceptually hinted at.",

    "abstract": "Prediction is an important foundation of cognitive and intelligent behavior. However, how such predictive capabilities emerged from simple organisms has not been investigated fully. Our prior works have shown the relationship between input delay and predictive function. Furthermore, we showed that environmental change can help predictive properties to evolve. In this paper, we investigate two other key factors contributing to the evolution of prediction. We set up a reaching task with a two-segment articulated arm with the goal of touching a moving target. In Task 1, the target’s location is received with a delay in the sensors. In Task 2, we introduced occlusion in the form of input blank-out. When the hand is too close to the moving target, the target disappears from the sensors, and reappears when it is farther than a threshold. In both tasks, prediction is needed to keep track of the target’s correct location. For the controller, we used the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. Our results from Task one indicate that an important fitness criterion for the emergence of predictive behavior is energy conservation. The results from Task two show that more occlusion leads to network types with stronger predictive power become more successful. Through our prior and current experiments, we identified four seemingly unrelated and unlikely factors that may have led to the evolution of prediction: delay, environmental change, energy constraint, and occlusion. These are prevalent conditions in the natural environment, thus it seems inevitable that predictive capabilities will emerge in evolving agents.",

    "abstract": "The collective escape of prey from predators is a classic example of adaptive behavior in animal groups. Across species, individual prey have evolved a large repertoire of evasive maneuvers to evade predators, and predators have evolved a series of hunting strategies to overcome them. With recent technological advances, empirical data on collective escape and cooperative hunting are increasingly becoming available, and large variation in the collective dynamics of different predator-prey systems is apparent. Computational models to link rules of individual behavior and collective patterns through self-organization are needed to understand this variation, but system-specific characteristics are rarely included in agent-based models of collective behavior. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a framework named DaNCES, that uses individual-based state machines to model spatiotemporal dynamics of collective predator-prey interactions. We implement it in a highly optimized software and pair it with an R package to facilitate its use. A synthetic agent in our framework can switch its behavior between continuous and discrete reactions through a dynamic Markov chain, depending on its local information. The flexibility and structure of our software allow substantial changes in a model with minimal code alterations, supporting the link between empirical data and theory. Overall, DaNCES is a valuable tool toward a standardized methodology to identify the underlying mechanisms of collective escape and cooperative hunting across species, enabling the link between individual behavior and eco-evolutionary dynamics, and offering bio-inspired solutions for autonomous artificial swarms.",

Most studies on human exploration used overly simple tasks that isolate variables but poorly reflect problems humans evolved to solve—limiting the generalizability of the results. To address this limitation, we introduce the Lockbox paradigm, a novel, ecologically valid, and challenging task that requires active exploration and physical interaction. Data from 263 participants interacting with the Lockbox across three different interaction modalities of varying interaction costs, reveal a remarkable ability to adapt and solve problems efficiently in complex scenarios. By comparing the interaction modalities, we demonstrate the critical role of cost variations, such as physical and temporal costs, in driving attentiveness and shaping exploration strategies. These findings provide important insights into human exploration strategies, with potential applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Experimental data suggest that episodic memory is involved in sequential value-based decision-making. By contrast, standard computational models of decision-making assume that prior reward outcomes are integrated into subjective values rather than remembered discretely. Previous work developed a minimal computational framework for sequential value-based decision-making that is based on noisy sampling of episodic memories, rather than calculating value. We called these agents “Imperfect Memory Programs” (IMPs) and showed how their single free parameter optimizes the trade-off between the magnitude of error and the complexity of imperfect recall. Here, we develop biologically plausible approximations to the IMPs with lossy agents (LIMPs) that maintain only 1 bit of reward memory for binary outcomes but fail to encode rewards with some probability. Both IMPs and LIMPs perform similarly to or better than a simple agent with perfect memory in multiple classic decision-making tasks and generate phenomenology that resembles value-based computations. We find that allowing different encoding probabilities for rewards and omissions improves performance further and allows to trade-off matching versus maximizing behavior, as well as flexible versus stable performance. Together, these results suggest that episodic agents can approximate value-based agents through capitalizing on realistic encoding and/or sampling noise. This suggests that mnemonic errors (1) can improve, rather than impair decision-making and (2) provide a plausible alternative explanation for some behavioral correlates of “value”.",

Building on a previously published baseline model, we re-examined the original ten-feature representation to evaluate whether focused, theory-driven refinements could improve model performance without altering the preprocessing pipeline. The revised feature set includes distance variability, face visibility, and a merged negative affect channel, alongside existing measures of gesture intensity, perceived proximity, and facial expressions. Models were trained and validated on a dataset of 403 annotated 30-second video segments from German secondary school classrooms. We evaluated four classical regressors—linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and extra trees—alongside the original multilayer perceptron (MLP). The refined MLP improved the correlation with human ratings from 0.44 to 0.49 and showed the most consistent prediction errors across teachers. Feature sensitivity analysis confirmed that the model’s predictions aligned with theoretical expectations: greater proximity, facial visibility, and expressive gestures were associated with higher immediacy. These results highlight the value of integrating behavioral theory into model design and support the use of automated tools for scalable, interpretable analysis of nonverbal communication in classroom settings.",

In particular, two very common preconceptions about the subject are analyzed: the role of natural selection in the definition of the phenomenon of communication and the metaphor of communication as information exchange. An alternative characterization is presented in terms of autopoietic theory, which avoids the mentioned preconceptions. In support of this view, the evolution of coordinated activity is studied in a population of artificial agents playing an interactional game. Dynamical modeling of this evolutionary process based on game-theoretical considerations shows the existence of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the total lack of coordinated activity which, however, may be unreachable due to the presence of a periodic attractor. In a computational model of the same game, action coordination evolves even with individual costs against it, due to the presence of spatial structuring processes. A detailed explanation of this phenomenon, which does not require kin selection, is presented. In an extended game, recursive coordination evolves nontrivially when the participants share all the relevant information, demonstrating that the metaphor of information exchange can be misleading. It is shown that agents engaged in this sort of interaction are able to perform beyond their individual capabilities.",

This article presents a survey of recent methods in GEC-developed mobile robot controllers, focusing on those methods that include a physical robot at some point in the learning loop. It simultaneously relates each of these methods to a framework of two orthogonal issues: the use of a simulated and/or a physical robot, and the use of finite, training phase evolution prior to a task and/or lifelong adaptation by evolution during a task. A list of evaluation criteria are presented and each of the surveyed methods are compared to them. Analyses of the framework and evaluation criteria suggest several possibilities; however, there appear to be particular advantages in combining simulated, training phase evolution (TPE) with lifelong adaptation by evolution (LAE) on a physical robot.",

In this article, we suggest control circuits to realize three of the most basic oculomotor behaviors and their integration: the vestibulo-ocular reflex and optokinetic response (VOR–OKR) for gaze stabilization, smooth pursuit for tracking moving objects, and saccades for overt visual attention. Each of these behaviors and the mechanism for their integration were derived with inspiration from computational theories as well as behavioral and physiological data in neuroscience. Our implementations on humanoid demonstrate good performance of oculomotor behaviors, which proves to be a viable strategy to explore novel control mechanisms for humanoid robotics.

The performance and robustness of different agent strategies is evaluated, emphasizing the important role that courtship plays in mate choice. Specifically, the courtship period can be used by individuals to swap to better partners when they become available. We found that using courtship as a mechanism for holding partners before full commitment to mating provides strategic advantages relative to sequential search using aspiration levels. Moreover, simple heuristics that require little computation provide a degree of robustness to environmental (parameter) changes that is unattainable by strategies based on more extensive information processing. Our model produces realistic patterns of assortative mating (high within-couple mate value correlations) and rates of mating that match empirical data on human sexual/romantic relationships much more closely than previous accounts from biology and the social sciences.",

This has led to the adoption of rule representations that ease the expression of existing knowledge. A second theme is that adaptation can be driven by competition among knowledge structures. Competition is applied at two levels in SAMUEL. Within a strategy composed of decision rules, rules compete with one another to influence the behavior of the system. At a higher level of granularity, entire strategies compete with one another, driven by a genetic algorithm.

    "abstract": "Plastic spiking neural networks are synthesized for phototactic robots using evolutionary techniques. Synaptic plasticity asymmetrically depends on the precise relative timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes at the millisecond range and on longer-term activity-dependent regulatory scaling. Comparative studies have been carried out for different kinds of plastic neural networks with low and high levels of neural noise. In all cases, the evolved controllers are highly robust against internal synaptic decay and other perturbations. The importance of the precise timing of spikes is demonstrated by randomizing the spike trains. In the low neural noise scenario, weight values undergo rhythmic changes at the mesoscale due to bursting, but during periods of high activity they are finely regulated at the microscale by synchronous or entrained firing. Spike train randomization results in loss of performance in this case. In contrast, in the high neural noise scenario, robots are robust to loss of information in the timing of the spike trains, demonstrating the counterintuitive results that plasticity, which is dependent on precise spike timing, can work even in its absence, provided the behavioral strategies make use of robust longer-term invariants of sensorimotor interaction. A comparison with a rate-based model of synaptic plasticity shows that under similarly noisy conditions, asymmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity achieves better performance by means of efficient reduction in weight variance over time. Performance also presents negative sensitivity to reduced levels of noise, showing that random firing has a functional value.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses qualitative and quantitative diversity and specialization issues in the framework of self-organizing, distributed, artificial systems. Both diversity and specialization are obtained via distributed learning from initially homogeneous swarms. While measuring diversity essentially quantifies differences among the individuals, assessing the degree of specialization implies correlation between the swarm’s heterogeneity with its overall performance. Starting from the stick-pulling experiment in collective robotics, a task that requires the collaboration of two robots, we abstract and generalize in simulation the task constraints to k robots collaborating sequentially or in parallel. We investigate quantitatively the influence of task constraints and types of reinforcement signals on performance, diversity, and specialization in these collaborative experiments. Results show that, though diversity is not explicitly rewarded in our learning algorithm, even in scenarios without explicit communication among agents the swarm becomes specialized after learning. The degrees of both diversity and specialization are affected strongly by environmental conditions and task constraints. While the specialization measure reveals characteristics related to performance and learning in a clearer way than diversity does, the latter measure appears to be less sensitive to different noise conditions and learning parameters.",

    "abstract": "A preference is not located anywhere in the agent's cognitive architecture, but it is rather a constraining of behavior which is in turn shaped by behavior. Based on this idea, a minimal model of behavioral preference is proposed. A simulated mobile agent is modeled with a plastic neurocontroller, which holds two separate high dimensional homeostatic boxes in the space of neural dynamics. An evolutionary algorithm is used for creating a link between the boxes and the performance of two different phototactic behaviors. After evolution, the agent's performance exhibits some important aspects of behavioral preferences such as durability and transitions. This article demonstrates (1) the logical consistency of the multi-causal view by producing a case study of its viability and providing insights into its dynamical basis and (2) how durability and transitions arise through the mutual constraining of internal and external dynamics in the flow of alternating high and low susceptibility to environmental variations. Implications for modeling autonomy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Emotion plays an important role in thinking. In this article we study affective control of the amount of simulated anticipatory behavior in adaptive agents using a computational model. Our approach is based on model-based reinforcement learning (RL) and inspired by the simulation hypothesis (Cotterill, 2001; Hesslow, 2002). The simulation hypothesis states that thinking is internal simulation of behavior using the same sensory-motor systems as those used for overt behavior. Here, we study the adaptiveness of an artificial agent, when action-selection bias is induced by an affect-controlled amount of simulated anticipatory behavior . To this end, we introduce an affect-controlled simulation-selection mechanism that uses the predictions of the agent's RL model to select anticipatory behaviors for simulation. Based on eXperiments with adaptive agents in two nondeterministic partially observable grid-worlds we conclude that (1) internal simulation has an adaptive benefit and (2) affective control can reduce the amount of simulation needed for this benefit. This is specifically the case if the following relation holds: positive affect decreases the amount of simulation towards simulating the best potential neXt action, while negative affect increases the amount of simulation towards simulating all potential neXt actions. In essence we use artificial affect to control mental eXploration versus eXploitations. Thus, agents “feeling positive” can think ahead in a narrow sense and free up working memory resources, while agents “feeling negative” must think ahead in a broad sense and maXimize usage of working memory. Our results are consistent with several psychological findings on the relation between affect and learning, and contribute to answering the question of when positive versus negative affect is useful during adaptation.",

We present a computational model of how human infants or other agents may acquire gaze following by learning to predict the locations of interesting sights from the looking behavior of other agents through reinforcement learning. The model accounts for many findings about the development of gaze following in human infants. During learning, the model develops pre-motor representations that exhibit many properties characteristic of mirror neurons, but they are specific to looking behaviors. The existence of such a new class of mirror neurons is the main prediction of our model. The model also offers a parsimonious account of how these and possibly other mirror neurons may acquire their special response properties. In this account, visual representations of other agents' actions become associated with pre-motor neurons that represent the intention to perform corresponding actions. The model also demonstrates how this development may be obstructed in autism spectrum disorder, giving rise to specific physiological and anatomical differences in the mirror system.",

A key conclusion is that while cnidarians (e.g. jellyfish) appear to have discovered some good tricks for the design of behavior-based control systems—largely lacking specialized selection mechanisms—the emergence of bilaterians may have forced the evolution of a central ganglion, or “archaic brain”, whose main function is to resolve conflicts between peripheral systems. Whilst vertebrates have many interesting selection substrates it is likely that here too the evolution of centralized structures such as the medial reticular formation and the basal ganglia may have been a forced move because of the need to limit connection costs as brains increased in size.",

As we show, despite this considered trade-off, there exist environments in which a combined adaptation scheme is optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal adaptive behavior produced by a particular distribution of population- and individual-level adaptation depends on the environmental dynamics.

    "abstract": "Computational models of motivation are tools that artificial agents can use to identify, prioritize, select and adapt the goals they will pursue autonomously. Previous research has focused on developing computational models of motivation that permit artificial agents to exhibit characteristics such as adaptive exploration, problem-finding behavior, competence-seeking behavior, and creativity. This permits self-motivated agents to identify novel or interesting goals not specifically programmed by system engineers, or adapt in complex or uncertain environments where it is difficult for system engineers to identify all possible goals in advance. However, existing computational models of motivation cover only a small subset of psychological motivation theories. There remains potential to draw on other psychological motivation theories to create artificial agents with new behavioral characteristics. This includes agents that can strive for standards of excellence, both internal and external; agents that can proactively socialize and build relationships with others; and agents that can exert their influence to gain control of resources. With these objectives in mind, this article expands our ‘‘motivation toolbox’’ with three new computational models of motivation for achievement, affiliation, and power motivation. The models are designed such that they can be used in isolation or together, embedded in an artificial ‘‘motive profile.’’ To validate the new models of motivation, three experiments are presented that compare the goal-selecting behavior of artificial agents with different motive profiles with that of humans with corresponding motive profiles. Results show that agents with different motive profiles exhibit different goal-selection characteristics, and that these various characteristics are statistically similar to behavioral trends observed experimentally in humans. The article concludes by discussing areas for the future development of each motivation model and the future roles and applications of agents with different motive profiles.",

By making use of the robot’s manipulation capabilities and force sensing, we introduce additional information that can be utilized to reliably separate unknown objects from the background. Once an object has been identified, the robot can continuously manipulate it to accumulate more information about it and learn its complete visual appearance. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by applying it to the problem of autonomous learning of visual representations for viewpoint-independent object recognition on a humanoid robot.",

However, it is not known at present why learning walks take the stereotypical shapes they do. Here we investigate how learning-walk form, visual surroundings and the interaction between the two affect homing performance in a range of virtual worlds when using a simple view-based homing algorithm. We show that the ideal form for a learning walk is environment-specific. We also demonstrate that the distant panorama and small objects at an intermediate distance, particularly when the panorama is obscured, are important aspects of the visual environment both when determining the ideal learning walk and when using stored views to navigate.

Put in the context of the paradigmatic shift that took place between first-order and second-order cybernetics, especially in the case of Maturana’s autopoietic theory, the enactive paradigm, so I will try to show in this work, appears rather like a conservative or revisionist project. Better said, it appears as a slightly hybrid paradigm, wherein original and progressive elements coexist with revisionist components.

Much like what occurs in biological agents, each reward feature evaluates a particular aspect of the (history of) interaction of the agent history with the environment, thereby, in a sense, replicating some aspects of appraisal processes observed in humans and other animals. Our experiments in several foraging scenarios demonstrate that by optimising the relative contributions of each reward feature, the resulting “emotional” RL agents perform better than standard goal-oriented agents, particularly in consideration of their inherent perceptual limitations. Our results support the claim that biological evolutionary adaptive mechanisms such as emotions can provide crucial clues in creating robust, general-purpose reward mechanisms for autonomous artificial agents, thereby allowing them to overcome some of the challenges imposed by their inherent limitations.",

Despite sharing common objectives and clear theoretical overlap, there has to date been little to no exchange between the two fields. This paper takes this under-appreciated overlap as not only a much needed call to begin building bridges between the two areas but also as an opportunity to explore how AE could benefit from biosemiotics. As a first tentative step towards this end, the paper will draw from both fields to develop a novel synthesis – biosemiotic enactivism – which aims to clarify, develop and ultimately strengthen some key AE concepts. The paper has two main goals: (i) to propose a novel conception of cognition that could contribute to the ongoing theoretical developments of AE and (ii) to introduce some concepts and ideas from biosemiotics to the enactive community in order to stimulate further debate across the two fields.",

In this situation, the ability to master one’s movements is damaged and, in radical cases, the ability to move is lost altogether; as a result the sensorimotor loop may collapse.

    "abstract": "Until recently, propositions on the subject of intelligent service companions, like robots, were mostly user and environment independent. Our work is part of the FUI-RoboPopuli project, which concentrates on endowing entertainment companion robots with adaptive and social behavior. More precisely, we focus on the capacity of an intelligent system to learn how to personalize and adapt its behavior/actions according to its interaction situation that describes (a) the current user attributes, and (b) the current environment attributes. Our approach is based on models of the type of Markov decision processes (MDPs) that are largely used for adaptive robot applications. In order to have, as quickly as possible, a relevant adaptive behavior whatever the interaction situation, several approaches were proposed to decrease the sample complexity required to learn the MDP model, including its reward function. We argue that systems that are based on detecting important attributes for each decision are more likely to converge faster than others. To this end, we present two algorithms to learn the MDP reward function through analyzing interaction traces (i.e., the interaction history between the robot and its users including their feedback regarding the robot actions). The first algorithm is direct, certain and does not particularly exploit its knowledge to adapt to unknown situations (i.e., unknown users’ and/or environment settings). The second is able to detect the importance of certain situation attributes in the adaptation process. The detection of important attributes is used to speed up the learning process and helps by generalizing the learned reward function to unknown situations. In this paper, we present both learning algorithms, simulated experiments and an experiment with the EMOX (EMOtion eXchange) robot that was upgraded during the FUI-RoboPopuli project. The results of those experiments prove that when dealing with adaptive decision making, the detection of important attributes for each decision speeds up the learning process and help in achieving convergence using fewer samples. We also present a scaling analysis through the simulated experiments.",

    "abstract": "Work on minimal cognition raises a variety of questions concerning the boundaries of cognition. Many discussions of minimal cognition assume that the domain of minimal cognition is a subset of the domain of the living. In this article, I consider whether non-living ‘active materials’ ought to be included as instances of minimal cognition. I argue that seeing such cases as ‘minimal models’ of (minimal) cognition requires recognising them as members of a class of systems sharing the same basic features and exhibiting the same general patterns of behaviour. Minimal cognition in this sense is a very inclusive concept: rather than specifying some threshold level of cognition or a type of cognition found only in very simple systems, it is a concept of cognition associated with very minimal criteria that pick out only the most essential requirements for a system to exhibit cognitive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dynamics are multimodal, and they need to integrate real-time feedback to be adaptive and appropriate. However, cognition research still relies on mostly unimodal paradigms using simple motor tasks in laboratory-based static situations. This paper addresses this limitation by presenting the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach based on the Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive perspective, which complements traditional laboratory work while also facilitating ecologically valid applications. First, we briefly review Mobile Brain/Body Imaging technologies used to obtain functional and structural images of the Brain/Body System during natural cognition. Specifically: mobile cognitive electrophysiology, mobile functional neurovascular dynamics, and mobile behavioral measurements. Second, we review the development of Mobile Brain/Body Imaging/4E in Chile. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities. We conclude that although this new epistemic/methodological approach is promising, there is a need for greater portability, robust equipment, and data-analysis tools that can integrate signals from the brain/body-in-the-world system. Future experimental designs need to re-consider their underlying logic and increase their ecological validity by-perhaps-modifying the physical spaces in which experiments are conducted.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior requires the sensing of salient behavioral consequences which can act to modulate changes in neural connections linking sensory and motor structures. In previous work, we proposed that salient sensory events trigger neuronal value systems capable of modulating synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigate the capacity of value systems to modulate their own responses in the context of various conditioning tasks. To this end, we implement a modifiable value system incorporating anatomical and physiological properties within Darwin V, a neuronal model embedded in a mobile real world device. While exploring an environment containing stimulus objects, Darwin V's visual maps develop object-related neuronal responses. Phasic responses of a value system initially triggered only by object-\"taste\" (innate value) modulate changes in connections between visual and motor neurons, thus linking specific visual responses to appropriate motor outputs. Over time, Darwin V is able behaviorally to discriminate between \"striped\" objects with positive value (appetitive behavior) and objects with \"blobs\" with negative value (aversive behavior) based on vision alone. In parallel with modification of visuo-motor connections, value-dependent modification also occurs in connections from visual sensory maps to the value system itself. As a result, visual activity patterns become able directly to trigger value signals (acquired value). If acquired value is disabled, transfer of the value signal to stimuli preceding innately salient events does not occur, and behavioral responses due to aversive conditioning are subject to rapid extinction. If an auditory signal reliably precedes the visual appearance of an aversive object, Darwin V could be conditioned first to reject the object based on vision (primary conditioning), and subsequently based on sound alone (secondary conditioning). We compare the functional characteristics of value-dependent learning to formal notions of reinforcement learning. We suggest that plasticity in sensory afferents to value systems may provide a neurobiological basis for mediating the changing effects of saliency on adaptive behavioral responses.",

The focus of the analysis is on how short-term memory is realized in such control networks through the dynamic modulation of sensorimotor mappings (rather than through feedback of neuronal activation, as in conventional recurrent nets), and how these internal dynamics interact with environmental/behavioral dynamics. In particular, it is demonstrated in the analysis of the last experimental scenario how this type of network can make very selective use of feedback/memory, while as far as possible limiting itself to the use of reactive sensorimotor mechanisms and occasional switches between them.",

This “artificial ethology” is applied to a controller with a decentralized structure that uses essential design characteristics of its biological model, the stick insect. The system takes advantage of recurrent connections that establish a loop through the environment. Despite its completely reactive nature, the system can adapt to unpredictable external conditions with no need for specific reprogramming. Leg trajectories are always adapted such that mechanical stress is reduced. This even holds true for special situations like, for example, walking over obstacles, stumbling, or walking with partially or totally amputated legs.

We start with the sim ulation environment of Hinton and Nowlan in which individual learning was shown to guide genetic evolution towards a difficult adaptive goal. We then consider, in lieu of individual learn ing, culture in the form of social learning by imitation. Our results demonstrate that when genes and culture cooperate, or enhance one another, culture too is able to guide genetic evolution towards an adaptive goal. Further, we show that social learning is superior to individual learning insofar as it with genetic evolution converges more quickly to the goal. However, the social learn ing algorithm results in slower genetic assimilation of adaptive alleles than with individual learn ing. It is as if, we argue, the adaptive values are stored in the culture rather than in the genes. Finally, we consider what happens when culture and genes pursue diametrically opposed goals. Here we show that culture, in the form of social learning, is no real match when opposed to genet ic evolution with individual learning. In fact, only the most herculean of social learning algorithms is able to keep a neutralizing toe-hold against the slow plodding force of genetic evolution. Finally, our results suggest that in both cases, opposition and enhancement, transmission forces such as the ratio of teacher to learner are central to the success of social learning.",

The evolved synaptic plasticity dynamics give rise to varying exploration/exploitation levels and to the well-documented choice strategies of risk aversion and probability matching. Additionally, risk aversion is shown to emerge even when bees are evolved in a completely risk-less environment. In contrast to existing theories in economics and game theory, risk-averse behavior is shown to be a direct consequence of (near-)optimal reinforcement learning, without requiring additional assumptions such as the existence of a nonlinear subjective utility function for rewards. Our results are corroborated by a rigorous mathematical analysis, and their robustness in real-world situations is supported by experiments in a mobile robot. Thus we provide a biologically founded, parsimonious, and novel explanation for risk aversion and probability matching.",

The importance of an adaptive controller is illustrated with the simulations of biped walking on uneven terrain, and the results show that the biped robot successfully copes with environmental perturbation by dynamically changing the torque outputs applied to the joints.

Networks that evolved in rich conditions showed higher behavioral flexibility and robustness, and higher neural complexity, than networks that evolved in simple conditions. The magnitude of neural complexity, which reflects a balance between dynamical integration and dynamical segregation, depended on properties of both the environment and the head/eye phenotype.

Model parameters were systematically varied to simulate developmental change in three neural components of visual selective attention: degree of oculomotor noise, growth of horizontal connections in visual cortex, and duration of recurrent processing in parietal cortex. While two of the three components—horizontal connections and recurrent parietal processing—are each able to account for the visual search performance of 3-month-olds, recurrent parietal processing also suggests a coherent pattern of developmental change in visual selective attention during early infancy. We conclude by highlighting plausible neural mechanisms for modulating recurrent parietal activity, including the development of feedback from prefrontal cortex.",

In this article, we study emergent communication behaviors that are not predetermined by the experimenter, but are shaped by artificial evolution, together with the rest of the behavioral repertoire of the robots. In particular, we describe a set of experiments in which artificial evolution is used as a means to engineer robot neuro-controllers capable of guiding groups of robots in a categorization task by producing appropriate actions. The categorization is a result of how robots' sensory inputs unfold in time, and, more specifically, of the integration over time of sensory input. In spite of the absence of explicit selective pressure (coded into the fitness function), which would favor signaling over non-signaling groups, communicative behavior emerges. Post-evaluation analyses illustrate the adaptive function of the evolved signals and show that these signals are tightly linked to the behavioral repertoire of the agents. Signals evolve because communication enhances group performance, revealing a “hidden” benefit for social behavior. This benefit is related to obtaining robust and fast decision-making mechanisms. More generally, we show how processes requiring the categorization of noisy dynamical information might be improved by social interactions mediated by communication. In a further series of experiments, we successfully download evolved controllers onto real s-bots. We discuss the challenges involved in porting neuro-controllers displaying time-based decision-making processes onto real robots. Finally, the beneficial effect of communication is shown to transfer to the case of a real robot, and the robustness of the behavior against inter-robot differences is discussed.",

We address two questions: Can the learning without synaptic plasticity approach be extended to continuous tasks? And if so, how does learning without synaptic plasticity work in the evolved circuits? Analysis of the most successful circuits to learn discrete stimuli reveal finite state machine (FSM) like internal dynamics.

    "abstract": "Designing an adaptive multi-agent system often requires the specification of interaction patterns between the different agents. To date, it remains unclear to what extent such interaction patterns influence the dynamics of the learning mechanisms inherent to each agent in the system. Here, we address this fundamental problem, both analytically and via computer simulations, examining networks of agents that engage in stag-hunt games with their neighbors and thereby learn to coordinate their actions. We show that the specific network topology does not affect the game strategy the agents learn on average. Yet, network features such as heterogeneity and clustering effectively determine how this average game behavior arises and how it manifests itself. Network heterogeneity induces variation in learning speed, whereas network clustering results in the emergence of clusters of agents with similar strategies. Such clusters also form when the network structure is not predefined, but shaped by the agents themselves. In that case, the strategy of an agent may become correlated with that of its neighbors on the one hand, and with its degree on the other hand. Here, we show that the presence of such correlations drastically changes the overall learning behavior of the agents. As such, our work provides a clear-cut picture of the learning dynamics associated with networks of agents trying to optimally coordinate their actions.",

    "abstract": "One of the main assertions of sensorimotor contingency theory is that sensory experience is not generated by activating an internal representation of the outside world through sensory signals, but corresponds to a mode of exploration and hence is an active process. Perception and sensory awareness emerge from using the structure of changes in the sensory input resulting from these exploratory actions, called sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs), for planning, reasoning, and goal achievement. Using a previously developed computational model of SMCs we show how an artificial agent can plan ahead with SMCs and use them for action guidance. Our main assumption is that SMCs are associated with a utility for the agent, and that the agent selects actions that maximize this utility. We analyze the properties of the resulting actions in a robot that is endowed with several sensory modalities and controlled by our model in a simple environment. The results demonstrate that its actions avoid aversive events, and that it can achieve a low-level form of spatial awareness that is resilient to the complete loss of a sensory modality.",

    "abstract": "Humans are very skilled at learning new control tasks, and in particular, the use of novel tools. In this article we propose a paradigm that utilizes this sensorimotor learning capacity to obtain robot behaviors, which would otherwise require manual programming by experts. The concept is to consider the target robot platform as a tool to be controlled intuitively by a human. The human is therefore provided with an interface designed to make the control of the robot intuitive, and learns to perform a given task using the robot. This is akin to the stage where a beginner learns to drive a car. After human learning, the skilled control of the robot is used to build an autonomous controller so that the robot can perform the task without human guidance. We demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal for humanoid robot skill synthesis by showing how a statically stable reaching skill can be obtained by means of this framework. In addition, we analyze the feedback interface component of this paradigm by examining a dynamics task, in which a human learns to use the motion of the body to control the posture of an inverted pendulum that approximates a humanoid robot, so that it stays upright.",

We apply a biologically inspired selection scheme, in which there is no explicit communication of the individuals’ fitness information. The individuals can only reproduce offspring by mating—a pair-wise exchange of genotypes—and the probability that an individual reproduces offspring in its own subpopulation is dependent on the individual’s ‘‘health,’’ that is, energy level, at the mating occasion. We validate the proposed method by comparing it with evolution using standard centralized selection, in simulation, and by transferring the obtained solutions to hardware using two real robots.",

The principal brain areas found to be active during this process are the hippocampus, the ventral striatum and the sensory-motor cortex. In this paper, we present a computational model that includes biological aspects of this circuit and explains mechanistically how it may be used to imagine and evaluate future events. Its most salient characteristic is that choices about actions are made by simulating movements and their sensory effects using the same brain areas that are active during overt execution. More precisely, the simulation of an action (e.g., walking) creates a new sensory pattern that is evaluated in the same way as real inputs. The model is validated in a navigation task in which a simulated rat is placed in a complex maze. We show that hippocampal and striatal cells are activated to simulate paths, to retrieve their estimated value and to make decisions. We link these results with a general framework that sees the brain as a predictive device that can ‘detach’ itself from the here-and-now of current perception using mechanisms such as episodic memories, motor and visual imagery.",

Some evidence in experimental psychology has suggested that imagery ability is crucial for the correct understanding of social intention. The present study was conducted first to confirm that the nature of the motor intention leads to early modulations of movement kinematics. Secondly, we tested whether humans use imagery to read an agent’s intention when observing the very first element of a complex action sequence. Results revealed early variations in movement kinematics between three different social actions and further showed that human agents can use these early deviants to anticipate above chance level the end-result before seeing the second half of the sequence. Response times in the observation task were similar in duration to those measured in the true production task, suggesting the use of motor imagery for trial categorization. Nevertheless, in a third study, the use of an artificial (neural network) classifier demonstrated that classification within the first 500 ms is possible without cognitive imagery processing. Hence, our results suggest that low-level motor indices afford intention reading without need for motor imagery but that human agents may use imaging beyond simulation to create an embodied sense of interactivity.",

We disagree with the implication of the treadmill model, based on dual-inheritance theory, that population size is the driver of cultural complexity. The treadmill model reduces the evolution of artifact complexity, measured by the number of parts, to the statistical fact that individuals with high skills are more likely to be found in a larger population than in a smaller population. However, for the treadmill model to operate as claimed, implausibly high skill levels must be assumed. Contrary to the treadmill model, the risk hypothesis for the complexity of artifacts relates the number of parts to increased functional efficiency of implements. Empirically, all data on hunter-gatherer artifact complexity support the risk hypothesis and reject the treadmill model. Still, there are conditions under which increased technological complexity relates to increased population size, but the dependency does not occur in the manner expressed in the treadmill model. Instead, it relates to population size when the support system for the technology requires a large population size. If anything, anthropology and ecology suggest that cultural complexity generates high population density rather than the other way around.",

In this article, we argue that extended enactivism, despite having some basis in AT’s original formulation, mistakes AT’s definition of living beings as autopoietic entities. We offer, as a reply to this interpretation, a more embodied reformulation of autopoiesis, which we think is necessary to counterbalance the (excessively) disembodied spirit of AT’s original formulation. The article aims to clarify and correct what we take to be a misinterpretation of AT as a research program. AT, contrary to what some enactivists seem to believe, did not (and does not) intend to motivate an extended conception of living beings. AT’s primary purpose, we argue, was (and is) to provide a universal individuation criterion for living beings, these understood as discrete bodies that are embedded in, but not constituted by, the environment that surrounds them. However, by giving a more explicitly embodied definition of living beings, AT can rectify and accommodate, so we argue, the enactive extended interpretation of autopoiesis, showing that although living beings do not extend beyond their boundaries as autopoietic unities, they do form part, in normal conditions, of broader autopoietic systems that include the environment.",

However, no holistic theory has been explicitly formulated that can inform how humans and robot swarms should interact through an interface while considering real-world demands, the relative capabilities of the components, as well as the desired joint-system behaviours. In this article, we apply a holistic perspective that we refer to as joint human–swarm loops, that is, a cybernetic system made of human, swarm and interface. We argue that a solution for human–swarm interaction should make the joint human–swarm loop an intelligent system that balances between centralized and decentralized control. The swarm-amplified human is suggested as a possible design that combines perspectives from swarm robotics, human-factors engineering and theoretical neuroscience to produce such a joint human–swarm loop. Essentially, it states that the robot swarm should be integrated into the human’s low-level nervous system function. This requires modelling both the robot swarm and the biological nervous system as self-organizing systems. We discuss multiple design implications that follow from the swarm-amplified human, including a computational experiment that shows how the robot swarm itself can be a self-organizing interface based on minimal computational logic.",

Associative network learning within an observational learning paradigm is used to explore the computational difficulties involved in establishing and maintaining a simple learned communica tion system. Because Hebbian learning is found to be sufficient for this task, it is proposed that the basic computational demands of learning are unlikely to account for the rarity of even simple learned communication systems.

A robot needs to explore in order to learn the structure of the world, and a robot needs to know its own location in order to make use of its acquired spatial information. However, a problem arises with the integration of exploration and localization. A robot needs to know its own location in order to add new information to its map, but a robot may also need a map to determine its own location. We have addressed this problem with ARIEL, a mobile robot system that combines frontier-based exploration with continuous localization. ARIEL is capable of exploring and mapping an unknown environment while maintaining an accurate estimate of its position at all times. In this paper, we describe frontier-based exploration and continuous localization, and we explain how ARIEL integrates these techniques. Then we show results from experiments performed in the exploration of a real-world office hallway environ ment. These results demonstrate that maps learned using exploration without localization suffer from substantial dead reckoning errors, while maps learned by ARIEL avoid these errors and can be used for reliable exploration and navigation.",

The effect of ISI on habituation rate is consistent with a simple one-stage process, but the effect of ISI on recovery rate seems to require a serial process in which two or more habituating units are cascaded, with earlier (peripheral) units in the series having shorter time constants than later (central) units.

The network incorporates detectors that can be tuned to the values of visual angles of different landmarks as perceived from the spatial location where a reinforcing event is encountered. After a detector has been tuned its output generates an effective stimulus that peaks at the distance from the landmark where positive or negative reinforcement was encountered previously. The outputs of the tuned detectors become associated with the reinforcing event. The network generates spatial generalization surfaces that can guide navigation from any location that is within view of familiar landmark cues, even if that location has never been visited before. Spatial navigation is accomplished by adopting a stimulus-approach principle-that is, by approaching appetitive places and avoiding aversive places. When generalization surfaces are assumed to represent forces exerted by the animal, the dynamics of spatial movements can be described. Computer simulations were carried out for appetitive, aversive, and aversive-appetitive place learning. This article shows that the network correctly describes the navigational trajectories and dynamics of many spatial learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "An application of reinforcement learning to a linear-quadratic, differential game is presented. The reinforcement learning system uses a recently developed algorithm, the residual-gradient form of advantage updating. The game is a Markov decision process with continuous time, states, and actions, linear dynamics, and a quadratic cost function. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. Although a missile and plane scenario was the chosen test bed, the reinforcement learning approach presented here is equally applicable to biologically based systems, such as a predator pursuing prey. The reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for differential games to find the minimax point rather than the maximum. Simulation results are compared to the analytical solution, demonstrating that the simulated reinforcement learning system converges to the optimal answer. The performance of both the residual-gradient and non-residual-gradient forms of advantage updating and Q-learning are compared, demonstrating that advantage updating converges faster than Q-learning in all simulations. Advantage updating also is demonstrated to converge regardless of the time step duration; Q-learning is unable to converge as the time step duration grows small.",

In this article we analyze the functional operation of robot controllers developed using evolutionary computation methods, to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying control system class. By comparing and contrasting robot controllers based on two different classes of artificial neural network, the GasNet and NoGas networks, we show that the increased evolvability of the GasNet class on a visual shape discrimination task is due to the temporally adaptive nature of the GasNet, where neuronal plasticity mediated through the concentration of virtual neuromodulatory \"gases\" occurs over a wide range of time courses. We argue that the availability of mechanisms operating over a wide range of potential time courses is a crucial property for controllers used to generate adaptive behavior over time, and that the design process should easily be able to adapt those time courses to the natural time scales in the environment.",

Rana computatrix (Arbib, 1987), an evolving computer model of anuran visuomotor coordination, models complex behaviors such as detouring around a stationary barrier to get to prey on the basis of an understanding of anuran prey and barrier recognition, depth perception, and appropriate motor pattern generation mechanisms based on sensory perception. Our present analysis of detour behavior goes beyond other models by incorporating new data from our laboratory demonstrating a learning component in anuran detour behavior. Building on earlier work showing how interacting schemas may be used to analyze a complex environment to generate an appropriate course of behavior, we turn to the questions: How are the relevant schemas adapted? How are schemas combined to form new schema assemblages acquired for the system to become more efficient? We describe the construction mechanisms and interactions with the environment that are necessary to achieve higher levels of detour performance. We have based this article mostly on data about learning to detour when approaching prey, but the model offers a strategy for learning to detour in general. Moreover, we have attempted to solve the problem in a general way so that the model of learning to detour points the way to a general theory of schema-based learning.",

Shaping rewards is a frequently used approach to increase the learning performance of reinforcement learning, with regards to both initial performance and convergence speed. Shaping rewards provide additional knowledge to the agent in the form of richer reward signals, which guide learning to high-rewarding states. Reinforcement learning depends critically on a few meta-parameters that modulate the learning updates or the exploration of the environment, such as the learning rate α, the discount factor of future rewards γ, and the temperature τ that controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in softmax action selection. We validate the proposed approach in simulation using the mountain-car task. We also transfer shaping rewards and meta-parameters, evolutionarily obtained in simulation, to hardware, using a robotic foraging task.",

Inspired by the rat’s hippocampus and neighboring areas, the time growing neural gas (TGNG) algorithm is used, which iteratively builds such a map by means of temporal Hebbian learning. The algorithm is combined with a motivation module, which activates goals, priorities, and consequent activity gradients in the developing cognitive map for the self-motivated control of behavior. The resulting motivated TGNG thus combines a neural cognitive map learning process with top-down, self-motivated, anticipatory behavior control mechanisms. While the algorithms involved are kept rather simple, motivated TGNG displays several emergent behavioral patterns, self-sustainment, and reliable latent learning. We conclude that motivated TGNG constitutes a solid basis for future studies on self-motivated cognitive map learning, on the design of further enhanced systems with additional cognitive modules, and on the realization of highly adaptive, interactive, goal-directed, cognitive systems.",

In human problem solving, high-dimensional problems are often made much easier by inferring a low-dimensional model of the system in which search is more effective. But this is an approach that seems to require top-down domain knowledge—not one amenable to the spontaneous energy minimization behavior of a natural dynamical system. However, in this article we investigate the ability of distributed dynamical systems to improve their constraint resolution ability over time by self-organization. We use a ‘‘self-modeling’’ Hopfield network with a novel type of associative connection to illustrate how slowly changing relationships between system components can result in a transformation into a new system which is a low-dimensional caricature of the original system. The energy minimization behavior of this new system is significantly more effective at globally resolving the original system constraints. This model uses only very simple, and fully distributed, positive feedback mechanisms that are relevant to other ‘‘active linking’’ and adaptive networks. We discuss how this neural network model helps us to understand transformations and emergent collective behavior in various non-neural adaptive networks such as social, genetic and ecological networks.",

The framework presented in this article is shown to adequately model human-like active perception behaviours, namely by exhibiting the following desirable properties: high-level behaviour results from low-level interaction of simpler building blocks; seamless integration of additional inputs is allowed by the Bayesian Programming formalism; initial ‘genetic imprint’ of distribution parameters may be changed ‘on the fly’ through parameter manipulation, thus allowing for the implementation of goal-dependent behaviours (i.e. top-down influences).",

Both strategies invoke action oriented representations (AORs). They differ in emphasizing different features of AORs in their attempt to answer the REC threat – focusing on their contents and vehicles, respectively. The first two sections review the central motivations and rationales driving the ‘content’ and ‘format’ strategies in turn and raise initial concerns about the tenability of each. With respect to the ‘content’ strategy, these worries ought to make us suspicious about the explanatory value of positing AORs. Although the ‘format’ strategy has a way of answering this concern, it raises a more fundamental worry about the motivation for even believing in AORs in the first place. Although these worries cast doubt on the feasibility of invoking AORs as a means of dealing with the REC threat, they do not constitute conclusive reasons for eliminating AORs altogether. There are other, stronger reasons for supposing that we should. The third section provides a sketch of a master argument, developed elsewhere, which makes that case in full dress fashion. The final section – ‘Resurrection?’ – considers and rejects the possibility that AORs might be resurrected, even if it is agreed that the master argument cited in the third section succeeds.",

A key factor in this capability is evolvability, or the propensity towards phenotypic variation. Numerous explanations for the origins of evolvability have been proposed, often differing in the role that they attribute to adaptive processes. To provide a new perspective on these explanations, experiments in this paper simulate evolution in gene regulatory networks, revealing that the type of evolvability in question significantly impacts the dynamics that follow. In particular, while adaptive processes result in evolvable individuals, processes that are either neutral or that explicitly encourage divergence result in evolvable populations. Furthermore, evolvability at the population level proves the most critical factor in the production of evolutionary innovations, suggesting that nonadaptive mechanisms are the most promising avenue for investigating and understanding evolvability. These results reconcile a large body of work across biology and inform attempts to reproduce evolvability in artificial settings.",

More importantly, we also propose an ASC strategy to deal with the “passing-by” problem and to gain better control performance. Simulation results are given to demonstrate that ASC can solve the inflexibility caused by “hard” step length in diffusive airflow, because it can autonomously adjust the step lengths of the robot according to the status of the environment, enabling our robot to stride confidently in the low chemical concentration areas and focus on highly suspicious areas.",

In comparison, the 4E approach helps us to overcome this dualist representational logic, allowing us to engage directly with the archaeological record as an integral part of the thinking process, and thus ground a more parsimonious cognitive archaeology. It also treats stone tools, the primary vestiges of hominin thinking, as active participants in mental life.

The key insight I start from is that to durably change undesirable patterns of behaviour, we could start by changing the affordances the environment offers – the possibilities for action offered to us by the living environment. The aim of this article is to sketch an integrative conceptual framework for understanding change-ability in terms in terms of a dynamical ‘brain ↔ body ↔ community ↔ landscape of affordances’ system. This Change-Ability Conceptual Framework starts from the idea that individuals and communities are situated in the same rich landscape of affordances and suggests that making communities more change-able entails transforming the material ‘grooves’ that have formed in this landscape of affordances.",

    "abstract": "Immersive learning environments in education provide a set of rich and diverse learning affordances (possibilities). Cognition in such environments can be considered as embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended (the 4Es of cognition). During such cognitive happenings, we assume and live as valid everything we experience. Yet in this enactive structural coupling between individuals and their experiential world, another phenomenon occurs. We become a behaviorally inseparable entity with the virtual/immersive world. We become entangled with that virtual/immersive world. Here we propose that, within the framework of the 4Es of cognition, a recognizable lived experience phenomena occurs when learners engage with virtual or immersive learning environments. That is, cognition becomes entangled in immersive environments with alternative realities. Coming from the Santiago school of cognition, and building from ideas from immersive learning, 4E cognition, and quantum entanglement inspired in quantum cognition, we attempt to describe the process of entangled cognition happening in immersive learning environments. We recognize at least two levels of entanglement from the same recursive phenomenology: one we call a local entanglement, related to perception and sense-making; and a second we call a global entanglement, connected to the process and phenomena of human consciousness and meaning-making, accessible when conceived as a whole. We see the benefits for such a theoretical framework to ultimately guide, justify, and encourage the emergence of an epistemology shift in educational technology towards design principles that account for entangled cognition in immersive learning (and beyond), and the associated possibilities offered by new immersive technologies in education.",

    "abstract": "Facing stress and producing stress responses are crucial aspects of an organism’s life and the evolution of both its species and of the other species in its environment, which are co-evolving with it. Philosophers and biologists emphasize the importance of environmental complexity and how organisms deal with it in evolution of cognitive processes. This article adds to these discussions by highlighting the importance of stress physiology in processes connected to plant cognition. While this article supports the thesis that life means cognizing (i.e., sensing the environment, arranging internal processes according to that perception, and affecting the environment with its actions), it also emphasizes that there are various kinds of organisms. In this regard, plant cognition is not animal cognition. However, given both the variety and continuity in evolutionary processes and the similarities even between the distantly related organisms in the tree of life, I argue that it is usually useful to consider and compare physiological and molecular mechanisms in plants and animals as well as the concepts and research processes in animal and plant science. Although the “pathological complexity” thesis that Veit (2023) presents is fruitful in considering the evolution of consciousness and cognition, I argue that, when thinking of biological processes in relation to cognition, stress can be a helpful concept (maybe even as suitable as pathological complexity) in thinking of organisms’ responses to environmental complexity and their adaptation and acclimation processes.",

In this article, we present experiments with a small humanoid robot that learns to swing.

Based on the psychological background wrapped in a framework of anticipatory behavioral control, the anticipatory learning classifier system ACS2 is explained. ACS2 learns and generalizes on-line a predictive environmental model (a model that allows the prediction of future environmental states). The model is a subjective model, that is, no global state information is available to the agent. It is shown that ACS2 can simulate anticipatory learning processes and anticipatory controlled behavior by means of the model. The simulations of various rat experiments, previously conducted by Colwill and Rescoria, show that the incorporation of anticipations is indeed crucial for simulating the behavior observed in rats. Despite the simplicity of the tasks, we show that the observed behavior reaches beyond the capabilities of model-free reinforcement learning as well as model-based reinforcement learning without on-line generalization. Possible future impacts of anticipations in adaptive learning systems are outlined.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to support effective learning and adaptation of behaviors for autonomous agents with reinforcement learning algorithms. These methods can identify control systems that optimize a reinforcement program, which is, usually, a straightforward representation of the designer's goals. Reinforcement learning algorithms usually are too slow to be applied in real time on embodied agents, although they provide a suitable way to represent the desired behavior. We have tackled three aspects of this problem: the speed of the algorithm, the learning procedure, and the control system architecture. The learning algorithm we have developed includes features to speed up learning, such as niche-based learning, and a representation of the control modules in terms of fuzzy rules that reduces the search space and improves robustness to noisy data. Our learning procedure exploits methodologies such as learning from easy missions and transfer of policy from simpler environments to the more complex. The architecture of our control system is layered and modular, so that each module has a low complexity and can be learned in a short time. The composition of the actions proposed by the modules is either learned or predefined. Finally, we adopt an anytime learning approach to improve the quality of the control system on-line and to adapt it to dynamic environments. The experiments we present in this article concern learning to reach another moving agent in a real, dynamic environment that includes nontrivial situations such as that in which the moving target is faster than the agent and that in which the target is hidden by obstacles.",

    "abstract": "A computational model of nervous system function during classical and instrumental conditioning is proposed. The model assumes the form of a hierarchical network of control systems. Each control system is capable of learning and is referred to as an associative control process (ACP). Learning systems consisting of ACP networks, employing the drive-reinforcement learning mechanism (Klopf, 1988) and engaging in real-time, closed-loop, goal-seeking interactions with environments, are capable of being classically and instrumentally conditioned, as demonstrated by means of computer simulations. In multiple-T mazes, the systems learn to chain responses that avoid punishment and that lead eventually to reward. The temporal order in which the responses are learned and extinguished during instrumental conditioning is consistent with that observed in animal learning. Also consistent with animal learning experimental evidence, the ACP network model accounts for a wide range of classical conditioning phenomena. ACP networks, at their current stage of development, are intended to model sensorimotor, limbic, and hypothalamic nervous system function, suggesting a relationship between classical and instrumental conditioning that extends Mowrer's (1956, 1960a/1973) two-factor theory of learning. In conjunction with consideration of limbic system and hypothalamic function, the role of emotion in natural intelligence is modeled and discussed. ACP networks constitute solutions to temporal and structural credit assignment problems, suggesting a theoretical approach for the synthesis of machine intelligence.",

The proposed model is a neural network architecture that learns and uses associations between vision and arm movements, even if the problem is ill posed (in the case of mapping problems between the visual space and the joints space of the arm). The central part of the model is a visuo-motor map able to represent the arm end point’s position in an ego-centered space (constrained by the vision) according to motor information (the proprioception). Sensorimotor behaviors such as tracking, pointing, spontaneous imitating, and sequences learning can then be obtained as the consequence of different internal dynamics computed on neural fields triggered by the visuo-motor map. The readout mechanism also explains how an apparently complex behavior can be generated and controlled from one simple internal dynamics and how at the same time the learning problems can be simplified. While highlighting the generic aspect of our model, we show that our robot can autonomously imitate and learn more complex sequences of gestures after the online learning of the visual and proprioceptive control of its hand extremity. Finally, we defend the idea of a co-development of imitative and sensorimotor capabilities, allowing the acquisition and the building of increasingly complex behavioral capabilities.",

The architecture employs a distributed representation in which a single pattern is coded by a small subset of columns. A column is initially able to respond to many different inputs; as it learns to trigger a motor program, its responses become more narrowly defined. Each column's output is a set of votes for the various motor programs. The votes for each program are collected by selection units, which drive a winner-take-all circuit to determine whether a particular motor program is executed.

The task is especially onerous in studies involving social insects because of the number of animals that must be observed simultaneously. To address this, we present a system that can automatically analyze animal movements, and label them, by creating a behavioral model from examples provided by a human expert. Further, in conjunction with identifying movements, our system also recognizes the behaviors made up of these movements. Thus, with only a small training set of hand labeled data, the system automatically completes the entire behavioral modeling and labeling process. For our experiments, activity in an observation hive is recorded on video, that video is converted into location information for each animal by a vision-based tracker, and then numerical features such as velocity and heading change are extracted. The features are used in turn to label the sequence of movements for each observed animal, according to the model. Our approach uses a combination of kernel regression classification and hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques. The system was evaluated on several hundred honey bee trajectories extracted from a 15 minute video of activity in an observation hive.",

I demonstrate that the uncertainty inherent in the process of meaning inference, moreover, leads to stable variation in both conceptual and lexical structure, providing evidence which helps to explain how language changes rapidly without losing communicability.

In particular, human foragers show contingent usage of information, initially using social infor mation to discover resource pools before private sampling information has been established. We describe a series of simulations that test the sources of resource undermatching often found in group foraging experiments. After testing the effects of foragers' starting locations, travel costs, the number of foragers, and the size of uniform food distributions, we discuss a novel hypothesis for undermatch ing. Spatial constraints lead to inadequate individual and group information sampling and cause group undermatching. The foraging group size, food rate, spatial distribution of food, and resulting forager reinforcement histories interact to produce undermatching, and occasionally overmatching, to resources.",

This article introduces a second-order neural network with parametric biases (sNNPB) that learns compositional structures based on sensorimotor time series data. The data was produced by a simulated robot that executed distinct object interactions (move-to and orient-toward). We show that various sNNPB setups can learn to compositionally imitate object interactions beyond the interactions that were specifically trained, which was not possible with previous neural network (NN) architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We also show that these imitation capabilities are accomplished by developing a self-organized, geometrically arranged compositional concept structure in the PB values and task-oriented, Braitenberg-like sensory encodings in hidden sensory layers. Because second-order connections were necessary to accomplish the task, we hypothesize that such connections may be essential to drive the learning of both sensorimotor-grounded compositional structures and Braitenberg-like, behavior-oriented ‘‘pro-presentations.’’ From a cognitive perspective, we show how sensorimotor time series of interactions may be processed to generate the signals necessary to develop semantically compositional structures.",

Our results show, along with previous work with English-speaking infants, that all three infants’ syntactic networks change their topology in a similar way, from tree-like networks to small-world networks. This change happens at a similar period in all three infants (between ~700 and ~800 days), regardless of the language they acquire. Our study also shows that the hubs – the most connected nodes in these small-world networks – are always the so-called functional words, which, according to linguistic theory, just contribute to the syntactic structure of human language. The emergence of these hubs happens abruptly, following a logarithmic growth pattern. This developmental pattern challenges usage-based theories of language acquisition and suggests that syntactic development is driven by the growth of the lexicon.",

This paper expands moth-inspired plume tracing via a single vehicle to multiple vehicles. The new strategy includes a mechanism determining a leader vehicle to perform moth-inspired plume-tracing maneuvers and a formation algorithm controlling non-leaders to follow the leader during plume-tracing missions. The Monte Carlo studies evaluate the strategy in a virtual environment where a simulated plume with significant filament intermittency and meander is developed. Considering our application, our simulation studies address an autonomous underwater vehicle’s kinematics and dynamics. The results demonstrate plume-tracing performance achieved by multiple vehicles, which automatically switch their roles superior to the single vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Sense-making, within enactive theories, provides a novel way of understanding how a comprehensible and manageable world arises for a subject. Elaboration of the concept of sense-making allows a fundamental reframing of the notion of perception that does not rely on the pick up of information about a pre-given world. In rejecting the notion of the subject as an input/output system, it is also necessary to reframe the scientific account of skilled action. Taking speech as an exemplary domain, I here present the outline of an enactive account of skilled action that is continuous with the concept of sense-making. Extending this account to the rich domain of joint or synchronous speaking allows many of the principal themes of the emerging enactive account to be considered as they relate to a familiar and important human practice.",

    "abstract": "The robustness of animal behavior is unmatched by current machines, which often falter when exposed to unforeseen conditions. While animals are notably reactive to changes in their environment, machines often follow finely tuned yet inflexible plans. Thus, instead of the traditional approach of training such machines over many different unpredictable scenarios in detailed simulations (which is the most intuitive approach to inducing robustness), this work proposes to train machines to be reactive to their environment. The idea is that robustness may result not from detailed internal models or finely tuned control policies but from cautious exploratory behavior. Supporting this hypothesis, robots trained to navigate mazes with a reactive disposition prove more robust than those trained over many trials yet not rewarded for reactive behavior in both simulated tests and when embodied in real robots. The conclusion is that robustness may neither require an accurate model nor finely calibrated behavior.",

    "abstract": "For mobile robots to communicate meaningfully about their spatial environment, they require personally constructed cognitive maps and social interactions to form languages with shared meanings. Geographic spatial concepts introduce particular problems for grounding—connecting a word to its referent in the world—because such concepts cannot be directly and solely based on sensory perceptions. In this article we investigate the grounding of geographic spatial concepts using mobile robots with cognitive maps, called Lingodroids. Languages were established through structured interactions between pairs of robots called where-are-we conversations. The robots used a novel method, termed the distributed lexicon table, to create flexible concepts. This method enabled words for locations, termed toponyms, to be grounded through experience. Their understanding of the meaning of words was demonstrated using go-to games in which the robots independently navigated to named locations. Studies in real and virtual reality worlds show that the system is effective at learning spatial language: robots learn words easily—in a single trial as children do—and the words and their meaning are sufficiently robust for use in real world tasks.",

These emotions and behaviors that disturb the organization of a crowd are of concern in our study, and we attempt to predict these suspicious circumstances and provide help in making the right decisions at the right time. Furthermore, most of the models that address crowd disasters belong to the physical or the cognitive approaches. They study pedestrian flow and collision avoidance, etc., and they use walking speed and angle of vision. However, in this work, based on a behavioral rules approach, we aim to model emergent emotion, behavior and influence in a crowd, taking into account particularly the personality of members of the crowd. For this purpose, we have combined the OCEAN (Openness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) personality model with the OCC (Ortony, Clore, and Collins) emotional model to indicate the susceptibility of each of the five personality factors to feeling every emotion. Then we proposed an approach that uses first fuzzy logic for the emotional modeling of critical emotions of members of the crowd at the announcement or the presence of unusual events, in order to quantify emotions. Then, we model the behavior and the tendency towards actions using probability theory. Finally, the influence among the members of the crowd is modeled using the neighborhood principle and cellular automata.",

We propose that there exists a suite of core concepts within enaction that are suited to the characterisation of many kinds of intentional subjects, including and especially animals, plants, collectivities and artefacts. We summarise some basic concerns of enactive theory and show how the common illustration of the single cell ascending a chemotactic gradient serves as a focus point for discussion of important topics such as identity, perspective, value, agency and life-mind continuity. We also highlight two important deficits of this example: the cell is ahistorical and asocial. Historicity and sociality are defining characteristics of living beings and are addressed within enactive theory by the concepts of structural coupling and participatory sense-making, respectively. This strongly biological framework is to be distinguished from scientific psychology which is, we argue, necessarily anthropomorphic. We propose a constrained bio-enactive framework that remains true to its biological foundations and that would allow us to negotiate consensus-based understanding in contested domains, where incompatible value systems enacted by competing systems are in conflict. A consensual ‘we’ is, we contend, a matter of negotiation, not of fixed essence. A bio-enactive framework may serve as a jumping off point for consensus-based discussion within contested domains.",

Dynamic signals from movement can be exploited to provide this expression while the robot is acting to perform its task. A research effort has been started to find general emotion expression models for actions that could be applied to any kind of robot to obtain believable and easily detectable emotional expressions. The need for a unified representation of emotional expression emerged. A framework to define action characteristics that could be used to represent emotions is proposed in this paper. Guidelines are provided to identify quantitative models and numerical values for parameters, which can be used to design and engineer emotional robot actions. A set of robots having different shapes, movement possibilities, and goals have been implemented following these guidelines. Thanks to the proposed framework, different models to implement emotional expression can now be compared in a sound way. The question mentioned in the title can now be answered in a justified way.",

Even simple states of collective motion, such as group translation or rotation, require nontrivial algorithms, sensors, and actuators to be achieved in real-world scenarios. We study here the capabilities and limitations in controlling experimental robot swarms of a decentralized control algorithm that only requires information on the positions of neighboring agents, and not on their headings. Using swarms of e-Puck robots, we implement this algorithm in experiments and show its ability to converge to self-organized collective translation or rotation, starting from a state with random orientations. Through a simple analytical calculation, we also unveil an essential limitation of the algorithm that produces small persistent oscillations of the aligned state, related to its marginal stability. By comparing predictions and measurements, we compute the experimental noise distributions of the linear and angular robot speeds, showing that they are well described by Gaussian functions. We then implement simulations that model this noise by adding Gaussian random variables with the experimentally measured standard deviations. These simulations are performed for multiple parameter combinations and compared to experiments, showing that they provide good predictions for the expected speed and robustness of the self-organizing dynamics.",

We examine how the notion of know-how figures in them to show an important point of convergence, namely, that the normativity of human cognitive capacities rests on shared know-how. Radical enactivism emphasizes the diachronic dimension of shared know-how, and linguistic bodies emphasize the synchronic one. Given that know-how is a normative notion, it is subject to success conditions. We then argue it implies basic content, which is the content of the successful ongoing interactions between agent(s) and environment. Basic content does not imply accuracy conditions and representational content, so it evades Hutto and Myin’s Hard Problem of Content. Moreover, this account is amenable to the central claim by Di Paolo et al. that the participatory sense-making relations at play in linguistic exchanges are explained in continuity with explanations of biological organization and sensorimotor engagements.",

    "abstract": "The tricky question in the plant cognition debate is what theory of cognition should be used to fix the reference of cognitive concepts without skewing the debate too much one way or the other. After all, plants are rather different to animals in many respects: they are not motile, do not possess central nervous systems or even neurons, do not exhibit an invariant morphology, interact with the world in a distributed multi-centred manner, and behave through changes in their physiology. Nonetheless, there is a significant strand in the debate that asserts that plants are indeed cognitive. But what theory of cognition makes sense of this claim without baking in prior zoological assumptions? The aim of this paper is to try out a theory of minimal cognition that makes the claim of plant cognition plausible. It is primarily inspired by the distributed cognition literature and the sensorimotor coordination theory of cognition proposed by van Duijn et al. (2006) . We take a cognitive system to be a coordinated set of semi-autonomous processes running over the organism and items in its environment. Coordination is characterised in terms of two functional conditions that ensure that the system generates goal-directed action in the world. The system is stigmergic in the sense that the material results of its actions in the environment are a crucial part of the processes that coordinate further actions. The account possesses a degree of scale invariance and helps unify cognitive explanation across microorganisms, plants and animals.",

Each model employs genetic algorithms to evolve foraging behaviors for multiple agents in spatially explicit environments, structured at the level of situated perception and action.

An individual whose mouth is open in the presence of food is fed and gains points; an individual who fails to hide when a predator is present is hurt by losing points. Opening mouths, hiding, and making sounds each exact an energy cost. There is no direct evolutionary gain for acts of cooperation or communication per se.In such an environment we start with a spatialized array of neural nets with randomized weights. Using standard learning algorithms, our individuals train up on the behavior of successful neighbors at regular intervals.

The performance and robustness of different agent strategies is evaluated, emphasizing the important role that courtship plays in mate choice. Specifically, the courtship period can be used by individuals to swap to better partners when they become available. We found that using courtship as a mechanism for holding partners before full commitment to mating provides strategic advantages relative to sequential search using aspiration levels. Moreover, simple heuristics that require little computation provide a degree of robustness to environmental (parameter) changes that is unattainable by strategies based on more extensive information processing. Our model produces realistic patterns of assortative mating (high within-couple mate value correlations) and rates of mating that match empirical data on human sexual/romantic relationships much more closely than previous accounts from biology and the social sciences.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the productive creativity of children in a computational model of the emergence and evolution of compositional structures in language. In previous models it was shown that compositional structures can emerge in language when the language is transmitted from one generation to the next through a transmission bottleneck. Due to the fact that in these models language is transmitted only in a vertical direction where adults only speak to children and children only listen, this bottleneck needs to be imposed by the experimenter. In the current study, this bottleneck is removed and instead of having a vertical transmission of language, the language is—in most simulations— transmitted horizontally (i.e., any agent can speak to any other agent). It is shown that such a horizontal transmission scenario does not need an externally imposed bottleneck, because the children face an implicit bottleneck when they start speaking early in life. The model is compared with the recent development of Nicaraguan Sign Language, where it is observed that children are a driving force for inventing grammatical (or compositional) structures, possibly due to a sparseness of input (i.e., an implicit bottleneck). The results show that in the studied model children are indeed the creative driving force for the emergence and stable evolution of compositional languages, thus suggesting that this implicit bottleneck may—in part—explain why children are so typically good at acquiring language and, moreover, why they may have been the driving force for the emergence of grammar in language.",

In the rat pup and robot experiments, we found that when 10-day-old Norway rats ( Rattus Norvegicus) are placed in an arena, they typically follow walls to a single corner and stay there. However, our thigmotaxic robots followed walls but typically circumnavigated the entire arena, contacting all corners, and exhibiting asymmetric corner behavior. After observing the latter behavior in robots, we found that rat pups also exhibited asymmetric corner behavior. Thus, our robotic experiments, while not quantitatively matching pup behavior, led to the discovery of a previously unrecognized pattern of behavior in rat pups. This illustrates the value of models in leading to discovery of new patterns of behavior in the system modeled. Our results also show that simple thigmotaxic architectures alone may not explain pup behavior in an arena.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a biomimetic control architecture affording an animat both action selection and navigation functionalities. It satisfies the survival constraint of an artificial metabolism and supports several complementary navigation strategies. It builds upon an action selection model based on the basal ganglia of the vertebrate brain, using two interconnected cortico-basal-ganglia–thalamo-cortical loops: A ventral one concerned with appetitive actions and a dorsal one dedicated to consummatory actions. The performances of the resulting model are evaluated in simulation. The experiments assess the prolonged survival permitted by the use of high-level navigation strategies and the com plementarity of navigation strategies in dynamic environments. The correctness of the behavioral choices in situations of antagonistic or synergetic internal states are also tested. Finally, the modeling choices are discussed with regard to their biomimetic plausibility, while the experimental results are estimated in terms of animat adaptivity.",

The model layers a distributed and asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithm over a learned topological map and standard behavioral substrate to create a reinforcement learning complex. The topological map creates a small and task-relevant state space that aims to make learning feasible, while the distributed and asynchronous aspects of the architecture make it compatible with behavior-based design principles. We present the design, implementation and results of an experiment that requires a mobile robot to perform puck foraging in three artificial arenas using the new model, random decision making, and layered standard reinforcement learning. The results show that our model is able to learn rapidly on a real robot in a real environment, learning and adapting to change more quickly than both alternatives. We show that the robot is able to make the best choices it can given its drives and experiences using only local decisions and therefore displays planning behavior without the use of classical planning techniques.",

Synchronization is achieved either by environmental stimuli or even by self-organizing processes solely based on local interactions within a robot population of up to 150 robots.

Sequential behavior is then defined in terms of serial, temporal and abstract structure. The resulting neuro-computational framework is demonstrated to account for observed sequence learning behavior. More interestingly, this framework naturally extends to grammatical constructions as form-to-meaning mappings. Predictions from the neuro-computational model concerning parallels in language and cognitive sequence processing are tested against behavioral and neurophysiological observations in humans, resulting in a refinement of the allocation of model functions to subdivisions of Broca's area. From a functional perspective this analysis will provide insight into the relation between the coding structure in human languages, and constraints derived from the underlying neurophysiological computational mechanisms.",

However this complexity together with the largely covert relation between the parameters and the behavior of the agent is also the main hindrance in the goal oriented design of a behavior system. This paper presents a general approach to the self-regulation of dynamical systems so that the design problem is circumvented. We consider the controller (a neural net work) as the mediator for changes in the sensor values over time and define a dynamics for the parameters of the controller by maximizing the dynamical complexity of the sensorimotor loop under the condition that the consequences of the actions taken are still predictable. This very general principle is given a concrete mathematical formulation and is implemented in an extremely robust and versatile algorithm for the parameter dynamics of the controller. We consider two different applications, a mechanical device called the rocking stamper and the ODE simulations of a “snake” with five degrees of freedom. In these and many other examples studied we observed various behavior modes of high dynamical complexity",

This implementation is then extended to show that the same underlying process could generate internal traces of the world (memories) in an internal environment. This model provides a novel account of the origin of internal representations. Further, as both external and internal traces are generated using the same mechanism, the model shows how an extended mind could be implemented. Also, as the stored internal traces develop entirely out of actions, these action components could be activated implicitly. This feature explains the origin of enactable and action-oriented mental content, suggested by recent experiments.",

Maze problems represent a simplified virtual model of real environments that can be used for developing core algorithms of many real-world applications related to the problem of navigation. However, the best achievements of LCSs in maze problems are still mostly bounded to non-aliasing environments, while LCS complexity seems to obstruct a proper analysis of the reasons of failure. We construct a new LCS agent that has a simpler and more transparent performance mechanism, but that can still solve mazes better than existing algorithms. We use the structure of a predictive LCS model, strip out the evolutionary mechanism, simplify the reinforcement learning procedure and equip the agent with the ability of associative perception, adopted from psychology. To improve our understanding of the nature and structure of maze environments, we analyze mazes used in research for the last two decades, introduce a set of maze complexity characteristics, and develop a set of new maze environments. We then run our new LCS with associative perception through the old and new aliasing mazes, which represent partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDP) and demonstrate that it performs at least as well as, and in some cases better than, other published systems.",

However, computational models of enactive vision are very rare and often rely on handcrafted control systems. In this article, we argue that the apparent complexity of the environment and of the robot brain can be significantly simplified if perception, behavior, and learning are allowed to co-develop on the same timescale. In doing so, robots become sensitive to, and actively exploit, characteristics of the environment that they can tackle within their own computational and physical constraints. We describe the application of this methodology in three sets of experiments: shape discrimination, car driving, and wheeled robot navigation. A further set of experiments, where the visual system can develop the receptive fields by means of unsupervised Hebbian learning, demonstrates that the receptive fields are consistently and significantly affected by the behavior of the system and differ from those predicted by most computational models of the visual cortex. Finally, we show that our robots can also replicate the performance deficiencies observed in experiments of motor deprivation with kittens.",

Acting on these premises, our model is able to replicate key empirical studies of social learning in children and chimpanzees. We demonstrate how a simple artificial system can account for a variety of biological social transfer phenomena, such as goal-inference and over-imitation, by taking into account action constraints and incomplete knowledge about the world dynamics.",

Individuals must attempt to find a suitable mate in a limited amount of time with only partial knowledge of the individuals in the pool of potential candidates. Individuals have multiple-valued character profiles, which describe a number of their characteristics (physical beauty, potential earning power, etc.), as well as preference profiles, that specify their degree of preference for those characteristics in members of the opposite sex. A process of encounters and dating allows individuals to gradually build up accurate representations of potential mates. Individuals each have a “temperature,” which is the extent to which they are willing to continue exploring mate-space and which drives individual decision making. The individual-level mechanisms implemented in KAMA produce population-level data that qualitatively matches empirical data. Perhaps most significantly, our results suggest that differences in first-marriage ages and hazard-rate curves for men and women in the West may to a large extent be due to the Western dating practice whereby males ask women out and women then accept or refuse their offer.",

In this article we present a new model designed to explore the relationship between mechanisms of autopoiesis and behavior.

We conduct a search of possible attractors and calculate dynamical quantities, such as the largest Lyapunov exponents (LLEs), at a fine resolution over the areas of parameter space where complex and chaotic dynamics are most likely, to build a more detailed picture of the dynamical regimes of the system, focusing on the most complex solutions. By building a precise LLE map, we identify a narrow region of parameter space of particular interest, rich with chaotic and multistable dynamics, and show that it is on the border of criticality. This allows us to draw conclusions about possible neural mechanisms underlying the generation of chaotic dynamics. We illustrate the detailed ecology of multiple attractors in the system by listing, characterising and grouping all the stable attractors in the parameter range of interest. This allows us to pinpoint the regions with complex multistability. The greater understanding thus provided is intended to help future studies on the roles of chaotic dynamics in biological motor control, and their application in robotics, particularly by giving a deeper insight into how input signals and control parameters shape the system's dynamics which can be exploited in chaos-driven adaptation.",

The main conceptual proposal is the extension of the notion of concern, present in the enactive philosophy, into the domain of social participation. The proposal introduces the notion that care in social life corresponds to a richer version of the basic living concern of the organism. In the enactive philosophy of the organism, concern appears as a link between the dynamical precariousness of the living system and the emerging properties of lived experience. Social participation, informed by an anthropology of social practice, is characterised as a multi-scale process of construction and maintenance of group and multi-individual identities. This article presents a caring practice perspective in order to capture the richness of life’s concern in social life. In this way, it stretches the life and mind continuity towards social dynamics. The construction and maintenance of group and individual identities in social life is a process that requires a form of concern that is best defined as care. The proposal characterises caring practices as both explicitly ethical and implicitly ecologically emerging. Finally, this article points towards an envisioned enactive anthropology of caring that unpacks the dynamics and phenomenology of social life.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the number of items varied during random practice in order to promote diversification of the skill on the adaptive process of motor learning. A coincident timing complex task was manipulated in terms of perceptive (experiment 1), motor (experiment 2) and perceptive coupled with motor (experiment 3) requirements. In each experiment, 22 children were divided into two groups according to the amount of variability (three or six). Also, the design included two phases: stabilization and adaptation. Results showed that when the motor skill was diversified in relation to perceptive and motor demands separately (experiments 1 and 2), there were no differences between groups with variability of three and six parameters during the adaptation. No learning occurred for both groups in experiment 3. In conclusion, a minimum amount of variability in perceptive and motor task demands varying separately during practice (three variations) was enough to provide the needed flexibility for adaptation in the motor skill.",

In this paper, we introduce a family of artificial life models that demonstrate how dynamical agents can engage in multiple different actions and autonomously switch between them. These described agents engage in a food foraging task, and are driven by both internal, metabolic variables and external, sensory variables. The analysis of one of these agents demonstrates how different actions can arise through transient modes of sensorimotor coordination, in which a subset of the available sensors and effectors become engaged while others are ignored. Transitions between actions are analyzed and shown to correspond to rapid movements through the agent’s state space. In these transitions, some of the previously controlling sensors and effectors disengage, and new sets of sensors and effectors are engaged.",

The results of the test show that the robot is able to solve the task and, in agreement with data from psychology experiments, exhibits response times linearly dependent on the angular disparity between the objects. This model represents a novel detailed operational account of the embodied brain mechanisms that may underlie mental rotation.",

    "abstract": "Learning new gaits for compliant robots is a challenging multi-dimensional optimization task. Furthermore, to ensure optimal performance, the optimization process must be repeated for every variation in the environment, for example for every change in inclination of the terrain. This is unfortunately not possible using current approaches, since the time required for the optimization is simply too high. Hence, a sub-optimal gait is often used. The goal in this manuscript is to reduce the learning time of a particle swarm algorithm, such that the robot’s gaits can be optimized over a wide variety of terrains. To facilitate this, we use transfer learning by sharing knowledge about gaits between the different environments. Our findings indicate that using transfer learning new robust gaits can be discovered faster compared to traditional methods that learn a gait for each environment independently.",

    "abstract": "Social play is common in mammals but its adaptive significance is not well understood. A commonly held hypothesis is that social play allows juveniles to learn skills and rules for cooperation as adults. On this view, the adaptive benefit of social play derives from the benefits of cooperation as adults. However, cooperation is only beneficial if it is used in populations of predominantly cooperators; otherwise, it is a costly strategy. We investigated the latter problem by modeling the link between social play and subsequent adult cooperation using an agent-based model. In our model, agents had a play gene with allelic social play states (i.e., play or not play). Juveniles with a play gene learned to cooperate by successfully engaging in social play with another juvenile agent with a play gene. As adults, agents played the stag hunt game with other adults to obtain resources for reproduction. Those that learned to cooperate by playing as juveniles cooperated in the stag hunt game. When agents aggregated into small groups, we found that social play could evolve by facilitating the learning of cooperation. Our theoretical results also show that social play is a novel mechanism for the indirect evolution of cooperation.",

Fuzzy logic is also adopted in order to enhance the performance of the navigation system. A rigorous series of experiments has been conducted using two navigation methods, which are the proposed control system and the conventional navigation technique utilizing the potential field method for achieving the desired goals. Both systems are implemented in the simulated experiments using Stage simulator. By employing these two approaches, it is possible to present a comparison of the navigation results between the systems utilizing different navigation techniques. The experimental results reveal that the proposed system produces better navigation performance compared to the conventional method in terms of safe and successful navigation, with a smoother trajectory and consistent motion.",

According to the Hypothesis of Extended Mind, whatever extends our cognitive processes is incorporated. At the same time, that object becomes a part of our self-manifestation. However, De Preester, in what I call a narrow version of incorporation, proposes that an object is incorporated to the self only if it is included in the sense of ownership of the body. Here, I explore a broader version of incorporation, related to Merleau-Ponty’s ideas of habit and incorporation. From this perspective, incorporation is the way a self expands and alters itself in its dealings with the world. A self, as a lived body, emerges in the self’s constitutive openness to worlds; therefore, objects (and even others) are incorporated in a temporal and situated way if they participate in constitutive experiences. Finally, this perspective explores the idea of a flexible and transparent self rather than a fixed self based on representations of the body.",

    "abstract": "Distributed and hierarchical models of control are nowadays popular in computational modeling and robotics. In the artificial neural network literature, complex behaviors can be produced by composing elementary building blocks or motor primitives, possibly organized in a layered structure. However, it is still unknown how the brain learns and encodes multiple motor primitives, and how it rapidly reassembles, sequences and switches them by exerting cognitive control. In this paper we advance a novel proposal, a hierarchical programmable neural network architecture, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme. In this approach, complex (and novel) behaviors can be acquired by embedding multiple modules (motor primitives) in a single, multi-purpose neural network. This is supported by recent theories of brain functioning in which skilled behaviors can be generated by combining functional different primitives embedded in “reusable” areas of “recycled” neurons. Such neuronal substrate supports flexible cognitive control, too. Modules are seen as interpreters of behaviors having controlling input parameters, or programs that encode structures of networks to be interpreted. Flexible cognitive control can be exerted by a programmer module feeding the interpreters with appropriate input parameters, without modifying connectivity. Our results in a multiple T -maze robotic scenario show how this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers permitting to learn, encode and control multiple qualitatively different behaviors.",

This Cartesian basis has not been fully resolved by archaeological attempts to integrate the SBH with relational models of cognition. At the heart of the issue has been a lack of meaningful consideration of the cognitive agency of things and the evolutionary efficacy of material engagement. This article proposes MET as a useful starting point for rethinking future approaches to human social cognitive becoming in a way that appreciates the co-constitution of brains, bodies and worlds. It also suggests how MET may bridge archaeological and 4E approaches to reconsider concepts such as the ‘mental template’ and Theory of Mind.",

    "abstract": "This article considers the adaptive setting and probable origins of human aesthetic capabilities, using evidence of the Acheulean tradition in the last million years, and highlighting the importance of the preceding and enveloping social and technological contexts. Acheulean bifaces, made from about 1.75 to 0.1 Ma, often with an appearance of symmetry, give windows on crucial interlocking aspects of human intellectual evolution. These have been seen as the domains of technology, sociality and aesthetics, following Leroi-Gourhan, or in near-equivalence the ‘technological’, ‘sociological’ and ‘ideological/philosophical’ of L.A. White. These domains can be analysed to have a reality, in the sense that social worlds of the apes far antedate technology, which in turn is generally taken to be far older than a sense of aesthetic appreciation. The bifaces are helpful in illustrating early developments because they can be made only through bringing together a set of concepts linking form, function and technology of manufacture, in a recurring ‘deep structure’. As there are at least 6 to 12 necessary concepts, perhaps significantly more, the artefacts are essentially multivariable or multivariate. They thus impose high cognitive requirements in manufacture, pressing towards effective sequencing of steps so that not too many variables will be involved simultaneously. Support of such a knowledge base has social requirements of shared or collective intention. Biomechanical and functional necessities also exert pressures on concepts: rules maintained by all these requirements entail a notion of ‘appropriateness’ or ‘rightness’ that may have been a prime factor in driving evolution of a sense of aesthetics and even the shaping of moral feelings. As the rules are variably expressed through time and space in the Acheulean, some of the best information comes from seeing how far particular variables are ‘locked’ in relationships which recur to give the impression of deep structure.",

Three playing style adaptability metrics were analysed, namely, (1) flexibility (i.e., exhibiting a wide range of playing styles), (2) reactivity (i.e., adapting playing style based on opposition) and (3) imposition (i.e., executing predetermined playing style regardless of opposition). Methods Team playing styles were derived through a clustering analysis of 21,708 matches played in the top five male European leagues from 2014/15 to 2019/20. Spearman’s correlation was utilized to assess the association between the three playing style adaptability metrics and four team match performance indicators (e.g., shots taken in opposition penalty box; shots conceded in own penalty box; goals scored; goals conceded; and total wins). Results Playing style flexibility was positively associated with both offensive and defensive match performance indicators and win frequency. Conversely, playing style reactivity and imposition were negatively associated with these team match performance indicators. Conclusions Our results suggest that the capacity to exhibit a wide range of playing styles throughout a season is associated with greater team performance. Furthermore, it is possible that high performing teams are capable of functionally switching between playing style reactivity and imposition, depending on match dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The enactive approach characterizes life and cognition as sense-making. The standard description of sense-making entails the co-emergence of an agent’s self and a meaningful world, as well as the emergence of a normativity that guides the behaviour of the coupled agent-environment system. This emergent process happens at different levels of interactions: biological, sensorimotor, intercorporeal and linguistic. Sense-making therefore accounts for the natural origins of intentionality and meaning and gives continuity to the emergent enactive processes of life and mind. The standard description of sense-making is nonetheless too abstract and neglects many historical and ecological aspects relevant to the scientific study of life and mind processes as they happen in concrete fields of action. To address this issue, I propose the enlarged description of sense-making in the wild, which is based on three fundamental concepts: norm development, enactive-situated normativity and transverse emergence. Norm development defines sense-making as a historically situated process that transforms the previously given dynamical configuration of the agent-environment system into a new one. Enactive-situated normativity asserts that in addition to the agent’s self-maintenance and the material constraints of the agent-environment system, many dynamical constraints, ecologically situated, shape the origin, maintenance and development of sense-making processes. Finally, transverse emergence describes the transformational process of the whole agent-environment system dynamically, as a reconfiguration of the landscape of attractors that exhibit the typical behaviour of the system. Sense-making in the wild thus aims to facilitate conceptual tools to study enactive cognition, as it happens in concrete fields of action.",

It is assumed that through classical conditioning animals build an internal model of the environment and that through operant conditioning animals select from alternative responses. The internal model of the environment provides predictions of the aversive stimulus based on environmental stimuli and the animal's own responses, and these predictions are used to train the operant conditioning block to generate responses that minimize the aversive stimulus. Computer simulations show that the model correctly describes many of the features that characterize escape and avoidance. The network also is able to describe the imitation of a demonstrator by an observer. During the demonstration, a neural network representing the observer stores classical associations between environmental stimuli and the demonstrator's responses and aversive stimuli, and these associations serve to train the operant associations during the observer's performance. It is assumed that the demonstrator's responses evoke a representation of identical responses in the observer and that the demonstrator's unconditioned response to the aversive stimulus serves as an aversive reinforcer for the observer. The network contributes to a general theory of adaptive behavior and is relevant to the design of autonomous systems that learn either through trial and error or through imitation.",

    "abstract": "Beer’s approach to addressing questions about embodiment, situatedness, and dynamics is to investigate an evolved model agent capable of exhibiting the most basic form of behavior that one might call “cognitive.” One “minimally cognitive behavior” performed by Beer’s agent is the discrimination between circles to catch and diamonds to avoid. Indeed, it is often assumed that the ability to perceive the categories to which objects in the world belong is a basic form of cognition. We wholeheartedly agree that the perception of boundaries separating categories plays a fundamental role in adaptive behavior, and that this topic provides an appropriate focal point for fruitful investigations of minimally cognitive behavior. But we argue that the entities composing the most important categories are possibilities for action rather than objects, and that perception detects these boundaries rather than creates them (Michaels, Prindle, & Turvey, 1985). From an ecological perspective (Gibson, 1979), successful behavior depends on the ability to perceive which actions are possible and which actions are not possible (Turvey, 1992). The Outfielder Problem (Oudejans, Michaels, Bakker, & Dolne, 1996)—that is, the problem of how an outfielder runs to catch a fly ball—provides a convenient example to illustrate this point, and is not unlike the behavior performed by Beer’s agent when it moves to catch a falling circle. When an outfielder runs to catch a fly ball, she must know whether or not it is possible to run quickly enough to reach the landing location before the ball does. If the ball is hit too hard or the fielder is too slow, she may slow down and catch it on a bounce rather than on the fly. The other behavior performed by Beer’s agent (i.e., moving to avoid a falling diamond) is akin to avoiding traffic when crossing the street. When a pedestrian crosses the street, he must know whether or not it is possible to walk quickly enough to pass in front of an approaching car. If the car is approaching too quickly or the pedestrian is too slow, he may wait for the car to pass. In both cases, the situation invites a qualitatively different kind of behavior depending on whether or not the action is possible. This is the sense in which actions are categorical—we either catch the ball on a fly or let it bounce; we either cross in front of the car or wait for it to pass. But the boundaries separating categories are not invented by the organism and imposed on continuous stimuli. Rather, they are defined by the fit of organism and environment such that possibilities for action are real and out there to be discovered. If behavior is to be appropriate for the situation (e.g., if the outfielder is to know whether to catch the ball on the fly or let it bounce), the behavioral possibilities of the environment must be perceived.",

Traditionally, chemotaxis has been considered as the fundamental chemosensory navigational mechanism for most species. Previous studies have demonstrated, however, that biased random walk is the more fundamental navigational strategy in various types of diffusion fields. Biased random walk is a robust and slow search process, but it has been shown that its efficiency can be enhanced if it is combined with chemotaxis. The present article summarizes previous findings of the authors in olfactory navigation and extends the work to searching in dynamic flow fields, including turbulence. In addition, a cooperative, multi-agent search method has been investigated and shown to be successful in enhancing search efficiency. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of future plans to implement these strategies in experimental mobile robots.",

An agent-based model designed to study gene-culture interactions in the evolution of communication is introduced. This model shows that cultural selection resulting from learner biases can be crucial in determining the structure of communication systems transmitted through both genetic and cultural processes. Furthermore, the learning bias that leads to the emergence of optimal communication in the model resembles the learning bias brought to the task of language acquisition by human infants. This suggests that the iterated application of such human learning biases may explain much of the structure of human language.",

However, a recent finding suggests that reactive agents can cope with perceptual ambiguity in a simple model (Nolfi, 2002). This paper investigates to what extent reactive and nonreactive agents can cope with perceptual ambiguity, and which strategies are employed when doing so. A model of active categorical perception (called Acp) is introduced. In Acp, situated agents with different types of neurocontrollers are optimized to categorize objects by adaptively coordinating action and perception. Our experiments show that both nonreactive and reactive agents can cope with perceptual ambiguity. An analysis of the behavior reveals that nonreactive agents use their internal memory to cope with perceptual ambiguity, while reactive agents use the environment as an external memory to compensate for their lack of an internal memory. We conclude that reactive agents can cope with perceptual ambiguity in the context of active categorical perception, and that they can organize their behavior according to stimuli that are no longer present, especially when they incorporate a nonlinear sensorimotor mapping. Moreover, we may conclude that sensory state-transition diagrams provide insight into the strategies employed by reactive agents to deal with perceptual ambiguity, and their use of the environment as an external memory.",

It is possible to store information in these networks through Hebbian learning. Eventually, learning “destroys” the dynamics and leads to a fixed point attractor. We investigate here the structural changes occurring in the network through learning. We show that a simple Hebbian learning rule organizes synaptic weight redistribution on the network from an initial homogeneous and random distribution to a heterogeneous one, where strong synaptic weights preferentially assemble in triangles. Hence learning organizes the network of the large synaptic weights as a “small-world” one",

We use the artificial life methodology of building a society of artificial agents, equipped with motor, perceptual and cognitive systems that are generic and have a realistic complexity. We demonstrate that agents, playing the “imitation game,” build shared syllable systems and show how these syllable systems relate to existing human syllable systems. Detailed experiments study the learnability of the self-organized syllable systems. In particular, we reproduce the critical period effect and the artificial language learning effect without the need for innate biases which specify explicitly in advance the form of possible phonological structures. The ability of children agents to learn syllable systems is explained by the cultural evolutionary history of these syllable systems, which were selected for learnability.",

While both types of implementations select the most active representation, the subsequent inhibition is at the level of selection for RS models and at the level of (re)activation for CQ models. It is shown that despite the overwhelming success of CQ models in serial recall (with regard to types of sequencing error) RS models outperform CQ models with regard to inter-response times in a free recall task. Additional analyses show that decay of response suppression reduces the difference between the models. The RS model is sensitive to the size of the search set and accounts for memory selection performance in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia or Huntington’s disease. Finally, a non-mnemonic clustering behavior is observed, which is related to the dynamical process of the selection mechanism.",

One open question is the degree of complexity required in the control algorithm to ensure reliable terrain adaptation and disturbance rejection. The present study applies a fully interconnected, linear controller to a two-dimensional, five-link walking model, achieving stable and efficient locomotion over unpredictable terrain (slopes varying between 2 ° and 7 ° and step-downs varying between 0 and 25% leg length). The results indicate that elaborate control principles are not necessarily required for stable bipedal walking.",

Our previous research shows that it is possible but not trivial to develop simulations in robots based on the simulation hypothesis. While there are several previous approaches to modelling mental imagery and related cognitive abilities, the origin of such internal simulations has hardly been addressed. The inception of simulation (InSim) hypothesis suggests that dreaming has a function in the development of simulations by forming associations between experienced, non-experienced but realistic, and even unrealistic perceptions. Here, we therefore develop an experimental set-up based on a simple simulated robot to test whether such dream-like mechanisms can be used to instruct research into the development of simulations and mental imagery-like abilities. Specifically, the hypothesis is that ‘dreams’ informing the construction of simulations lead to faster development of good simulations during waking behaviour.

The landmark distances based on egomotion can be obtained and this information produces a new type of homing navigation with landmark vectors. It includes varying sizes of landmark vectors, depending on the distance. We investigate the effect of quantized distance information or continuous distance in the landmark vectors for homing navigation performance. Even a few classes of discretization of landmark distances and a rough estimation of the current agent location can show excellent homing performance.

Until the Unified Conceptual Space Theory (UCST), based on Peter Gärdenfors’ Conceptual Spaces Theory, no one had attempted to offer an explicitly enactive theory of concepts. UCST is set apart from its competitors in locating concepts not in the mind (or brain) of the conceptual agent nor in the affordances of the agent’s environment but in the interaction between the two. On the UCST account, concepts are never truly static: conceptual knowledge is always in the process of being “brought forth”, such that neither agent nor environment can cleanly be separated from the other, and the preconceptual noumena cannot be reconstructed free of conceptual taint. Through such conceptual coloring, mind extends into the world. Concepts create binary distinctions – beginning, most importantly, with the self/non-self distinction – and discrete entities that mask what are, with respect to the conceptual framework, underlying continua. These distinctions – implying notions of e.g. internal and external, inner experience and outer world – are both conceptually necessary and, at the same time, lacking prior ontological status. They are meaningful only with respect to some identifiable observer (which could, in appropriate circumstances, be the organism itself). In consequence, phenomenology has a key role to play, and first-person methods are indispensable to any empirical investigation of concepts.",

Direct learning holds that improvements with practice are driven by information for learning that can be found in the dynamic organism-environment interaction. The theory formally describes information for learning as a vector field that spans a space with all the perception-action couplings that may be used to perform an action. Being located at a point of such a space means using a specific perception-action coupling. Changes in perception-action couplings due to learning can be represented as paths across the space, and can be explained with the vector field of information for learning. Previous research on direct learning considered actions that were best understood with single perception-action couplings. To conclude the article, and inspired by the criteria of Di Paolo et al., we discuss an extension of the theory to actions that are best understood with multiple perception-action couplings.",

    "abstract": "In their article, Tom Froese and his associates (2013) accept the concept of a ‘biologically embodied mind’ (surely today an uncontroversial position) and define their ‘enactive’ approach comprehensively as an attempt ‘to understand the biological, social, and historical origins of the phenomenon of symbolic representation as an aspect of our cultural environment’ (p. 199). They are especially interested in why people attach significance to certain hallucinations and not others. They thus seek to bring together two fields of research: neurology and the study of cultural contexts. On the one hand, they rightly allow that ‘the disinhibited visual system generates spatiotemporal [geometric] patterns of neural activity due to Turing instabilities’ (p. 200), while on the other they wonder why Upper Palaeolithic people selected and deployed certain of these geometrics from the array of possible forms – which, I argue, is a cultural matter. Neurophenomenology, they say, relates ‘the empirical data of neuroscience and verbal descriptions of firstperson experience in a mutually informing and enriching manner’ (p. 208). As so defined, Froese et al.’s research is very like what some researchers have been doing for a few decades – though Froese and associates place greater and valuable emphasis on neurology. For my part, I have drawn on research dealing with geometric visual hallucinations but have tended to concentrate on cultural contexts because my expertise in neural issues is virtually non-existent. I therefore welcome their attempt to bring the two sides of the human coin together. A few points need to be made. Most of their writing seems to assume human individuality and isolation. They wonder why individuals value certain selected geometric hallucinations. In practice, as a phenomenological approach should show, individuals are embedded in cross-cutting social groups of different kinds. Meaning and value are formed consensually (and also in social and personal contestation) within and between these groups. Whatever the underlying neurological causes of the percepts, we know from ethnographic reports and laboratory research that certain ones, those that in the 1920s Heinrich Kluver (1966) called ‘form constants’, are widely experienced. They may be induced by the ingestion of hallucinogens and, contrary to some researchers, by numerous other means as well (e.g., Bressloff et al., 2002). We should remember that geometric hallucinations are often experienced along with iconic images of animals, people, emotionally charged objects, and so forth. Researchers cannot study the one without the other. If we attend to reported iconic mental images, we can begin to form some idea as to why people value their mental imagery as a whole. At the same time, it is true that in some social contexts, such as the modern West, geometric hallucinations are, at least in mundane contexts, marginalized or ignored altogether. This is clearly a social and historical rather than a neurological issue. Why only certain geometric forms are valued and, in some contexts, depicted, seems to me again a social issue. The geometric forms found in the Neolithic monuments of western Europe look, upon superficial inspection, different from those that the Tukano of south America depict and which they explicitly claim to see in their yaje-induced trances (Lewis-Williams & Pearce, 2005). Yet both kinds are reducible to the basic forms that Kluver isolated (see also, for example, Siegel, 1977; Eichmeier & Hofer, 1974): grid patterns, cobwebs, tunnels or vortexes, and spirals. To these may be added zigzags and the migraine scotoma. Clearly, these fundamental forms are socially moulded in the process of depiction, and this accounts for the differences. It is only in detail that the forms, as potentially generated by the brain, may be considered ‘an almost infinite set of possible patterns’ (p. 200). To make sense",

ECM has obvious parallels with the extended mind thesis (EM), according to which the physical basis of cognition is likewise not confined to the brain. However, EM’s originator and most prominent defender, Andy Clark, argues that EM theorists can and should reject ECM, and offers an alternative internalist account, which admits a causal but non-constitutive role for sensorimotor dynamics. In this paper, I examine how well this claim fits with some of the key commitments of EM, and the implications for the EM theorist who wishes to deny ECM.

    "abstract": "Although play occurs in a wide variety of animals, models of the origins of play behavior are lacking. We propose a novel computational model exploring the evolution of non-social frivolous play. Asexually reproducing semelparous animals can either rest or forage. Foraging occurs when an organism is below an energy threshold. Success is determined by the combination of skill and availability of resources, which declines over time but replenishes for each generation. Play was introduced as a mutant strategy: a frivolous activity that uses energy and increases the probability of dying over resting with no direct fitness benefit. Simulations show that play behavior becomes fixed in the population and the time spent playing is maintained at a low rate in spite of its costly nature. When play behavior is functional by increasing foraging ability, it evolves quickly and the time individuals spend playing increases, but eventually the population of players collapses and play disappears. We suggest a mechanism underlying the origins of adaptive play from non-adaptive behavior when resources expand. Initially play acts as a spiteful behavior in that playing individuals suffer a direct cost to their fitness, but also may incur even greater costs to other individuals in the population.",

Technology can aid behavior analysis interventions supporting different educational agents (e.g. psychologists, parents, and teachers) as well as patients. In this article, we reviewed how researchers are using technology in ABA interventions with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We present the results obtained from a systematic review of the literature. The purpose was to map the employment of the computational technology in ABA interventions, as well as to discuss the primary technologies used, their benefits, and their limitations. Based on our review, we noticed that technology-based interventions are in the early stages of development. We evidenced it by the methodological limitations in many of the studies we found, and the relatively simplistic nature of many of the technological applications (e.g. inability to customize the software to meet individual learner needs). We also provide suggestions, based on these findings, for how researchers may advance the studies in this area to improve the lives of children with ASD and their families.",

Conversely, by accommodation these structures are changed according to the child’s new experience. Despite the intuitive power of these concepts to trace the course of sensorimotor development, they have gradually lost ground in psychology. This likely due to the lack of brain-related views capturing the dynamic mechanisms underlying them. Here we propose that brain modular and hierarchical organization is crucial to understanding assimilation/accommodation. We devise an experiment where a bio-inspired modular and hierarchical mixture-of-experts model guides a simulated robot to learn different reaching tasks by trial-and-error. The model gives a novel interpretation of assimilation/accommodation based on the functional organization of the experts allocated through learning. Assimilation occurs when the model adapts a copy of the expert trained for solving a task, to face another task requiring similar sensorimotor mappings. Experts storing similar sensorimotor mappings belong to the same functional module. Accommodation occurs when the model uses non-trained experts to face tasks requiring different sensorimotor mappings (generating a new functional group of experts). The model also provides a new theoretical framework to investigate assimilation/accommodation impairment, and proposes that such impairment might be related to autism spectrum disorder.",

Norms can be explained within the framework of ecological psychology as a particular kind of affordance that enables actions to be directly understood as correct. This view entails that the niche of human beings is inherently normative. Finally, the ecological account of normativity is used to elucidate the notion of rule-following.",

Our framework can combine any rule-based inductive engine (which learns new rules) with a deductive engine (which derives a coverage graph for all rules) and integrate them into a lifelong learner. We rate rules by introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of the minimum message length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical assessment structure which handles evidence and rules in a unified way. The metrics are used to forget some of the worst rules and also to consolidate those selected rules that are promoted to the knowledge base. This mechanism is also mirrored by a demotion system. We evaluate the framework with a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain.",

The majority of the existing approaches use pre-defined mappings provided by a domain expert. To overcome this limitation and enable autonomous transfer learning, this paper introduces a method for weighting and using multiple inter-task mappings based on a probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that the use of multiple inter-task mappings, accompanied with a probabilistic selection mechanism, can significantly boost the performance of transfer learning relative to 1) learning without transfer and 2) using a single hand-picked mapping. We especially introduce novel tasks for transfer learning in a realistic simulation of the iCub robot, demonstrating the ability of the method to select mappings in complex tasks where human intuition could not be applied to select them. The results verified the efficacy of the proposed approach in a real world and complex environment.",

However, its incorporation into cognitive science has been largely done by following an objectivist frame of reference, without reconsidering the practices and standards involved in the process of research and the interpretation and validation of the results. This has given rise to a number of issues that reveal inconsistencies in the understanding and treatment of some crucial aspects of first-person research. In this article, we will outline a research direction aiming at contributing to the establishment of a framework for the study of experience that addresses these inconsistencies. Specifically, we will identify some challenges facing the study of experience—in particular those linked to the understanding of memory, expression and description, and intersubjectivity in exploring experience—and propose to reframe them under the epistemological framework of the enactive approach. Moreover, we will explore the prospect of gaining insight into theoretical and methodological strategies for dealing with these issues by extending our vision beyond the field of cognitive science to its neighboring fields, focusing in particular on the field of somatic practices.",

Especially interesting are simple systems that provide unexpected examples of memory, decision-making, or problem-solving in substrates that at first glance do not appear to be complex enough to implement such capabilities. We seek to develop tools to determine minimal requirements for such capabilities, and to learn to recognize and predict basal forms of intelligence in unconventional substrates. Here, we apply novel analyses to the behavior of classical sorting algorithms—short pieces of code studied for many decades. To study these sorting algorithms as a model of biological morphogenesis and its competencies, we break two formerly ubiquitous assumptions: top-down control (instead, each element within an array of numbers can exert minimal agency and implement sorting policies from the bottom up), and fully reliable hardware (instead, allowing elements to be “damaged” and fail to execute the algorithm). We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among elements in chimeric arrays consisting of two different algorithms. The discovery of emergent problem-solving capacities in simple, familiar algorithms contributes a new perspective showing how basal forms of intelligence can emerge in simple systems without being explicitly encoded in their underlying mechanics.",

In order to stimulate a systematic study on this topic, I present a simple individual- oriented model on inter-sexual dominance and how it is influenced by species characteristics of primates, such as intensity of aggression and sex ratio. The model represents a virtual world inhab ited by entities that do nothing except grouping and performing dominance interactions in which the effects of winning and losing are self-reinforcing. VirtualMales start out with a higher winning tendency and are characterized by a higher intensity of aggression than VirtualFemales. To ensure comparability to behavioral patterns of real animals, I record the same behavioral aspects of the artificial entities as have been collected for real primates. Results show that due to the high impact of acts in fiercely aggressive VirtualSpecies, the variation in dominance values is larger than in mild ones. As a consequence, the rank of the most subordinate VirtualMale is lower than that of the lowest-ranking mild VirtualMale and, counter-intuitively, VirtualMales dominate relatively fewer VirtualFemales in fierce than mild species. Correspondence of model results to findings on primates allows us to use insight obtained from the model to derive hypotheses on the relation between intensity of aggression, sex ratio, male mounting behavior and female choice of primates.",

Adaptive change routinely exhibited in infants' everyday activities outstrips the scaling-up potential of current robotic systems and clarifies effective principles obeyed by naturally intelligent systems. A general form is outlined to subject-environment interaction that \"engineers\" restructuring of early abilities in the direction of greater anticipation (considered an upper boundary for the competence of concept-free human and animat systems); and an action-based account of the phenomena is provided. This emphasizes the relationship between representation and situated inference and the role of reciprocal constraints between cognitive and physical-motor mechanisms.

Böhm, Schildberger, and Huber (1991) proposed a simple additive mechanism to explain how the cricket combines the two behaviors. Problems implementing this on the robot led us to propose an alternative inhibition mechanism, which proved effective. Here we directly compare these two possibilities and several further alternatives. First, in a simulation of the open-loop paradigm used by Böhm et al. we demonstrate that there are at least five algorithms (including “efferent copy”) that may adequately account for the data they present. We then consider possible neural implementations of several of these schemes, and test them in robot experiments.

To achieve a better fitness, the agent must select relevant sensory inputs and update its working memory to realize a non-Markovian sequential behavior in which the preceding state alone does not determine the next action. We compare the performance of a feed-forward and recurrent neural control architectures in different environment settings and analyze the neural mechanisms and environment features exploited by the agents to achieve their goal.

The use of simulation allows the discussion of generative hypotheses on the origin of roosts, which are emergent from individual behavior. Besides confirming the main expectations, the results point to the need for a natural ordering in grooming partner selection.

We analyze abstraction from a formal point of view and characterize three distinct facets: aspectualization, coarsening, and conceptual classification. The taxonomy we develop allows us to interrelate existing approaches to abstraction, leading to a code of practice for designing knowledge representations that support knowledge transfer. We detail how aspectualization can be utilized to achieve knowledge transfer in reinforcement learning. We propose the use of so-called structure space aspectualizable knowledge representations that explicate structural properties of the state space and present a posteriori structure space aspectualization (APSST) as a method to extract generally sensible behavior from a learned policy. This new policy can be used for knowledge transfer to support learning new tasks in different environments. Finally, we present a case study that demonstrates transfer of generally sensible navigation skills from simple simulation to a real-world robotic platform.",

    "abstract": "Food acquisition mode in lizards (i.e., ambush vs. widely searching) has been intensely scrutinized for the past decade to identify correlations between food acquisition mode, diet, sprint speed, and other aspects of phenotypic diversity. To begin to understand these correlations, we studied foraging mode variation in natural foraging behavior and attack speed in three ambush predators and two widely foraging species in the field. Sequential analyses revealed considerable variation in the temporal structure of behavioral repertoires associated with acquiring food. Ambush and wide-foraging species use unique combinations of behaviors prior to prey attack with differences among and between food acquisition modes. Attack speeds were well below maximum sprint speed for these species. Thus, the widely demonstrated correlation between food acquisition mode and sprint speed is not related to prey capture per se. The striking variation in prey capture repertoires in these model ambush and wide foragers shows that we have a long way to go before we will understand the ecological relevance of many performance and phenotypic traits that are related to foraging mode in lizards.",

Our implementation emphasizes the affective components of differential reward magnitude and reward omission expectation and thus we model Affective-Associative Two-Process theory (Aff-ATP). ATP has been used to explain the findings of differential outcomes training (DOT) procedures, which emphasize learning differentially valuated outcomes for cueing actions previously associated with those outcomes. ATP hypothesizes the existence of a ‘prospective’ memory route through which outcome expectations can bring to bear on decision making and can even substitute for decision making based on the ‘retrospective’ inputs of standard working memory. While DOT procedures are well recognized in the animal learning literature they have not previously been computationally modelled. The model presented in this article helps clarify the role of ATP computationally through the capturing of empirical data based on DOT. Our Aff-ATP model illuminates the different roles that prospective and retrospective memory can have in decision making (combining inputs to action selection functions). In specific cases, the model’s prospective route allows for adaptive switching (correct action selection prior to learning) following changes in the stimulus–response–outcome contingencies.",

In the homeostatic adaptation model, higher-level dynamics internally self-organized from sensorimotor dynamics are associated with desired behaviors. These dynamics are regenerated when drastic changes occur, which might break the internal dynamics. Due to the weak link between desired behavior and internal homeostasis in the original homeostatic adaptation model, adaptivity is limited. In this paper, we improve on the homeostatic adaptation model to create a stronger link between desired behavior and internal homeostasis by introducing a metabolic causation in a plasticity mechanism and show that it becomes more adaptive. Our results show that our model has three different time scales in the adaptive behaviors, which are discussed with our cognition and mental imagery.",

Participants appear to have anticipated impaired RT and adapted unconsciously by executing a more rapid movement to the brake pedal.

We argue that this conceptual framework is both expressive and naturally generates robust assertion and concept updating models. In particular, we define both assertion and updating rules for language games involving a mixture of labels and negated labels. Finally, the results of language game simulations are presented, where a multi-agent system evolves through pairwise language games incorporating an assertion and an updating algorithm. Our results suggest that, within this framework, a mixture of both positive and negative assertions may be required in order for agent interpretations to converge, whilst retaining sufficiently discriminatory categories for effective communication.",

While some relationships are known within species and across individuals, it is not obvious that such relationships can be used to explain differences and similarities in amount and type of play across large taxonomic groupings of animals, let alone transitions among them. Primates encompass a relatively large assemblage of species that differ in numerous dietary, habitat, reproductive, and physiological processes. While all juvenile primates engage in social play, far fewer primate species engage in social play as adults. Here, derived from theory and more small-scale comparisons, we explore several biological and behavioral phenomena that differ among nonhuman primates and which may explain differences in the occurrence of adult–adult social play. We used phylogenetic logistic regression to assess the correlation of adult play with various life-history, metabolic and socioecological variables. Although the main contribution of our paper is demonstrating use of phylogenetic methods in the context of play evolution, suggestive but not significant evidence was found that adult sexual and nonsexual social play is influenced by diet, habitat, reproductive, and metabolic factors, sometimes in opposite directions, that we discuss along with needed future analyses involving improved data and interactions among traits.",

    "abstract": "Play fighting in many animals consists of a complex choreography of somewhat stereotypical behaviors involving attack and defense—typically of particular body areas—that are differentially generated under specific conditions. In most domains where behavior is considered, including the study of social play, the prevailing explanatory theories rest on the assumptions that: (1) behavior is the result of “programs” that can be strictly or loosely specified, located somewhere in the central nervous system, and (2) the behavior an organism produces in a certain circumstance is the result of a choice between all (or many) of the available options, assumed to be arrived at by considering internally generated predictions about the consequences of actions. To test these assumptions, we used sets of parameters generated by our previous work with rats and crickets to create an agent-based model of a game of “keep-away.” We demonstrate that the agents need to possess neither behavioral programs (e.g., fixed or modal action patterns), nor any predictive capacity, in order to reproduce the tactics commonly used when organisms protect an object of interest from conspecifics. The results are presented in terms of the evolution of social play, which can be seen as a variation of the game of keep away.",

A distributed source localization algorithm is presented for a homogeneous team of simple agents. An agent uses a single sensor to sense the gradient and two sensors to sense its neighbors. The algorithm is a set of individualistic and social behaviors where the individualistic behavior is as simple as an agent keeping its previous heading and is not self-sufficient in localizing the source. Source localization is achieved as an emergent property through agent's adaptive interactions with the neighbors and the environment. Given a single agent is incapable of localizing the source, maintaining team connectivity at all times is crucial. Two simple temporal sampling behaviors, intensity-based-adaptation and connectivity-based-adaptation, ensure an efficient localization strategy with minimal agent breakaways. The agent behaviors are simultaneously optimized using a two phase evolutionary optimization process. The optimized behaviors are estimated with analytical models and the resulting collective behavior is validated against the agent's sensor and actuator noise, strong multi-path interference due to environment variability, initialization distance sensitivity and loss of source signal.",

This is the case in aerial robotics applications, where an autonomous aerial robot cannot interact with the environment hazard free. Prototype generation is a well known technique commonly used in supervised learning to help reduce the number of samples needed to learn a task. However, little is known about how such techniques can be used in a reinforcement learning task. In this work we propose an algorithm that, in order to learn a new (target) task, first generates new samples—prototypes—based on samples acquired previously in a known (source) task. The proposed approach uses Gaussian processes to learn a continuous multidimensional transition function, rendering the method capable of reasoning directly in continuous (states and actions) domains. We base the prototype generation on a careful selection of a subset of samples from the source task (based on known filtering techniques) and transforming such samples using the (little) knowledge acquired in the target task. Our experimental evidence gathered in known reinforcement learning benchmark tasks, as well as a challenging quadcopter to helicopter transfer task, suggests that prototype generation is feasible and, furthermore, that the filtering technique used is not as important as a correct transformation model.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, several theories have claimed to explain the teleological causality of organisms as a function of self-organising and self-producing processes. The most widely cited theories of this sort are variations of autopoiesis, originally introduced by Maturana and Varela. More recent modifications of autopoietic theory have focused on system organisation, closure of constraints and autonomy to account for organism teleology. This article argues that the treatment of teleology in autopoiesis and other organisation theories is inconclusive for three reasons: First, non-living self-organising processes like autocatalysis meet the defining features of autopoiesis without being teleological; second, organisational approaches, whether defined in terms of the closure of constraints, self-determination or autonomy, are unable to specify teleological normativity, that is, the individuation of an ultimate beneficiary; third, all self-organised systems produce local order by maximising the throughput of energy and/or material (obeying the maximum entropy production (MEP) principle) and thereby are specifically organised to undermine their own critical boundary conditions. Despite these inadequacies, an alternative approach called teleodynamics accounts for teleology. This theory shows how multiple self-organising processes can be collectively linked so that they counter each other’s MEP principle tendencies to become codependent. Teleodynamics embraces – not ignoring – the difficulties of self-organisation, but reinstates teleology as a radical phase transition distinguishing systems embodying an orientation towards their own beneficial ends from those that lack normative character.",

From Material Engagement Theory, we hold that defending such a notion leads to unnecessary ontological asymmetries that obscure the fundamental role of materiality for cognition. On the one hand, we argue that the relationship of close intertwinement and co-constitution that unites organism and environment makes it untenable to characterise cognition as being driven by individuals. In our view, cognition arises from the dynamic encounter between brains, bodies and culture. On the other hand, we suggest that organism and environment should not be seen as separate ontological categories that come to interact with each other but as two terms of a transactional process of continuous becoming. Consistently, we propose to consider meaning as emerging from the in-between space that material engagement creates rather than from the activity of an organism.",

Walter Veit’s novel pathological complexity thesis proposes to investigate nonhuman consciousness from an evolutionarily bottom-up perspective, casting aside our obsessive preoccupation with the complexities of human consciousness, and seeks to understand the adaptive origins of even the most minimal forms of subjective experience. In this brief response to Veit’s proposal, I offer glimpses into the phenomenologically complex minds of wild individual bonnet macaques Macaca radiata – a cercopithecine nonhuman primate endemic to peninsular India – examined through deep naturalistic observations of their cognitive decision-making processes. Such explorations, I believe, are critically important, in not only revealing the innovative responses of these cognitive beings to the pathological complexity presented by the socioecological realities of the everyday but also in uncovering the mechanisms by which these individuals may be able to ‘consciously’ synthesise their various subjective experiences to take novel decisions at different stages of their challenging life histories in the long term, as postulated by Veit.",

Considering this, the main thesis I will defend in this article is that we humans live surrounded by images, and we spatially organise these images into a particular cultural niche which I call imaginal space, a material or virtual space that we interactively navigate. We use such images in the imaginal space as fundamental props in the imaginative dynamics of our scaffolded minds. The images we find in our imaginal space are public depictive representations. They are twofold objects: on the one hand, they are material objects in that they can be manipulated into the ecological niche; on the other hand, they also are normative objects in that their representational function can be redesigned through a practice of use. As a first consequence of this main thesis, I will contend that public representations emergent into the imaginal space of a certain community may play a crucial regulative role for imagination: emergent systems of public representations can get a canonical status in their community, so that they can exert a normative power on the members of that community regulating their imagistic mental representations. As a second consequence, I will defend that the canonical images emergent in the imaginal space constitute the collective imagery of a human community: they support and influence the development of public narratives in the considered community.",

He distinguishes various dimensions of consciousness, explores their distribution in different species, and traces their roots to an ancient system of hedonic valence, which evolved to solve complex problems of action selection in early animals. This approach places Veit firmly within a new ‘post-Cartesian’ paradigm for consciousness science, which treats consciousness as a complex functional state, which can be studied by standard scientific means – in contrast to the traditional Cartesian paradigm, which focused on irreducibly subjective qualia and the ‘hard problem’ they present. However, there are places where Veit’s discussion displays residual Cartesian influence. Veit continues to use Cartesian terms such as ‘qualia’, and he suggests that states of hedonic valence play their functional role in virtue of their ‘feel’, implying a subjective realm – a ‘Cartesian bureau de change’ – where intrinsic value is felt and reacted to. This weakens Veit’s presentation, and I urge him to commit to a thoroughly functionalist account. The Cartesian and post-Cartesian paradigms are incommensurable, and in order to achieve a Darwinian revolution in consciousness studies, the concept of an irreducibly subjective mental realm must be completely abandoned.",

    "abstract": "Walter Veit has written an important book about his theory of Pathological Complexity positing animals’ life history challenges as the driving force behind the evolution of consciousness. I agree completely with his “bottom-up” approach, emphasizing the animal’s world view and sensory capacities, not human’s, when attempting to understand the many aspects of animal consciousness and their evolution. He has further elucidated the significant attributes of consciousness as proposed by Birch, Schnell, and Clayton. I have applied his Pathological Complexity Thesis to stages in the life history of piping plovers ( Charadrius melodus ), suggesting the various decisions they are likely to face at each challenge. I then describe several of my field experiments with plovers that imply cognitive and conscious capacities that the plover could use to help master its challenges. The “Safe-Dangerous” experiments with human intruders indicate that a plover can learn to discriminate between potentially “threatening” and “safe” intruders. With non-human intruders too? I also examined whether the plovers’ use of the “Broken Wing Display” can be understood as a purposeful, First Order Intentional behavior, namely, the plover wants to lead an intruder/predator away from its nest/young. In my other research, plovers responded very variably, but seemingly adaptively, to pre-recorded chick distress calls played back in different contexts. Their responses during silent periods following the calls suggest that plovers possess representations encompassing acoustic, visual, and locational elements. I conclude that plovers likely have intentionality, aiding their ability to meet their life challenges.",

Our human-swarm teaming arrangement contrasts a sheepdog and a human shepherd trained using traditional methods, and a drone and a human pilot trained using computational models of abstracted mustering skills. We design two effectiveness attributes for mustering that measure the level of influence a sheepdog/drone exerts on a sheep (swarm-guidance-controllability) and the level of anticipation that assists sheep to modulate their response (swarm-guidance-predictability). We collect field data where the sheep are mustered by a sheepdog in one setting and by a drone in another. We contrast field data against data collected from simulation models. Our analysis reveals that while collective behaviours in simulations may appear to be similar to field data, the dynamics of influence are vastly different between the two. The findings are particularly important when assessing the suitability of contemporary swarm shepherding and collective behaviour models produced by the research community.",

    "abstract": "On a traditional top-down experimental approach to consciousness science, researchers start by investigating consciousness in humans, or closely related living animals, based on evidence from experimental paradigms that aim to directly disentangle conscious from unconscious processing. Only afterward are these insights (iteratively) extended beyond the human case to investigate and understand how consciousness is distributed more broadly. In A Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness , Walter Veit radically departs from this approach by taking a Copernican turn in suggesting that we should first understand consciousness’ simple beginnings, and only afterward make sense of how these humble beginnings further complexified. Central to Veit’s approach is abruptly removing the reliance on insights about human consciousness by suggesting that evolutionary considerations can provide a credible source of evidence that can independently and directly support hypotheses about consciousness. My aim here is two-fold. Firstly, I will argue that using evolutionary considerations to support hypotheses about consciousness this way is problematic for principled reasons. The consequence is that evolutionary considerations fail to convincingly support Veit’s central hypothesis: That consciousness’ function is to enable organisms to deal with high pathological complexity. However, secondly, I will suggest that these considerations can nevertheless support an adjacent hypothesis: That an evaluative mode of being is required in general to deal with high pathological complexity irrespective of how consciousness is involved. Taken together, I conclude that consciousness science should not be turned upside down, and that Veit’s central hypotheses are better understood as hypotheses not directly concerned with consciousness.",

This paper briefly reviews the relevant neurobiological and cognitive data, and their relation to computational models of spatial learning and localization used in contempo rary mobile robots. It proposes a hippocampal model of spatial learning and localization, and characterizes it using a Kalman filter based tool for information fusion from multiple uncertain sources. The resulting model not only explains neurobiological and behavioral data from rodent experiments, but also allows a robot to learn a place-based metric representation of space and to localize itself in a stochastically optimal manner. The paper presents an algorithmic implementa tion of the model and results of several experiments that demonstrate its capabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a general model that covers signaling with and without conflicts of interest between signalers and receivers. Krebs and Dawkins (1984) argued that a conflict of interests will lead to an evolutionary arms race between manipulative signalers and sceptical receivers, resulting in ever more costly signals; whereas common interests will lead to cheap signals or \"conspiratorial whispers.\" Previous simulation models of the evolution of communication have usually assumed either cooperative or competitive contexts. Simple game-theoretic and evolutionary simulation models are presented; they suggest that signaling will evolve only if it is in the interests of both parties. In a model where signalers may inform receivers as to the value of a binary random vari able, if signaling is favored at all, then signalers will always use the cheapest and the second cheap est signal available. Costly signaling arms races do not get started. A more complex evolutionary simulation is described, featuring continuously variable signal strengths and reception thresholds. As the congruence of interests between the parties becomes more clear-cut, successively cheaper signals are observed. The findings support a modified version of Krebs and Dawkins's argument. Several variations on the continuous-signaling model are explored.",

    "abstract": "Different animals employ different strategies for sampling sensory data. In animals that can see, differences in sampling strategy manifest themselves as differences in field of view and in spatially variant sampling (so-called foveal vision). In analyzing adaptive behavior in animals, or attempting to design autonomous robots, mechanisms for exploring variations in sensory sampling strategy will be required. This article describes our work exploring a minimal system for investigating the effects of variations in patterns of sensory sampling. We have reimplemented Wilson's animat (Wilson, 1985b) and then experimented with altering its sensory sampling pattern (i.e., its sensory field). Empirical results are presented which demonstrate that alterations in the sensory field pattern can have a significant effect on the animat's observable behavior. Analysis of our results involves characterizing the interaction between the animat's sensory field and the environment within which the animat resides. We found that the animat's observed behavior can, at least in part, be explained by the animat cautiously moving in a manner that attempts to maximize the generation of new information from the environment over time. We demonstrate that similar explanations can be offered for behavioral patterns in real animals. The article concludes with a discussion of the generality of the results and reflections on the prospects for further work.",

    "abstract": "This article reports a study on modeling covert visual attention as a parallel process that unfolds in synergy with the embodied agent’s action selection process. The parallel nature of the proposed model is according to the multiple covert attention hypothesis and thus suitable for the concurrent search for multiple objects in the embodied agent’s visual field. In line with the active vision approach, the interaction with the action selection process is exploited by the model to deploy visual attention in a by-need way. Additionally, the multiple focuses of attention considered in the proposed model interact in a way that their collective behavior robustly self-organizes for a proper handling of the speed—accuracy trade-off inherent to visual search tasks. Besides the self-organization of a global spatiotemporal visual attention policy, the model also produces parallel, sparse, and active spatial working memories, that is, local maps of the environment. The underlying mechanisms of the model are based on the well known formalism that describes the self-organization of collective foraging strategies in social insects. This metaphor is particularly interesting because of its similarities with the problem tackled in this article, that is, the one of parallel visual attention. This claim is validated by experimental results on a simulated robot performing local navigation, where the ability of the model to generate accurate visual attention and spatial memories in a parsimonious and robust way is shown.",

    "abstract": "There are many different kinds of model and scientists do all kind of things with them. This diversity of model type and model use is a good thing for science. Indeed, it is crucial especially for the biological and cognitive sciences, which have to solve many different problems at many different scales, ranging from the most concrete of the structural details of a DNA molecule to the most abstract and generic principles of self-organization in networks. Getting a grip (or more likely many separate grips) on this range of topics calls for a teeming forest of techniques, including many different modeling techniques. Barbara Webb’s target article strikes us as a proposal for clear-cutting the forest. We think clear-cutting here would be as good for science as it is for non-metaphorical forests. Our argument for this is primarily a recitation of a few of the ways that diversity has been useful. Recently, looking at the actual practice of artificial life modelers, one of us distinguished four uses of simulation models classified in terms of the position the models take up between theory and data (see Figure 1). The classification is not exhaustive, and the barriers between kinds are not absolute. Rather, the purpose of the taxonomy is to open up the view for an epistemic ecology of modeling practices. First, and closest to the empirical domain, there are mechanistic models, in which there is an almost one-to-one correspondence between variables in the model and observables in the target system and its environment. Webb’s cricket robot is a paradigmatic example of this type. Second, there are functional models, which aim for a behavioral or functional rather than a variable-to-variable correspondence between the model system and its target. Many models in cognitive psychology are of this type, as are many in biology when the underlying mechanisms are not accessible to modeling correspondence (see Vickerstaff & Di Paolo, 2005, for a good example of this). Third, there are generic models, which cover a wide spectrum of phenomena in search for generic principles of complex systems. Cellular automata, random Boolean networks, and the like belong to this class. Finally, there are conceptual models, which do not target any particular natural system nor a wide spectrum of them. Instead conceptual models are built from theories, for which they embody assumptions, illustrate concepts, simulate theoretical principles, and so forth. Beer’s model and many other animats are of this type (for more details see Barandiaran, 2008, chap. 2; Barandiaran & Moreno, 2006). Modeling is a relational activity, it involves the template or construct (usually referred as the model) and also an interpretative framework (made of assumptions, generalizations, definitions, etc.) that puts the model in connection with other models, theories or objects. It is this interpretative framework and the modelers’ intentions that situate a given model into one of the categories of models. But only mechanistic models are used as Webb suggests all models should be: “the cricket robot is a mixed physical and computational implementation of a particular hypothesis about an observed phenomenon of sensorimotor behavior in",

Their theoretical language is, in essence, a strict mathematical formalism applied to the description of variables (usually quantitative ones) that can – at least in principle – be measured by mechanical instruments. In such a language, what is the definition of an agent? Of an act? In contrast to previous approaches, which attempt to discriminate between agent and non-agent systems, we pursue a more Dennettian approach that attempts only to characterise the explanatory logic of intentional (agentive) interpretations of a physical system; we wish to do so purely in terms of the formal relations that hold between variables in a dynamical system or stochastic process. Our approach is straightforward: we use Pearl’s causal formalism to identify physical variables at the causal boundary between ‘agent’ and ‘environment’, and identify these with variables in Bayesian decision theory; this provides a rigorous bridge between mathematical models of physics and mathematical models of rational decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Biological agents need to complete perception-action cycles to perform various cognitive and biological tasks such as maximizing their wellbeing and their chances of genetic continuation. However, the processes performed in these cycles come at a cost. Such costs force the agent to evaluate a tradeoff between the optimality of the decision making and the time and computational effort required to make it. Several cognitive mechanisms that play critical roles in managing this tradeoff have been identified. These mechanisms include adaptation, learning, memory, attention, and planning. One of the often overlooked outcomes of these cognitive mechanisms, in spite of the critical effect that they may have on the perception-action cycle of organisms, is “emotion.” In this study, we hold that emotion can be considered as an emergent phenomenon of a plausible neurocomputational energy regulation mechanism, which generates an internal reward signal to minimize the neural energy consumption of a sequence of actions (decisions), where each action triggers a visual memory recall process. To realize an optimal action selection over a sequence of actions in a visual recalling task, we adopted a model-free reinforcement learning framework, in which the reward signal—that is, the cost—was based on the iteration steps of the convergence state of an associative memory network. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in simulation and on a robotic platform: the iCub humanoid robot. The results show that the computational energy regulation mechanism enables the agent to modulate its behavior to minimize the required neurocomputational energy in performing the visual recalling task.",

As a result, primate models for technical and cognitive evolution, rooted in the teleological functionalism of the Neo-Darwinist approach, reduce tool use to the unit of the individual, conflating technology with technique and physical cognition with problem-solving computations of energetic efficiency. This article attempts, through the application of material engagement theory, to explore non-human primate technology as a non-individualistic phenomenon in which technique is co-constructed through the ontogenetic development of skill within a dynamic system of structured action affordances and material interactions which constitute an emergent, species-specific mode of technical cognition.",

Behavioral diversity is an inherent feature of all animals, and it is also important for robots to perform adaptively in unknown and dynamically changing environments. This feature enables animals to select adaptive behavior from among versatile behaviors. However, most designers have avoided or ignored behavioral diversity while constructing artificial systems, with the aim of achieving highly optimized performance in specific environments for given tasks; this leads to vulnerability of these systems to environmental changes. To understand how behavioral diversity can be embedded into artificial systems, we focus on a large amoeba-like unicellular organism, i.e., the plasmodium of true slime mold ( Physarum polycephalum), in this study. Despite the absence of a central nervous system, the plasmodium exhibits various types of locomotion (i.e., exploratory, taxis, and escape behaviors) and switches its behavior depending on the environment. Inspired by this primitive yet intelligent living organism, we build a modular robot that exhibits exploratory and taxis locomotions, and spontaneously switches between them in a fully decentralized manner according to the situation encountered. The results are expected to shed new light on a design scheme for life-like robots that exhibit amazingly versatile and adaptive behaviors.",

Intrinsically motivated particle swarm optimisation can be used for adaptive task allocation when the nature of the target task is not well understood in advance, or can change over time. We first present a general framework in which a computational model of motivation generates a dynamic fitness function to focus the attention of the particle swarm. We then discuss two approaches to modelling motivation in this framework: a computational model of curiosity using an unsupervised neural network and a model of novelty based on background subtraction. We introduce metrics for evaluating intrinsically motivated particle swarm optimisation and test our algorithm as an approach to task allocation in a workplace hazard mitigation scenario. We found that both proposed motivation techniques work well for generating a fitness function that can locate hazards, without requiring a precise definition of a hazard. We found that particle swarm optimisation can converge on optima in our generated fitness landscape in some, but not all, of our simulations.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation, the gathering of individuals into a single group as observed in animals such as birds, bees, and amoeba, is known to provide protection against predators or resistance to adverse environmental conditions for the whole. Cue-based aggregation, where environmental cues determine the location of aggregation, is known to be challenging when the swarm density is low. Here, we propose a novel aggregation method applicable to real robots in low-density swarms. Previously, Landmark-Based Aggregation (LBA) method had used odometric dead-reckoning coupled with visual landmarks and yielded better aggregation in low-density swarms. However, the method’s performance was affected adversely by odometry drift, jeopardizing its application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a novel Reinforcement Learning-based Aggregation method, RLA, is proposed to increase aggregation robustness, thus making aggregation possible for real robots in low-density swarm settings. Systematic experiments conducted in a kinematic-based simulator and on real robots have shown that the RLA method yielded larger aggregates, is more robust to odometry noise than the LBA method, and adapts better to environmental changes while not being sensitive to parameter tuning, making it better deployable under real-world conditions.",

The robots switch searching and resting behavior in a distributed manner to perform foraging quickly and energy efficiently. It is known that robots that are resting can act as a potential labor pool in addition to saving energy. Because they function as a potential labor pool, resting robots can help with foraging if needed. In this study, we consider the group foraging task, which requires two or more robots to transport a food item. In a group foraging task, resting robots can help with the transportation of a heavy food item in response to the recruitment of other robots. Until now, the efficacy of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool has been suggested, but the environments in which this function is dominant is still unknown. In this study, we propose a state-transition model for robots that includes the resting behavior and investigate the performance through multi-agent simulation. By comparing models with and without the resting behavior, we found that the function of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool is dominant in cases when the food items are heavy or the population is small.",

Through a narrative-theoretical review of the literature on creativity’s conceptualization, nature, and valuation, we examine how social, cultural, and psychological factors have influenced the understanding of creativity throughout history. The discussion contrasts key aspects at the individual level, such as motivation, personality, intuition, exceptionality, and intelligence, with group dimensions like domain, field, collaboration, background, and the societal consequences of creative acts. The paper presents diverse psychological frameworks, including behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, humanistic psychology, and cognitive psychology, each offering unique insights into the mechanisms behind creativity. By tracing the historical phases of creativity—from its early association with divine creation to its modern applications in art, science, and technology, as well as its relationship with artificial intelligence—this paper highlights how creativity has been judged and valued across different eras. One of the conclusions drawn is that while the concept of artistic genius and originality cannot be disentangled from its broader social and cultural context, creativity is also an intensely personal psychological process, with the internalized sociocultural context acting as a proxy for external fields and domains.",

In this commentary, I highlight the book’s potential relevance for animal welfare science, where understanding species-specific affective experiences is central. Veit’s concept of pathological complexity, the adaptive challenge of managing life-history trade-offs, provides a compelling functional rationale for the evolution of consciousness. This framework has important implications for both comparative cognition and welfare science, encouraging us to consider consciousness as a gradual and multidimensional phenomenon shaped by ecological demands. While the book’s theoretical depth may require careful reading for those outside philosophy or evolutionary biology, Veit’s openness to critique, and his use of rich biological examples make the work an important contribution. By emphasising evaluative richness as a core dimension of consciousness, Veit lays the groundwork for an empirical bridge between consciousness studies and animal welfare research. I argue that integrating his framework into welfare science could help refine our methods for assessing animal affect and agency. If consciousness evolved to guide living well, then investigating how animals thrive is not only ethically meaningful but also conceptually essential to understanding consciousness itself.",

Despite this uncertainty, however, real environments usually afford structure that can be effectively exploited by organisms. The article examines environmental characteristics and struc tures that enable humans to survive and thrive in a wide range of real environments. The rela tionsnip between these characteristics and structures, uncertainty, and cognitive structure is ex plored in the context of PLAN, a proposed model of human cognitive mapping, and R-PLAN, a version of PLAN that has been instantiated on an actual mobile robot. An examination of these models helps to provide insight into environmental characteristics which impact human perfor mance on tasks which require interaction with the world.",

When very similar colors are used, moths select the correct color during the first test on a given day, thus using a stimulus strategy, but after repeated rewards, they switch to a place strategy and choose the flower in the position where they received the reward. When dissimilar colors are used, the moths continue to select flowers based on color and ignore position. We show how a computational model can reproduce the behavior in the experimental situation. The aim of the model is to investigate which learning and behavior selection strategies are necessary to reproduce the behavior observed in the experiment. The model is based on behavioral data and the sensitivities of the moth photoreceptors. The model consists of a number of interacting behavior systems that are triggered by specific stimuli and control specific behaviors. The ability of the moth to learn the colors of different flowers and the adaptive processes involved in the choice between stimulus-approach and place-approach strategies are reproduced very accurately by the model. The model has implications both for further studies of the ecology of the animal and for robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Much is known about the evolution of speech. Fossil evidence points to modern adaptations for speech appearing between 1.5 million and 500,000 years ago. Studies of vocal behavior in apes show the ability to use combinatorial vocalizations in some species (but not chimpanzees) and some cultural influence on vocalizations, but little ability for vocal imitation. For modern speech, the comparison of many languages shows that speech can become extremely complex, but that it can also be astonishingly simple. Finally, the way in which infants acquire speech is becoming increasingly clear. We therefore know about the starting point of the evolution of speech, its end point and some steps in between. Much less is known about the exact scenario and the dynamics of the evolution of the acquisition of speech. As it involves co-evolution between culturally transmitted sounds and genetic evolution, the dynamics are complex. Computer models are therefore ideal for studying these dynamics. This paper presents a computer model of the co-evolution between a repertoire of speech sounds and a population of learners that can either represent a lexicon holistically or combinatorially. It shows that cultural influences can change the dynamics of the transition between a population of holistic and combinatorial learners.",

By proposing a simple computational model for microslips, we examine the microslip as an implicit parallel dynamics underneath human cognition. Here, an agent, given as a dynamical system of a simple neural architecture, takes one of two choices, whose neural net is evolved using a genetic algorithm. An evolved agent often shows a hierarchy of action primitives and intentionality, and the agent is sensitive to the subtle differences of the object's layout, which results in a complex basin structures in the action-selection landscape.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we describe an adaptive controller for an autonomous mobile robot with a simple structure. Sensorimotor connections were made using a three-layered spiking neural network (SNN) with only one hidden-layer neuron and synapses with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the SNN controller, synapses from the hidden-layer neuron to the motor neurons received presynaptic modulation signals from sensory neurons, a mechanism similar to that of the withdrawal reflex circuit of the sea slug, Aplysia. The synaptic weights were modified dependent on the firing rates of the presynaptic modulation signal and that of the hidden-layer neuron by STDP. In experiments using a real robot, which uses a similar simple SNN controller, the robot adapted quickly to the given environment in a single trial by organizing the weights, acquired navigation and obstacle-avoidance behavior. In addition, it followed dynamical changes in the environment. This associative learning scheme can be a new strategy for constructing adaptive agents with minimal structures, and may be utilized as an essential mechanism of an SNN ensemble that binds multiple sensory inputs and generates multiple motor outputs.",

By answering this question it becomes possible to investigate what are the simplest cognitive systems. It addresses the question by treating cognition as a solution to a design problem. It defines a nested sequence of design problems: (1) How can a system persist? (2) How can a system affect its environment to improve its persistence? (3) How can a system utilize better information from the environment to select better actions? And, (4) How can a system reduce its inherent informational limitations to achieve more successful behavior? This provides a corresponding nested sequence of system classes: (1) autonomous systems, (2) (re)active autonomous systems, (3) informationally controlled autonomous systems (autonomous agents), and (4) cognitive systems. This article provides the following characterization of cognition: The cognitive system is the set of mechanisms of an autonomous agent that (1) allow increase of the correlation and integration between the environment and the information system of the agent, so that (2) the agent can improve the selection of actions and thereby produce more successful behavior. Finally, it shows that common cognitive capacities satisfy the characterization: learning, memory, representation, decision making, reasoning, attention, and communication.",

The difficulty in understanding these mechanisms lies therefore (1) in the multi- and interdisciplinary nature of this issue, and (2) in keeping up with very rapid developments in various scientific fields. This Special Issue provides an interdisciplinary approach to predator–prey interactions to identify how phenotypic traits of both types of organisms interact and how each can act as a selective pressure on the evolution of a population of organisms at the different levels of the trophic chain. Moreover, we show that confronting bodies of knowledge that a priori appear as remote as those of robotics and experimental biology or ecology may seem difficult but can provide reciprocal understanding.",

SSDs usually support disabled users by replacing sensory inputs that have been lost, but they also offer a unique opportunity to study adaptation and flexibility in human perception. Current debates in sensory substitution (SS) literature focus mostly on its neural correlates and behavioural consequences. In particular, studies have demonstrated the neural plasticity of the visual brain regions that are activated by the substituting modality. Participants also adapt to using the devices for a broad spectrum of cognitive tasks that usually require sight. However, little is known about the SS experience. Also, there is no agreement on how the phenomenology of SS should be studied. Here, we offer guidelines for the methodology of studies investigating behavioural adaptation to SS and the effects of this adaptation on the subjective SS experience. We also discuss factors that may influence the results of SS studies: (1) the type of SSD, (2) the effects of training, (3) the role of sensory deprivation, (4) the role of the experimental environment, (5) the role of the tasks participants follow, and (6) the characteristics of the participants. In addition, we propose combining qualitative and quantitative methods and discuss how this should be achieved when studying the neural, behavioural, and experiential consequences of SS.",

Considering that the performance of emergency management could be affected by many different factors, it is hard to improve all the factors under the condition of limited resources. One approach that works well is to optimize the key factors that affect emergency management. To this end, an integrated method based on fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient is presented in this article to determine the critical risk factors in emergency management. First, the causal relationships between the risk factors influencing emergency management are determined according to expert opinions. To verify if the survey results from experts are reliable, an item-average correlation test based on Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient is performed. Then, two scenarios are designed and the FCM method is utilized to identifying the critical risk factors of emergency management. Finally, five critical factors are figured out, and the efficiency of emergency management could be enhanced by optimizing these five factors. In addition, a comparative analysis is also conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method.",

The proposed controller does not utilize the robot dynamic model. A wavelet-based TSFN is utilized to approximate adaptively the lumped nonlinear terms, parameter uncertainties, and defective torque signal. The wavelet block acts as a feature extractor, reduces the number of fuzzy rules, and also acts as a normalization function. The parameters of TSFN are tuned online by an adaptive law based on Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed controller guarantees the desired specification such as minimum speed of convergence, maximum steady-state error, overshoot concerning the position tracking error, and also bounded closed-loop signals. Numerical simulations on MATLAB/SimMechanics environment demonstrate the stable walking of the quadruped robot in the presence of the actuator faults and parameter uncertainties.",

This article focuses on the idea that ASC involves impairments in the capacity to connect with the feelings and actions of others. The metaphor of social connectedness might be considered somewhat uninformative, hardly specific of ASC, and ultimately compatible with a variety of competing approaches to social impairments in ASC. Nevertheless, here I develop an account of social connectedness which plays a distinctive and informative role in further understanding ASC. My strategy is to explore the role of social reciprocity in relation to the difficulties that persons with ASC have with social connectedness. Drawing on the work of Peter Hobson, I propose that such difficulties primarily involve experiences and actions that require the uptake or response from another subject for their fulfillment. I clarify and develop this idea by introducing the concept of minimal social act, inspired by the work of the phenomenologists Adolf Reinach and Dietrich von Hildebrand, and by discussing some 4E (i.e., embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended) approaches to ASC. On the current proposal, minimal social acts are pervasive and developmentally critical experiences that have built into their conditions of success a receptiveness or responsiveness from the subject to whom they are directed.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a computational model for altruistic behavior, shows its implementation on a physical robot, and presents the results of human–robot interaction experiments conducted with the implemented system. Inspired from the sensorimotor mechanisms of the primate brain, object affordances are utilized for both intention estimation and action execution, in particular, to generate altruistic behavior. At the core of the model is the notion that sensorimotor systems developed for movement generation can be used to process the visual stimuli generated by actions of the others, infer the goals behind, and take the necessary actions to help achieving these goals, potentially leading to the emergence of altruistic behavior. Therefore, we argue that altruistic behavior is not necessarily a consequence of deliberate cognitive processing but may emerge through basic sensorimotor processes such as error minimization, that is, minimizing the difference between the observed and expected outcomes. In the model, affordances also play a key role by constraining the possible set of actions that an observed actor might be engaged in, enabling a fast and accurate intention inference. The model components are implemented on an upper-body humanoid robot. A set of experiments are conducted validating the workings of the components of the model, such as affordance extraction and task execution. Significantly, to assess how human partners interact with our altruistic model deployed robot, extensive experiments with naïve subjects are conducted. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model can explain emergent altruistic behavior in reference to its biological counterpart and moreover engage human partners to exploit this behavior when implemented on an anthropomorphic robot.",

The process of perceptual learning is key in our cognitive life and development: we can learn to discriminate environmental aspects and hence adapt ourselves to it, using our resources intelligently. Perceptual learning, according to the classic cognitivist view, is based on the enrichment of passively received stimuli, a linear operation on sensations that results in a representation of the original information. This representation can be useful for other processes that generate an output, like a motor command, for example. On the contrary, alternative approaches to perceptual learning, different from the one depicted in the classic cognitivist theory, share the ideas that perception and action are intrinsically tied and that cognitive processes rely on embodiment and situatedness. These approaches usually claim that mental representations are not useful concepts, at least when portraying a process of perceptual learning. Approaches within post-cognitivism are not a unified theory, but a diversity of perspectives that need to establish a dialogue among their different methodologies. In particular, this special issue is focused on ecological psychology and enactivism as key traditions within the post-cognitivist constellation.",

A key component in reinforcement learning is the reward function, which, according to an emerging consensus, should be intrinsic to the learning agent and a matter of appraisal rather than a simple reflection of external outcomes. We describe an approach to intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning that involves various aspects of happiness, operationalized as dynamic estimates of well-being. In four experiments, in which simulated agents learned to explore and forage in simulated environments, we show that agents whose reward function properly balances momentary (hedonic) and longer-term (eudaimonic) well-being outperform agents equipped with standard fitness-oriented reward functions. Our findings suggest that happiness-based features can be useful in developing robust, general-purpose reward mechanisms for intrinsically motivated autonomous agents.",

This is combined with a probabilistic model of uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed, which exploits borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out, in which agents apply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus operator in isolation, we also investigate scenarios in which agents are influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the former, we conduct simulations that combine consensus formation with belief updating based on evidence. For the latter, we investigate the effect of assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible they are in the consensus building process. In all cases, applying the consensus operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief that is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations that combine consensus formation with evidential updating converge more quickly to a shared opinion, which is closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence.

    "abstract": "External representations ( ERs) are objects or performances in the world whose proper function is to communicate about other things in the world. Why and how did we make them, and what do they give us? We outline a simple framework for thinking about ERs grounded in modern machine learning. We propose a minimal set of neural mechanisms needed for open-ended ER production. Our constructivist enactive view contrasts with nativist views which propose specialist neural modules requiring symbolic internal representations. We propose a plausible set of (biological and cultural) evolutionary steps to full Gricean symbolic communication via a set of increasingly complex enactive algorithms for ER production. A pragmatic space of games is defined, which includes not only fully cooperative language games but also science, art, and evolved signal manipulation games. This space is defined by the complexity of learning needed by sender and receiver. We propose that one important step towards open-ended ER use was selection for bush reading, which like mind-reading is an inferential process requiring complex contextual and syntactic understanding of cues about events displaced in space and time. Bush reading pre-adapted receivers to be receptive, competent, and perspicacious interpreters of later intentionally produced signals about hidden topics such as felt mental states. This paved the way for minimally Gricean communication, which subsequently could be bootstrapped into explicit theories of mind, folk psychology narratives, and symbolic language in general. Recent findings in cognitive archaeology are integrated within the framework, and new experiments in machine learning suggested.",

We argue that, similarly, each behavior of a recurrent behavior network should be an attractor of the network, to inhibit fruitless, repeated switching between different behaviors in response to small changes in the environment and in motivations. We demonstrate that the performance in a test domain of the Do the Right Thing recurrent behavior network is improved by redesigning it to create desirable attractors and basins of attraction. We further show that this performance increase is correlated with an increase in persistence and a decrease in undesirable behavior switching.",

Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior.

From an embodied perspective perception-action provides the key feature for anything cognitive, and one may wonder whether this model does exemplify perception-action relations to a sufficient degree. The problem is that we hardly have any good criteria on this count, just intuitions.

These oscillators are driven by an internal noise, which results in phase transitions in their activity. External stimuli modify the activity via sensors and food consumption. The interaction among the activity of oscillators and external influences give rise to an emergence of searching rules that are similar to those shared by various organisms, thus favoring this hypothesis. The hypothesis can be verified further by investigating various types of nonlinear systems in different environments.",

Based on the psychological background wrapped in a framework of anticipatory behavioral control, the anticipatory learning classifier system ACS2 is explained. ACS2 learns and generalizes on-line a predictive environmental model (a model that allows the prediction of future environmental states). The model is a subjective model, that is, no global state information is available to the agent. It is shown that ACS2 can simulate anticipatory learning processes and anticipatory controlled behavior by means of the model. The simulations of various rat experiments, previously conducted by Colwill and Rescorla, show that the incorporation of anticipations is indeed crucial for simulating the behavior observed in rats. Despite the simplicity of the tasks, we show that the observed behavior reaches beyond the capabilities of model-free reinforcement learning as well as model-based reinforcement learning without on-line generalization. Possible future impacts of anticipations in adaptive learning systems are outlined.",

Adaptation allows agents to change their behavior in order to improve the overall sys tem performance. We describe a general mechanism for adaptation in multi-agent systems in which agents modify their behavior in response to changes in the environment or actions of other agents. The agents estimate the global state of the system from local observations and adjust their actions accordingly. We derive a mathematical model that describes the collective behavior of such adaptive systems. The model, consisting of coupled rate equations, governs how the collective behavior changes in time. We apply the model to study collaboration in a group of mobile robots. The system we study is an adaptive version of the collaborative stick pulling in a group of robots examined in detail in earlier works (Ijspeert, Martinoli, Billard, &amp; Gambardela, 2001; Lerman, Galstyan, Martinoli, &amp; Ijspeert, 2001). In adaptive stick pulling, robots estimate the number of robots and sticks in the system and adjust their individual behavior so as to improve collective performance. We solve the mathematical model and show that adaptation improves collective performance for all parameter values.",

These forms of behavior exploit emergent characteristics of the interaction between the body of the robot, its control system, and the environment.

While regular cycling manifests itself as a characteristic banded plot, irregular cycling produces an irregular tartan pattern that is also consistent with random drift through strategy space. Although this tartan pattern is often reported in the literature on coevolutionary algorithms, it has received little attention or analysis. Here we argue that irregular cycling will tend to be more prevalent than regular cycling, and that it corresponds to a class of coevolutionary scenario that is important both theoretically and in practice. As such, it is desirable that we improve our ability to distinguish its occurrence from that of random drift, and other forms of coevolutionary dynamic.",

The key of the control system is the perceptual core, where heterogeneous information coming from sensors is merged to build an internal portrait representing the current situation of the environment. The internal representation triggers an action as the response to the current stimuli, closing the loop between the agent and the external world. The robot's internal state is implemented through a nonlinear lattice of neuron cells, allowing the generation of a large amount of emergent steady-state solutions in the form of Turing patterns. These are incrementally shaped, through learning, so as to constitute a “mirror” of the environmental conditions. Reaction—diffusion cellular nonlinear networks were chosen to generate Turing patterns as internal representations of the robot surroundings. The associations between incoming sensations and the perceptual core, and between Turing patterns and actions to be performed, are driven by two reward-based learning mechanisms. We report on simulation results and experiments on a roving robot to show the suitability of the approach.",

A series of experiments with an autonomous agent implementing a collision-free goal-following behavior is presented in five simulated environments with different levels of difficulty. Two types of immune network based action selection mechanism are examined: (a) independently acting and (b) emotionally influenced.

Neurodynamics focuses on the dynamics of neural control, while observing interfaces with the world and the body. From this perspective, we present a dynamical analysis of embodied recurrent neural networks evolved to control a cybernetic device that solves a problem in active tracking. For competent action selection, agents must rely on the attractor landscapes of the evolved networks. Insights into how the networks achieve this are given in terms of the network's dynamical substrate, which highlights the role of the network's inherent attractors as they change as a function of the input parameters (sensors). We introduce some terminological extensions to neurodynamics to allow for a more precise formulation of how attractor changes influence behavior generation: in particular, attractor landscapes, which are the space of all attractors accessible through coherent parametrizations of the network (input stimuli), and the meta-transient, which resolves behavior by approaching attractors as they shape-shift. We apply these concepts to the analysis of interesting behaviors of the tracking device, such as temporal contextual dependency, chaotic transitory regimes in moments of ambiguity, and implicit mapping of environmental asymmetricities in the response of the device. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the concepts introduced in terms of autonomy, learning, and modularity.",

Motivated reinforcement learning is a promising model for developmental robotics because it provides a way for artificial agents to build and adapt their skill-sets autonomously over time. However, new models and metrics are needed to scale existing motivated reinforcement learning algorithms to the complex, real-world environments inhabited by robots.

Further, it eliminates some of the chief criticisms of the ILM: that it does not study grounded languages, that it does not include peer learning, and that it builds in a bias for compositional languages. We show that, over the span of a few generations, a stable linguistic system emerges that can be acquired very quickly by each generation, is compositional, and helps the agents to solve the classification problem with which they are faced. The ICG also leads to a different interpretation of the language acquisition process. It suggests that the role of parents is to initialize the linguistic system of the child in such a way that subsequent interaction with peers results in rapid convergence to the correct language.",

    "abstract": "Social media users can easily be offended or hurt on those platforms, which leads to discomfort and health issues such as stress and anxiety. Forgiveness plays an important role to maintain healthy online relationships, which is the central constituent of social dynamics, from cooperation to social cohesion. While most prior studies have focused on analyzing forgiveness factors in offline settings using statistical methods, this study offers a new perspective using a two-staged approach whereby a research model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), and then the results were used as inputs for artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) models. An agent-based simulation was then performed to shed light on a possible use of the implemented models. Combining ANN and FL provided more accurate prediction results. In addition, simulation experiments call attention to the potential benefits of forgiveness in maintaining connectedness in a social network. The main purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the applicability of soft computing techniques on forgiveness prediction. Instead of relying on data mining techniques, we looked into questions that can improve our understanding of how society works in a digital age. In addition, this study provides an interesting example of a different and insightful way of doing computational social science that is useful to both researchers and practitioners.",

We compared leap up strategies between two distantly related amniote species, Anolis carolinensis (Squamate) and Microcebus murinus (Lemuriform) known to use leaping as their major locomotor mode for predator avoidance. Our comparative analysis and model show that leaping strategies (flat jump trajectory in horizontal leaps, use of forelimbs in landing) are similar in both species. The most striking divergence concerns only the temporal joint sequence accommodation to leaping height, although an identical proximal-to-distal sequence is observed when both taxa leap to maximal height. We suggest a convergent exaptation of leaping biomechanics among arboreal amniotes, which reflects similar biomechanical constraints and evolutionary pressures in these animals.",

However, this can only be part of the story: (1) the “hippocampal chart” provided by place cells and grid cells differs radically when a rat is placed in different environments and so a higher level organization is needed to link these charts into an overall cognitive map of the rat’s world; and (2) even without a hippocampus a rat can exploit much of the spatial structure of its world. The World Graph (WG) model addressed the former problem, whereas the Taxon Affordance Model (TAM) was developed to address the latter, with the two models being integrated to form the TAM-WG model. Here we provide a new version strengthened in three ways: (1) we relate the TAM model to explicit ideas of executability and desirability; (2) we show how temporal difference learning elegantly supplies “spatial difference learning” to resolve the debate between the local hypothesis and the non-local hypothesis for node selection in the original WG model; and (3) we analyze an explicit example of how the “locometric map” provided by grid cells and place cells can complement the high-level cognitive map given by the WG, demonstrating the importance of navigation algorithms that integrate across multiple levels of spatial organization.",

    "abstract": "Weakly electric fish use electric organ discharge (EOD) and their electroreceptors to identify prey, explore their surroundings, and communicate with other members of the same species. They are specialized in active electrolocation using a self-generated electric field, and they can sense distortion of their self-generated electric field caused by a target object. Electric fish have many electrosensors on the surface of their body, and the sensor readings from the electroreceptors form an electric image. A correlation exists between features of the electric images and characteristics of a target object. In estimating the location of a target object, the intensity, width, and slope of the electric image must be considered. In this article, we suggest that periodic EOD signals are helpful to extract localization features from noisy electrosensory signals. Cross-correlation between an efference copy signal and sensory signals in the waveform can produce filtered signals in the temporal domain. For a biomimetic fish robot, we can use two-phase filtering: noise-filtering with cross-correlation in the temporal axis and additional filtering in the rostrocaudal spatial axis. This spatiotemporal filtering can effectively remove noise, thus making it possible to obtain accurate localization features of a target object in an underwater environment.",

    "abstract": "Game theory is commonly used to study social behavior in cooperative or competitive situations. One socioeconomic game, Stag Hunt, involves the trade-off between social and individual benefit by offering the option to hunt a low-payoff hare alone or a high-payoff stag cooperatively. Stag Hunt encourages the creation of social contracts as a result of the payoff matrix, which favors cooperation. By playing Stag Hunt with set-strategy computer agents, the social component is degraded because of the inability of subjects to dynamically affect the outcomes of iterated games, as would be the case when playing against another subject. However, playing with an adapting agent has the potential to evoke unique and complex reactions in subjects because of its ability to change its own strategy based on its experience over time, both within and between games. In the present study, 40 subjects played the iterated Stag Hunt with five agents differing in strategy: exclusive hare hunting, exclusive stag hunting, random, Win-Stay-Lose-Shift, and adapting. The results indicated that the adapting agent caused subjects to spend more time and effort in each game, exhibiting a more complicated path to their destination. This suggests that adapting agents exhibit behavior similar to human opponents, evoking more natural social responses in subjects.",

In total, 17 young adults (aged 25.1 ± 2.4 years) and 14 older adults (aged 72.6 ± 3.4 years) participated in the study. The subjects were instructed to press both hands simultaneously to match the 1 Hz sine curve force under two conditions (with or without calculation) with continuous visual feedback. Differences in bimanual motor synergy, bimanual coordination, force accuracy, force variability, and calculation speed were compared. This study found that the specific motor control strategy of older adults involved a decreased bimanual force control ability with both increased V UCM and V ORT , and was not influenced by dual tasking. These findings might have implications for establishing interventions for aging-induced hand force control deficits.",

Central place foraging (CPF) models have been used for analyzing foraging behaviours of hunter-gatherers and drawing a causal link from the volume of available resources in the environment to the mobility decisions of hunter-gatherers. In this study, we propose a spatially explicit agent-based CPF model. We explore its potential for explaining the formation of settlement patterns and test its robustness to the configuration of space. Building on a model assuming homogeneous energy distributions, we had to add several new parameters and an adaptation mechanism for foragers to predict the length of their stay, together with a heterogeneous environment configuration. The validation of the model shows that the spatially explicit CPF is generally robust to spatial configuration of energy resources. The total volume of energy has a significant effect on constraining sedentism as predicted by aspatial model and thus can be used on different environmental conditions. Still the spatial autocorrelation of resource distribution has a linear effect on optimal mobility decisions and needs to be considered in predictive models. The effect on settlement location choice is not substantial and is more determined by other characteristics of settlement location. This limits the CPF models in analyzing settlement pattern formation processes.",

The former being called the self-organized aggregation, and the latter being called the cue-based aggregation. One of the fascinating examples of cue-based aggregation is the thermotactic behavior of young honeybees. Young honeybees aggregate on optimal temperature zones in the hive using a simple set of behaviors. The state-of-the-art cue-based aggregation method BEECLUST was derived based on these behaviors. The BEECLUST method is a very simple, yet a very capable method that has favorable characteristics such as robustness to noise and simplicity to apply. However, the BEECLUST method does not perform well in low robot densities. In this article, inspired by the navigation techniques used by ants and bees, a self-adaptive landmark-based aggregation method is proposed. In this method, robots use landmarks in the environment to locate the cue once they “learn” the relative position of the cue with respect to the landmark. With the introduction of an error threshold parameter, the method also becomes adaptive to changes in the environment. Through systematic experiments in kinematic and realistic simulators with different parameters, robot densities, and cue sizes, it was observed that using the information of the environment makes the proposed method to show better performance than the BEECLUST in all the settings, including low robot density, high noise, and dynamic conditions.",

    "abstract": "A central question in the evolution of human language is how it emerged. Based on recent research across disciplines, we identified three processes proposed as potential driving factors behind the evolution of ‘modern’ language phenotype: i) a reduction in reactive aggression entailing a boost in prosociality and cooperation, ii) a change in early brain growth trajectory that impacted structures like the cerebellum and striatum, and thus likely impacted the (procedural) memory circuits these regions support, and iii) a demographic expansion of H. sapiens during the Middle Pleistocene. While extensively researched on their own, the interaction between these three processes has yet to be investigated systematically. We develop an abstract agent-based model to interrogate the relationship between these three factors and how they influence transmission of information within a population, which we take to be the essence of language. The model abstracts linguistic capacity to an ‘array of skills’ and investigates under what conditions the number of skills increases. The results demonstrate that there is an optimal degree of cooperation and memory capacity at which the amount of transmitted information is the highest. Our model also shows that separate linguistic communities arise under circumstances where individuals have high levels of memory capacity and there is at least a certain degree of non-cooperation. In contrast, we find no significant direct effects for population size in the process of linguistic community formation. Taken together, these results highlight the explanatory benefits of combining insights from cognitive science, archaeology, and computational modelling.",

    "abstract": "Self-organisation in robot swarms can produce collective behaviours, particularly through spatial self-organisation. For example, it can be used to ensure that the robots in a swarm move collectively. However, from a designer’s point of view, understanding precisely what happens in a swarm that allows these behaviours to emerge at the macroscopic level remains a difficult task. The same behaviour can come from multiple different controllers (ie the control algorithm of a robot) and a single controller can give rise to multiple different behaviours, sometimes caused by slight changes in self-organisation. To grasp the causes of these differences, it is necessary to investigate the relationships between the many methods of self-organisation that exist and the various behaviours that can be obtained. The work presented here addresses self-organisation in robot swarms by focusing on the main behaviours that lead to spatial self-organisation of the robots. First, we propose a unified definition of the different behaviours and present an original classification system highlighting ten self-organisation methods that each allow one or more behaviours to be performed. An analysis, based on this classification system, links the identified mechanisms with behaviours that could be considered as obtainable or not. Finally, we discuss some perspectives on this work, notably from the point of view of an operator or designer.",

In this paper, we employ the ecological-enactive approach to cognition to explain how atmospheres are perceived and created. According to that approach, cognitive systems actively explore meaningful possibilities for action in their environments. We thereby construe the perception of atmospheres as the possibilities for being in certain moods by exploring what the place affords. The perception of atmospheres is, therefore, a meaningful activity that is ultimately related to the organism’s biological interests, which we argue, is a type of meaning that cannot be fully conveyed descriptively. From this, it seems to follow that architects cannot foresee the atmospheres of a place during the designing phase of their projects. We avoid this undesirable conclusion by evoking the material engagement theory and the situated aspect of cognitive performances. Accordingly, skillful architects can imagine the intended atmospheres of a place by creating what we call proto-atmospheres, which involves creatively thinking through and with their tools.",

A controlled laboratory experiment is used to test the effect of interactions between members of a social group and across social groups on the walk dynamics of people. This study tries to discover the trade-off made by people between the need to communicate/interact between group members and the need to avoid collision with opposing pedestrians in a bidirectional flow. Thirty adults participated in a series of controlled experiments. The individuals and group characteristics were compared to study the effect of social groups. Spatial patterns/group formations, average walking speeds, and deviation from the desired direction of motion were assessed. The analysis shows that time to cross the platform is the least when triads adopt the river and inverted V group formations. In contrast, V and line-abreast group formations require slightly more time and are better suited to promote interactions between the group members. Irrespective of the initial formation adopted by participants, there is a higher tendency for the groups to shift to river formation or inverted V formations. This may be a result of the higher group speeds observed in the Inverted V and river formations, which accelerates their progress in the direction of motion. The understanding of walking dynamics of social groups from this study can enable better planning of pedestrian facilities and crowded events.",

This article presents a neural network model to account for the detection of and response to a looming stimulus. The generation of an appropriate response includes five tasks: detection of a looming stimulus, localization of the stimulus position, computation of the direction of the stimulus movement, determination of escape direction, and selection of a proper motor action. The detection of a looming stimulus is achieved based on the expansion of the retinal image and depth information. The spatial location of the stimulus is encoded by a population of neurons. The direction of the looming stimulus is computed by monitoring the shift of the peak of neuronal activity in this population. The signal encoding the stimulus location is gated by the direction- selective neurons onto a motor heading map, which specifies the escape direction. The selection of a proper action is achieved through competition among different groups of motor neurons. The model is based on the analysis of predator-avoidance in frog and toad but leads to a comparative analysis of mammalian visual systems.",

The policy by which they do this is called a monitoring strategy. Our work has focused on classifying different types of monitoring strategies and understanding how strategies depend on features of the task and environment. We have discovered only a few general monitoring strategies, in particular periodic and interval reduction, and speculate that there are no more. The relative advantages and generality of each strategy will be discussed in detail. The wide applicability of interval reduction will be demonstrated both empirically and analytically. We conclude with a number of general laws that state when a strategy is most appropriate.",

Yet, the mechanism underlying development is unknown. We propose a robot that learns to track a target object mentally (i.e., maintaining a representation of an object's position when outside the field of view) as a model for spatial development. Mental tracking is considered as prediction of an object's position, given the previous environmental state and motor commands and the current environment state resulting from movement. Following Jordan and Rumelhart's (1992) forward modeling architecture, the system consists of two components: an inverse model of sensory input to desired motor commands and a forward model of motor commands to desired sensory input (goals). The robot was tested on the \"three cups\"paradigm (in which children are required, under various movement conditions, to select the cup containing the hidden object). Consistent with child development, in the absence of the capacity for self-locomotion, the robot makes errors that are self-center-based. When given the ability for self-locomotion, the robot responds allocentrically.",

The ant behavioral rule set is still under investigation and a better understanding of the structure it creates has proved a very useful tool to examine aspects of the algorithm. We draw the conclusions that firstly, the size of the area available for sorting affects the robot algorithm and ant algorithm in opposite ways, secondly, the metrics have proved very useful in aiding discrimination between the robot and ant structures and thirdly, application of the metrics to the ant structure has offered biologists new ideas and a better understanding of the structure and how it is built.",

We quantify the learning capabilities of three inbred strains and show that population distributions of hand preference emerge from the properties of individual mice. The model informs our understanding of gene—environment interactions because it accommodates genotypic differences in learning and memory abilities, and environmental biases. We tuned each strain’s model to match their experimental hand-preference distributions in unbiased worlds and, by comparing simulations and experiments, identified and quantified a constitutive left-bias in hand preference of one strain. The models, tuned for unbiased worlds, match experimental measures in left- and right-biased worlds and in biased worlds after previous training. New measures quantitatively assess this matching, revealing that two strains, previously considered non-learners of hand preference, actually have significant learning ability and we confirm this with new experiments. Model mice match the kinetics of hand-preference learning of one strain and predict the limits of learning. We conclude that genetically evolved hand-preference behavior in mice is inherently probabilistic to provide robustness and allow constant adaptability to ever-changing environments.",

Simulation studies of the prisoner's dilemma, where players make probabilistic choices based on previous actions, find that strategies such as win-stay-lose-shift, tit-for-tat, and firm-but-fair come to dominate the long-term behavior of the population. Often, these models assume that decisions are made in synchrony. In many biological contexts, this is an unrealistic assumption, as individuals change their behavior on different and uncorrelated timescales. Here we develop a model where both, one, or neither of the players can update their behavior at any time. This study demonstrates that as the assumption of synchrony is relaxed, less reactive and more generous strategies such as firm-but-fair dominate the long-term population dynamics.",

Adaptive foraging principles found in insects have attracted the research community to develop new approaches that benefit from the simplicity and collaborative behaviours of these natural multi-agent systems. This paper discusses both traditional and swarm-intelligence-based routing and investigates the extent to which a new bee-inspired approach, termed BeeIP, results in adaptive, robust and optimized routing in networks of high mobility. BeeIP is directly and quantitatively compared with the state-of-the-art protocols using a variety of performance metrics. The results show that it outperforms the others by keeping low and balanced end-to-end packet delay under stressful network conditions, such as high traffic and mobility rates. In addition, BeeIP is indirectly and qualitatively compared with the first bee-inspired routing protocol, BeeAdHoc. The resulting discussion indicates that the proposed design can offer better packet delivery ratio and use smaller control packets, thus less overhead, by utilizing an enhanced adaptive path monitoring mechanism inspired by honeybee foraging.",

In particular, neurocontrollers incorporating hebbian synapses have been shown to be useful for implementing conflicting sub-behaviors. Numerous interesting complex tasks assume such flexibility. However, those evolved controllers often exhibit behavioral instability, as simulation time is extended beyond the short limit used during evolution. In this paper, we propose constrained plastic models inspired by neural homeostasis phenomena, in order to evolve flexible and stable pattern generators for single-legged locomotion. Comparative results show that constrained controllers perform better than unconstrained ones in both terms of evolvability and behavioral stability. Functional analyses of the best evolved controller unveil the adaptivity, robustness and homeostasis arising from the statically constrained plasticity. Interestingly, homeostasis evolved implicitly without relying on any active homeostatic mechanisms and is implemented through hebbian plasticity, usually considered destabilizing.",

    "abstract": "The kinematics of human walking are largely driven by passive dynamics, but adaptation to varying terrain conditions and responses to perturbations require some form of active control. The basis for this control is often thought to take the form of entrainment between a neural oscillator (i.e., a central pattern generator and/or distributed counterparts) and the mechanical system. Here we use techniques in evolutionary robotics to explore the potential of a purely reactive, linear controller to control bipedal locomotion over rough terrain. In these simulation studies, joint torques are computed as weighted linear sums of sensor states, and the weights are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm. We show that linear reactive control can enable a seven-link 2D biped and a nine-link 3D biped to walk over rough terrain (steps of ∼5% leg length or more in the 2D case). In other words, the simulated walker gradually learns the appropriate weights to achieve stable locomotion. The results indicate that oscillatory neural structures are not necessarily a requirement for robust bipedal walking. The study of purely reactive control through linear feedback may help to reveal some basic control principles of stable walking.",

Typical emotional phenomena such as arousal and action readiness can be interpreted as morphofunctional processes, and their functionality may be replicated in robotic systems with morphologies that can be modulated for real-time adaptation. We investigate the control requirements for such systems, and present a possible bio-inspired architecture, based on the division of control between neural and endocrine systems in humans and animals. We suggest that emotional episodes can be understood as emergent from the coordination of action control and action-readiness, respectively.

Traditional accounts of our social understanding skills, focusing on the role of intentionality as the “aboutness” associated with the use of symbolic language, make this sort of explanation difficult to articulate. A satisfactory explanation should start with the recognition that intentionality is not a monolithic phenomenon and that more basic kinds of intentionality embodied in material culture have played a crucial role in allowing for the complexity of human social cognition. We argue for the importance of kinds of bottom-up intentionality, which arise from the world as it is experienced, dynamically structuring and directing our cognitive capacities toward possibilities of (joint) action. Musicality (our capacity for being musical) is a particularly rich kind of cultural expression, in which intentionality embodied in material culture can be studied and its significance for the structure of our deeply social cognition can be explored.",

This article proposes and defends the thesis that the notion of sensorimotor dependencies is insufficient to account for the reality of human perception and that the central enactive notion should be that of perceptual practices. Sensorimotor enactivism is insufficient because it has no traction on socially dependent perceptions (SDPs), which are essential to the role and significance of perception in our lives. Since the social dimension is a central desideratum in a theory of human perception, enactivism needs a notion that accounts for such an aspect. This article sketches the main features of the Wittgenstein-inspired notion of perceptual practices as the central notion to understand perception. Perception, I claim, is properly understood as woven into a type of social practices that includes food, dance, dress, and music. More specifically, perceptual practices are the enactment of culturally structured, normatively rich techniques of commerce of meaningful multi- and intermodal perceptible material. I argue that perceptual practices explain three central features of SDP: attentional focus, aspects’ salience, and modal-specific harmony-like relations.",

Despite the relatively small amount of input data, the trend reconstruction fits to established archaeological observations for prehistoric Europe. The comparison of cultural and spatial distance leads to the remarkable result of no significant permanent correlation, which indicates that the spread of the relevant aspects of burial traditions cannot be explained with simple diffusion models.

In this article, agent-based modelling has been applied to study the chances of dairy farmers increasing annual milk yield by learning better farming strategies from each other. Two sets of strategies were considered; in one set ( S), each farmer agent would possess a number of farming strategies based on their knowledge, and in a second set [Formula: see text], farmer agents would possess farming strategies that they have adopted from their peers. Regression models were used to determine litres of milk that could be produced whenever new strategies were applied. By using data from Ethiopia and Tanzania, 28 and 25 determinants for increase in milk yield were fitted for the two countries, respectively. There was a significant increase in average milk yield as the farmer agents interacted and updated their [Formula: see text]– from baseline data, average milk yield of 12.7 ± 4.89 and 13.62 ± 4.47 to simulated milk yield average of 17.57 ± 0.72 and 20.34 ± 1.16 for Tanzania and Ethiopia, respectively. The peer-to-peer learning approach details an inexpensive method manageable by the farmers themselves. Its implementation could range from physical farmer groups to online interactions.",

    "abstract": "The increase of violence in Mexico and consequent suffering during the last decades is evident, but its effects over feelings and moral judgments remain uncertain. We used journalistic news showing real-life situations to investigate the effects of facing violence over the experience of four moral emotions which represent powerful impulses for social actions in situations of suffering linked to violence: Negative Compassion, Positive Compassion, Schadenfreude, and Indignation. We evaluate brain activation by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during three cognitive conditions: reading, introspection, and resting. When reading the news, only Indignation-evoking stimuli elicited salient brain activations in the posterior cerebellum, and temporal and parietal cortical regions, whose functions are related to anger experiences and processing of socially relevant circumstances. When introspecting the emotional experience, cerebellar, frontal, parietal, and occipital activations related to self-focused experiences were observed for all emotions. When resting after facing the stimuli, only the Negative Compassion emotion elicited brain activations in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus related to emotional self-reference processing; thus, negative compassion may produce more perdurable cognitive-affective effects related to sadness while perceiving suffering in others. Our results may suggest different emotional-based social decisions to face suffering and violence and to motivate pro-social actions in the collectivistic Mexican culture.",

This seems to raise what can be called a cognitive gap question, namely, how do non-contentful behaviours give rise to contentful behaviours?

    "abstract": "Matching behavior is a phenomenon describing response rate ratios of an organism as a function of their associated reinforcer rate ratios. The generalized matching law (GML), its quantitative formulation, has been frequently found to explain over 80% of the variance in concurrent reinforcement schedules. However, a previous paper found by means of Monte Carlo simulations that matching behavior could be due to environmental constraints on behavior rather than a mere decision-making process. The purpose of the current study is to systemically investigate the influence of constraints induced by concurrent schedules of reinforcement. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out. Results showed that the GML reached much better explained variances with real (and artificial) organisms than the current simulated results. Thus, a learning process seems partly necessary to generate matching behavior. According to the current findings, concurrent reinforcement schedules clearly induced a quantitative dependency between behavior rates and reinforcer rates. The simulation demonstrates that matching behavior is not only a consequence of a behavioral (decision-making) process, but of environmental conditions also.",

Our approach uses neuro-dynamics as a theoretical language to model cognition, emotional states, decision making and action. The control architecture is formalized by a coupled system of dynamic neural fields representing a distributed network of local but connected neural populations. Different pools of neurons encode relevant information in the form of self-sustained activation patterns, which are triggered by input from connected populations and evolve continuously in time. The architecture implements a dynamic and flexible context-dependent mapping from observed hand and facial actions of the human onto adequate complementary behaviors of the robot that take into account the inferred goal and inferred emotional state of the co-actor. The dynamic control architecture was validated in multiple scenarios in which an anthropomorphic robot and a human operator assemble a toy object from its components. The scenarios focus on the robot’s capacity to understand the human’s actions, and emotional states, detect errors and adapt its behavior accordingly by adjusting its decisions and movements during the execution of the task.",

Such an ability depends critically on seven types of competencies. First, intrinsic morality should be grounded in the internal values of the robot arising from its physiology and embodiment. Second, the moral principles of robots should develop through their interactions with the environment and with other agents. Third, we claim that the dynamics of moral (or social) emotions closely follows that of other non-social emotions used in valuation and decision making. Fourth, we explain how moral emotions can be learned from the observation of others. Fifth, we argue that to assess social interaction, a robot should be able to learn about and understand responsibility and causation. Sixth, we explain how mechanisms that can learn the consequences of actions are necessary for a robot to make moral decisions. Seventh, we describe how the moral evaluation mechanisms outlined can be extended to situations where a robot should understand the goals of others. Finally, we argue that these competencies lay the foundation for robots that can feel guilt, shame and pride, that have compassion and that know how to assign responsibility and blame.",

This special issue seeks to address the significance of grounding of emotions in robots in relation to aspects of physical and homeostatic interaction in the world at an individual and social level. Specific questions concern: How can emotion and social interaction be grounded in the behavioral activity of the robotic system? Is a robot able to have intrinsic emotions? How can emotions, grounded in the embodiment of the robot, facilitate individually and socially adaptive behavior to the robot?

Our idea is to imbue the robot with intrinsic motivation (IM) so that it can handle new situations and appears as a genuine social other to humans and thus be of more interest to a human interaction partner. Human-robot interaction (HRI) experiments mainly focus on scripted or teleoperated robots, that mimic characteristics such as IM to control isolated behavior factors. This article presents a “robotologist” study design that allows comparing autonomously generated behaviors with each other and, for the first time, evaluates the human perception of IM-based generated behavior in robots. We conducted a within-subjects user study ( N = 24) where participants interacted with a fully autonomous Sphero BB8 robot with different behavioral regimes: one realizing an adaptive, intrinsically motivated behavior and the other being reactive, but not adaptive. The robot and its behaviors are intentionally kept minimal to concentrate on the effect induced by IM. A quantitative analysis of post-interaction questionnaires showed a significantly higher perception of the dimension “Warmth” compared to the reactive baseline behavior. Warmth is considered a primary dimension for social attitude formation in human social cognition. A human perceived as warm (friendly, trustworthy) experiences more positive social interactions.",

Such interactions are social in the sense that they depend on socially-agreed market regulations and communication protocols, and are collective in the sense that global market dynamics depend on the interactions of groups of traders. Moreover, the tools and techniques of adaptive behavior research could be profitably employed to build predictive models of existing or planned market systems. Despite these poten tial applications, we note that there is a near-total absence of papers in the adaptive behavior lit erature that deal with autonomous agents capable of exhibiting trading behaviors. We summarize work in experimental economics where human trading behavior is studied under laboratory con ditions. We propose that such experiments could and should be used as 'benchmarks' for evaluat ing and comparing different architectures and strategies for trading animats. We present results from experiments where an elementary machine learning technique endows simple autonomous- software agents with the capability to adapt while interacting via price-bargaining in market envi ronments. The environments are based on artificial retail markets used in experimental econom ics research. We demonstrate that groups of simple agents can exhibit human-like collective mar ket behaviors.

    "abstract": "The influence of nest site selection on population dynamics is explored by considering two reproductive strategies. The first one, described as opportunist, is the most common in ecology. It postulates that an individual tries to select and track the optimal environmental conditions that maximize its total reproductive output. The second one, described as obstinate, comes from a generalization of \"natal homing\" recently proposed by Cury (1994). It assumes that a newborn individual memorizes early environmental cues that later determine its reproductive environment. We use an individual-based model named SEALAB to track artificial fish in a heterogeneous environment displayed as a lattice of hexagonal patches. The effects of two components of the lattice structure—namely the composition (amount of each patch type) and the configuration (spatial arrangement of patches)—on the success of the searching behavior are examined. For the obstinate strategy, whose searching behavior is characterized by a simple random walk, a spatial redundancy index seems sufficient to account for the spatial heterogeneity influence, whereas for the opportunist strategy, more subtle indices are needed. We develop a quantitative measure of spatial local optima that could apply to any searching behavior based on local hill-climbing or local gradient information. Our results indicate how heterogeneity causes opportunist individuals to get stuck in local spatial optima. The use of a spatially explicit individual-based model such as SEALAB is justified by the possibility of carefully estimating simultaneously the value and the sensitivity of global parameters in relation to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment.",

In these dynamics, we pay particular attention to how many robots, called instigators, are required to make all robots eventually change their strategy type. In addition, to make it easy for all robots to change their strategy type, we provide a mechanism by which the robots themselves reduce the utility of strategies.",

Recently Zeil, Hoffmann and Chahl (2003) showed that a simple calculation— the root mean square (RMS) difference between the current image and the home image—produces a monotonic function leading to the home position for natural images. In this article we propose a gradi ent descent algorithm based on Caenorhabditis elegans chemotaxis (Ferree &amp; Lockery, 1999) for hom ing with the RMS signal. The parameters for this algorithm are evolved for a simulated agent, and the resulting homing behavior compared with alternative algorithms in simulation and using a real robot. A simulated agent using this algorithm in an environment constructed from real world images homes effi ciently and shows generalization to variations in lighting and changes in the scene. In the real robot this algorithm is affected by noise resulting from imperfect sensors, and alternative algorithms appear more robust. However, the best performing algorithm for unchanging environments, image warping (Franz, Schölkopf, Mallot, &amp; Bülthoff, 1998), is completely disabled by scene changes that do not affect algo rithms utilizing the RMS difference.",

    "abstract": "Human locomotion is extremely adaptive and robust to changes in environment, body size, and morphology. The control of this highly adaptive system is thought to be performed by central pattern generators, supported by a system of sensorimotor connections called reflexes. Several studies on central pattern generators have been conducted, alone and in concert with reflexes. However, controllers based on direct sensorimotor reflexes have not been given much attention, as they have probably been considered too simple for the task of controlling a biped. In this paper, however, we present results to the contrary. It is shown that a purely sensorimotor neural network, that is one with direct connections between sensors and motors can produce gait in an eight degree-of-freedom simulated lower body biped. Further analysis indicates that proprioceptive information is useful but not essential for the control of walking, while cutaneous information is essential. The final experiments show that sensorimotor control of biped walking can be accomplished using a network with only two cutaneous inputs and four neurons. The results suggest that reflexes may play a large role in rhythm generation, in addition to central pattern generators. The results also demonstrate the importance of sensorimotor reflexes in adaptive behavior.",

Formulations of temporal difference (TD) learning have gained a great deal of attention due to the similarity of the TD prediction error and the observed activity of dopamine neurons in the primate midbrain. Recent work has attempted to integrate additional neuromodulatory systems such as noradrenaline and acetylcholine in a TD framework. Additional work has been done to remedy representational issues arising from TD variants that result in incorrect predictions of dopamine activity, as well as to incorporate the TD error signal in models of categorization. In this paper, an actor—critic model incorporating aspects of TD learning and psychological models of attention is described. The development of the model and the behavior of an autonomous agent in a simulated environment are examined and compared with a variant of TD learning lacking an attentional component. The agent learns to behave adaptively due to the shifting of attention to relevant aspects of a high-dimensional input. In contrast, the TD model exhibits perseverative behavior and comparatively slow learning in the same context. It is suggested that real-time models of attention may provide insight into neuromodulatory systems implicated in attention and representational learning.",

    "abstract": "Grey Walter’s pioneering use of his very early mobile robots, or “tortoises,” to investigate mechanisms underlying the generation of behavior (Walter, 1950, 1951), is rightly lauded as one of the key starting points for the kind of research championed by this journal. His tortoises had all the hallmarks of what later became known as animats. Walter’s work has had a huge influence over the decades, both directly and indirectly. Although they were explicitly intended to shed light on animal behavior, his models did not have tightly specified animal targets: they were madeup artificial creatures. They do not meet the harsh criteria for biologically relevant animat models suggested by Barbara Webb in her well argued and provocative article. Webb suggests that “animat simulations, if they are to be relevant to biology, should be considered as models” (sec. 5) and that for such models to be useful they must be grounded in real target animal systems; to not do so, she claims, undermines any justification for their relevance. While science must ultimately be empirically grounded, and the majority of modeling should probably be of the classical kind supported by Webb, I suggest that other kinds of more speculative, less grounded models also have an important role to play. In the first of his famous Scientific American articles, Walter (1950) described how his simple threewheeled robots, sporting a protective “shell” and equipped with a scanning light sensor, a touch sensor, a propulsion motor, a steering motor, and an electronic valve based analog “nervous system,” were used to “discover what degree of complexity of behaviour and independence could be achieved with the smallest number of elements connected in a system providing the greatest number of interconnections” (p. 44). The tortoises had two artificial neurons connected in such a way as to be capable of sustaining a range of interaction patterns. Contrary to the then prevailing view that large numbers of neurons were necessary to generate behavioral complexity of any degree, Walter was able to demonstrate surprisingly intricate phototaxis-based behaviors in a pair of interacting robots controlled by the minimal nervous system. The second article (Walter, 1951) outlines experiments with a later generation of robots that were now equipped with extended, although still relatively simple, artificial nervous systems capable of exhibiting learning behavior: a conditioned reflex. Walter demonstrated, for the first time, a neural-like mechanism that generated interesting conditioned reflex behavior in an embodied autonomous sensorimotor system. Although the work was rooted in a close study of Pavlov’s original conditioned reflex studies (Pavlov, 1927), Walter’s model did not have a specific animal target; it was of a more general, exploratory nature. As he put it, “These models are of course so simple that any more detailed comparison between them and living creatures would be purely conjectural” (Walter, 1951, p. 63).",

Construction in this environment involves the agents picking up colored discs and dropping them at incomplete parts of the structure being built. The ConAg architecture provides both reactive behaviors which are used to maintain the viability of the agent and navigational planning behaviors that are used for construction. The action selection mechanism enables learning the sequence of behaviors required for construction by reinforcement learning. The navigational planning behaviors use a grid-based representation of the world. The shape of the structure to be built is also encoded on an internal spatial map. Path planning is implemented by spreading activations on sets of grid-based maps so that the agents perform the construction task efficiently. Construction of arbitrary structures is supported by temporal sequencing of goals. We present simulation results that demonstrate the performance of the architecture and algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn during continuous and on-line observation would be advantageous for humanoid robots, as it would enable them to learn during co-location and interaction in the human environment. However, when motions are being learned and clustered on-line, there is a trade-off between classification accuracy and the number of training examples, resulting in potential misclassifications both at the motion and hierarchy formation level. This article presents an approach enabling fast on-line incremental learning, combined with an incremental memory consolidation process correcting initial misclassifications and errors in organization, to improve the stability and accuracy of the learned motions, analogous to the memory consolidation process following motor learning observed in humans. Following initial organization, motions are randomly selected for reclassification, at both low and high levels of the hierarchy. If a better reclassification is found, the knowledge structure is reorganized to comply. The approach is validated during incremental acquisition of a motion database containing a variety of full body motions. 1",

    "abstract": "Weakly electric fish use self-generated electric fields to identify prey, explore their surroundings, and communicate with conspecifics. They have electroreceptors over their entire skin surfaces, and readings from these electroreceptors form electric images. The characteristics of electric images include important information such as the locations, shapes, and electrical properties of target objects. The lateral distance to a target object can be estimated using the rate between maximal slope and maximal amplitude, or relative slope, and provides a direct cue to localize target objects, irrespective of size and electrical properties. Sensor readings acquired from distributions of electroreceptors are interpreted as spatial electric images. Temporal electric images can be assessed using a single electroreceptor by back-and-forth swimming. Some species of weakly electric fish engage in back-and-forth swimming behavior during foraging and can use spatiotemporal information to localize objects. With active body movement and forward swimming, a single electroreceptor can scan the time course of potential perturbation caused by a target object. If there is more than one target object, electric images may be distorted by interactions between individual images. In this paper, we suggest that temporal relative slope is an effective measure for the electrolocation of multiple objects by robotic systems. We investigate the characteristics of temporal relative slopes based on back-and-forth sweeping motions to localize multiple spherical objects via modeling experiments. This method can be applied to biomimetic robotic systems in the underwater environment.",

Model behavior was tested across a wide range of parameters and compared with empirical data. The model produces numbers of lifetime sexual partners, and partners in the last year, rates of concurrency, and relationship durations similar to nationally representative data from the US; it also generates correlations in partners' quality similar to those reported for marriage and dating partners.

In this article, we systematically examined the influence of body-flexibility on the group behavior of infant rats (Rattus norvegicus) by comparing one-, two-, and three-segmented simulated rats with 7- and 10-day-old rats in an arena. Simulated rats provided very different fits to 7-day-old rat pups compared with 10-day-old pups. With respect to 7-day-old pups, three-segmented rats were similar on 83% of our metrics, two-segmented rats were similar on 33% of our metrics, and one-segmented rats were similar on 66% of our metrics. Both one- and three-segmented simulated agents matched 7-day-old rats better than two-segment agents, but it is still premature to conclude which of the three simulated agents best matched the 7-day-old rats. However, no group of simulated rats was similar to 10-day-old pups on any metric. Our results suggest that morphology strongly determines behavior in groups of 7-day-old rats, but that other mechanisms, from more active intersegment control to more influential top-down control, are required to explain the group behavior of 10-day-old rats.",

    "abstract": "O’Regan and Noë’s sensorimotor approach rejects the old-fashioned view that perceptual experience in humans depends solely on the activation of internal representations. Reflecting a wealth of empirical work, for example active vision, the approach suggests that perceiving is, instead, a matter of bodily exploration of the outside environment. To this end, the approach says the perceiver must deploy knowledge of sensorimotor contingencies, the ways sense input changes with movement by the perceiver or object perceived. Clark has observed that the approach faces a challenge accounting for the experience of temporal duration, since event-like properties cannot be characterised by reference to the sensory consequences of possible movements. This paper argues that the account can best be shored up by emphasising, more than Noë does, the dependence of perceptual experience, in general, on temporally extended, organismic interaction with the outside environment. The paper argues, moreover, that an ‘extensionalist’ account of temporal experience could help make sense of object experience, which is itself, plausibly, an experience of temporal duration.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous oscillations have become a widespread hypothetical “mechanism” to explain how brain dynamics give rise to neural functions. By focusing on synchrony one leaves the phase relations during moments of desynchronous oscillations either without a clear functional role or with a secondary role such as a transition between functionally “relevant” synchronized states. In this work, rather than studying synchrony we focus on desynchronous oscillations and investigate their functional roles in the context of a sensorimotor coordination task. In particular, we address the questions: a) how does the informational content of the sensorimotor activity present in a complete dynamical description of phase relations change as such a description is reduced to the dynamics of synchronous oscillations? and b) to what extent are desynchronous oscillations as causally relevant as synchronous ones to the generation of functional sensorimotor coordination? These questions are addressed with a model of a simulated agent performing a functional sensorimotor coordination task controlled by an oscillatory network. The results suggest that: i) desynchronized phase relations carry as much information about sensorimotor activity as synchronized phase relations; and ii) phase relations between oscillators with near-zero frequency difference carry a relatively higher causal relevance than the rest of the phase relations to the sensorimotor coordination; however, overall a privileged functional causal contribution can not be attributed to either synchronous or desynchronous oscillations.",

One is based on the rate of odor patches encountered by the searcher, the other employs the variation of odor concentrations as well as the rate of odor patches experienced by the searcher. The concentration of odor has been simulated by using a stochastic model for the time-evolution of concentrations along the path of a moving observer in an inhomogeneous plume. For each algorithm, we released the searchers at a crosswind location away from the plume centerline; we then calculated the ensemble average position relative to the plume centerline and the distribution of the searchers along the crosswind direction at the source. Compared with strategies using rate of odor patches only, the algorithms that also employ the variation of concentrations are seen to be more effective in locating the source; that is, the average path of all searchers is more biased toward the plume centerline and their crosswind distribution is more skewed toward the source. The findings of this work can be used as guidelines to discriminate successful strategies that can be tested in future experiments.",

    "abstract": "For autonomous agents the problem of deciding what to do next becomes increasingly complex when acting in unpredictable and dynamic environments while pursuing multiple and possibly conflicting goals. One of the most relevant behavior-based models that tries to deal with this problem is the behavior network model proposed by Maes. This model proposes a set of behaviors as purposive perception–action units that are linked in a nonhierarchical network, and whose behavior selection process is orchestrated by spreading activation dynamics. In spite of being an adaptive model (in the sense of self-regulating its own behavior selection process), and despite the fact that several extensions have been proposed in order to improve the original model adaptability, there is not yet a robust model that can self-modify adaptively both the topological structure and the functional purpose of the network as a result of the interaction between the agent and its environment. Thus, this work proposes an innovative hybrid model driven by gene expression programming, which makes two main contributions: (1) given an initial set of meaningless and unconnected units, the evolutionary mechanism is able to build well-defined and robust behavior networks that are adapted and specialized to concrete internal agent’s needs and goals; and (2) the same evolutionary mechanism is able to assemble quite complex structures such as deliberative plans (which operate in the long-term) and problem-solving strategies. As a result, several properties of self-organization and adaptability emerged when the proposed model was tested in a robotic environment using a multi-agent platform.",

In this paper, we introduce the term generative grounding to refer to the establishment of shared meaning for concepts referred to using relational terms. We investigated a spatial domain, which is both experienced and constructed using mobile robots with cognitive maps. The robots, called Lingodroids, established lexicons for locations, distances, and directions through structured conversations called where-are-we, how-far, what-direction, and where-is-there conversations. Distributed concept construction methods were used to create flexible concepts, based on a data structure called a distributed lexicon table. The lexicon was extended from words for locations, termed toponyms, to words for the relational terms of distances and directions. New toponyms were then learned using these relational operators. Effective grounding was tested by using the new toponyms as targets for go-to games, in which the robots independently navigated to named locations. The studies demonstrate how meanings can be extended from grounding in shared physical experiences to grounding in constructed cognitive experiences, giving the robots a language that refers to their direct experiences, and to constructed worlds that are beyond the here-and-now.",

However, the previous studies did not focus on the spatial aspects of these experiences and did not acquire cognitive maps. We modified previous models and trained the proposed model with the visuomotor experiences of an agent in a simulated two-dimensional environment. The proposed model was trained to predict future visual and motion inputs even when only one modality was provided (crossmodal prediction). The proposed model correctly predicted visual images, even when the agent experienced unknown paths. Comparisons of the crossmodal predictions of the models under different conditions revealed that the crossmodal predictions related to motion resulted in self-organization of the cognitive map. Further experiments of mental simulation abilities showed that two-way crossmodal predictions (from vision and motion only) were required for consistent generation of vision and motion. These results indicated that predictive learning involving integrated vision and motion was necessary for self-organization of spatial recognition with a cognitive map.",

Humans influence each other in the usage of words, and hence, the robots they program indirectly affect the development of our society’s vocabulary. Most human–robot interaction studies focus on one robot interacting with one human. Studying the dynamic development of language in a group of humans and robots is difficult and requires considerable resource. We therefore conducted a social simulation of a human–robot communication network based on a real-world human–human network, allowing us to study how the centrality of the robots’ owners influences the propagation of words in the network and what influence the number of robots in the network has on achieving a fixation state. Our results show that robots owned by highly connected people have less effect on the dynamics of language than robots owned by less connected people. Highly connected people interact with many others and therefore are more strongly influenced by a greater number of people and their robots. We have found that 11% of the humans owning a robot is sufficient for the robots to dominate the development of the language resulting in 95% of the humans using or adopting their words.",

    "abstract": "Concerning what signifies the minimal requirements for a process to be designated cognitive, various criteria have been proposed, but the problem has not been settled. The important thing to consider in establishing the criteria is which criterion has stronger explanatory power. Recent developments in immunology demonstrate that the immune system is omnipresent in the realm of living beings, including bacteria and archaea. Although the structural characteristics of immune systems are significantly different among species, the fundamental functional components, namely, recognition, information integration, reaction, and memory, are well conserved. Interestingly, these adaptive features are superimposed on those of the central nervous system. Given that adaptive cognitive ability is a prerequisite for the existence and the survival of living organisms, these results may be compatible with the idea that in bacteria without an apparent nervous system, the immune system performs neural-like functions. The presence of the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein (Cas) systems as a cognitive system in the earliest living organisms suggests that one of the fundamental functions is conserved throughout evolution. Furthermore, this interpretation can evade the critiques against the current biological paradigm that demand that cognitive mechanisms be preceded by organisms in the earlier stages of evolution, thus providing better and stronger explanatory power. I thus propose that genetic and biochemical machinery represented by the bacterial immune system serves as a minimal cognitive system.",

I begin by presenting the foundations of the framework on offer: the concepts, methods, and theories of ecological psychology; embodied cognition; dynamical systems theory; and machine intelligence. Next, I apply the framework to the case of visually-guided action.

The analysis is inspired by complex network theory and explores an important issue in psycholinguistics: how children combine words syntactically. To this end, the article exploits the longitudinal data of multiple individual studies stored and publicly available in the CHILDES database. This analysis proves useful in two regards: in coincidence with previous approaches to syntactic development, it reveals a similar linear–nonlinear pattern of syntactic development (a combination of linear periods interrupted by abrupt transitions) in typical children regardless the language they are acquiring. It also provides a straightforward objective measure of syntactic impairment in atypically developing children. A striking difference between typical and atypical children lies in the connectivity of functional words, which suddenly become hubs but only in typical development. Our technique offers a formal measure of impairment with respect to typical syntactic development, which goes beyond the standard notion of retardation in development, for the Down syndrome condition.",

Especially in otherwise inaccessible environments, decentralized robotic swarms can be advantageous due to their high spatial resolution of measurements and resilience to failure of individuals in the swarm. However, such robotic swarms might need to be able to compensate misplacement during deployment or adapt to dynamical changes in the environment. Reaching a collective decision in a swarm with limited communication abilities without a central entity serving as decision-maker can be a challenging task. Here, we present the CIMAX algorithm for collective decision-making for maximizing the information gathered by the swarm as a whole. Agents negotiate based on their individual sensor readings and ultimately make a decision for collectively moving in a particular direction so that the swarm as a whole increases the amount of relevant measurements and thus accessible information. We use both simulation and real robotic experiments for presenting, testing, and validating our algorithm. CIMAX is designed to be used in underwater swarm robots for troubleshooting an oxygen depletion phenomenon known as “anoxia.”",

Accordingly, this article examines the emergence of the ability to leverage material forms for cognitive purposes, using the tool-using behaviors and lithic technologies of ancestral species and contemporary non-human primates as proxies for matters like collective use, generational sustainment, and the non-teleological emergence of design features.",

The participants were 90 able-bodied individuals including children ( n = 39; age: 5.89 ± 0.94 years), young adults ( n = 30; age: 23.23 ± 1.61 years) and older adults ( n = 21; age: 64.59 ± 5.24 years) who took part in different balance tasks that had different levels of cognitive and physical challenges. The main dependent variables were postural sway area, postural variability and postural complexity. The participants stood on a standard force plate for 10 s in each task condition, and the centre of pressure displacement was collected at 100-Hz sampling frequency. The results of this study showed that children and older adults, in the more difficult tasks, had greater sway area and complexity and less postural variability. In addition, there was a linear trend in the stability measures as the difficulty of the task was increased. In conclusion, special populations, such as children and older adults, were more sensitive to the balance changes and used active control mechanisms to minimise the risk of losing balance in more challenging conditions.",

First, the article reviews the history of the cerebellum, its evolution and phylogenetics, and its concerted evolution with various brain regions. It also notes the critical role of the cerebellum and the cerebro-cerebellar network in its traditionally recognized control of gross and fine motor movements and in its exaptation for basic and higher level cognitive processes, particularly in regard to increasingly more sophisticated stone knapping. Also, reviewed are various theories, advanced over the past three decades, of how the cerebellum tweaks and refines thoughts, images, and ideas just as it refines and smooths motor movements. Baddeley’s working memory model is also prominently featured, as are the works of Ito, Vandervert, and others on the cerebellum’s role in novel problem-solving, insight, and creativity. Finally, this article reviews two “Cognitive Rubicons” in stone tool knapping, Theory of Mind and stone knapping, and Malafouris’ Material Engagement Theory. The article concludes with a novel hypothesis that the automaticity provided by the cerebellum derived from extensive practice in stone knapping may have freed Baddeley’s central executive from its attentional demands and allows the mind to “wander and wonder.”",

We argue that whenever Turing instabilities of neural activity play a role in generating visual hallucinations, they do more than shape the geometric patterns. Their relatively autonomous self-organization is a source of intrinsic value related to their self-maintenance as a pattern of activity, and they would also thereby decouple “higher-level” stages of neural processing from external stimulation, thus facilitating a more abstract mode of cognition. These additional features of our proposal support Hodgson and Lewis-Williams in their respective theories about the very first origins of human artistic activity. We also evaluate the critical literature regarding the possibility of ritualized enaction of altered states of consciousness (ASC) in early prehistory. We conclude that ASC were indeed possible, and suggest that they were likely involved in facilitating the social development of more symbolic forms of life and mind.",

We then develop a state-dependent life history model on the assumption that social play is adaptive and thus focus on play’s contribution toward the development of skill and how such development affects an individual’s future lifetime expected reproductive success (i.e. fitness that accounts for both survival and reproduction). Although our model is not intended to capture a specific situation, a number of commonly observed phenomena emerge from the model, including that most social play is dyadic and that animals select partners that are of similar age or skill. We discuss ways of increasing the fidelity of the model by allowing injury due to play, the role of energetic reserves, handicapping, and polyadic play.",

In these situations, collective human behavior such as crowd stampedes may be triggered. Sometimes stampedes lead to fatalities, as people are crushed or trampled. In this paper, a dynamic model for the evacuation of pedestrians during emergency situations is proposed with the consideration of information transmission in the crowd. In this model, based on a complex adaptive system, it is assumed that the information, part of which is psychology and behavior, has an influence on the interactions of pedestrians. We investigated two factors: (1) the systematic condition of information transmission and (2) the intensity of beneficial information that affects the interaction. Parameters of the factors are discussed to capture the dynamic features of the pedestrian crowd through proved theorems, and the critical values for effective evacuation are obtained. Finally, a numerical example for the evacuation of pedestrians is designed to validate the practicality of this model and mathematical demonstration.",

Synthetic agents are generated based on a variety of combinations of some key parameters, such as exploitation-vs-exploration trade-off, learning back-up and discount rates, and speed of learning, and interact over a very large number of games on a grid infrastructure; experimental data is then analysed to generate clusters of agents that demonstrate interesting associations between eventual performance ranking and learning parameters’ set-up. The evolution of these clusters indicates that agents with a predisposition to knowledge exploration and slower learning tend to perform better than exploiters, which tend to prefer fast learning. Observing these clusters vis-à-vis the playing behaviours of the agents makes it also possible to investigate how to select opponents best from a group; initial results suggest that good progress and stable evolution arise when an agent faces opponents of increasing capacity, and that an agent with a good learning mechanism set-up progresses better when it faces less favourably set-up agents.",

Through social learning the experience of an agent is governed by the actions of an expert, and the structures that develop within the agent's “brain” are influenced by its social situatedness. We are inspired from biological findings in primates of the existence of mirror neurons, which are believed to be involved in imitation. The visual and motor properties of these neurons suggest a tight perception–action coupling, where affordances could be expressed. Our system is designed to model the functional properties of the mirror neurons and therefore express the functionality of objects. The system builds up perceptual and motoric structures from experience using temporal attention and forms perceptual-motor connections. The experience arises through imitation, where an agent can perceive objects and the interactions upon them. We have successfully applied our system on three different platforms, two in simulation and the third on a real robot learning from a human. The system is able to segment the perceptual–motor experience into distinct structures that can be used to recognize and reproduce the task in each experiment. Some unexpected results showed us that the motoric complexity in these experiments was not high enough to expose the full potential of our system, and we suggest future work that will address these results.",

    "abstract": "In many multiagent systems, small changes in individual-level rules may lead to very large changes at the group-level. This phenomenon is striking in the “aggressor-defender game,” a simple participative game in which each participant randomly selects two others from the group (A and B). In the aggressor game, everyone tries to position themselves so that A is always between themselves and B. In the defender game everyone tries to position themselves between A and B. Despite these exceedingly simple rules and the seemingly small difference between them, the two games exhibit very different dynamics. The aggressor game produces a highly dynamic group that rapidly expands over time whereas the defender game quickly collapses to a tight knot. I analyze these games and provide some insight as to how these two group level behaviors arise, thereby linking the micro- and macro-levels. I also introduce and analyze a new, related and simpler game, the stalker game, in which each participant selects and pursues a single participant, and which also produces a collapsing group. It is suggested that such a geometrical analysis may be applicable for other multiagent systems such as insect societies and collective robotics.",

One system, an interactive musical instrument, is a typical artificial intelligence (AI) implementation, based on the technique of constraint programming. The other, a dancing robot, is a typical artificial life (AL) endeavor, specified as a non-linear dynamical system. Although very different in their design, we found that both systems have the same goal of compromising autonomy and reactivity in their user interaction. They elicit interaction and—we argue here—an elusive feeling of agency , because they are neither too predictable nor too random. Creating and controlling such a compromise in a programmatic way is not a trivial problem: we find that both approaches (AI and AL) raise similar pragmatic problems that are in fact rooted in human perception science. Psychological experimentation is needed to clarify the relation between the internal dynamics of the artificial systems and the ongoing feeling of agency (or absence thereof) imparted in their human user. As a first step toward such experimentation, we derive a minimal mathematical model which subsumes both implementations and abstracts them from their respective contexts of music and dance. This model is similar to a Van der Pol oscillator, forced by an input signal coupled to its output in a non-programmatic way. It isolates two critical variables controlling the illusion of agency: the model’s sampling rate and the polynomial order of its reactive term.",

A novel hierarchical adaptive controller that contains two-level units was developed and trained in a physical mobile robot “e -Puck.” In the low-level unit, the robot holds a number of biologically inspired Aplysia -like spiking neural networks that have the property of spike time-dependent plasticity. Each of these networks is trained to become an expert in a particular local environment(s). All the trained networks are stored in a tree-type memory structure that is located in the high-level unit. These stored networks are used as experiences for the robot to enhance its navigation ability in both new and previously trained environments. The robot's memory is designed to hold memories of various lengths and has a simple searching mechanism. Forgetting and dynamic clustering techniques are used to control the memory size. Experimental results show that the proposed model can produce a robot with learning and memorizing capabilities that enable it to survive in complex and highly dynamic environments.",

By training on different color—odor combinations and testing on others, it becomes possible to investigate the exact relation between the two modalities during learning. Three computational models were tested in the same experimental situations as the real moths and their predictions were compared with the experimental data. The average error over all experiments as well as the largest deviation from the experimental data were calculated. Neither the Rescorla—Wagner model nor a learning model with independent learning for each stimulus component were able to explain the experimental data.

A simple yet powerful simulation environment is developed where adaptive agents act and adapt to varying levels of information quality that they sense about their environment. The simulation environment consists of two types of agents moving in a bounded two-dimensional continuous plane: a neuro-evolutionary learning agent that adapts its manoeuvreing strategies to escape a pre-programmed deceptive agent; and a pre-programmed agent, whose goal is to capture the adaptive agent, that acts on noisy information about the adaptive agent’s manoeuvres that it senses from the environment. The pre-programmed agent is also able to produce deceptive actions to confuse the adaptive agent. The behaviour is represented in terms of the manoeuvreing strategies that the agents adopt as their actions to the environmental changes. A behaviour analysis methodology is developed to compare agent actions under different information conditions, that elicits interesting relationships between behaviour and the studied information conditions. The framework is easily extendable to analyse human behaviour in similar environments by replacing the adaptive agent with an interactive human–machine interface.",

In contrast to previous models, the reversal is modeled by the inhibition of the previously learned behavior. This allows for the reinstatement of behavior to recur quickly, as observed in animal behavior. In this model learning is achieved by implementing isotropic sequence order learning and a third factor (ISO-3) that triggers learning at relevant moments. This third factor is modeled by phasic and tonic dopaminergic activity which respectively enable long-term potentiation to occur during acquisition, and long-term depression (LTD) to occur when adjustments in learned behaviors are required. It will be shown how the nucleus accumbens core uses conditioned reinforcers to invigorate instrumental responding while relatively strong LTD in the shell influences the core through a shell-ventral pallido-mediodorsal pathway.

This algorithm is a distributed clustering approach to fine-tune the optimal distances between agents of the system to strengthen the data passing among them using a set of spatial constraints. In fact, this method will increase interconnectivity among agents and clusters, leading to improvement of the overall communicative functionality of the multi-robot system. This strategy will lead to the establishment of loosely-coupled connections among the clusters. These implicit interconnections will mobilize the clusters to receive and transmit information within the multi-agent system. In other words, this algorithm classifies each agent into the clusters with the lowest cost of local communication with its peers. This research demonstrates that the presented decentralized method will actually boost the communicative agility of the swarm by probabilistic proof of the acquired optimality. Hence, the common assumption regarding the full-knowledge of the agents’ primary locations has been fully relaxed compared to former methods. Consequently, the algorithm’s reliability and efficiency is confirmed. Furthermore, the method’s efficacy in passing information will improve the functionality of higher-level swarm operations, such as task assignment and swarm flocking. Analytical investigations and simulated accomplishments, corresponding to highly-populated swarms, prove the claimed efficiency and coherence.",

We claim that the adaptation introduced by a transmission control protocol congestion control mechanism is interpretable as the self-organization of complex itinerant behavior among many quasi-attracting states. To discuss this argument quantitatively, we study the adaptation of the Internet by simulating a PSN using ns-2. Our hypothesis is that the robustness and fragility of the Internet can be attributed to the inherent dynamics of the PSN feedback mechanism called the congestion window size, or cwnd. By varying the data input into the PSN system, we demonstrate the possible self-organization of attractors in cwnd temporal dynamics and discuss the adaptability and robustness of PSNs. The present study provides an example of Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety in action.",

    "abstract": "The target article promotes an enactive approach to human behaviour, highlighting the phenomenology of agent-environment coupling, and is rooted in the course of experience from pre-reflective self-consciousness. In our comment we debate the idea that experience does equate with subjectivity. Such an equation reflects an organismic asymmetry locating behavioural organisation in the subjective mind, interacting with the objective world. In contrast, an ecological realist perspective considers that human behaviour and experience should be captured at the ecological level of analysis, requiring investigation of eco-physical variables. To achieve this aim, researchers need to avoid organismic asymmetries, and instead study performance variables that underpin the symmetry of the agent-environment system. We also debate the place of language and the fact that verbalisation does not equate with subjective experience. According to James Gibson, language focuses on ‘knowledge about the environment’ and not ‘knowledge of the environment’ needed by any autonomous, self-regulating organism, making their way in the world. Last, the target paper promotes the course of in-formation to complement the course of experience, without fully explaining how to deal with potential incongruence and divergence between findings emerging from verbalisation and behavioural aspects of realizing a given activity (the difference between ‘what we say, what we do’). We conclude by considering how our ecological perspective could offer pathways for the presented enactive approach to go beyond the course of in-formation.",

    "abstract": "Diversity of expertise is inherent to cultural evolution. When it is transparent, diversity of human knowledge is useful; when social conformity overcomes that transparency, “expertise” can lead to divisiveness. This is especially true today, where social media has increasingly allowed misinformation to spread by prioritizing what is recent and popular, regardless of validity or general benefit. Whereas in traditional societies there was diversity of expertise, contemporary social media facilitates homophily, which isolates true subject experts from each other and from the wider population. Diversity of knowledge thus becomes social division. Here, we discuss the potential of a cultural-evolutionary framework designed for the countless choices in contemporary media. Cultural-evolutionary theory identifies key factors that determine whether communication networks unify or fragment knowledge. Our approach highlights two parameters: transparency of information and social conformity. By identifying online spaces exhibiting aggregate patterns of high popularity bias and low transparency of information, we can help define the “safe limits” of social conformity and information overload in digital communications.",

I extend a previous model by Tomlinson and O'Donald (1996) to investigate how dominance, sex-linkage, and sex-limitation affect the evolution of a costly new female preference. I find that recessivity of the new female preference can allow it to spread as a pleiotropic byproduct of adaptive evolution even when the novel preference is initially extremely detrimental. Further, three predictions of this model are satisfied by empirical data on the genetics of female mating preferences in Drosophila. Taken together, these findings suggest that incidental association of novel female preferences with alleles under selection could be a potent force in the origin and evolution of novel female mating preferences.",

    "abstract": "The learning architecture described in this article autonomously acquires a topographical (metric) map that encodes a measure of \"value\" for xy-Cartesian locations in an environment. There are two reasons for the creation of low value areas. Direct negative reinforcement from the environment will result from the robot discovering obstacles or having other \"unpleasant\" experiences.- The other source of negative reinforcement is internally generated by the learning algorithm, as it identifies regions that are a long distance away from the \"pleasant\" places in the environment. Conversely example \"pleasant\" places, where positive environmental reward is received, might be energy-charging sites or simply locations that the robot should visit in executing its daily tasks. In general what the robot learns is a map of \"motivational\" tendencies, or \"expectancies\". In such a map, the value attached to a place comes to reflect a balance between the good and bad rewards attainable from that position. When the Temporal Difference learning part of the architecture is turned on, that measure of value comes to include an estimate of how far, in travel time, it is to positive reinforcement. The architecture is loosely based on an Adaptive Heuristic Critic structure. Exploration of a continuous-valued search space is conducted by an Evolution Strategy, tuned for fast and approximate optimization. Knowledge acquired autonomously from this exploration is stored in a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Inherent features of this neural network type lead to the creation of a \"potential field\" structure that exerts appetitive and aversive \"forces\"on the robot as it moves around in the environment. The results of simulation experiments are presented, with a view to illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of the architecture. The map building architecture proposed here is intended to form part of an overall navigational system. In future work it will be integrated with a self-localization algorithm, landmark-based topological mapping, and a reactive system for dealing with local dynamics in the environment.",

In cognitive science, conventional approaches for designing meta-rules follow human hardwired architectures. In contrast to previous approaches, this study employs evolutionary processes to explore neuronal mechanisms accounting for meta-level rule switching. In particular, we performed a series of experiments with a simulated robot that has to learn to switch between different behavioral rules in order to accomplish given tasks. Continuous time recurrent neural networks (CTRNN) controllers with either a fully connected or a bottleneck architecture were examined. The results showed that different rules are represented by separate self-organized attractors, while rule switching is enabled by the transitions among attractors. Furthermore, the results showed that neural network division into a lower sensorimotor level and a higher cognitive level enhances the performance of the robot in the given tasks. Additionally, meta-cognitive rule processing is significantly supported by the embodiment of the controller and the lower level sensorimotor properties of environmental interaction.",

It is proposed that volition is a functional, aggregate property of certain physical systems and it is defined as the capacity for adaptive decision-making. The scale, similar in scope to Daniel Dennett's Kinds of Minds scale, is then outlined, as well as a set of progressive “litmus tests” for determining where a candidate system falls on the scale.

It is discussed how material surroundings – including architectural structures and material objects – are used to shape and structure social interactions and practices in various ways. It is shown how complex organizational structures develop through underlying mechanisms of change such as diversification, connectivity and standardization, and how these can be applied in archaeological case studies. The presented framework will thus show how structures of social organization and development of social complexity can be inferred from the archaeological record.",

To understand the dynamics of this controller, we investigate a heavily simplified variation of it called a node-based sensorimotor-to-motor map (NB-SMM). This deterministic, stateless, continuous-time controller coupled to a minimalistic robot and environment demonstrates six distinct categories of behaviour, including an ability to distinguish between the two sides of a symmetric stimulus, suggesting that controllers based purely on sensorimotor-state to motor mappings may be more capable than intuition first suggests. As the number of nodes increases, the potential behavioural complexity also increases. With two nodes, cycles become possible, along with systems which produce multiple behaviours depending upon initial conditions. This hints at the potential behavioural complexity of a system with many more nodes and provides insight into the kinds of behaviours that might be accomplished by IDSM-controlled robots or virtual agents.",

    "abstract": "One of the core challenges of long-term autonomy is the environmental dynamics that agents must interact with. Some of these dynamics are driven by reliable cyclic processes, and thus are predictable. The most dominant of these is the daily solar cycle, which drives both natural phenomena like weather, as well as the activity of animals and humans. Circadian clocks are a widespread solution in nature to help organisms adapt to these dynamics, and demonstrate that many organisms benefit from maintaining simple models of their environments and how they change. Drawing inspiration from circadian systems, this work models relevant environmental states as times series, allowing for forecasts of the state to be generated without any knowledge of the underlying physics. These forecasts are treated as special percepts in a behavior-based architecture; providing estimates of the future state rather than measurements of the current state. They are incorporated into an ethologically based action-selection mechanism, where they influence the activation levels of behaviors. The approach was validated on a simulated agricultural task: a solar-powered agent monitoring pest populations. By using the artificial circadian system to leverage the forecasted state, the agent was able to improve performance and energy management.",

We propose a series of bidirectional (forward/inverse) SM maps and its associated learning processes that generalize from uni- to bimanual interaction (and affordances) naturally, reinforcing the motor equivalence property. The SM maps range from a SM nature to a solely sensory one: full body control, delta SM control (through small action changes), delta sensory co-variation (how body-related perceptual cues covariate with object-related ones). We make several contributions on how these SM maps are learned: (1) Context and Behavior-Based Babbling: generalizing goal babbling to the interleaving of absolute and local goals including guidance of reflexive behaviors; (2) Event-Based Learning: learning steps are driven by visual, haptic events; and (3) Affordance Gradients: the vectorial field gradients in which an object can be manipulated. Our modeling of bimanual affordances is in line with current robotic research in forward visuomotor mappings and visual servoing, enforces the motor equivalence property, and is also consistent with neurophysiological findings like the multiplicative encoding scheme.",

I clarify that my approach affirms the importance of self-preserving behavior but questions the widespread assumption that this and other varieties of motivated behavior can be explained as the product of homeostatic mechanisms. I suggest that extremal properties can not only do a better job of explaining homeostasis-like behaviors, but they can also be extended to other kinds of motivated behavior that are not homeostasis-like. Finally, I emphasize the explanatory promise of extremal properties with respect to fundamental questions about the emergence of order in living and nonliving systems.",

Specifically, we are interested in learning for artificial agents that act in the world, and operationalize “dreaming” as a mechanism by which such an agent can use its own model of the learning environment to generate new hypotheses and training data. We first show that it is not necessarily a given that such a data-hallucination process is useful, since it can easily lead to a training set dominated by spurious imagined data until an ill-defined convergence point is reached. We then analyse a notably successful implementation of a machine learning-based dreaming mechanism by Ha and Schmidhuber (Ha, D., &amp; Schmidhuber, J. (2018). World models. arXiv e-prints, arXiv:1803.10122). On that basis, we then develop a general framework by which an agent can generate simulated data to learn from in a manner that is beneficial to the agent. This, we argue, then forms a general method for an operationalized dream-like mechanism. We finish by demonstrating the general conditions under which such mechanisms can be useful in machine learning, wherein the implicit simulator inference and extrapolation involved in dreaming act without reinforcing inference error even when inference is incomplete.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the famous tourist attractions are becoming more and more popular for people from all over the world. Thus, to ensure the safety of tourists is a tough task in such crowded area. The study of pedestrian’s characteristics in crowd movement is essential for safety management. In this article, both uni- and bidirectional observational experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the movement properties of pedestrians in a zigzag corridor which is located in a tourism area named Yuyuan business district in Shanghai. Several phenomena have been found during the tourists’ movement process: congestion at boundary, competing and bypassing behavior, and flow gap. As indicated by the transit time of pedestrians in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios, pedestrians in bidirectional pattern (&gt;10 s) spend more time on going through the corridor than that in unidirectional one (&lt;10 s). Besides, the fundamental diagrams in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios are significantly different from data in a controlled experiment, and obvious differences are observed within the density regime from 1.5 to 2.5 ped/m 2 between the uni- and bidirectional scenarios. In addition, spatial distributions of density and velocity demonstrate that pedestrians would like to cluster at the boundary of straight corridors in both uni- and bidirectional scenarios. The results could enrich the database of fundamental diagrams, and then be used for model calibration by taking the actual situation into consideration in similar scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In diverse situations, humans produce natural and adaptable bipedal locomotion by cooperatively manipulating the interactions among the different parts of their bodies and the environment. Therefore, to realize a robot with adaptable behavior, it should be enabled to adjust its morphology accordingly in response to environmental changes. From this perspective, this study introduces the development of a bipedal robot with adaptive morphology. By implementing an actuator network system (ANS), the robot is able to manipulate the physical characteristics of its legs and the way they interact with each other. Two experiments have been conducted: main and supplementary experiments. The main experiment examined how effective is adjusting the robot’s morphology on changing the robot’s behavior. The experiment was conducted on different ground materials and under different connection patterns between the robot’s legs. During the experiment, the robot’s behavior was evaluated in reference to four aspects: walking style, stability, speed, and moving direction. The supplementary experiment took the results of the main experiment and used it to improve the robot’s behavior during locomotion. The robot was enabled to automatically switch between the different connection patterns of the ANS, which in turn changed the interaction between the robot’s legs and generated a more suitable dynamics for the surrounding environment.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the learning walks of the ant Ocymyrmex robustior, the original multi-snapshot model was introduced, which—in contrast to the classical “single snapshot at the goal” model—collects multiple snapshots in the vicinity of the goal location that subsequently can be used for homing, that is, for guiding the return to the goal. In this study, we show that the multi-snapshot model can be generalized to homing in three dimensions. In addition to capturing snapshots at positions shifted in all three dimensions, we suggest to decouple the home direction from the orientation of snapshots and to associate a home vector with each snapshot. We then propose a modification of the multi-snapshot model for three-dimensional route following and evaluate its performance in an accurate reconstruction of a real environment. As an illumination-invariant alternative to grayscale images, we also examine sky-segmented images. We use spherical harmonics as efficient representation of panoramic images enabling low memory usage and fast similarity estimation of rotated images. The results show that our approach can steer an agent reliably along a route, making it also suitable for robotic applications using on-board computers with limited resources.",

This article addresses such VR studies, including a recent experiment which involved recreating the classical “moving room” paradigm into a “virtual moving room-wall paradigm” to assess the impact of VR-induced visual postural perturbations on postural stability and control. Evidence of both compensatory and anticipatory postural responses during unexpected and expected visual postural perturbations is presented. The future scope, required virtual environment set-up variations, limitations, and significance of a “virtual moving wall” paradigm in the learning and adaptation of postural control behavior are also discussed.",

This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.",

Such mechanisms provide dynamic representations of feasible actions, thus enabling to scale the surrounding structures on the behavioural repertoire and capacities supported by our body. This attractive hypothesis has been taken up in robotics, to build intelligent systems able to determine in advance whether a given action would be successful given the current state of the environment and their own skills. Several arguments, however, suggest that the motor simulation framework is not sufficient to explain affordance perception: (1) it rests on a misunderstanding of what affordances are: not actions that are currently feasible, but actions that are possible; (2) it is computationally unrealistic: motor simulation is too costly in terms of computational resources to explain how one can access prospectively to actions that are potentiated by surrounding structures; (3) it only covers the part of the perceptual field within the scope of our attention, but the affordances we perceive do not reduce to the object or state of affairs our attention is focused on at time t; and (4) it can only work if a first layer of affordances is available: motor simulation cannot explain affordance perception, because its very functioning presupposes such perception. Other mechanisms must consequently be hypothesized.",

We identify which fixed policies exhibit turn-taking behaviour in medium-access games and show how to compute the Nash equilibria of such games by using Markov chain methods to calculate the agents’ expected rewards for different stationary policies. We present simulation results for an extensive range of reward functions for pairs of Q-learners playing medium-access games and we use our analysis for stationary agents to develop predictors for the emergence of turn-taking. We explain how to use our predictors to design reward functions for pairs of Q-learning agents that are conducive (or prohibitive) to the emergence of turn-taking in medium-access games. We focus on designing multi-agent reinforcement learning systems that deliberately produce coordinated turn-taking but we also intend our results to be useful for analysing emergent turn-taking behaviour.

In part, this is because it is difficult to identify the consequences (for the nature of signaling systems) of the different ecological contexts in which signaling has developed. The goal of our investigation is to complement the ongoing work in the biological sciences on this issue. Using a theoretical framework that we call synthetic behavioral ecology, we perform a series of experiments involving populations of simulated animals (animats) that, in their simulated world, must compete for food. When animats pick up reliable information about the \"strength\" of other animats within sensory range, a coherent form of collective behavior develops, which we call minimal territoriality. We then introduce the signaling of aggressive intentions. Each individual has a bluffing strategy that is determined by a form of artificial evolution in which there is no explicit fitness function. By varying, in energy terms, the cost of producing aggressive signals, and by analyzing the population dynamics at different costs of signaling, we are able to provide evidence that the handicap principle (according to which higher costs enforce honesty) can apply in multiagent ecologies. We then suggest how variations in the cost of signaling affect the territorial behavior. The article ends with a discussion of the current model and identification of some directions for future research.",

That is, appropriate locomotor patterns are realized by mutual synchronization between the physical system and the neural system. In this article a simple learning model is proposed to acquire an appropriate parameter set, the intrinsic fre quency of the CPG, and the interaction between the CPG and the physical system, in order to obtain a desired locomotor pattern.

It has recently been sug gested, based on evolutionary simulations of an agent-based model inspired by the ultimatum game, that strong reciprocity may arise from individual selection. Ontogenic adaptations were introduced to the model to see how phenotypic plasticity affects the evolution of strong reciprocity. The influence of plasticity is explored by varying the way in which agents adapt. Simulations show that plasticity during an agent's lifetime changes the path of evolution toward interesting behaviors that better approach those observed in humans. As plasticity is increased, the average offers and acceptance threshold also increase.",

This perspective holds that the network and the body are distinct things, and that the network should be thought of as extending beyond the boundaries of the body. The relationship between body and network is subtle, and I revisit it here from the extended perspective.

The robot is self organized both on the level of the individual wheels and with respect to inter-wheel coordination, which arises exclusively from the mechanical coupling of the individual wheels and segments. For the individual wheel, the generating principle proposed results in locomotive states that correspond to self-organized limit cycles of the sensorimotor loop. Our robot interacts with the environment by monitoring the state of its actuators, that is via propriosensation. External sensors are absent. In a structured environment the robot shows complex emergent behavior that includes pushing movable blocks around, reversing direction when hitting a wall and turning when climbing a slope. On flat grounds the robot wiggles in a snake-like manner, when moving at higher velocities. We also investigate the emergence of motor primitives, viz the route to locomotion, which is characterized by a series of local and global bifurcations in terms of dynamical system theory.",

    "abstract": "The autonomic computing paradigm addresses the operational challenges presented by increasingly complex software systems by proposing that they be composed of many autonomous components, each responsible for the runtime reconfiguration of its own dedicated hardware and software components. Consequently, regulation of the whole software system becomes an emergent property of local adaptation and learning carried out by these autonomous system elements. Designing appropriate local adaptation policies for the components of such systems remains a major challenge. This is particularly true where the system’s scale and dynamism compromise the efficiency of a central executive and/or prevent components from pooling information to achieve a shared, accurate evidence base for their negotiations and decisions. In this paper, we investigate how a self-regulatory system response may arise spontaneously from local interactions between autonomic system elements tasked with adaptively consuming/providing computational resources or services when the demand for such resources is continually changing. We demonstrate that system performance is not maximized when all system components are able to freely share information with one another. Rather, maximum efficiency is achieved when individual components have only limited knowledge of their peers. Under these conditions, the system self-organizes into appropriate community structures. By maintaining information flow at the level of communities, the system is able to remain stable enough to efficiently satisfy service demand in resource-limited environments, and thus minimize any unnecessary reconfiguration whilst remaining sufficiently adaptive to be able to reconfigure when service demand changes.",

    "abstract": "People sometimes make better decisions either by treating inanimate objects like strategic reasoners or by treating other reasoners as if they were inanimate objects. I advance “strategic agenthood attribution” as a psychological mechanism for modulating economic behavior. From a design perspective, inducing or suppressing the attribution of strategic abilities can influence aggregate social outcomes. Drawing from experiments in behavioral and institutional economics, developmental and social psychology, and human–robot interaction, I document human strategic reasoning in environments that mix typical adult humans with other kinds of entities. I then discuss anomalous misattributions of strategic agenthood and non-agenthood, with special attention to settings in which two types of error—either attributing strategic reasoning abilities to objects that can’t think, or failing to attribute such abilities to typical human subjects—actually led to better economic outcomes. Because over- and under-mentalizing are endemic to human decision-making processes, game theory can be applied to improve interaction design, whether or not a given interaction is a game. I show that the flexible nature of human agenthood attribution increases the scope of game theory in some places, reduces it elsewhere, and generally introduces behavioral economics as a promising source of theory for human interactions with equivocal agents.",

Given such a task, humans exhibit two different braking behaviors: continuously regulated braking and impulsive braking. Based on an oft-used experimental task in human perception/action research, a series of evolutionary robotics simulations were developed to explore the space of possible braking strategies by examining how braking strategies change as the optical information is manipulated. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) behaviors similar to human behavior were observed only when the constraints were selected correctly; (2) the optical variables τ and proportional rate yielded significantly better braking performance; (3) two different classes of impulsive braking behaviors were observed, including one not reported in previous studies: discrete impulsive braking and oscillatory impulsive braking; (4) the optical variable τ is used to initiate and terminate braking; (5) the evolved model agents use a proportional rate control strategy to regulate braking continuously. We argue that combining psychological experiments and evolutionary robotics simulations is a promising research methodology that is useful for testing existing hypotheses and generating new ones.",

    "abstract": "To follow a goal-directed behavior, an autonomous agent must be able to acquire knowledge about the causality between its motor actions and corresponding sensory feedback. Since the complexity of such sensorimotor relationships directly influences required cognitive resources, this work proposes that it is of importance to keep the agent’s sensorimotor relationships simple. This implies that the agent should be designed in a way such that sensory consequences can be described and predicted in a simplified manner. Living organisms implement this paradigm by adapting sensory and motor systems specifically to their behavior and environment. As a result, they are able to predict sensorimotor consequences with a strongly limited amount of (expensive) nervous tissue. In this context, the present work proposes that advantageous artificial sensory and motor layouts can be evolved by rewarding the ability to predict self-induced stimuli through simple sensorimotor relationships. Experiments consider a simulated agent recording realistic visual stimuli from natural images. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to (i) synthesize visual sensorimotor structures adapted to an agent’s environment and behavior, and (ii) serve as a computational model for testing hypotheses regarding the development of biological visual sensorimotor systems.",

In our study, we use pairs of retinal images, i.e. the resolution is higher towards the image center and low in the periphery, which stem from two cameras, each one mounted on a pan–tilt unit (PTU). The internal simulation is driven by two internal models: a saccade controller (SC) which generates a fixation movement to a certain point in either image, and a visual forward model (VFM) that models the effect on camera movements (by the PTU) onto the image. The SC takes as sensory input the current position of a salient point (in image coordinates) and generates a motor command that would lead to the fixation of that point. The VFM takes as sensory input a current camera image and a motor command, i.e. a saccade, and generates an image that appears as if the saccade was executed. By using the internal models, the salient objects are virtually fixated in both images. These fixated views are matched against each other using a simple difference-based matching approach. The performance of the model is evaluated through a large number of experiments on an image database and compared to a widely used approach from computer vision. In addition, a comparison on a commonplace scene is presented.",

To establish a design methodology for such a controller for robotic systems, we have proposed a fully decentralized control system, inspired by biochemical oscillators in true slime mold ( Physarum polycephalum), which allows a modular robot to exhibit adaptive and versatile behaviors. However, in real living systems, many adaptation mechanisms with different time constants co-exist without conflict in the body (e.g., reflex, learning, growth and evolution); this contributes to the amazingly resilient and intelligent behaviors of living systems. It is well known that in true slime mold, long time-scale morphological changes coexist with the oscillatory behavior stemming from biochemical oscillators. In the present study, we have designed a mathematical model and real physical robot in which two decentralized controllers are incorporated. Numerical and experimental results show that by combining the controllers with different time constants, a robot can use the proposed model to successfully negotiate a narrow aisle by deforming its body shape dynamically.",

The first is based on a finding in recent years, which is that a standalone global path does not always provide adequate multi-agent navigation in crowded scenarios. A global planner that is aware of other agent configurations and thus finds clearer paths is required for optimal navigation. In real life, usually, an agent is only aware of the area close to it. In this study, by taking into account this limitation, we propose a state-machine-based global planner that monitors agents’ close domains and, if required, modifies the path for congestion prevention. The second aspect is the coordination of local and global planners. Multi-agent navigation systems require both local steering and global path planning. As a matter of fact, these two systems should work in coordination since the output of one influences the other. A steering technique cannot always guarantee smooth and collision-free navigation while tracking the global planner’s path. Therefore, we propose a system that detects and rebuilds coordination between local and global path planners.",

We use the term basic trust to refer to the attitude of certainty we express when we act in skilled, often unreflective, habitual ways in the living environment. We will argue that the basic trust of people living in cities should be understood in relation to what we will call trusted urban places. Trusted urban places can be understood similarly as what Giovanna Colombetti and Joel Krueger have called “affective niches” that provide affordances for amplifying, dampening, and sustaining affective states. The basic trust of people living in cities, we will argue, depends upon people moving through and engaging with trusted urban places. In urbanism and architecture, it is barely recognized how the city affords places of affective significance that the person incorporates into their bodily way of existing. Persistent exposure to urban stressors can disturb basic trust in one’s living environment, resulting in a person no longer being at home in the world. We provide examples in which people, as a consequence of the repeated exposure to stressors, no longer move through and engage with trusted urban places, and the impact this has on their basic trust. Our aim is to understand how the urban environment can contribute to the path from stress to anxiety and mood disorders, and how a person can regain their openness to possibilities for regulating their emotions skilfully.",

Mobile service robots emerged as a potential solution, offering a bridge between humans and various tasks. While existing techniques have been introduced to enable robots to deliver objects in an end-to-end manner, they come with limitations. Grippers, for instance, can deliver only one object per round, cabinet robots require manual speed tuning to keep the object in place, and object holders lack generalizability. Inspired by the idea of human nature to use a tray to deliver the object, we developed the Visual-Based Adaptive Interaction System (hereinafter “VAIS”), a novel learning system, to improve service delivery using visual information and a fast neural learning mechanism. Within this system, the robot learns the optimal angular rotational and linear translational moving speeds to effectively transport objects placed on a tray without an extra holder. The robot validates these learnt movements by successfully completing multiple-object delivery tasks along designated routes. The results exhibit that the robot can utilize online learning after a few attempts to determine its proper moving speed and deliver different objects to a given location.",

However, tackling the ever-changing landscapes of brain dynamics seems a hopeless task with complex models. This paper uses a simple Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model to illustrate how phase transitions that change the number of attractors in the landscape for the relative phase between two neural assemblies can occur, helping to explain a qualitative agreement with empirical decision-making measures. Additionally, the paper discusses the possibility of interpreting this agreement with the aid of Irruption Theory (IT). Being the effect of symmetry breakings and the emergence of non-linearities in the fundamental equations, the order parameter governing phase transitions may not have a complete microscopic determination. Hence, many requirements of IT, particularly the Participation Criterion, could be fulfilled by the HKB model and its extensions. Briefly stated, triggering phase transitions in the brain activity could thus be conceived of as a consequence of actual motivations or free will participating in decision-making processes.",

    "abstract": "In his book “ A Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness,” Walter Veit attempts to provide a philosophical foundation for the science of animal consciousness, especially focusing on hedonic evaluation. While he highlights an important aspect of phenomenal consciousness, several conceptual issues warrant further examination. The first one is the role of evaluation. Veit argues that hedonic evaluation explains the origin of consciousness, but it seems implausible for conscious animals to have the evaluative aspect alone. Instead, the origin(s) of consciousness may have linked to the capacity for making prediction that combine both perceptive and evaluative aspects. Second, it is necessary to distinguish between creature and state consciousness for discussing subjective unity. Autonomous movements of octopus arms do not necessarily imply multiple conscious subjects within one body. Alternatively, an octopus may experiences “switching” within a single phenomenal field between conflicting perceptions as in binocular rivalry. Lastly, the adaptivity of consciousness requires scrutiny. Just as different animal phyla show various body plans, the neuroarchitecture of consciousness may be implemented in different ways among animals. Specific mentalities may be fine-tuned to specific lifestyles, similarly to specific adaptation of animal bodies. It appears that the “adaptivity” of ground plans (e.g., vertebrate body and vertebrate consciousness) makes no sense or must be considered differently from the adaptivity of specific character states (e.g., the body shape and food preferences of a bat). The current analysis could help improve Veit’s proposal, linking it to previous accounts and establishing a solid philosophical foundation for this research field.",

However, the proximate mechanisms underlying this adaptive behavior are largely unknown. Similarly, engineering artificial agents that can as flexibly solve such mechanical puzzles is still a substantial challenge in areas such as robotics. This article is an interdisciplinary approach to study mechanical problem solving which we hope is relevant to both fields. The behavior we are studying results from the interaction between a complex environment (the lockbox) and different processes that govern the animals’ behavior. We therefore jointly analyze the parrots’ (1) engagement, (2) sensorimotor skill learning, and (3) action selection. We find that none of these aspects could solely explain the animals’ behavioral adaptation and that a plausible model of proximate mechanisms must jointly address these aspects. We accompany this analysis with a discussion of methods to identify such mechanisms. At the same time, we argue, it is implausible to identify a detailed model from the limited behavioral data of just a few studies. Instead, we advocate for an incremental approach to model building in which one first establishes constraints on proximate mechanisms before specific, detailed models are formulated. To illustrate this idea, we apply it to the data presented here. We argue that as the field attempts to find mechanistic explanations for increasingly complex behaviors, such alternative modeling approaches will be necessary.",

    "abstract": "Animals can navigate through complex environments with amazing flexibility and efficiency: they forage over large areas, quickly learning rewarding behavior and changing their plans when necessary. Some insights into the neural mechanisms supporting this ability can be found in the hippocampus (HPC)—a brain structure involved in navigation, learning, and memory. Neuronal activity in the HPC provides a hierarchical representation of space, representing an environment at multiple scales. In addition, it has been observed that when memory-consolidation processes in the HPC are inactivated, animals can still plan and navigate in a familiar environment but not in new environments. Findings like these suggest three useful principles: spatial learning is hierarchical, learning a hierarchical world-model is intrinsically valuable, and action planning occurs as a downstream process separate from learning. Here, we demonstrate computationally how an agent could learn hierarchical models of an environment using off-line replay of trajectories through that environment and show empirically that this allows computationally efficient planning to reach arbitrary goals within a reinforcement learning setting. Using the computational model to simulate hippocampal damage reproduces navigation behaviors observed in rodents with hippocampal inactivation. The approach presented here might help to clarify different interpretations of some spatial navigation studies in rodents and present some implications for future studies of both machine and biological intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The ability of robots to make efficient and effective behavior decisions is a critical prerequisite for completing various tasks in unknown and complex environments. When operating in continuously changing environments, robots often struggle to achieve satisfactory decision-making outcomes due to a lack of prior knowledge about the environment. Investigating how to endow robots with human-like learning and decision-making capabilities to make sound decisions in changing environments remains a significant topic in robotics research. This paper models the processes of memory replay and memory consolidation by mimicking the memory conversion mechanism of the human brain, from the cellular level (synaptic consolidation) and system level (system consolidation), and proposes a human-like brain memory consolidation model based on a motivated developmental network. By leveraging different neurotransmitters’ neuromodulatory effects and considering the dependency of memory conversion on the neocortex during the memory transformation process, the model simulates the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory and the reconsolidation of long-term memory, enhancing memory plasticity and improving the robot’s learning and decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments. Physical experiments and comparative tests have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "The collective homeostasis model, grounded in ecological dynamics, has recently been proposed to explain the self-regulating individual-environment interactions that are necessary to conceptualizing sports teams as collective homeostatic systems. Based on these insights and given the capacity of humans to construct and adapt their ecological niches, this article explores the creation of enriching sporting contexts for the development of adaptive player-environment interactions in competitive team sports. This model of adaptation emphasizes the importance of creating a sports niche rich in shared affordances to enable team coordination through the development of individual and collective homeostasis in different sub-phases of competitive performance. In a homeostatic sports system, principles of play advocated by coaches allow players to intentionally coordinate and adapt their actions to shape the collective identity of the team. The team’s identity is shaped by the synergetic development of collective attractors (stable system states) emerging at specific scales of complexity. This is facilitated through the manipulation of constraints by the coaching and support staff. These ideas have important implications for implementing team sports training and performance preparation, helping to transform the self-regulating tendencies of players through adapting their behaviors to dynamic performance contexts.",

    "abstract": "An associative control process (ACP) network is a learning control system that can reproduce a variety of animal learning results from classical and instrumental conditioning experiments (Klopf, Morgan, &amp; Weaver, 1993; see also the article, 'A Hierarchical Network of Control Systems that Learn\"). The ACP networks proposed and tested by Klopf, Morgan, and Weaver are not guaranteed, however, to learn optimal policies for maximizing reinforcement. Optimal behavior is guaranteed for a reinforcement learning system such as Q-learning (Watkins, 1989), but simple Q-learning is incapable of reproducing the animal learning results that ACP networks reproduce. We propose two new models that reproduce the animal learning results and are provably optimal. The first model, the modified ACP network, embodies the smallest number of changes necessary to the ACP network to guarantee that optimal policies will be learned while still reproducing the animal learning results. The second model, the single-layer ACP network, embodies the smallest number of changes necessary to Q-learning to guarantee that it reproduces the animal learning results while still learning optimal policies. We also propose a hierarchical network architecture within which several reinforcement learning systems (e.g., Q-learning systems, single-layer ACP networks, or any other learning controller) can be combined in a hierarchy. We implement the hierarchical network architecture by combining four of the single-layer ACP networks to form a controller for a standard inverted pendulum dynamic control problem. The hierarchical controller is shown to learn more reliably and more than an order of magnitude faster than either the single-layer ACP network or the Barto, Sutton, and Anderson (1983) learning controller for the benchmark problem.",

We explore the hypothesis that adaptability will depend unimodally on environmental variety, and we measure this component of environmental structure using the information-theoretical uncertainty (Shannon entropy) of detectable environmental conditions. We define adaptability as the degree to which a certain kind of population successfully adapts to a certain kind of environment, and we measure adaptability by comparing a population's size to the size of a nonadapting, but otherwise comparable, population in the same environment. We study the relationship between adaptability and environmental structure in an evolving artificial population of sensorimotor agents that live, reproduce, and die in a variety of environments. We find that adaptability does not show a unimodal dependence on environmental variety alone, although there is justification for preserving our unimodal hypothesis if we consider other aspects of environmental structure. In particular, adaptability depends not just on how much structural information is detectable in the environment but also on the extent to which this information is unambiguous and valuable (i.e., whether the information accurately signals a difference that makes a difference). How best to measure and integrate these other components of environmental structure remains unresolved.",

A web or journal search might retrieve thousands of articles, ranked in a manner that is biased by, for example, popularity or eigenvalue centrality rather than by informed relevance to the complex query. With hundreds of thousands of articles published each year, the dense, tangled thicket of knowledge grows even more entwined. Although natural language processing and new methods of generating knowledge graphs can extract increasingly high-level interpretations from research articles, the results are inevitably biased toward recent, popular, and/or prestigious sources. This is a result of the inherent nature of human social-learning processes. To preserve and even rediscover lost scientific ideas, we employ the theory that scientific progress is punctuated by means of inspired, revolutionary ideas at the origin of new paradigms. Using a brief case example, we suggest how phylogenetic inference might be used to rediscover potentially useful lost discoveries, as a way in which machines could help drive revolutionary science.",

Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications.

The hierarchy in open systems is characterised by three main relativities: (a) whole and parts, (b) control and (c) variability. From a hierarchical standpoint, motor skills phenomena are structured under two levels: macro (responsible for the consistency and configuration of patterns) and micro (responsible for variability and, consequently, the flexibility of patterns). Study findings make it possible to understand how adaptations in the soccer, futsal, swimming, golf, coincident timing and graphic motor skills take place by altering the microstructure (parameterisation) or reorganising the macrostructure (self-organisation). The distinction between these two modes of adaptation allows us to consider the increase of complexity in the motor skills phenomena as a basic feature of living systems.",

For such purpose, we place an agent in a virtual environment and let it perform in different contexts. We analyze how new knowledge structures results from prior experiences and interactions with the environment.

Reliable signals of important outcomes are responsible for triggering critical anticipatory or preparatory behavior, which is any form of behavior that prepares the organism to receive a biologically significant event. Previous research has shown that humans and other animals prepare more for outcomes that occur in the presence of highly reliable (i.e., highly contingent) signals, that is, those for which that difference is larger. However, it seems reasonable to expect that, all other things being equal, the probability with which the outcome follows the signal should also affect preparatory behavior. In the present experiment with humans, we used two signals. They were differentially followed by the outcome, but they were equally (and relatively weakly) reliable. The dependent variable was preparatory behavior in a Martians video game. Participants prepared more for the outcome (a Martians’ invasion) when the outcome was most probable. These results indicate that the probability of the outcome can bias preparatory behavior to occur with different intensities despite identical outcome signaling.",

    "abstract": "The question of why some animals play has received serious scientific attention since Herbert Spencer (1872) published the first theory of the origin of play in his The Principles of Psychology. Spencer thought that play occurs when an animal builds up excess energy in its brain, which is then discharged as frivolous play behavior that imitates the animal’s functional behaviors. Groos (1898), in the first book dedicated to animal play, argued that Spencer’s imitative theory could not explain why young animals play because they lack adult functional behaviors to imitate. Spencer then argued that a more plausible version of the excess energy theory would assert that frivolous play behaviors are instead instinctive behaviors discharged when excess energy is sufficiently high. Groos, however, did not believe that any excess energy theory of frivolous play was empirically or theoretically adequate. Empirical observations suggested that young animals play even when fatigued and therefore do so while lacking excess energy. Theoretically, Groos could not accept the idea that play is merely frivolous; play must be favored by natural selection in order to evolve. Groos instead proposed an adaptive theory of play, which postulated that animals inherit partial or incomplete instincts. Play by young animals allows them to practice incomplete instinctive behaviors, which over developmental time become adult functional behaviors. Thus, in Groos’ adaptive theory of play, the function of play is practice and its adaptive benefit is the development of adult functional behaviors. Today, although the details of both theories are not seriously entertained, the broad perspectives of frivolous versus adaptive play still frame the debate. In 2010, Gordon Burghardt and Sergio Pellis proposed a series of workshops on the evolution of play, which were sponsored by the National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) and held from 2011 to 2013. The aim of these NIMBioS workshops was to develop computational and mathematical models of the evolution and mechanisms of play with the aim developing a clearer and integrative understanding of the conditions under which play could evolve. The papers in this issue represent the first systematic use of computational and mathematical models to investigate the theoretical and empirical origins of play. Pellis, Palagi, Burghard, and Mangle, in this issue, present a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution and mechanisms of play. A problem for purely adaptive approaches to the evolution of play is that play is sparsely distributed across animal phyla. Play has been identified in only five of 30 different phyla and most species that play are mammals (Burghardt, 2005). If play as practice is essential for completing or fine-tuning adult functional behaviors during development, then play should be more common across phyla. In part to address this problem, they distinguish three types of play processes: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary process play is the most basic and expressed during an animal’s development, it just satisfies criteria for play, and may not be adaptive. Once primary process play has evolved, it may be evolutionarily co-opted to serve adaptive functions in secondary and tertiary process play. The distinction between these different processes or levels of play integrates essential elements of the two nineteenth century views on the origin of play previously discussed. When there is resource abundance (i.e., surplus resource theory; SRT; Burghardt, 1984, 2005), primary process play may initially evolve without adaptive benefit. Once established, selection can co-opt primary process play to transform it into adaptive secondary and tertiary process play, which have adaptive benefits. This suggests that play is phylogenetically rare because initially it is typically not adaptive and requires resource abundance to evolve. Alternatively, primary process play could be adaptive as argued by Spinka, Newberry, and Bekoff (2001). They theorized that primary process play functions to build a repertoire of behavioral responses to unexpected events. Interestingly, Cully, Clune, Tarapore,",

Mating hierarchies emerge wherein one dominant mating pair holds an unproportional majority of the group’s reproductive benefit, while other members mate infrequently, yet allocate energy and resources toward the offspring of the dominant group members. In this paper, we use an agent-based model, which mimics mongoose populations, to investigate the effect of reproductive skew, specifically how reproductive skew affects how quickly individuals can become adapted to their environment. The results of the model show that reproductive skew does increase the rate of natural selection, which has possible practical implications in conservation biology.",

We examine the modulation of reading relationship-action sentences in the execution of concurrent motor actions. We manipulated the delay between the sentence display and the visual prompt for motor response: 300 ms and 800 ms. If approach-avoidance verbs recruit motor representations, sentence reading will modulate the execution of the motor action. We found that sentence interfered with motor action at 300 ms delay while facilitated it at 800 ms delay in congruent conditions: approach-forward and avoidance-backward. This result supports that sentence understanding and motor action execution share motor processes. Implications are discussed for embodiment of social cognition in the ambit of relationship actions and their interwoven with language to facilitate social navigation.",

    "abstract": "Enactive approaches to cognitive science as well as contemporary accounts from neuroscience have argued that we need to reconceptualize the role of temporality and affectivity in minds. Far from being limited to special faculties, such as emotional mental states and timekeeping, these accounts argue that time and affect both constitute fundamental aspects of minds and cognition. If this is true, how should one conceptualize the relation between these two fundamental aspects? This paper offers a way to conceptualize and clarify the relation between temporality and affectivity when understood in this fundamental sense. In particular, the paper contributes to ongoing discussions of structural temporality and affectivity by combining enactive notions of self-maintenance with a thermodynamically informed view of the organization of living systems. In situating temporality and affectivity by way of their role for the maintenance of thermodynamic non-equilibrium, I will argue that temporality and affectivity should be regarded as two sides of the same coin—that is, two distinct ways of highlighting one and the same process. This process corresponds to the continued differentiation of organism and environment as functional poles of a living system. The temporal and affective structure of living systems may thus be seen as the warp and weft by which living systems maintain themselves in terms of thermodynamic non-equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Toluene-based inhalants found in some common products, such as paint thinner or glues, may be used to induce intoxication. Though addiction may be one of its most detrimental consequences, treatment options are insufficient or limited. Environmental enrichment (EE) refers to housing conditions that enhance sensory, cognitive, and motor stimulation. This paradigm induces beneficial effects in a variety of animal models of brain disorders, and also in animal models of drug addiction. Previous studies have shown that toluene induces behavioral sensitization and that EE treatment can reduce this response. Since EE comprises a variety of elements, the aim of the present study was to group mice into five different types of EE-shaping housing conditions (4 weeks) and to identify which of them are key elements in attenuating toluene-induced behavioral sensitization. The experimental groups were: Standard housing with conspecifics; EE with conspecifics; Toys stimulation with conspecifics; Exercise wheels with conspecifics; and Wheel and toy isolated. Mice in Standard housing and previously exposed to toluene exhibited high locomotor activity, suggesting behavioral sensitization. When animals were exposed to toluene and then housed in EE with conspecifics or Exercise wheels with conspecifics conditions an attenuation of behavioral sensitization was observed ( p &lt; 0.001; 100% and 75% effectiveness, respectively). Toy with conspecifics housing also reduced behavioral sensitization, but in a less proportion than the two previous mentioned treatments ( p &lt; 0.002; 33.5% effectiveness). Mice in the Wheel and toy isolated housing did not show significant changes in the assessed behavior ( p = 0.061; 12.4% effectiveness). We suggest that exercise and social interaction are the key enriched main elements to attenuate toluene-induced behavioral sensitization. Our results advise preclinical strategies for inhalant abuse interventions based on social interactions and physical exercise. Also, they provide guidelines to develop experimental models with diverse environments and groups that lead us to understand the complexity of environmental enrichment.",

Additionally, in line with the life-mind continuity thesis, we suggest that the best place to look for the interplay between motivations and nonmotivational physical, biological, and dynamical factors, may be at the level of the continuous feeling of being an embodied, living organism.",

    "abstract": "Risk-taking is a ubiquitous behavior and its assessment is a central aspect of understanding human decision-making. Self-report questionnaires can be used to probe risk-taking propensities in a domain-specific manner. In contrast, most behavioral tools for risk-taking assessment provide nonspecific, unitary measures with a strong bias towards risk scenarios involving monetary gains and losses tied to probabilities. In the current work, we evaluate a behavioral task designed to specifically address recreational risk-taking, that is, situations where decision-making is driven by intrinsic motivation and performance is rewarding in its own right. For this, we chose the Tower Building Task (TBT), in which participants use wooden blocks to attempt to build the tallest tower they can; a trial ends if the building collapses, the allotted time ends, or the builder is satisfied with their tower. We correlated the TBT scores with each of the domains provided by two widely used self-report instruments, the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking scale (DOSPERT) and the Evolutionary Domain-Specific Risk scale (ERS). We found small, but significant correlations between TBT scores and those of (i) the recreational domain of the DOSPERT as well as (ii) the environmental exploration domain of the ERS. These correlation values reflect a small degree of similarity between these tests, suggesting that they capture some aspects of the complex construct that is recreation. However, the small magnitude of the correlations highlights the need for a complementary set of tools to evaluate the full spectrum of recreational risk-taking activities.",

We conduct an experiment where humans are virtually immersed in an open field foraging environment and are trained to collect the highest amount of rewards. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the human decision dynamics. Then, Imitation Learning (IL) based on maximum likelihood estimation is used to train Neural Networks (NN) that map human decisions to observed states. The results show that passive imitation substantially underperforms humans. We further refine the human-inspired policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm which shows better stability than other algorithms and can steadily improve the policies pre-trained with IL. We show that the combination of IL and RL match human performance and that the artificial agents trained with our approach can quickly adapt to reward distribution shift. We finally show that good performance and robustness to reward distribution shift strongly depend on combining allocentric information with an egocentric representation of the environment.",

The DPC model reproduces the usual shape of a conditioned response, the curve of efficacy of conditioning as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI), the dependence of the optimal ISI on CS duration, the extinction of a conditioned response [even for long-lasting CSs as opposed to Klopf's (1988) model], and several other properties of classical conditioning.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning, in particular in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been widely used in robotics for object classification and action recognition, among others, with very high performance. Nevertheless, this high performance, mostly in classification tasks, is rarely accompanied by reasoning processes that consider the relationships between objects, actions, and effects. In this article, we used three CNNs to classify objects, actions, and effects that were trained with the CERTH-SOR3D dataset that has more than 20,000 RGB-D videos. This dataset involves 14 objects, 13 actions, and in this article was augmented with seven effects. The probabilistic vector output of each trained CNN was combined into a Bayesian network (BN) to capture the relationships between objects, actions, and effects. It is shown that by probabilistically combining information from the three classifiers, it is possible to improve the classification performance of each CNN or to level the same performance with less training data. In particular, the recognition performance improved from 71.2% to 79.7% for actions, 85.0%–86.7% for objects, and 77.0%–82.1% for effects. In the article, it is also shown that with missing information, the model can still produce reasonable classification performance. In particular, the system can be used for reasoning purposes in robotics, as it can make action planning with information from object and effects or it can predict effects with information from objects and actions.",

Multi-objective reinforcement learning methods address this kind of problem by fusing the reinforcement learning paradigm with multi-objective optimization techniques. One major drawback of these methods is the lack of adaptability to non-stationary dynamics in the environment. This is because they adopt optimization procedures that assume stationarity in order to evolve a coverage set of policies that can solve the problem. This article introduces a developmental optimization approach that can evolve the policy coverage set while exploring the preference space over the defined objectives in an online manner. We propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm that can robustly evolve a convex coverage set of policies in an online manner in non-stationary environments. We compare the proposed algorithm with two state-of-the-art multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms in stationary and non-stationary environments. Results showed that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in non-stationary environments while achieving comparable results in stationary environments.",

It is also customary to think of minds as kinds of bounded loci for thoughts, representations, and other internal entities, targeting the borderline between the internal domain and the external world as a genuine barrier. Therefore, not surprisingly, boundaries and surfaces have become targets of disciplined formal-ontological investigations. However, to have a boundary (or surface) is not only a purely geometrical or topological feature, for boundaries play certain roles. For that reason, this article unpacks boundaries in general, and surfaces in particular, in terms of interactions between structured entities, most importantly—living creatures capable of (minimal) cognition. It is argued that boundaries should be thought of as products of and at the same time as critical constraints imposed on structural coupling between complex beings, including the interactions between the (minimally) cognitive subjects and their surroundings.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly is a phenomenon broadly observed in nature where a vast number of various molecules spontaneously synthesize complex structures. In this article, prompted by the need for the realization of highly autonomous self-assembly systems that employ magnetism as a driving force, we discuss fundamental issues associated with magnetically driven self-assembly systems. We first introduce some examples from our case studies, in which the models all subscribe to a distributed approach, and thus lack central control. Then we categorize them by their type of magnetic attachment. The issues discussed include several fundamental properties, such as the effect of morphology, stochasticity, the difference between two-dimensional models and three-dimensional models, emergence, allostericity, and parallelism. The conclusions obtained support our stance that the appropriate morphology lightens the control cost for the assembly, providing primal but engaging instances of magnetic self-assembly systems that warrant further study.",

    "abstract": "There are several ways to estimate the distance to an object based on visual information. Many robotic systems compute object distances based on disparity values or motion information. In addition to a disparity cue or image motion, research has shown that animals can possibly estimate the distance using the image size as well as the azimuth and elevation angles in their visual field. In this paper, inspired by the vigilance behavior of fiddler crabs, we suggest distance-estimation methods with several visual cues for engineering applications. A foraging fiddler crab can estimate the distance of an intruder from the burrow entrance. If the intruder is close to the burrow, the crab rushes back home to maintain possession of the burrow. In this study, we investigated burrow-centered distance-estimation methods based on visual information such as the retinal position, that is, the azimuth and elevation angles in an omnidirectional view as well as the image size and retinal speed of a target object. The methods show potential for engineering applications to the surveillance problem.",

In this commentary, I will show that abnormal subjective states are neither necessary nor essential to understanding the universality of geometric art. In effect, the geometric art from the Middle Stone/Palaeolithic Age and later can be sufficiently explained by recourse to the normal function of the visual cortex in the context of the regular engagement with everyday materials.",

How is that structure to be described, and how can its behavioral consequences be explained and predicted? We aim to establish initial answers to these questions by simulating the evolution of very simple organisms in simple environments with different structures. Our artificial creatures, called \"minimats, \"have neither sensors nor memory and behave solely by picking amongst the actions of moving, eating, reproducing, and sitting, according to an inherited probability distribution. Our simulated environments contain only food (and multiple minimats) and are structured in terms of their spatial and temporal food density and the patchiness with which the food appears. Changes in these environmental parameters affect the evolved behaviors of minimats in different ways, and all three parameters are of importance in describing the minimat world. One of the most useful behavioral strategies that evolves is \"looping\" movement, which allows minimats-despite their lack of internal state—to match their behavior to the temporal (and spatial) structure of their environment. Ultimately we find that minimats construct their own environments through their individual behaviors, making the study of the impact of global environment structure on individual behavior much more complex.",

An agent-based model designed to study gene culture interactions in the evolution of communication is introduced. This model shows that cultural selection resulting from learner biases can be crucial in determining the structure of communication systems transmitted through both genetic and cultural processes. Furthermore, the learning bias that leads to the emergence of optimal communication in the model resembles the learning bias brought to the task of language acquisition by human infants. This suggests that the iterated application of such human learning biases may explain much of the structure of human language.",

As biological systems, in contrast to technical systems, show an impressive capability of self-adaptation, this is meant as a proof of principle. Complementing an intensity encoded system (Linder, 2002), where scalar values are represented as the activity of a given neuron, this mechanism is based on spatial encoding, where a scalar value is represented as the location of the most active neuron in a chain of neurons. This encoding scheme can often be observed in biological systems. While the intensity encoded system requires linear input characteristics and symmetrical distribution of the input values over the whole range for both target angles and actual angles, the spatially encoded system presented here is completely self-organizing for evenly distributed target angles and actual angles. By employing an internal teaching signal, it can even adjust for arbitrary (i.e., biologically relevant) distributions of the input. This internal signal is provided through body geometry. Instead of error back-propagation, the system exploits local neuronal mechanisms implicated by a biologically plausible realization of self-organizing maps.",

To scaffold imaginative discussions about everyday life in 2050 with a cross-section of the Dutch population, we wrote seven short speculative stories and designed a set of physical discussion tools. When looking at this design case and the cases Rietveld describes in his inaugural lecture, one can see that we both are guided by and contributing to the development of ecological and enactive philosophy, which rejects the dichotomy between sensorimotor and higher cognition. In his approach, Rietveld pushes the boundaries of the affordances of the material during the making process, whereas we predominantly investigate the affordances of the things and practices which we have designed. Despite these differences, we are both pursuing engagement with philosophical practice through non-discursive means while imagining new sociomaterial practices.",

    "abstract": "Dual-process theories divide cognition into two kinds of processes: Type 1 processes that are autonomous and do not use working memory, and Type 2 processes that are decoupled from the immediate situation and use working memory. Often, Type 1 processes are also fast, high capacity, parallel, nonconscious, biased, contextualized, and associative, while Type 2 processes are typically slow, low capacity, serial, conscious, normative, abstract, and rule-based. This article argues for an embodied dual-process theory based on the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger. According to Heidegger, the basis of human agents’ encounters with the world is in a prereflective, pragmatically engaged disposition marked by readiness-to-hand ( Zuhandenheit), sometimes equated with “smooth coping.” Examples of smooth coping include walking, throwing a ball, and other embodied actions that do not require reflective thought. I argue that smooth coping primarily consists of Type 1 processes. The Heideggerian dual-process model yields distinctly different hypotheses from Hubert Dreyfus’ model of smooth coping, and I will critically engage with Dreyfus’ work.",

However, it is neither theoretically nor empirically grounded. This article presents a null hypothesis statistical test to assess whether an organism’s behavior is sensitive to reinforcement as quantitatively expressed by the matching law.

The aim of model is to assist policymakers for energy and environmental policy design based on consumers’ behavior. The jeepney owners in the old public utility jeepney (PUJ) fleet in Metro Manila are chosen as case study to prove the applicability of the model. The results show that rational, psychological, and social interaction of owners could not lead to diffusion of technology without intervention of policy instruments. However, by implementing incentive-based policies, the entire jeepney fleet could be renovated before the end of simulation horizon and the government could launch a 5-year plan to combat pollution of the fleet. The model could be applied to evaluate and prioritize strategies for reducing the future energy requirements and emissions in other fleets and regions.",

Three examples of agency at different scales—human, bacterial, and thermodynamic—are presented, which reveal insights into the nature of agency itself, while also illustrating the range of phenomena that theoretical accounts need to address. Three approaches to agency are then explored, an enactive approach and two ecological accounts, Reed’s “effort after meaning and value” and ecological values-realizing theory. These approaches are compared from the perspective of ecological values-realizing theory, noting differences and similarities between them. The article is intended to be exploratory, so that the contributions of each of the three accounts can be appreciated, while posing sharp questions and challenges from an ecological values-realizing perspective. Claims considered include: Agency is characteristic of the ecosystem in its entirety, not only in its organismic components. A defining aspect of agency is the possibility of acting in ways that increase freedom and other values. Values function as ecosystem defining constraints. Agency requires hope and responsibility, going beyond goal-achievement toward increasing the integrity of the ecosystem. Agency is marked by interdependence and self-criticism more than autonomy.

The study of consciousness and subjective experience has been central to philosophy for centuries.

Francisco Varela (1946–2001) pioneered the empirical study of consciousness by developing novel, naturalised and rich approaches in a non-reductive and comprehensive manner. In this article, we review the main conceptual distinctions and philosophical challenges of consciousness research and highlight the main contributions of Varela and his associates: the development of neurophenomenology as a methodological framework that builds a bridge between subjective and objective sources of data and the discovery of gamma-band phase synchronisation as a neural marker of perceptual awareness. Finally, we describe the work of Varela on time consciousness, his philosophical approach and the implementation of his neurophenomenological framework for its study by integrating subjective reports with neural measures.",

It aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of representation-hungry activities by grounding cognition in practice. Practice is not merely something that we do as a means to an end, but is constitutive of cognition. Puzzlingly, however, the CEF begins to develop a distributed approach to cognition by viewing individuals through their cultural-cognitive ecology or milieu, before shifting focus to an internalist interpretation of enactive agency. CEF states that the agent enacts their world and discovers themselves through practice, but provides no clear account of organism-environment mutuality. This is problematic because CEF’s notion of practice depends on organism-environment mutuality in its first core assumption. The tendency to downplay the importance of the environment is likely due to a holdover of early enactivist ideas that have sparked tensions between ecological psychology and enactivism in the past. We attempt to re-align the CEF with the enactive project, which we think is gradually shifting away from individualistic concepts like autopoiesis and sense-making toward social and ecological concepts like participatory sense-making and affordances.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models, with a history reaching back to the 1940s, have been cited as a useful technique for planning economic development and simulating the effect of economic crashes. These models offer an insightful alternative to the traditional techniques of mathematical modelling. Understanding how different designs of agent-based models change simulation outcomes will be useful for modellers of economic and other simulation scenarios. The work presented here examines how a computer simulation of an agent-based model responds to disruptive events, in the context of an economic model. Agents within the model interact by producing, selling and buying goods. A series of experiments compare system stability in two scenarios: one where a top-down rule is applied to the pricing of goods and another where decision-making is at the individual agent level, a bottom-up approach. These two approaches are termed system-adaptive and self-adaptive. Results draw the conclusion that a self-adaptive function can provide greater stability, but this depends on whether the measured variable is a primary or secondary variable to the adaptive function. Considerations are presented for future work which could consider the impact adaptive functions have on secondary variable measurements.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the potential for the development of novel perceptual experiences through sustained training with a sensory augmentation device. We developed (1) a new geomagnetic sensory augmentation device, the NaviEar, and (2) a battery of tests for automaticity in the use of the device. The NaviEar translates head direction toward north into continuous sound according to a “wind coding” principle. To facilitate automatization of use, its design is informed by considerations of the embodiment of spatial orientation and multi-sensory integration, and it uses a sensory coding scheme derived from means for auditory perception of wind direction that is common in sailing because it is easy to understand and use. The test battery assesses different effects of automaticity (interference, rigidity of responses, and dynamic integration) assuming that automaticity is a necessary criterion to show the emergence of perceptual feel, that is, an augmented experience with perceptual phenomenal quality. We measured performance in simple training tasks, administered the tests for automaticity, and assessed subjective reports through a questionnaire. Results suggest that the NaviEar is easy and comfortable to use and has a potential for applications in real-world situations. Despite high usability, however, a 5-day training with the NaviEar did not reach levels of automaticity that are indicative of perceptual feel. We propose that the test battery for automaticity may be used as a benchmark test for iterative research on perceptual experiences in sensory augmentation and sensory substitution.",

It is proposed that the fundamental representations used to store and process information are the limiting factor. A review of the literature of current cognitive models reveals a lack of models suitable for implementation in real agents and proposes that available models fail as they have not been developed with real agents in mind.

    "abstract": "Human upright posture is an unstable position: Continuous activation of postural muscles is required to avoid falling down. This is the output of a complex control system that monitors a very large number of inputs, related to the orientation of the body segments, to produce an adequate output as muscle activation. Complexity arises because of the very large number of correlated inputs and out puts: The finite contraction and release time of muscles and the neural control loop delays make the problem even more difficult. Nevertheless, upright posture is a capability that is learned in the first year of life. Here, the learning process is investigated by using a neural network model for the controller and the reinforcement learning paradigm. To this end, after creating a mechanically realistic digital human body, a feedback postural controller is defined, which outputs a set of joint torques as a function of orientation and rotation speed of the body segments. The controller is made up of a neural net work, whose `synaptic weights' are determined through trial-and-error (failure in maintaining upright posture) by using a reinforcement learning strategy. No desired control action is specified nor particular structure given to the controller. The results show that the anatomical arrangement of the skeleton is sufficient to shape a postural control, robust against torque perturbations and noise, and flexible enough to adapt to changes in the body model in a short time. Moreover, the learned kinematics closely resembles the data reported in the literature; it emerges from the interaction with the environment, only through trial-and-error. Overall, the results suggest that anatomical arrangement of the body segments may play a major role in shaping human motor control.",

    "abstract": "Modularity is a system property of many natural and artificial adaptive systems. Evolutionary algorithms designed to produce modular solutions have increased convergence rates and improved generalization ability; however, their performance can be impacted if the task is inherently nonmodular. Previously, we have shown that some design variables can influence whether the task on the remaining variables is inherently modular. We investigate the possibility of exploiting that dependence to simplify optimization and arrive at a general design pattern that we use to show that evolutionary search can seek such modularity-inducing design variable values, thus easing subsequent search for highly fit, modular organization within the remaining design variables. We investigate this approach with embodied agents in which evolutionary discovery of morphology enables subsequent discovery of highly fit, modular controllers and show that it benefits from biasing search toward modular controllers and setting the mutation rate for control policies higher than that for morphology. This work also reinforces our previous finding that the relationship between modularity and evolvability that is well-studied in nonembodied systems can, under certain conditions, be generalized to include embodied systems as well and provides a practical approach to satisfying the conditions in question.",

    "abstract": "The traditional approach in cognitive sciences holds that cognition is a matter of manipulating abstract symbols following certain rules. According to this view, the body is merely an input/output device, which allows the computational system—the brain—to acquire new input data by means of the senses and to act in the environment following its commands. In opposition to this classical view, defenders of embodied cognition (EC) stress the relevance of the body in which the cognitive agent is embedded in their explanation of cognitive processes. From a representationalist framework regarding our conscious experience, in this article, I will offer a novel argument in favor of EC and show that cognition constitutively—and no merely causally—depends upon body activity beyond that in the brain. In particular, I will argue that in order to solve the problem derived from the empirical evidence in favor of the possibility of shifted spectrum, representationalist should endorse the view that experiences concern its subject: the content of experience is de se. I show that this claim perfectly matches the phenomenological observation and helps explaining the subjective character of the experience. Furthermore, I argue that entertaining this kind of representation constitutively depends on bodily activity. Consequently, insofar as cognition depends on consciousness, it is embodied.",

Whether accidents are problematic for an animal depends on their context, frequency, and severity. In this article, we investigate the question of how accidents affect the task performance of agents in an agent-based simulation model for a wide class of tasks called “multi-agent territory exploration” tasks (MATE). In MATE tasks, agents have to visit particular locations of varying quality in partially observable environments within a fixed time window. As such, agents have to balance the quality of the location with how much energy they are willing to expend reaching it. Arriving at the wrong location by accident typically reduces task performance. We model agents based on two location selection strategies that are hypothesized to be widely used in nature: best-of-n and min-threshold. Our results show that the two strategies lead to different accident rates and thus overall different levels of performance based on the degree of competition among agents, as well as the quality, density, visibility, and distribution of target locations in the environment. We also show that in some cases, individual accidents can be advantageous for both the individual and the whole group.",

As a result of these variations, transmissibility of the randomly generated symbols of the language decreases. We introduce multiple cycles of iterated imitation during which the symbols of the language evolve and adapt to the uncertainties in robots’ sensors and actuators. Specific structures emerge in the learned symbols and transmissibility of the language increases. This process is proposed as a model that explains how structural syntax emerges and evolves in a symbolic communication system.",

The agent only knows of its own actions via their effect on future inputs; therefore desired states, and error signals, are most naturally defined in terms of the inputs. Most machine learning algorithms, however, operate in terms of desired outputs. For example, backpropagation takes target output values and propagates the corresponding error backwards through the network in order to change the weights. In closed loop settings, it is far more obvious how to define desired sensory inputs than desired actions, however. To train a deep network using errors defined in the input space would call for an algorithm that can propagate those errors forwards through the network, from input layer to output layer, in much the same way that activations are propagated. In this article, we present a novel learning algorithm which performs such ‘forward-propagation’ of errors. We demonstrate its performance, first in a simple line follower and then in a 1st person shooter game.",

Some effects of this abuse are observed in memory deficits, but the organism–environment interactions are poorly understood. We propose that studying environmental enrichment (EE) in animal models allows the elucidation of adaptive behavior mechanisms to face harmful effects, as well as plausible translational interventions; however, the effects of the different elements that comprise the complexity of EE must be determined. In this work, we measured the effects of housing under five environments for 4 weeks on memory impairments induced by the repeated administration of toluene in mice (4000 ppm, 30 min/day for 4 weeks). Recognition memory was recovered after housing in a complete enriched environment involving voluntary exercise with running wheels, cognitive stimulation with objects to explore, and social interaction. However, enrichment with only voluntary exercise in social conditions produced a significant memory recovery. In addition, EE in isolation showed fewer beneficial effects, while cognitive stimulation, even under social conditions, did not reverse the memory impairment by itself. We argue that physical exercise and social interaction could derive in cognitive enhancement and be used to advise on psychosocial interventions.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to successfully solve sequential decision problem. However, considering risk at the same time as the learning process is an open research problem. In this work, we are interested in the type of risk that can lead to a catastrophic state. Related works that aim to deal with risk propose complex models. In contrast, we follow a simple, yet effective, idea: similar states might lead to similar risk. Using this idea, we propose risk mapping by similarity (RMS), an algorithm for discrete scenarios which infers the risk of newly discovered states by analyzing how similar they are to previously known risky states. In general terms, the RMS algorithm transfers the knowledge gathered by the agent regarding the risk to newly discovered states. We contribute with a new approach to consider risk based on similarity and with RMS, which is simple and generalizable as long as the premise similar states yield similar risk holds. RMS is not an RL algorithm, but a method to generate a risk-aware reward shaping signal that can be used with a RL algorithm to generate risk-aware policies.",

For this purpose, coalition benefit criteria and three opinion formation models which extend the 2-state majority rule model on lattices are introduced. The proposed models focus on the coalition profit of its constituent coalition opinions and cover the possible final scenarios from coalition alliance perspective: either minor opinion or major opinion is favored, or dynamics do not favor to any coalition opinion. Opinion exchanges take place on a torus embedded lattice network of a 3-state system having in consideration tie configurations and two rules to break them: either by random choice or leaving ties unaltered. Models were analyzed in the statistical mechanics spirit through Monte Carlo simulations without node replacement. Estimations for coalition benefits, the growth of coalition ties, and consensus probabilities are reported. The loss of coalition strengths due to coalition ties and its indecision is indicated. In particular, the logistic decay of consensus probability is due to the logistic adaptive growth of coalition ties. Scaling behaviors for consensus time and coalition ties in terms of network size are suggested. The results of numerical simulations are discussed in the context of social influence and social dynamics.",

This emphasis on ‘purpose’ hides a host of assumptions about the nature of cognition and its relationship with physical activity. In particular, a notion of ‘purpose’ might assume that this is teleological which, in turn, requires a model of a desired end state of an action that can be projected onto the environment. Such a model is fundamental to traditional descriptions of cognition and a version of this can be found in the ‘template’ theory of stone-tool production (i.e. where the maker of the tool has a model in mind and attempts to reproduce this model in stone). Against this cognitive perspective, a number of approaches have been proposed that share their roots in the work of Gibson (i.e. ecological psychology) or Bernstein (i.e. dynamic systems). From these perspectives, ‘purpose’ is not a matter of a projection but opportunity; put simply, an action is performed until it need not be performed further. Trivial though this might sound, it has implications for how we define purpose and how this might apply to our understanding of tool use. We argue from a dynamic systems perspective and demonstrate the use of tools to crack bones for marrow extraction.",

Seven participants with traumatic spinal injury were selected to undergo learning in an adapted boat equipped with wind-measuring instrument. A learning program, defined by two conditions, (1) blocked practice and (2) random practice, was applied. In blocked schedule, fixed sequence of two maneuvers consist of tacking on a close-hauled course (45°–55°) and gybing on a broad reaching course (135°–145°). In random schedule, the same maneuvers were carried out randomly. Eight 30-min practice sessions were carried out over a period of 2 weeks, in 3 days per week. Velocity Made Good was analyzed in the familiarization test, pre-test, post-test, and retention test. The learning program was effective in both random and blocked practice conditions on all participants. However, there is an evident variability in the results. This study demonstrates the suitability of applying contextual interference to facilitate the learning of adapted sailing. The variability of the results could be related to the heterogeneity of the participants and suggests the need for further research that can provide information about how restricted mobility affects the learning process.",

Two strategies in particular, conformist and payoff-based social learning, have been subject to considerable theoretical analysis, yet previous models have tended to examine their efficacy in relation to specific parameters or circumstances. This study employs individual-based simulations to derive the optimal proportion of individual learning that coexists with conformist and payoff-based strategies in populations experiencing wide-ranging variation in levels of environmental change, reproductive turnover, learning error and individual learning costs. Results demonstrate that conformity coexists with a greater proportion of asocial learning under all parameter combinations, and that payoff-based social learning is more adaptive in 97.43% of such combinations. These results are discussed in relation to the conjecture that the most successful social learning strategy will be the one that can persist with the lowest frequency of asocial learning, and the possibility that punishment of non-conformists may be required for conformity to confer adaptive benefits over payoff-based strategies in temporally heterogeneous environments.",

The present work can be seen as an addition to a growing body of work that demonstrates the role of dynamic field theory as a bridge between low-level reactive approaches and high-level symbol processing mechanisms. The architecture is evaluated on a set of planning problems using a simulated e-puck robot, including analysis of the system’s behavior in response to noise and temporary blockages of the planned route. The system makes no explicit distinction between planning and execution phases, allowing continuous adaptation of the planned path. The proposed architecture exploits the dynamic field theory property of stability in relation to noise and changes in the environment. The neural dynamics are also exploited such that stay-or-switch action selection emerges where blockage of a planned path occurs; stay until the transient blockage is removed versus switch to an alternative route to the goal.",

    "abstract": "Eastern gray squirrels produce alarm calls—vocalizations used in the presence of danger that influence the behavior of some receivers. This influence is possible because the alarm calls’ rate, duration, and structure contain information about the threat and the caller. Gray squirrels’ mix of different structural call types (kuks and quaas) could contain information on potential internal influences within the squirrel. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ideal tools to investigate whether hidden states explain the frequencies of kuks versus quaas throughout an alarm call sequence. In this study, we compare the ability of an iid (independent and identically distributed) model and two- to six-state HMMs to represent observed sequences of kukking, quaaing, and periods of silence. Audio recordings of 44 gray squirrels were collected and the first 30 s of each alarm call sequence was coded based on spectrograms. A number of HMMs were fitted, and the overall fit of the observed sequences to each model was assessed using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Monte Carlo methods. The five-state HMM fit the observed call frequencies better than the other models, suggesting that the squirrels’ alarm calling sequences are influenced by a more complex temporal sequencing of acoustic units.",

Also, we modulated the network after the optimization process based on the computational theory of classical conditioning and the reinforcement learning algorithm for the adaptation to environmental changes. This adaptation was implemented by separated modules that implement the “innate” term and “acquired” term of outputs. The modulated network exhibited behaviors that were similar to those of real toads.

We report here some experimental confirmations of this prediction, using the social display system of male Siamese fighting fish, in which afterdischarge is visually observable. A mirror was presented and removed, to elicit social display followed by display afterdischarge. A CS object was presented just as the afterdischarge faded. After 10 to 12 such pairings, the CS shown alone elicited display. The model, however, also predicts that no excitatory conditioning should occur to a CS presented near the beginning of a long afterdischarge. This arrangement and an unpaired CS condition were used as controls, and the prediction was confirmed. However, the model further suggests that a CS presented at the beginning of an afterdischarge should show excitatory conditioning if the display afterdischarge could be artificially shortened so that the CS presentation would come just before the end of the afterdischarge. In a second experiment, the CS was presented immediately after mirror removal, and then afterdischarge was ended by feeding the fighting fish a guppy. Since the CS now predicted the arrival of food as well as the end of the afterdischarge, we depressed conditioned feeding responses by food-satiating the fish before presenting the CS alone. Display conditioning was confirmed. Controls were included for the effects of feeding.",

Other behaviors such as obstacle negotiation and risk taking emerge naturally from the creature's interaction with the environment.

We recently developed a novel control framework for 3D bipedal walking that we call “linear reactive control.” It is linear because control torques are computed as simple weighted sums of sensor states. It is reactive because it depends only on the model’s current state. The present simulation study shows that this controller performs reliably in the presence of realistic models of joint actuation, sensor noise, and uncertainty in model and contact parameters. The controller is able to maintain a stable gait in the presence of noisy sensor inputs and low-impedance actuation. It also performs reliably on models with high uncertainty (up to 20%) in measurements of their dynamic parameters and widely varying ground contact parameters. The robustness of this controller to realistic conditions validates this method as a promising avenue for bipedal control.",

    "abstract": "This work presents biologically inspired engineering on the use of narrowband sonar in mobile robotics. It replicates, using robotics as a modeling medium, elements of how CF-FM bats process the constant frequency part of their emitted call for estimating Doppler shift in the echoes. The experimental platform for the work is RoBat, a 6-DOF biomimetic sonar head mounted on a 3-DOF mobile platform. Two models of the signal processing performed by the bat's cochlea were implemented, based on sets of bandpass filters followed by full-wave rectification and lowpass filtering. One filter bank uses Butterworth filters whose center frequencies vary linearly across the set. The alternative filter bank uses gammatone filters, with center frequencies varying nonlinearly across the set. Two methods of estimating Doppler shift from the return echoes after cochlear signal processing were implemented. The first was a simple energy-weighted average of filter center frequencies. The second was a novel neural-network-based technique. Each method was tested with each of the cochlear models and evaluated in the context of several dynamic tasks in which RoBat was moved at different velocities toward stationary echo sources such as walls and posts. Overall, the performance of the linear filter bank was more consistent than the gammatone. The same applies to the artificial neural network, with consistently better noise performance than the weighted average. The effect of multiple reflectors contained in a single echo was also analyzed in terms of error in Doppler-shift estimation assuming a single wider reflector.",

    "abstract": "Characteristic sex differences in mating strategies (e.g., choosy females, unselective males) have been claimed by Trivers and other theorists to evolve as an automatic consequence of sex differences in minimum parental investment, arising chiefly from greater female reproductive refractoriness. The theory has been supported by correlational evidence and conceptual analogies to economics. A simulated evolution experiment was performed to provide a clearer test of whether female reproductive refractoriness alone can drive the emergence of differences in mating selectivity. A population of male and female replicators initially differed only in that females were unavailable to mate for a fixed period prior to the appearance of offspring. Over succeeding generations, females evolved far greater selectivity than males with respect to the longevity of potential mates. This greater selectivity was relatively robust with respect to population and genetic parameters, but quantitatively unstable with realistic breeding population sizes.",

Here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment. Environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions. Given some task, we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t+ dt, s+ ds, a+ da. Discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy. Discounted reward schemes are incorporated naturally by taking the Laplace transform of the equations. The Liouville machine quickly solves rather complex maze problems.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel adaptive competitive self-organizing (ACS) model, with applicability for real-time clustering and vector quantization. An important feature of this model is its dynamic structure and self-adjusting parameters that also offers a solution to the problem of parasitic limit points and consequently in more accurate label assignments. This unsupervised classifier is free of any external control mechanism. Its self-organizing (SO) dynamic is governed by the gradient descent (GD) theory in cooperation with a competition mechanism based on Lotka–Volterra competitive exclusion. The core algorithm of this classifier is based on developing an energy function, where its minima or equilibrium points correspond to the centroid of similar input patterns. Since this energy function is a form of Lyapunov function, it guarantees stabilization of the dynamical trajectories of labels in finite numbers of isolated equilibrium points. This energy function along with other control parameter functions, then, will be the base for the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the overall dynamic of our system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed ACS model is demonstrated by implementing it on both real and artificial data sets as well as comparing with other well-known clustering methods. ACS method showed a better clustering performance in some categories and an overall comparable rendition.",

Forty-two volunteers aged 18–22 years old were placed in three groups of pre-training, post-training, and control. In the pre-training group, Mu (8–12 Hz) amplitude was suppressed at C4 before the motor skill training, while the participants in the post-training group were instructed to increase theta (4–8 Hz) amplitude at Pz and immediately after motor skill training. After the training session, the subjects participated in retention tests at approximately 90 min, 24 h, and 1 week after training. The results showed that the pre-training group performed better in the first retention test (p = 0.002). Nevertheless, this superiority was not maintained in subsequent retention tests, where no difference was observed between the groups. Mu amplitude suppression before training led to more beneficial effect on learning of a new motor skill, even though it was not so effective over time. However, it appears that the inhibition of Mu amplitude in the motor cortex and subsequent higher excitability can effect motor skill acquisition.",

Eight psychosomatic and extended cognitive functions working as an interactive whole are proposed to constitute self-consciousness: (1) somatic domain and body image; (2) situation and domestic range; (3) agency and power to act; (4) introspection, mindfulness, and metacognition; (5) first person discourse and appropriation; (6) episodic memory, autobiography, and role; (7) attribution and alterity; (8) conscience, moral consciousness, and ethical stance. These functions, complemented with considerations about depersonalization and selflessness, are briefly defined and described. These subsystems may work independently but they may interact and variably coalesce according to the demands of the task. Since self-awareness would require a dynamic swarm-like activation pattern of the cluster, the self does not reside in particular brain sites or networks but depends on top-down and bottom-up mechanisms coupled with incoming and outgoing sensory-motor data loops. This psychophysical theory avoids the swing between internal and external elements in favor of an embracing I-World patterned process that comprises neural, bodily, behavioral, environmental, and social dimensions converging in the construction and expression of self-conscious and personal identity experiences integrated by a participant brain.",

From this perspective, several studies have considered variable compliant actuation to change the physical characteristics of the robot as it interacts with the environment. Robots with this ability show a variety of efficient stable motions during contact with the environment. However, having locally variable compliant parts with independent dynamics under the same body may be insufficient for achieving adaptability in diverse environments. To extend the idea of variable compliant actuation, from being used locally to the level of the entire body’s dynamics, in this study, we use an actuator network system (ANS). As an approximation of bipedal robots, we developed an eight-legged rimless wheel robot with an ANS that allows energy transfer among limbs through passive interactions among mutually interconnected air cylinders mounted on the robot’s legs. We experimentally demonstrated that by using the ANS to realize energy transfer among limbs, the robot performance improved.",

An individual whose mouth is open in the presence of food is 'fed' and gains points; an individual who fails to hide when a predator is present is 'hurt' by losing points. Opening mouths, hiding, and making sounds each exact an energy cost. There is no direct evolutionary gain for acts of cooperation or 'successful communication' per se. In such an environment we start with a spatialized array of neural nets with randomized weights. Using standard learning algorithms, our individuals 'train up' on the behavior of successful neighbors at regular intervals.

Evolution and maintenance of cooperation are possible by a combination of multiple mechanisms including reciprocity, which in primates and particularly in humans is largely dependent on memory and the ability to exchange social information, a function of language. In this article, we present a multi-agent model developed with the aim of evaluating the importance of memory in cognitive and social adaptations for cooperation based on reciprocity when populations are under ecological stress.

    "abstract": "This article tries to offer a different perspective on the issue of what it means for some physical structure to be a representation. In the first sections, it will be shown how and why this issue is still far from settled. This will be done by emphasizing the—what I will call—metaphysically promiscuous character of representation. For although representations are typically assumed to be some sort of physical objects or structures, on closer inspection, the notion of representation is used in such a variety of ways that its fundamental metaphysical status is far from obvious. Proceeding from these observations, it will be argued that, even though “representation” pre-theoretically indeed often picks out objects, their representational status is best not understood in terms of their physical properties or their causal-functional profile. It will be argued that, what it means for some physical structure to be—as a matter of fact—a representation, only first becomes intelligible in relation to certain socio-normative practices in which the cognitive capacity to relate to something as something it is not is prescriptively called upon. Moreover, an answer to the oft-heard question of what makes something (i.e., some physical object or structure) a representation is readily available, provided we take into account certain cognitive abilities, as well as a socio-normative context in which these abilities are normatively regulated. It will be concluded that at the fundamental metaphysical level, the phenomenon of representation is best understood as a triadic relation which involves, but does not reduce to, certain physical objects or structures. Finally, this socio-normative account of representation will be compared with two dominant notions of representation within cognitive science: symbolic representation and S-representation.",

In neurorobotic, the common approach is to reproduce cognitive phenomena with multiple levels of bio-inspiration into robotic scenarios.

The experimental context consists in a visual learning task solved through an operant conditioning procedure. Results suggest that the proposed neural architecture sustains both behaviors, switching from one to the other by external cues.

The goal of those satellite sessions was to bring together a community of researchers from different fields who had interests in the evolution of cultural complexity. This special issue includes three papers that grew out of those workshops and one paper that was solicited. Each brings a unique perspective on myriad issues that surround how and why culture evolves. One issue that is key to understanding the evolution of cultural complexity—and it is addressed in the papers included here—is how humans learn and transmit information and the rate at which it is learned and transmitted.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I aim to elucidate minimality in cooperation by drawing on a previously developed multi-dimensional approach to cooperation. This approach provides a useful framework to locate any cooperative phenomenon at a specific point on the continua of different dimensions. That point, in turn, determines the criteria for a particular cooperative phenomenon to emerge. Thus, on one hand, the analysis provides a contribution to the philosophical debate on minimal cooperation by elucidating different kinds of minimalism in cooperation that are characterized by the lowest point of the continua of either dimension, including (1) cognitive minimalism, (2) behavioural minimalism, (3) affective minimalism, (4) social minimalism and (5) contextual minimalism. On the other hand, it facilitates the dialogue among disciplines insofar as it helps determining whether the skills and capacities that are required for particular cooperative activities (e.g. cooperative games like the Joint Simon task or the prisoner’s dilemma) are not only present in typically developing individuals but also individuals with developmental disorders like autism. Drawing on an externalist/internalist distinction, the analysis shows that high-functioning individuals with autism perform particularly well in cooperative activities that amount to externalism and are highly defined by an institutional context, social rules and regularities as well as the roles of the agents.",

The robots implement an abstract model of embodied iterated social learning in which the forms evolve due to limited perceptual abilities of the robots during multiple learning cycles. It is shown that shared chunks that consisted of similar movement sequences emerge in the learned forms, and as these emergent shared sequences can be learned with high accuracy, they cause a cumulative increase in the learnability of the collections. Therefore, we are able to present robotic experiments in which embodied learning on robots leads to combinatorial structure as a result of cultural interactions in the form of iterated learning without a communicative task.",

Experiments in classical conditioning show that animals such as rabbits, pigeons, and dogs can make long temporal associations that enable multi-step prediction. To replicate this remarkable ability, an agent must construct an internal state representation that summarizes its interaction history. Recurrent neural networks can automatically construct state and learn temporal associations. However, the current training methods are prohibitively expensive for online prediction—continual learning on every time step—which is the focus of this paper. Our proposed problems test the learning capabilities that animals readily exhibit and highlight the limitations of the current recurrent learning methods. While the proposed problems are nontrivial, they are still amenable to extensive testing and analysis in the small-compute regime, thereby enabling researchers to study issues in isolation, ultimately accelerating progress towards scalable online representation learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Learning is a major determinant of behavioral change for some organisms through their lifecycles. From an associative perspective, learning is assumed to occur whenever organisms experience particular statistical regularities in their environment; specifically, meaningful outcomes that follow certain cues or actions chiefly contribute to behavioral change. However, numerous empirical reports reveal that not all cue–outcome and action–outcome combinations are learned equally well, a phenomenon that is termed belongingness. Those reports are valuable as descriptive-level knowledge, but beg further considerations, like what is the origin, adaptive value of, and underlying mechanisms associated with the predisposition to couple particular events. Contrary to what is often assumed, the mere observation of learning predispositions says little as to whether they arise from genetics, are constrained by hardwired neural circuitries, or have been ecologically advantageous in an evolutionary timescale. The present paper aims to present a number of notions from different research fields outside the hard core of associative learning and, in so doing, provides elements for careful study and conceptualization of this issue. Thereafter, these notions are pooled to understand behavioral variation in a wide array of phenomena, thus, bringing a more informed approach to the nature versus nurture debate.",

In this paper, I develop an alternative to both views, which focuses not on the processes in the animal’s head, but on the sociomaterial processes that animals are in and that organize their ongoing activities. Instead of an individual trying to predict the behaviour of another individual based on inferential abilities, the animal is responsive to affordances and how they are nested within the sociomaterial processes that make up the environment. I argue that this depiction of animal social cognition is preferable, because it is allows us to understand the social abilities of nonhuman animals free from our current understanding of human social cognition.",

Moreover, benefits from the CRP are often compared among decision-makers, which raises fairness issues. Given these, this paper comprehensively considers these two factors in linguistic GDM modeling. Aiming at the problem of multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) under distributed linguistic assessment (DLA) information, a two-stage group consensus model that considers psychological behaviors with fairness concern is proposed. Subsequently, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are illustrated by a case of selecting emergency material warehouses related to urban flood disasters. The main innovations and contributions of this paper are as follows. (a) The psychology of individual fairness concern is integrated into the MAGDM process with DLA information. (b) The DLA-based two-stage group consensus model, including the first-stage consensus model with maximum fairness satisfaction degree and the second-stage consensus model with minimum cost, is developed. Compared with the existing consensus models for distributed linguistic MAGDM, the proposed consensus model can not only improve the consensus level on the opinions with minimum cost but also promote the fairness satisfaction degree of decision-makers.",

We prove that, unlike standard models of Reinforcement Learning, Temporal Difference in particular, VGL is guaranteed to converge to optimality under certain conditions. The core of the proof is the mathematical equivalence of VGL and Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle, a well-known optimization technique in systems and control theory. Given the similarity between VGL’s formulation and regulatory models of behavior, we argue that our algorithm may provide psychologists with a tool to formulate such models in optimization terms.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a model of the evolution of reflexive primate signals that incorporates a realistic vocal tract model for generating the signals. Signaler neural networks receive signal types as inputs and produce vocal tract muscle activations as outputs. These muscle activations are input to a model of the primate vocal tract, generating real sounds. Receiver neural networks receive spectrograms of these sounds as inputs and produce signal type classifications as outputs. Incorporating a realistic vocal tract has a substantial effect on the types of signals that can evolve. Compared to a model with abstract signals, the realistic model signals are more similar and have more correlated elements. The realistic, embodied model also exhibits more variability in rate of adaptation, usually adapting more slowly. This may be explained by the more jagged fitness landscapes in the realistic model. The realistic signals also tend to be quiet. Environmental noise results in louder signals but makes the evolutionary process even slower and less robust. These results indicate that signal evolution with a more realistic genotype–phenotype mapping can differ substantially from evolution with abstract signals. Including realistic signal generation mechanisms may enable computational models to provide greater insights into natural signal evolution.",

In this work, this problem is addressed, using evolutionary algorithms, and modeling phenomena such as kin selection and kin discrimination in a biologically plausible way. We also used self-organizing maps to analyze the behavior of these populations during the evolutionary process, within the solution space. We believe that this approach can shed light on the predictive power of the Hamilton rule, the importance of kin selection in the evolution of altruistic behaviors, and how self-organizing maps can allow us to observe the different solutions in which the evolutionary algorithm converges through time.",

The experiment reported here used a transfer of calibration paradigm to investigate this hypothesis as well as the more specific hypothesis that the object of calibration is independent of the sensitivity of a given anatomical component to the particulars of a given energy form. In a pretest and posttest, participants perceived the distance of an occluded surface by two different modalities—by exploring that surface with a wooden rod and by doing so with and Enactive Torch, a vibrotactile sensory-substitution device. In a practice session, we manipulated which modality participants used to perform this task (Rod or Enactive Torch) and whether feedback about performance was provided. We found that, when feedback was provided during the practice session, recalibration of perception of surface distance transferred from the rod to the Enactive Torch, and vice versa. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that the object of calibration in this perceptual task is (potentially) independent of the particular form of mechanical energy generated when exploring the surface.",

Our particular goal is to study the influence of learning on the evolution of sensors, with learning duration being the tunable parameter. A genetic algorithm governs the evolution of sensors appropriate for the agent solving a simple grid world task. The performance of the agent is taken as fitness; ‘sensors’ are conceived as a map from environmental states to agent observations, and individual adaptation is modeled by Q-learning. Our experimental results show that due to the principles of cognitive economy learning and varying the degree thereof actually transforms the fitness landscape. In particular we identify a trade-off between learning speed (load) and sensor accuracy (error). These results are further reinforced by theoretical analysis: we derive an analytical measure for the quality of sensors based on the mutual entropy between the system of states and the selection of an optimal action, a concept recently proposed by Polani, Martinetz, and Kim.",

This explanation is based on the fact that in these, and many other relat ed studies, real-valued neural network outputs are thresholded to provide discrete actions. The effect of such thresholding produces a particular type of fitness landscape in which lifetime learn ing can reduce the deleterious effects of mutation, and therefore increase mean population fitness.",

    "abstract": "Lizards have strong directional hearing across a broad band of frequencies. The directionality can be attributed to the acoustical properties of the ear, especially the strong acoustical coupling of the two eardrums. The peripheral auditory system of the lizard has previously been modeled in bilaterally symmetric form and several types of bilaterally asymmetric models have also been considered. Both in simulation by software and experiment with a mobile robot, the symmetric model shows a strong phonotaxis while asymmetric models show frequency-dependent direction errors determined by the type and magnitude of their intrinsic bias. To attain effective directional hearing, the bias in the peripheral system should be compensated. In this article, with the peripheral models, we design a decision model and a behavior model, a virtual robot, to simulate the auditory system of the lizard in software. The decision model is trained using three alternative training algorithms, which are evaluated and compared using experimental testing. The results demonstrate that the trained decision model is able to compensate for the frequency-dependent direction errors generated by the asymmetric peripheral models. With both symmetric and asymmetric peripheral models, the robot shows consistent and effective phonotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Many cyclic movements of vertebrates are produced by a rhythm generator in the spinal cord, which is often referred to as the central pattern generator. Meanwhile, higher centers, such as the cerebellum, are also involved in motor control. In this study, we discuss the control and learning mechanisms of these two control systems, focusing on the following problems: (1) how these two control systems generate a motor command cooperatively without conflict, and (2) how these control systems acquire motor commands. As a possible model to solve these problems, we propose a hierarchical motor control learning model on the basis of physiological knowledge. This model assumes that the higher center learns the timing and amplitude of a motor command and sends control signals to the rhythm generator. The rhythm generator is tuned by the control signals and acquires the ability to output a motor command to realize a target motion. By applying this model to a simulation experiment of the learning control of a one-dimensional hopping robot, hopping at a desired height was successful. Our simulation results also show that a multiple control system involving the higher center and rhythm generator is more robust than a single control system.",

    "abstract": "It is healthy, I believe, to periodically examine the way in which a field’s activity is supposed to be valuable, both internally, to those within the field itself, but also externally to the wider scientific community in which it is embedded, and ultimately society at large. Otherwise, there may be a tendency for modes or styles of work to lock in and be perpetuated uncritically. However, it is clear that such a process of critique must take care with how it defines what counts as valuable. If the definition is cast too close to the community being examined, there is a risk of swallowing a motivating story that may perhaps be internally consistent and widely accepted within the community, but does not survive scrutiny from a more critical perspective. Eugenic science might be cited as an example. Its value relies on subscribing to a set of background assumptions that should themselves be part of any critique. On the other hand, the value of many scientific activities would be difficult to discern from too remote a vantage point. What exactly is the value to future generations of investing in the study of a particular mollusk, for instance? Here, Webb’s sights are trained on the “synthetic methodology,” and in particular a specific sub-community involved in building systems that are intended to shed light on biological questions. Consequently the sense of value that Webb is concerned with is largely derived from the aims of biological science, which seems fair enough. However, I believe that there is a problem in the scoping here, which I will return to below. In large part, however, I am in agreement with Webb’s line of argument and the useful distinctions that she makes between different motivating stories that can be found throughout the ALife and adaptive behavior literatures. I share her sense that the things being built should be thought of as models, and that they are therefore models of something. This mindset should always make us wary of systems that are presented as artificial worlds worthy of study for their own sake—free-floating models that have been disconnected from the target systems that they were originally motivated by. I agree that the animats built by the community under consideration, whether simulations or fabrications, do instantiate or represent hypotheses about nature, and that, as such, their value is intimately tied up in which hypotheses are represented and to what end. Where animat behavior challenges our ideas in a way that can be empirically tested, it is, or should be, taking part in a scientific cycle of theory– hypothesis–experiment–theory (Di Paolo, Noble, & Bullock, 2000). However, I do not agree with the repeated assertion running through the article that the biological relevance of a model must be cashed out in terms of whether or not it speaks to the properties of a specific animal or species. This position seems to reflect Webb’s own interests in biological mechanisms. How does it manifest itself? In the abstract: “Animat simulations ... represent hypotheses about ... animals”. Later: “But if the results of animat models are to be relevant to biology, then ultimately some claim about the physical mechanisms of real animals must be asserted.” (sec. 4.2). This idea leads Webb to assume that because Beer claims that his work “has important implications for our understanding of perception” it must also be the case that “empirical claims are being made about the world on the basis of the model results” (sec. 3.5). I think this move is made too quickly and is overly narrow.",

There are, however, many roads to biological relevance, including but not limited to the close targeting of models to specific animals. Moreover, models which deliberately depart from close targeting can have biological relevance precisely because of their departures.",

    "abstract": "Webb distinguishes two endeavors she calls animal modeling and animat modeling and advocates for the former. I share her preference and point to additional virtues of modeling actual biological mechanisms (animal modeling). As Webb argues, animat modeling should be regarded as modeling of specific, but madeup, biological mechanisms. I contend that modeling made-up mechanisms in situations in which we have some knowledge of the actual mechanisms involved is modeling with one hand—the good one—tied behind one’s back. The hand that is used in animat modeling is constructing and evaluating models by whether they behave in the right way—do they exhibit the particular phenomenon one is trying to understand? The good hand that is disavowed seeks to use evidence about the mechanism employed in real living systems both for inspiration in designing the model and for evaluating the model. Denying oneself use of one’s good hand both limits one’s access to valuable evidence for evaluating a model and denies oneself access to a potent discovery strategy. Webb draws attention to one reason to employ the good hand—if models are to be relevant to biology (and not just characterize hypothetical mechanisms), then the component parts and operations specified in the model must in some way map onto those in actual biological organisms. Especially if one accepts the possibility of multiple realizations, then if one only uses behavior to evaluate the model one may well have described an alternative realization than that found in real organisms. To determine that one has modeled the actual realization, it is necessary to compare the proposed mechanism with the actual mechanism—does it consist of the same parts, operations, and organization. I have argued elsewhere (Bechtel & Mundale, 1999) that multiple realization is highly suspect if we demand that alternative realizations be compared at the same fine-grain of behavioral detail as employed in claiming that the realizations are actually different. If there is only one realization once we are rigorous in evaluating behavioral equivalence, then models of made-up mechanisms that meet the behavioral test will also correspond to models of actual systems. In fact, however, researchers typically work with a much coarser-grained analysis of the phenomenon to be explained, and in such circumstances the plausibility of mechanisms with very different design generating the same phenomena increases significantly. If the goal is nonetheless to produce models that correspond to actual mechanisms, the sooner we release the good hand and start to use it, the sooner we will arrive at realistic models. Many animat modelers, however, reject the assumption that the goal is to produce models that correspond to specific actual mechanisms. They advocate instead the importance of idealized or general models—models that represent the breadth of biological possibility not the specific realizations studied in actual biology. Webb correctly notes that in any modeling of a mechanism, specific assumptions are made about the mechanism. She then questions what makes a made-up mechanism more general than an actual mechanism. This is an important issue and raises a broader question about the nature of generalization in the life sciences. In philosophy, generalization is usually assumed to take the form of universally quantified statements",

Such behavior does not serve their self-interest, as they are foregoing opportunities to exploit others without any negative consequences. Hence, it is not clear how this behavior could have evolved. Some previous explanations invoked the existence of other-regarding preferences, moral motivation, or intrinsic concern for social norms. In this study, we develop an agent-based model illustrating that none of these is necessary for the emergence of norm-abiding behavior. Our model suggests evolutionary pressure against norm violators may lead to the emergence of a bias, causing agents to be extremely sensitive to the probability of being caught. Because of this, they often incorrectly classify anonymous situations as non-anonymous ones and obey social norms due to the fear of being punished. In our simulations, we show that cooperation is promoted by (1) the number of interactions actually observed, (2) the strength of punishments against norm violators, and most importantly, (3) the uncertainty in agent classifications.",

We propose a method where morphological plasticity is achieved through learning during individual’s lifetime allowing each individual to quickly adapt its morphology to the current environment. We show that the resulting plasticity allows evolution of creatures better adapted to different simulated environments. We also show that evolution combined with the new learning rule reduces the total computational cost required to evolve an individual with a given target fitness compared to evolution without learning.",

We provide one answer by exploiting an understanding of data and models on mirror neurons to extend a prior neurocomputational model of list learning by macaques, SCP1, which addressed results of the simultaneous chaining paradigm (SCP) to yield a new model, SCP2, that addresses social facilitation (observational learning) effects based on the SCP. SCP2 extends SCP1 by adding action-recognition elements and (vicarious) reward-processing elements to facilitate performance following observation of a demonstrator. Our simulations suggest prior experience is important for the observed facilitation and serves to bridge the (separately collected) neurophysiological and behavioral data. Crucially, the inner workings of SCP1, as distinct from its successful performance on the SCP dataset, are irrelevant. What is crucial is the “wrapping” of the “do it alone” model to support social facilitation. This study provides an example of dyadic brain modeling, simulating brain models of interacting agents, in the case in which the behavior of only one member of the dyad is affected by the behavior of the other.",

As is well known, many natural and man-made systems are complex networks where, besides network topology, node activity states also play an important role in determining system performance. For example, a collaborative project involving friends is more likely to succeed than one involving enemies, even though the topology of network organization is the same. The concept of CSD can quantitatively distinguish the difference between the involvement of friends and the involvement of enemies. This article reports a simulation study on the adaptive behaviors of nodes based on the selfish rule and the following-others rule, and the simulation results show that based on such adaptive behaviors of nodes, a network system will automatically evolve to a high level of system consilience. The simulation study also demonstrates that a high level of system consilience resulting from adaptive behaviors will contribute to increased system resistance to external disturbances. The generality of adaptive behaviors in reality implies that CSD is an inherent attribute of real-world network systems, and therefore, the concept of CSD has significant application potential in the study of adaptive behaviors in network systems.",

We are broadly in sympathy with the perspective Beer espouses, but we want to invite the author to take one more step and join us in seeing his work as leading to consequences that are even more radical than those reached in his paper. A central part of Beer’s paper is his rejection of representationalism; that is, he rejects the idea that cognition consists of the manipulation of symbolic internal representations. It is important to note that representationalism is just one aspect of a bigger and older idea, namely internalism, the belief that cognition is something that goes on inside the head. Our thesis in brief is that Beer might as well go all the way and reject internalism in all its guises. Beer seems to take for granted the following dilemma: either higher-level, agent-based explanations (those that use concepts such as cognition, knowledge, meaning, etc.) should be reducible to explanations in terms of internal, representational mechanisms, or such higher level descriptions can be dispensed with in favour of dynamical explanations of the coupled brain-body-environment system.

The acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum has previously been shown to use stored information about negative stimuli. Here, we repeatedly exposed the slime mould to three stimuli with differing levels of potential risk: light, salt and lavender. We asked if the slime mould would change its foraging behaviour depending on the level of risk. In our experiment, taking risk yielded better food. We consistently selected individuals that made the same foraging decision (accepting risk or avoiding risk) over multiple trials. Hence, the same individuals were tested over a period of time, but only individuals that continued to make the same decision were allowed to continue. Regardless of selection regime, slime moulds in the light became more likely to select the food in the light over time, while those exposed to salt became more salt averse. Lavender had no effect. Our results can cautiously be interpreted as examples of non-associative learning, adding to a growing body of work showing that the absence of a central nervous system is no impediment to possessing sophisticated information processing.",

    "abstract": "Vision did not arise and evolve merely so that individuals might \"see\" things but rather so that they might act on and interact with their habitat. Thus it might be misleading to study vision without looking also at its natural coupling to vital action. Here we investigate this problem in a simulation study of the simplest kind of visually guided foraging by a species of two-dimensional hypothetical animal called the (diurnal) paddler. In a previous study, we developed a hypothetical animal called the archaepaddler, which used positive phototaxis to forage for autoluminescent prey in a totally dark environment (the deep sea). Here we discuss possible visual mechanisms that allow (diurnal) paddlers to live in shallower water, foraging for light-reflecting prey in ambient light. The modification consists of two stages. In the first stage, Weber adaptation compresses the retinal illumination into an acceptable range of neural firing frequencies. In the second stage, high-pass filtering with lateral inhibition separates background responses from foreground responses. We report on a number of parameter studies conducted with the foraging diurnal paddler, in which the influence of dark-light adaptation and lateral inhibition on foreground-background segregation and foraging performance (\"fitness\") are quantified. It is shown that the paddler can survive adequately for a substantial range of parameters that compromises between discarding as much unwanted visual (background) information as possible and retaining as much information on potential prey as possible. Parameter values that optimize purely visual performance, such as foreground-background segregation, are not always optimal for foraging performance, and vice versa. This article shows that studies of vision might indeed require more serious consideration of the goals of vision and the ethogram of the studied organisms than has been customary.",

There are many open questions when trying to envision the future of architecture; but, in this particular workshop, the goal was not only to imagine the future but also to create it. With this particular goal in mind, the Living Architecture workshop at European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL) 2017 brought together practitioners from the sciences and architecture to share ideas and technologies to examine possible paths forward. Living Architecture is a specific substantiation of the broader notion of Living Technology where living systems or artificial systems with life-like properties are developed towards technological applications. In Living Architecture, objects designed in the built environment would contain living systems as part of their functionality (such as bioreactors for energy) or artificial distributed systems with feedback loops (such as neural networks or artificial intelligence). In this way, Living Architecture represents a congruence in functionality and form between living systems, technology and architecture.",

    "abstract": "Discussions about intersubjectivity can be traced back to philosophical discussions of the 19th century. In recent years, disciplines such as neuroscience, social cognition, and phenomenology have discussed “empathy” in terms of the ability for human connection. More recently, researchers are discussing the definition of empathy, especially the relationship between empathy and the motivation to seek another’s well-being. In this discussion, psychological theories conceived empathy as a factor of prosocial behavior. Other researchers such as Bloom consider empathy as an unfit moral guide, while yet others attempt to remove the caring condition from the equation of empathy. In this article, we aim to contribute to the discussion on empathy discussions by analyzing lynching, a form of collective violence sometimes seen in the South American context. We suggest that lynching, as well as other phenomena of collective violence, presents specific challenges for the conceptualization of empathy, and that those challenges could be tackled from the perspective of “4E cognition.”",

Once it is deprived of its representational tinsels, intentionality appears to us again as a property of object-directedness. Nevertheless, is the autopoietic model of intentionality as object-directedness coherent and convincing?

Characterizing a simple decision strategy has always seemed straightforward, and the debate around the simplicity of the take-the-best heuristic is mostly concerned with a proper specification of the heuristic. I argue that the predominate conceptions of “simplicity” and “frugality” need to be revised. To this end, a number of recent behavioral and neuroscientific results are discussed. The example of take-the-best heuristic serves as an entry point to a foundational debate on bounded agency. I argue that the fast and frugal heuristics needs to question some of its legacy from the classical AI research. For example, the assumption that the bottleneck of decision-making process is information processing due to its serial nature. These commitments are hard to reconcile with the modern neuroscientific view of a human decision-maker. In addition, I discuss an overlooked source of uncertainty, namely neural noise, and compare a generic heuristic model to a similar neural algorithm.",

Consequently, pharmacological interventions aim to increase serotonin concentration in its target areas or stimulating excitatory 5HT receptors. A standard approach is to use serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which cause a higher accumulation of serotonin. Another approach is to stimulate excitatory serotonin receptors with psychedelic drugs. This article compares these two approaches by first setting up a system-level limbic system model of the relevant brain areas and then modelling a delayed reward paradigm which is known to be disrupted by a lack of 5HT. Central to our model is how serotonin changes the response characteristics of decision-making neurons where low levels of 5HT allow small signals to pass through, whereas high levels of 5HT create a barrier for smaller signals but amplifying the larger ones. We show with both standard behavioural simulations and model checking that SSRIs perform significantly better against interventions with psychedelics. However, psychedelics might work better in other paradigms where a high level of exploration is beneficial to obtain rewards.",

This year’s edition emphasized the human–human interactions in which human–robot interactions are embedded. On this background participants addressed essential themes such as robots’ agency, gestures, speech, and likeness to humans and the program featured expert lectures, practical workshops, and analysis sessions, fostering an interdisciplinary approach to learning. The successful integration of educational content and community building was evident in the positive testimonials, highlighting the importance of in-person exchanges and the combination of diverse views for progress in HRI research. This paper reflects on the accomplishments of the summer school, illustrating how it became a crucible for thought leadership and collaborative innovation in the HRI space.",

    "abstract": "A core issue of embodiment is the question of how phenomenal and agentive consciousness relates to external forms of behavior. Instead of biasing the question in terms of the “hard problem” as to why and how consciousness arises from brain processes (D. Chalmers), it is suggested to ask for psychophysical correlations in a metaphysically neutral way. This, however, demands (1) to explore both sides of the problem with equivalent precision and depth—not only the physical—and (2) to develop a metaphysically neutral tool to formalize them in a consistent way. Concerning (1), the basic structure of mental micro-activities found in first-person studies on cognitive processes suggests extending the scope of qualia as a mark of consciousness. In the context of Structure Phenomenology (H. Witzenmann), functionally negative phenomenality experienced in ambiguous or meaning-deprived situations and inner agentive qualia of mental activities are correlated with the decompositional signature of sensory-neural processing and synchronized neural oscillations. Concerning (2), G. Günther’s Transclassical Logic is briefly introduced and deployed to integrate the mental, psychophysical, and physical contextures in a three-valued formal framework which also includes enacted and embodied aspects. The emerging picture rebalances first-person and third-person aspects of cognition by functionally separating and dynamically integrating them, thus revitalizing the neurophenomenological research agenda with new experimental proposals and concrete hypotheses.",

Hyperscanning findings seem to point to the fact that synchronized interbrain activity may be caused by cooperative social interaction, showing that traditionally dominant perspectives about the mind‒brain relation (in particular, supervenience and internalism regarding mental contents) should be revised or replaced by others that adequately integrate the influence of human interactions on the neurobiological underpinnings of cognition (e.g., contextual emergence, externalism regarding mental contents, 4E cognition). This shift would undeniably also have important implications in the fields of mental health (e.g., opening avenues for the design of diagnoses and treatments for social skill conditions) and the social sciences (regarding aspects such as sociocultural interplay, collective decision-making and public participation, social conflict and polarization, interpersonal curiosity, and autonomy).",

    "abstract": "In an article from 2023, Tom Froese suggests Irruption Theory as a new conceptual framework for understanding the causal efficacy of normative states, particularly concerning motivations for action in embodied agents. Froese’s theory is built on three central tenets, two of which—the Irruption and Scalability theses—are central to its claim that normative states causally affect behavior via the creation and amplification of the microscopic, stochastic processes after which the theory is named. According to Froese, this amplification process explains why agential behavior is underdetermined by its material basis, creating a causal gap that can be filled by causally-efficacious normative states. In this commentary, I argue that the Irruption and Scalability theses do not give a sufficiently detailed account of how underdetermination arises in material systems and how the scaling-up of irruptions causally affects normative behavior. However, the theses should not be rejected outright. Rather, I argue that Irruption Theory should adopt central concepts from complex systems theory in order to adequately describe the causal efficacy of normativity in embodied agents. To this end, I suggest that it should identify normative states as relations holding between embodied agents and similar-scale systems in their environment. These relations can be usefully described and modeled as topologies of a large-scale agent-environment system that top-down constrain an agent’s behavior. Accordingly, I propose interpreting irruptions as a boundary condition for normative behavior, with normative states as one of its control parameters (237 words).",

The methodology decomposes a given root strategy into a tree of self-contained supporting strategies that can be fully implemented and tested before the next strategy is added. The methodology also uses comparative performance tests for each new strategy relative to its predecessor. The methodology assumes the use of skill modules that can be shared by multiple behavioral layers and produces learning mechanisms that are highly specialized and context dependent. Two example applications of the methodology are presented using simulated robots in the domains of foraging/mapping and conflict resolution. The examples are implemented by hand using a decomposed model of behavior that allows skill modules to be shared while retaining a unique representation of each strategy for excitation and inhibition. Finally, we discuss how the solutions produced using this methodology differ from existing behavior-based solutions.",

A trial-and-error learning algorithm is proposed that is inspired by backward chaining from the animal training discipline. The procedure is analytically formulated using a serial composition of finite action-set learning automata with delay. Simulation of the proposed algorithm shows that the algorithm does indeed lead to sequence learning. The effect of parametric variation in the magnitude and quality of reinforcement is investigated in both theory and simulation. It is shown that a fundamental tradeoff exists between quality and speed of learning. It is also shown that the algorithm has the ability to learn desirable action sequences among several feasible action sequences through the use of relative rewards, which may be interpreted using the Bellman principle of optimality.",

    "abstract": "Distance perception for mobile agents is of great importance for safe navigation in unknown environments. Traditional methods make use of analytical solutions. Yet, according to some research hypothesis, distance perception is not the result of mathematical calculations, but an emergent consequence of an association process, where visual and tactile information acquire a central role. Designing models closer to natural cognition poses paramount challenges to artificial intelligence (AI), which call for a review of some of the foundations of current methods. Our work is framed in the embodied cognition paradigm, which highlights the importance of the body for the development of cognitive processes. We provide theoretical grounds and empirical evidence for an artificial account of distance perception through a multimodal association process. By learning multimodal sensorimotor schemes, an agent is capable of perceiving affordances related to distance perception without any non-body-based geometric knowledge. We let an agent interact with an environment cluttered with objects, while learning multimodal sensorimotor associations. The learned spatial relations are thoroughly characterized to show how the model depends on the agent’s specific sensorimotor capabilities. The system is tested in a passability experiment and a navigation task, showing the agent anticipates undesired situations using the learned model predictions.",

Caterpillar bodies are like a sac filled with fluid. In this article, we propose a locomotion model in which the head and posterior are connected with a spring and damper system instead of a rod; we refer to this as the “balloon model.” The numerical experiments reveal the following benefits. Benefit 1: The model can explain a phenomenon that the posterior moves little behind the head. Our model showed such movement causes efficient movement. Benefit 2: The model can explain inching as crawling. The rod model cannot explain inching because the model cannot change the body length. Our balloon model can change the body length drastically and can locomote faster. Benefit 3: The model does not use the stiff organ. Benefit 4: The model can explain the phenomenon called “environmental skeleton,” which causes the body to contract during the locomotion. The balloon model can change body length and create power between the head and posterior. This model not only simulates the behavior closer to the actual caterpillar but also can explain the caterpillar with a soft element.",

Very often this leads to accidents at home, which are unnoticed for a long time and therefore cause severe complications. We propose a cyber-physical system consisting of sensors for motion, light, temperature, and so on, which monitors the behavior of elderly people but is non-invasive in the sense that the persons are not observed by a camera and must not wear certain sensors on their body. Unusual behavior or accidents are registered in-time by a change point detection algorithm based on Markov chains, which does not store any data with the exception of the last datum, so that also the integrity of the elderly people is preserved. For verification of this algorithm, a cyber-physical test environment has been programmed which allows to simulate human common and uncommon behavior in house during day and night. This simulation environment is based on behavior trees and decision theory. The verification results suggest that the implemented cyber-physical system for change point and anomaly detection could be successfully used in the real environment of elderly people to give them help in-time when an accident occurs.",

However, both constructing and evaluating such models remain an open challenge. The most common approaches to evaluating models is to assess their accuracy with respect to observable values. However, the prevailing reliance on estimator accuracy as a proxy for the usefulness of the knowledge has the potential to lead us astray. We demonstrate the conflict between accuracy and usefulness through a series of illustrative examples including both a thought experiment and an empirical example in Minecraft, using the General Value Function framework (GVF). Having identified challenges in assessing an agent’s knowledge, we propose an alternate evaluation approach that arises naturally in the online continual learning setting: we recommend evaluation by examining internal learning processes, specifically the relevance of a GVF’s features to the prediction task at hand. This paper contributes a first look into evaluation of predictions through their use, an integral component of predictive knowledge which is as of yet unexplored.",

    "abstract": "The tension between reflection and experience has been highlighted by Buddhism as the origin of human suffering, described as an undercurrent and constant feelings of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, and dissatisfaction or disease. This universal suffering experience called Dukkha refers to the failure to find a Self in reflection or the frustrated desire or craving to have or to be something. For Buddhism, not only the desired object is illusory, but so is the desiring self. Further, Varela et al. (1993) integrate these ideas into the development of cognitive sciences and the understanding of human experience from an embodied and selfless mind perspective. The present article attempts to apply the Buddhist notion of suffering or Dukkha along with Varela, Thompson, and Rosch’s contributions to the understanding of the embodied sense of Self that characterizes symptoms of Depression. The expression of the self-grasping suffering experiences and the tension between reflection and experience for depressive patients will be discussed from an enacted and embodied perspective. Further, new research ideas along with possible new psychotherapeutic approaches are discussed.",

The course-of-experience method can provide a useful step toward the development of both.

In this paper, it is shown how the functional systems theory of P. K. Anokhin formulated key notions of adaptive control, self-monitoring, and self-detectable (“system-detectable”) error that directly anticipate current debates on neural information and representation, and allow to reframe these debates in new empirical and theoretical perspectives. In addition to showing this on the basis of early (less known and untranslated) works, we analyze how functional systems pose new questions for current research. Specifically, recent discoveries in integrative and cellular neuroscience regarding the biophysical limits of signal summation in neural cells directly confirm Anokhin’s analysis of the integrative activities of the neuron. These findings may have wide implications, and call for new and biologically more specific models of the integrative and semiotic closure of nervous activity, in line with the systemic closure of the organismic functions in which they participate.",

    "abstract": "The target article presents an alternative view on cognition through the lens of human practice, which is experienced from within by practitioners and through their course-of-experience. It pays specific heed to micro-phenomenological and semiotic aspects that the situated cognition literature has not in general attended to. However, the proposed framework can be read as reducing events to self-identical actors, organisms, environment, or signs, which impedes the goal of overcoming the body-mind Cartesian dualism. This commentary focuses on two issues. First, experiencing, as event, needs to be analyzed by means of categories that retain the its evental qualities. This cannot be done by attempting to breathe life into people and things through enaction. Second, human life and any of its parts, as irreducibly transactional phenomena, are essentially and originarily social.",

    "abstract": "Referential communication is central to social and collective behaviour, for example honey bees communicating nectar locations to each other or co-workers gossiping about a colleague. Since such behaviour typically is considered to be ‘representation hungry’, it is often assumed to require the possession of complex cognitive machinery capable of manipulating symbolic representations of the world. However, a series of simulation studies have shown that it can be achieved by very simple embodied artificial agents controlled by evolved recurrent artificial neural networks that are challenging to interpret in symbol-processing terms. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to explore scenarios in which a pair of agents, each of which is privy to a different piece of private information, must jointly solve a task that requires both pieces of information to be communicated, compared and acted upon, i.e., each agent must simultaneously play the role of both signaller and receiver during an unstructured referential communication interaction that is bidirectional. We demonstrate evolved agents that are able to solve this task, and analyse the extent to which their situated, embedded and embodied communicative behaviour can be considered to be a step towards understanding the minimal cognitive basis for human language.",

By relying on the enactive paradigm, the Course-of-Experience Framework focuses on singular experiences but does not take individuals as its starting point. Thus, from-within gains a very particular meaning that will be explored here through the concept of event, in Deleuzian terms, the event is neither subjective nor objective in the usual meaning of these words, even though it is a singularity, capable of producing both individual and collective effects. This concept prevents considering subjective experience as a property of individuals. The concept of event is valuable to elucidate the notion of “common experiential ground.”",

In his lecture, Erik describes three affordance-related aspects of the making practices at Rietveld Architecture-Art-Affordances (RAAAF), a visual art and architecture studio Erik and his brother Ronald Rietveld founded in 2006. The special issue includes 22 reflections on Erik’s lecture written by commentators from a broad range of different fields including art history, architecture, ecological psychology, dynamical systems cognitive science, anthropology, archaeology and the philosophy of 4e cognition. Erik and I provide a response that reflects on what it means to make philosophical art installations. The special issue also includes an interview conducted with art-historian Anja Novak reflecting on the potential of ecological-enactive cognitive science to further our understanding of experiential engagement with art. Finally, Erik has written an opinion article in which he sets out the next steps in his research programme of developing a conceptual framework for understanding ‘change-ability’ – skills for coordinating with a rapidly changing world. The key insight behind the framework is that changing the affordances of the living environment can contribute to changing otherwise rigid and undesirable patterns of behaviour. Erik reflects on the role that artworks can play in inviting reflection on how the practices that organise and shape human life could be different, a task that is increasingly urgent in a time when removing obstacles to change is necessary.",

    "abstract": "While organisms are continually experiencing and interacting with their environments, the role and extent of experiences in behavioral development has been controversial. Some argue that adaptive behaviors are acquired through experiences, while others claim they are the result of innate programs that don’t require environmental input. Such controversies have historically occurred within animal behavior and psychology, but similar debates are emerging in the field of artificial intelligence. Here, the debate is centered on those who design experience-dependent systems that are trained to learn the statistical properties of “environmental” inputs, and those advocating the use of pre-packaged artificially “innate” responses tailored to prespecified inputs. Those favoring artificial innateness draw analogies with animal behavior to argue that innateness is necessary for the emergence of complex adaptive behavior. But does behavioral development in animals reflect the unfolding of innate programs? Here we highlight the widespread role of specifically causal experiences in the ontogeny of species-typical behaviors. All behaviors are an outcome of a chain of organism-environment transactions—called ontogenetic niches—that begin in the earliest periods of life. This challenges the notion that organisms come prepared with innate programs for behavior. We suggest that an artificial intelligence that matches the complexity of animal behavior should be based on principles of behavioral development, where experiences are necessary and specifically causal factors in the emergence of behavioral abilities.",

    "abstract": "Multistable perception, characterized by spontaneous alternations between perceptual states, has garnered increasing attention in autism research, because atypical performance in multistable perception tasks has been suggested as a behavioral marker of this population. However, previous studies in this field have yielded variable and conflicting results leading to inconsistent conclusions. Here we present a computational model integrating key neurocognitive mechanisms, all of which have been considered critical in accounting for atypical behavior in autism, such as bottom-up/top-down processes, the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, and neural noise. By systematically altering these mechanisms within an artificial neural network, we explored their functional roles on perceptual fluctuations. Our approach provides a clearer understanding of how specific behaviors may correlate with varied neural and cognitive alterations in autism. This model offers a perspective on key debates in autism research, such as the direction for the excitation/inhibition imbalance, and the possible dominance of bottom-up processing. Moreover, this model challenges heuristic single-mechanism theories of autism, favoring neurodiversity approaches by illustrating the spectrum’s complexity, where identical behaviors might result from diverse neurocognitive mechanisms. We highlight the need for future research to employ multiple behavioral tasks to map neurocognitive alterations in autism, aiming for more precise identification and management in therapeutic scenarios.",

The global attendance time-series x(t) has a mean near, but not equal to, s . Surprisingly, the standard deviation or \"volatility\" of x(t) can show a minimum with increasing adaptability of the individual agents. Various arguments based on random walk models are dis cussed.

    "abstract": "Interfacing robots with real biological systems is a potential approach to realizing truly adaptive machines, which is a long-standing engineering challenge. Although plants are widely spread and versatile, little attention has been given to creating cybernetic systems incorporating plants. Producing such systems requires two main steps: the acquisition and interpretation of biological signals, and issuing the appropriate stimulation signals for controlling the physiological response of the biological part. We investigate an automated physiological recovery of young avocado plants by realizing a closed interaction loop between the avocado plant and a water-control device. The study considers the two aforementioned steps by reading out postural cues (leaf inclination) and electrophysiological (biopotential) signals from the plant, and controlling the water resource adaptive to the drought condition of an avocado plant. Analysis of the two signals reveals time-frequency patterns of increased power and global synchronization in the narrow bands when water is available, and local synchronization in the broad bands for water shortage. The results indicate the feasibility of interface technologies between plants and machines, and provide preliminary support for achieving adaptive plant-based ‘machines’ based on plants’ large and robust physiological spectrum and machines’ control scheme diversity. We further discuss fundamental impediments hindering the use of living organisms like plants for artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "The common approach for training robots is to expose them to different environmental scenarios, training their controllers to have the best possible commands when untrained scenarios are encountered. When humans train, they do the same. They try new manipulations by performing within different environments. However, humans training also includes a type of training which, although claimed to improve cognitive capabilities, has not, to date, been adopted for the training of robots. This type of training involves the restriction of manipulation capabilities while performing different tasks, e.g. climbing with just one hand. Recently research that aims at exploring the invigorating idea that such training, termed as mechanical cognitivization (MC), would enhance the robustness of robots, has been published. However, that work has demonstrated the idea by utilizing mathematical functions. In the current paper, the first proof that such training may enhance the robustness of robots is given by using a kinematic system. Specifically, it is shown that such training improves the performances of robots when encountering the need to perform new tasks, when performing within untrained environments and when malfunctions occur. The advantages of the suggested training are highlighted through facilitating a comparison between three learning schemes that include a common neural net and two MC-based nets. These are termed here as amalgamated modes neural net and committee of modes neural net. It is shown that both MC-based schemes are superior when robustness is considered.",

    "abstract": "Learning to control dynamic systems with unknown models is a challenging research problem. However, most previous work that learns qualitative control rules does not construct qualitative states; a proper partition of continuous- state variables has to be designed by human users and given to the learning programs. We design a new learning method that learns appropriate qualitative state representation and the control rules simultaneously. Our method can aggressively partition the continuous-state variables into finer, discrete ranges until control rules based on these ranges are learned. As a case study, we apply our method to the benchmark control problem of cart-pole balancing (also known as the inverted pendulum). Experimental results show that our method not only derives different partitions for the cart-pole systems with different parameters but also learns to control the systems for an extended period of time from random initial positions.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing among theories of sexual selection requires that one develop diagnostic predictions that can be tested in living systems. Recently, genetic studies of female species preferences in Drosophila supported the predictions of a model of sexual selection through pleiotropy with adap tive traits: preferences generally behaved as recessive characters. However, the dominance predic tions of female preferences resulting from runaway sexual selection have not been investigated. Here, I present an extension of previous simulation models of runaway sexual selection by varying the dominance of the female preference and incorporating genetic drift. I show that runaway sex ual selection is generally more likely to favor the evolution of dominant female preferences than recessive ones. Also, in contrast to the results of a previous study, dominant preferred male char acters spread more quickly by runaway sexual selection than recessive ones under some conditions. Overall, the predictions derived from this model of runaway sexual selection are not supported by empirical data on the genetic basis of species preferences, suggesting that runaway sexual selection may not be a major force in the evolution of such preferences. More empirical studies will be nec essary to further evaluate both the predictions and the assumptions of this model, however.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the assumption, implicit in many robot and animat models of learning, that learning and unlearning are a pair of symmetrical processes. Unlearning mechanisms supposedly erase or remove existing learning because it is no longer relevant. Whether learning and unlearning result from the operation of symmetrical and antagonistic processes is an issue which has had a long but uneven history in animal and human psychology. This history is briefly recapitulated here. In particular, there is a contrast in the significance of the antagonistic processes model in the area of motivation compared to associative learning which has theoretical significance. For example, animat modelers frequently adopt a generic strengthening and weakening mechanism for all forms of learning and motivation representations without any consideration for its biological and psychological validity. In order to evaluate and question this, we examine the unlearning concept in a number of artefactual models drawn from a range of robotic and artificial life perspectives, and discuss their validity in terms of contemporary models of animal learning and motivation. Finally, we outline an alternative view of learning/unlearning, based on a recent contingency model of causality learning in humans, which does not rely on antagonistic processes and may have applications for artefacts.",

    "abstract": "It is usually a mark of good design when technologies and tools that mediate goal-directed action are such that the user’s attentional focus is maintained on the intended ends of action rather than on the technologies and tools themselves. When the mediators become the focus, the continuity of goal-directed action is disrupted, and the flow of action can be re-directed. What then is the purpose of the projects designed by the RAAAF studio, as described by Rietveld, which seem to be intended to do both? Disruption of the continuity of goal-directed perception-action may prompt reflection about the circumstances at work, and in so doing provoke a transformation in habitual patterns of action and of thought. The project “The End of Sitting” is intended to remediate the adverse health effects of standard chair-dominated offices through an unconventional office landscape that prompts intermittent postural readjustments, boosting the levels of activity common in such settings. The project “Bunker 599” demonstrates that seemingly unremarkable features of the landscape can sometimes conceal aspects of culture’s history, and that design can function to draw attention to a hidden and even vanishing history. Design can enrich an individual’s sense of place in a stream of cultural history.",

Forty players of both sexes (21.2 ± 2.4 years) participated in the study and were divided into four experimental groups: alternated, random, choice, and yoked. The task was the Handball 7-m throw, in specific right and left side throw. Participants performed five blocks of six throws in the practice phase and, after 30 min, another six throws in the retention test. A mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVA) were run with data from the performance success and consistency rates considering first and last blocks of acquisition and retention block as repeated measures. Groups were analyzed as independent variables by considering their interaction with sex (4 × 2 × 3 (groups × sex × blocks)) and time of practice (4 × 4 × 3 (groups × time of practice × blocks)). Results showed that the alternated and choice groups presented superior rates of performance success to the random and yoked groups. The findings of this study allowed us to conclude that learning was benefited by the alternated and choice conditions compared to the random and yoked conditions.",

RAAAF’s practice of cutting and splitting closely relates to the work of the ‘70s artist Gordon Matta-Clark. But the radical proposals of both RAAAF and Matta-Clark engage with power in almost oppositional ways. While Matta-Clark offers the cut as a final space, RAAAF aims to create new worlds. I question the need for new worlds, since they are built on current power structures, instead of dismantling them.",

It is also a tribute to John Stewart who accompanied the first stages of this research. Having already examined the difficulties surrounding questions of the perception of exteriority within the framework of enactive approaches, we will proceed in two stages. The first stage will consist of an attempt to explain distal perception in terms of individual sensorimotor invariants. This poses the problem but fails to solve it. The second stage will propose a new pathway to account for spatial perception; a pathway that does not deny the initial intuitions of the autopoietic enactive approaches, but one which radically changes the conception of cognition by considering, from the perceptual stage, the need to take into account interindividual interactions. The protocol of an original experimental study will characterize this new approach considering the perceptual experience of objects at a distance, in exteriority, in a space of possibilities without parting from the domain of interaction. To do this, we have to work at the limits of the perceptual crossing, that is, at the moment when the perceptual reciprocity between different subjects begins to disappear.",

This article offers an alternative framework for classification of behaviour based upon only the behavioural outcomes. The framework is specified from first principles of a state-space approach, allowing us to discuss intermediate outcomes that may have instrumental value. This approach could provide a firmer foundation to consider the hierarchical nature of goals and allows us to address both the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ questions within a single framework. This taxonomy is designed to complement rather than replace existing attempts; the classification of behaviour by outcome is orthogonal to questions of the mechanisms of decision making or of the implementation of actions. This article specifies nine basic classes of behaviour and provides precise definitions for each of these. We then develop a formal language for the description of observed activities, the representation of behavioural hierarchies and for the analysis of possibility sets for achieving future goals. We follow up with some critique and discussion of the problems such a framework poses.",

The model results in an acceptable agreement (validated by ? 2 goodness-of-fit analysis) between the predicted and observed copulation rates of the laboratory population of E. affinis. The copulation rate predicted by the model, with estimated weightings to the transition rates, is 16.7%; the observed rate was 13.0% (16 copulations out of 123 courtship bouts observed), for a discrepancy of 3.7%.

We present the state of the art in graph self-assembly, and then we detail the self-assembly behavior observed in real ants from which our model is derived. We describe our main algorithm, called AntGraph, where each ant represents one datum and where the proximity graph is built in an incremental way. Ants perform two steps: following the path of maximum local similarity, and then connecting to other ants. We present a hierarchical extension, called H-AntGraph, which can build large graphs (with up to 1 million data items). We study the properties of the constructed graphs, and compare our results with those obtained by other methods. We use force-directed graph layout algorithms to display the graphs and to allow the domain expert to perform an interactive clustering task. We validate this approach with a comparative user-study.",

We will advocate the animats' right to existence by listing advantages of the animat approach.3.

It is driven by a positive feedback in the opposite direction. This theoretical argument was transformed into a System Dynamics simulation model and tested with time series data on unmarried cohabitation (U.S.A., 1960-1994), reform marriages in Israel (1990-1996), and homosexuality (U.S.A., 1973-1996).

How can cognitive science research extend beyond the bounds of its own field to change academia and society? These are precisely the kinds of questions the 2022 Workshop on “Challenges in 4E Cognition and the Opportunities They Present” sought to address. The workshop gathered an interdisciplinary cohort of researchers from philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to discuss the future of 4E (embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended) cognition research in and outside of Japan. The aim was to identify the most prominent fields in which 4E research is taking place, such as 4E in relation to artificial life, human–computer interfaces, and phenomenology. We strived to articulate the most important open questions in these fields, and understand how adopting a 4E perspective may yield unique ways of answering them, as well as novel avenues of long-term interdisciplinary collaboration. We then discussed how the 4E framework may embed itself as a point of connection between the social and biological sciences, and bridge the gap between academia, medicine, and policymaking, to inform how humans conduct research, think about ourselves, and live life. In this report, we summarize the topics of discussion, the insights garnered, and the practical methods used to ignite discussions and collaborations amongst the researchers in attendance, as a model for future workshops with similar aims.",

In the present opinion, we discuss the notions of transparency of sports equipment used by athletes, showing that the association between appropriation and transparency is not straightforward. Furthermore, we highlight distinctions between types of sports equipment based on the latter’s behavior in relation to the athlete’s activity. This leads us to suggest three directions of research that should develop a better understanding of the interplay between humans and sports equipment in particular, and more generally the interplay between humans engaged in a quest for performance and their material artefacts.",

To fill this gap, we propose an Ecological-Enactive (E-E) affordance-based account of situated causal engagement, that is, causal judgments and perceptions. We develop this account to improve our understanding of this way of dealing with the world, which includes making progress on the causal selection problem, and to extend the scope of embodied cognitive science to causal cognition. We characterize identifying causes as selectively attending to the relevant ecological information to engage with relevant affordances, where these affordances are dependent on individual abilities. Based on this we construe causal engagement as based on a learned skill. Moreover, we argue that to understand judgments of causation as we make them in our daily lives, we need to see them as situated in sociocultural practices. Practices are about doing, and so this view helps us understand why people make these judgments so ubiquitously: to get things done, to provide an effective path to intervening in the world. Ultimately this view on causal engagement allows us to account for individual differences in causal perceptions, judgments, and selections by appealing to differences in learned skills and sociocultural practices.",

    "abstract": "The formation and evolution of public opinion have been widely studied to understand how consensus forms due to atomic interactions between individuals. While many studies have paid attention to modelling influence and interaction, most of the literature assumes static agents, ignoring the frequent changes in physical locations expected in real life. This feature naturally allows humans to interact with diverse people and avoid disagreement, which heavily impacts the co-evolution of opinions, communities or isolation in human societies. Our previous work proposed an extension of the bounded confidence model inspired by the theories of homophily and cognitive dissonance, which concern humans’ natural behaviours of attraction and disagreement. Although this demonstrated a marked difference to a static opinion model and purely random mobility, the limited experiments gave little insight into the causes or the resulting structures of consensus. This article addresses these shortcomings through a thorough investigation of the impact of mobility modelled by different mechanisms. Through extensive simulation, we observe a transition from multiple stable opinion clusters to complete consensus and a shift from a geographically based organisation to isolated structure-less agents. Lastly, we propose a novel classification of the different outcomes of self-organisation in opinion models, highlighting the patterns of emerging behaviours across the spectrum of interaction range and influence parameters.",

We conduct a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms, focusing on QD (Quality-Diversity) algorithms, based on a well-defined methodology for benchmarking evolutionary algorithms. We introduce carefully chosen indicators to evaluate their performance in three core aspects: task performance, phenotype diversity, and genotype diversity. Our findings highlight MNSLC (Multi-BC NSLC), with the introduction of aligned novelty to NSLC (Novelty Search with Local Competition), as the most effective algorithm for diversity preservation (genotype and phenotype diversity), while maintaining a competitive level of exploitability (task performance). MAP-Elites, although exhibiting a well-balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration, fall short in protecting morphological diversity. NSLC, while showing similar performance to MNSLC in terms of exploration, is the least performant in terms of exploitation, contrasting with QN (Fitness-Novelty MOEA), which exhibits much superior exploitation, but inferior exploration, highlighting the effects of local competition in skewing the balance toward exploration. Our study provides valuable insights into the advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs of different algorithms in co-evolving morphology and control.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether the adaptation of postural control to perform saccadic tasks is still maintained in challenging situations such as when the posture is challenged with a large movement of the moving room and with the addition of a second perturbation as a visual task of memorization. Thirty young adults (20.0 ± 1.3 years) were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. Participants stood upright on a force plate inside a moving room wearing eye-tracking. The room moved back and forth (anterior–posterior direction), at low (.6 cm—first and third trials) and high (3.5 cm—second trial) amplitude, and frequency of .2 Hz. In each trial, participants performed left-right horizontal saccades on a target (1.1 Hz). The experimental group also performed a concomitant number memorization task. There were no differences between groups in the coupling between center of pressure (CoP) displacements and visual stimulus in any condition. There was also no difference in the performance of the saccadic task. In the memorization task, CoP displacements in response to the visual stimulus frequency (room motion) were not affected. The performance in the memorization task was similar between room conditions. Overall, increasing cognitive involvement by adding a working memory task does not deteriorate the postural stabilization of young adults to accomplish accurate gaze shifts. Also, it does not interfere with adaptive visual reweighting due to changes in the moving room amplitude. In conclusion, young adults are flexible in optimizing their postural control to succeed in multiple tasks even under perturbation.",

    "abstract": "The trust degree between individuals plays an important role in social network group decision-making (SNGDM). The majority of current literature assumes that the trust degree between individuals is constant. However, the trust values among decision-makers (DMs) are subject to change over time. Thus, it is necessary to identify potential dynamic trust that is compatible with the actual SNGDM to support the consensus reaching. For this purpose, this article investigates consensus building that considers dynamic trust among DMs in SNGDM with linguistic distribution assessments (LDAs). Firstly, the three-dimensional trust degree among DMs is constructed from three perspectives: the trust relationship from social networks, the confidence level of DMs, and the similarity of DMs' preferences. Secondly, an optimization model is developed with the objective of maximizing consensus to determine how trust degree is assigned to each perspective, thereby determining the weights of DMs. Then, a double feedback-based consensus mechanism incorporating both opinion evolution and trust evolution is developed. Under the guidance of consensus mechanism, an improved SNGDM approach with LDAs is presented. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed approach through a case study of sustainable supplier selection in a circular economy.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MRL) is a growing area of research. What makes it particularly challenging is that multiple learners render each other's environments non-stationary. In addition to adapting their behaviors to other learning agents, online learners must also provide assurances about their online performance in order to promote user trust of adaptive agent systems deployed in real world applications. In this article, instead of developing new algorithms with such assurances, we study the question of safety in online performance of some existing MRL algorithms. We identify the key notion of reactivity of a learner by analyzing how an algorithm (PHC-Exploiter), designed to exploit some simpler opponents, can itself be exploited by them. We quantify and analyze this concept of reac tivity in the context of these algorithms to explain their experimental behaviors. We argue that no learner can be designed that can deliberately avoid exploitation. We also show that any attempt to opti mize reactivity must take into account a tradeoff with sensitivity to noise, and devise an adaptive method (based on environmental feedback) designed to maximize the learner's safety and minimize its sensitivity to noise.",

If mental properties do not depend exclusively on neurological properties but depend on external or extra-cranial properties, mental causation cannot be pre-empted by or reduced to neurological properties. In this sense, Keijzer and Schouten argue that this theory entails a robust nonreductive materialism (RNM) that vindicates a notion of mental causation. However, I will argue that this maneuver produces different kinds of overdetermination problems that compromise the metaphysical austerity of a materialist theory of cognition and, for this reason, Process Externalism might not be conceived as entailing an RNM. Finally, I will suggest that the theory could be rendered as a moderate reductive account of the cognitive phenomena that would avoid the overdetermination problems that haunt nonreductive accounts of cognition.",

In this article, we seek to explore an approach to active vision inspired by biological systems, which uses limited constraints for motor strategies through progressive adaptation via an evolutionary method. This type of approach gives freedom to artificial systems in the discovery of eye-movement strategies that may be useful to solve a given vision task but are not known to us. In the experiment sections of this article, we use this type of evolutionary active vision system for more complex natural images in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments. To further improve the results, we experiment with the use of pre-processing the visual input with both the uniform local binary patterns (ULBP) and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) for classification tasks in the 2D and 3D environments. The 3D experiments include application of the active vision system to object categorisation and indoor versus outdoor environment classification. Our experiments are conducted on the iCub humanoid robot simulator platform.",

While noting the importance of understanding perception as embodied, he argues that addressing just the issues of embodiment is not enough, that the socially situated and conditioned character of bodies, and the practices involved in perception, must be given full account. In surveying the current state of enactive theories of perception Arango dismisses what he terms “autopoietic” enactivism as only “hand waving” on the manner in which social aspects of life affect or transform bodily perception and action. In this commentary I argue that Arango has overlooked an important body of research by researchers in the “life-mind” or “sense-making” domain of enactive thinking. This literature addresses the dynamics of sociality in perception and action, and while greater integration between the descriptions of embodied action and social engagement is needed, significant progress has been made on this matter in recent publications.",

In this reply, I explain that the omission is due to the fact that such theories are not accounts of perception. It is argued that, unlike participatory sense-making, the approach of the “From Sensorimotor Dependencies to Perceptual Practices” article does not focus on the perceptual aspects of things social, but on the social aspects that are constitutive of perception in general. I conclude by underscoring the central argument of the original article: that the adequate notion to make enactivism about perception social is that of “perceptual practices,” a social practices-based notion of perception.",

However, they are not the only ones: chemoreception is another modality that biologists have found to be a contributor to self-recognition in numerous species, of which arthropods are notable. This article aims to help address the gap between philosophical and biological literature by presenting the octopus as an example of a creature in which peripheral chemoreceptive processes appear to be a significant component of self-recognition. Building on the findings of Nesher et al. that chemical compounds in octopus skin interfere with the behaviour of its suckers, this article proffers an account of how chemoreception may contribute to self-recognition in octopuses.",

    "abstract": "Learning to make decisions in partially observable environments is a notorious problem that requires a complex representation of controllers. In most work, the controllers are designed as a non-linear mapping from a sequence of temporal observations to actions. These problems can, in principle, be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process whose policy can be parameterised through the use of recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we will propose an alternative framework that (a) uses the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder framework to learn an internal state representation for historical observations and then (b) integrates it into existing recurrent policy models to improve the task performance. The LSTM Encoder encodes a history of observations as input into a representation of internal states. The LSTM Decoder can perform two alternative decoding tasks: predicting the same input observation sequence or predicting future observation sequences. The first proposed decoder acts like an auto-encoder that will guide and constrain the learning of a useful internal state for the policy optimisation task. The second proposed decoder decodes the learnt internal state by the encoder to predict future observation sequences. This idea makes the network act like a non-linear predictive state representation model. Both these decoding parts, which introduce constraints to policy representation, will help guide both the policy optimisation problem and latent state representation learning. The integration of representation learning and policy optimisation aims to help learn more complex policies and improve the performance of policy learning tasks.",

The approach is inspired by the model of decentralized locomotion control in the stick insect introduced by one of the authors and makes use of second-order nonlinear systems to realize the neuron-like dynamics of the sub-units of the whole control system. Each of these sub-units controls the behavior of a leg and is coordinated with the others by means of local influences based on the leg status, revealed by contact sensors. The suitability of the approach has been shown by using cellular nonlinear networks (CNNs) to implement the leg controllers. Simulations of the CNN-based locomotion control demonstrate its robustness with respect to different initial conditions and the property of pattern recovery after the external blocking of a leg.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive morphology of a robot, such as shape adaptation, plays a significant role in adapting its behaviors. Shape adaptation should ideally be achieved without considerable cost, like the power required to deform the robot’s body, and therefore, it is reasonably considered as the last resort in classical rigid robots. However, the last decade has seen an increasing interest in soft robots: robots that can achieve deformability through their inherent material properties or structural compliance. Nevertheless, the dynamics of these types of robots is often complex and therefore it is difficult to substantiate whether the cost like the required power for changing its shape will be worthwhile to achieve the desired behavior. This article presents an approach in the development and analysis of a shape-changing locomoting robot, which relies on the ability of elastic beams to deform and vibrate. Through a proper use of elastic materials and the robot’s vibration-based dynamics, it will be shown both analytically and experimentally how shape adaptation can be designed such that it leads to desirable behaviors, with better power efficiency compared to when the robot solely relies on changing its control input. The results encourage emerging direction in robotics that investigates approaches to change robots’ behaviors through their adaptive morphology.",

Fifty-six boys between 7 and 10 years were classified into groups as overweight ( n = 33) or normal-weight ( n = 23). They performed two trials of running and hopping over a 20-m straight line distance. Accelerometers were attached on the trunk and head for collecting body movements in different directions from 15 strides. Postural variability and coordination were calculated by multiscale entropy and cross approximate entropy for the running and hopping trials, separately. Findings highlight overweight boys had significantly higher trunk-head coordination in mediolateral direction than normal-weight boys (0.72 vs. 0.68). The hopping movement pattern had highest variability (9.88 vs. 8.77) and trunk–head coordination (0.61 vs. 0.67) than running. Excess body mass demands additional postural adaptations to compensate for reducing the risk of losing balance laterally in boys with overweight.",

It is written under the commitment that life is intrinsically valuable, and its value has to be taken seriously in doing biology. Stewart defends a conception of life in which every living organism has a subjective point of view from which it makes sense of the world. Under this conception and the commitment that life is valuable in itself, the book presents the story of life from its origin and our history as humankind. However, the book is more successful in presenting the former than the latter. Yet Stewart’s conception of enaction opens the possibility for cognitive science and his conception of what makes us human enables us to embrace the histories and the forms of life of those who have been systematically silenced.",
