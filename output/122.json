    "abstract": "Ties between the endocrine system and mental health are undeniably a consistent point of interest in modern day medicine. Furthermore, mental disturbances due to hormonal changes following childbirth have been mentioned in medical literature since Hippocrates. Considering the dramatic endocrine, paracrine and autocrine changes that occur during gestation, labour and postnatal phase, hormonal theories are not to be ignored in the treatment of postpartum disorders.Reproductive hormones are known to modulate behavioural, emotional and cognitive response, therefore rapid changes in estradiol and progesterone plasma concentrations during pregnancy and labour create a vulnerable terrain leading towards postpartum disorders. New research shows that women suffering from postpartum disorders have abnormal neural responses, suggesting a neuroendocrine explanation for postpartum syndromes.To facilitate further research in this area, we present new information on several hormonal interactions and the psychiatric response involved in pregnancy and labour, offering an interdisciplinary outlook on pregnancy and postpartum disorders. There is enough evidence to suggest that estradiol, progesterone, oxytocin, cortisol and thyroid hormones are some of many hormones involved in postpartum syndromes and tackling their perinatal imbalance with pharmacological substituents or antagonists could be useful as an adjuvant form of treatment in future patients.",

We used the Fertility Problem Inventory, the Endometriosis Health Profile and the Beck Depression Inventory.We first realized a descriptive analyses of patients' health related quality of life - 60% of women reported higher infertility distress associated with relationship issues caused by difficulties to conceive. The descriptive analysis over the quality of life in patients with endometriosis suggests that the high level of stress related factors, are: the loss over the control of the symptoms, dyspareunia and altered emotional status. Regarding the sexual aspect of life, almost a quarter of the women complained about an altered sexual status, due to both fear of failing in conceiving and dyspareunia caused by the endometriosis. The descriptive analysis over the infertility related stress suggests that the factors associated with a high level of stress are: sadness, pessimism, feeling of failure, irritability, lack of confidence, self-hatred and fatigue.Patients with endometriosis are dealing daily with a large spectrum of symptoms, including pain, dyspareunia, emotional instability and high levels of stress, which have a negative impact upon the quality of life, by lowering it on different levels. Also, within the present study we showed a significant presence of high infertility stress in patients of all ages that lead to depression and social anxiety.",

Studies were excluded if they did not have an abstract, or they contained no data about the exact implication mechanism of microbiota.There are differences regarding the composition of the gut microbiota in healthy people and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients; the later proved to have significantly decreased Clostridium components, and increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations.The intestines of obese subjects are less rich in microbial genes, have a reduced amount of Bacteroidetes and an increased amount of Firmicutes. Fecal microbiota transplantation from obese subjects resulted in adoption of the donor somatotype. Early differences in gut microbiota composition (higher number of Bifidobacteria) function as diagnostic markers for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high-risk patients.The gut endotoxins contribute to metabolic syndrome manifestation. Experimental studies with prebiotic showed lower levels of cytokines and antiobesity potential.Microbiota composition and its changes since childhood have an important role in the metabolic syndrome. Any intervention in order to prevent or treat obesity and diabetes mellitus should have as target the gut immune system.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures compared to the general population. The pathogenesis of the elevated fracture risk is multifactorial and still largely elusive. In contrast to primary osteoporosis, in T2DM the bone mineral density (BMD) is increased compared to controls, suggesting that specific alterations in bone quality occur in diabetic patients. Even more, the specific increase in BMD observed in these patients impairs at least in part both the classical diagnosis of osteoporosis by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the current fracture risk estimation by FRAX (fracture risk assessment tool). Trabecular bone score (TBS) and TBS-adjusted FRAX could improve fracture risk estimation in patients with T2DM but improved tools are needed in the future as well as specific risk stratification criteria. Decreases in the fracture risk of patients with T2DM can be obtained by optimal diabetes control and standard treatment of osteoporosis (most drugs appear to have similar efficacy in patients with T2DM and primary osteoporosis).",

Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were performed. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). All participants underwent a Doppler ultrasound to measure intima-media thickness of carotid artery (cIMT).TG/HDL-C ratio correlated with body mass index (r=0.194, p=0.01), and visceral adipose tissue (r=0.193, p=0.002). Additionally, TG/HDL-C correlated with glucose (r=0.367, p=0.001), insulin (r=0.354, p=0.001) and HOMA-IR (r=0.396 p=0.001). TG/HDL-C was associated with prediabetes, Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.83 (95%CI 1.07-3.13) and insulin resistance 3.27 (95%CI 1.78-6.01), and this risk remains in normal weight women 4.7 (95%CI 1.2-17.81) for prediabetes and 4.38 (95%CI 1.42-13.84) for insulin resistance. No significant risk for cIMT.A TG/HDL-C ratio ≥ 3.0 is a potential risk factor for prediabetes and insulin resistance in women 40-60 years, even in normal weight women.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis (OP) is a disease predisposing postmenopausal women to fractures, and often accompanied by insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Previous studies provided contradictory results concerning prevalence of MetS in postmenopausal OP. To better understand the pathogenesis of IR, we reviewed cellular and molecular aspects and systematically reviewed studies providing homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Bone is an active endocrine organ maintaining its integrity by orchestrated balance between bone formation and resorption. Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts contain receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) operating in skeletal development and in the adult life. Defects in this system generate systemic IR and bone-specific IR, which in turn regulates glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism through osteocalcin. Examination of genetic syndromes of extreme IR revealed intriguing features namely high bone mineral density (BMD) or accelerated growth. Studies of moderate forms of IR in postmenopausal women reveal positive correlations between HOMA index and BMD while correlations with osteocalcin were rather negative. The relation with obesity remains complex involving regulatory factors such as leptin and adiponectin to which the contribution of potential genetic factors and in particular, the correlation with the degree of obesity or body composition should be added.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer. However, a proportion of the obese individuals display a significantly lower risk for metabolic complications than expected for their degree of body mass index, and this subtype of obesity was described as \"metabolically healthy obesity\" (MHO). No universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of MHO exists and the prevalence of this subtype of obesity varies largely according to criteria used. Broadly, MHO is characterized by a lower amount of visceral fat, a more favorable inflammatory profile, and less insulin resistance as compared to the metabolically unhealthy obesity. Currently, controversies exist regarding the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality associated with MHO as compared to metabolically-healthy non-obese individuals. Further research is needed in order to identify the MHO phenotype and if MHO is truly healthy for a long period of time or if it is a transient state from normal metabolic/normal weight to abnormal metabolic/obese state. This review will discuss the MHO definition criteria; the differences between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity; the possible underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of MHO.",

    "abstract": "Foetal asphyxia, a frequent birth complication, detrimentally impacts the immature brain, resulting in neuronal damage, uncontrolled seizure activity and long-term neurological deficits. Oxytocin, a neurohormone mediating important materno-foetal interactions and parturition, has been previously suggested to modulate the immature brain's excitability, playing a neuroprotective role. Our aim was to investigate the effects of exogenous oxytocin administration on seizure burden and acute brain injury in a perinatal model of asphyxia in rats.Asphyxia was modelled by exposing immature rats to a 90-minute episode of low oxygen (9% O2) and high CO2 (20% CO2). Control rats were kept in ambient room-air for the same time interval. In a third group of experiments, oxytocin (0.02 UI/g body weight) was nasally administered 30 minutes before the asphyxia episode. Seizure burden was assessed by the cumulative number of loss of righting reflex (LRR) over a two-hour postexposure period. Acute brain injury was assessed through hippocampal S-100 beta, a biomarker of cellular injury, 24-hours after exposure.Asphyxia increased both LRR and hippocampal S-100 beta protein compared to controls, and these effects were significantly reduced by oxytocin administration.Oxytocin treatment decreased both seizure burden and hippocampal injury, supporting a potential neuroprotective role for oxytocin in perinatal asphyxia.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma has a significant mortality and its growing incidence is associated with important social and health care costs. Thus, investigation of the complex mechanisms contributing to emergence and development of melanoma are of real interest both in scientific research and clinical practice. Estrogens play an important role in the emergence and development of certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, but their role in development of cutaneous melanoma is still a matter of debate. Various data suggest that increased levels of endogenous estrogens during pregnancy or exposure to exogenous estrogens by use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may have a potential role in melanoma development and progression. Moreover, there were revealed several intracellular pathways which can support the connection between estrogens, estrogen receptors (ER) and melanoma. While ER-β plays an antiproliferative role, ER-α promotes cell growth and cellular atypia. Thus, inhibition of ER-β activity in the skin can increase the risk for development of cutaneous melanoma and spread of metastatic cells. However, despite recent advances in this area, the exact role and clinical implications of estrogens and estrogen receptors in melanoma are still not entirely understood and require further investigations.",

Chemerin, one of the signaling molecules of adipose origin, and irisin, defined as the Renaissance of the metabolism, are among these molecules.This cross-sectional study was planned in order to compare the values of serum irisin and chemerin levels in patients newly diagnosed with T2DM and in healthy subjects.The study included 41 patients newly diagnosed with T2DM and 49 healthy individuals. The chemistry parameters were analyzed with a biochemistry autoanalyzer, and hormonal parameters were analyzed with an immunoassay analyzer. Plasma irisin and chemerin levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of glucose, HbA1C, Insulin, HOMA-IR and lipid panel results. Irisin levels in the group of patients newly diagnosed with T2DM were lower than in the control group. Chemerin levels in the group of patients newly diagnosed with T2DM were higher than in the control group.Consequently, diabetes-dependent changes in chemerin and irisin concentrations suggest that these two hormones have a role in the pathophysiology of DM. Further studies are required to understand the complex structure of the signaling pathways of chemerin and irisin molecules as well as the physiological importance of these molecules as metabolism regulators especially in humans.",

HOMA index for insulin resistance was calculated as the product of resting plasma insulin (in microunits/milliliter) and plasma glucose (in millimoles/liter), divided by 22.5. SI was determined using BIA, as being the ratio between muscle mass and fat mass, measured in cm2/m2.A significant decrease of BMI (p<0.05) in DTG (from 31.63 to 24.50) and DTSG (from 30.18 to 24.17) vs. CG was observed (Pearson coefficient r=0.281, p<0.001). Weight status changed significantly (p<0.05) in the high-risk patients. There was a significant decrease of HOMA index (p<0.05) in DTG (from 5.93 to 2.57), DTSG (from 3.93 to 2.23), and in CG an increase was observed (from 3.15 to 3.37).The best results in the prevention/ treatment of sarcopenia in MS patients were obtained for DTSG, which benefited from both the positive effect of diet and physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Pituitary radiotherapy (RT) has undergone important progress in the last decades due to the development of new stereotactic techniques which provide more precise tumour targeting with less overall radiation received by the adjacent brain structures.Pituitary surgery is usually firstline therapy in most patients with nonfunctioning (NFPA) and functioning adenomas (except for prolactinomas and large growth hormone (GH) secreting adenomas), while RT is used as second or third-line therapy.The benefits of RT (tumour volume control and, in functional tumours, decreased hormonal secretion) are hampered by the long latency of the effect and the potential side effects.This review presents the updates in the efficacy and safety of the new stereotactic radiation techniques in patients with NFPA, GH-, ACTH-or PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas.Methods.A systematic review was performed using PubMed and articles/abstracts and reviews detailing RT in pituitary adenomas from 2000 to 2017 were included.Results.Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic RT (FSRT) provide high rates of tumour control i.e. stable or decrease in tumour size, in all types of pituitary adenomas (median 92 -98%) at 5 years.Endocrinological remission is however significantly lower: 44-52% in acromegaly, 54-64% in Cushing's disease and around 30% in prolactinomas at 5 years.The rate of new hypopituitarism varies from 10% to 50% at 5 years in all tumour types and as expected increases with the duration of follow-up (FU).The risk for other radiation-induced complications is usually low (0-5% for new visual deficits, cranial nerves damage or brain radionecrosis and extremely low for secondary brain tumours), however longer FU is needed to determine rates of secondary tumours.Notably, in acromegaly, there may be a higher risk for stroke with FSRT.Conclusion.Stereotactic radiotherapy can be an effective treatment option for patients with persistent or recurrent pituitary adenomas after unsuccessful surgery (especially if residual tumour is enlarging) and/or resistance or unavailability of medical therapy.Comparison with conventional radiation therapy (CRT) is rather difficult, due to the substantial heterogeneity of the studies.In order to evaluate the potential brain-sparing effect of the new stereotactic techniques, suggested by the current data, longterm studies evaluating secondary morbidity and mortality are needed.",

The tumor dimensions were similar in both groups (3.05± 1.05 cm in children; 2.7± 1.07 cm in adults). Massive suprasellar extension reaching the third ventricle was frequently present in all cases. All cases underwent surgery but only a minority of those not cured received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Frequent postoperative complications were: aggravation of the endocrine deficit (>80% of cases in both groups needed chronic replacement therapy), central diabetes insipidus (68.2% children, 34.3% of adults).Despite similar tumor dimensions and extension compared to adults, craniopharyngioma in children is more frequently associated with signs of intracranial pressure. The results and complications of treatment are similar in adults and children.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Romania has no national guidelines for hypothyroidism treatment, nor are there any recommendations from national societies to adhere to international guidelines. Our aim was to identify the attitudes of Romanian physicians relating to hypothyroidism treatment focusing on available formulations of levothyroxine (LT4). Methods. All 748 members of the Romanian Society of Endocrinology were invited to participate in a web-based survey. A total of 316 (42.24%) members responded, of whom 222 (70.2%) completed all questions. Results. Half of the respondents recommended LT4 treatment in euthyroid patients, from 3.6% in euthyroid patients with obesity to 36.4% in euthyroid females with infertility associated with high levels of thyroid antibodies. LT4 was considered the preferred treatment for hypothyroidism (compared to combination treatment of LT4 with LT3 or LT3 alone) by 98.6% of respondents. LT4 in liquid solution was preferred over tablets if malabsorption is suspected (56.5% vs. 27.3%), for patients with unexplained poor biochemical control (52.5% vs. 22.9%) and for patients not able to adhere to ingesting LT4 fasted (74.0% vs. 9.8%). The most and least probable explanations for persistent symptoms in patients with hypothyroidism who achieve a normal TSH under medication were “psychosocial factors” and “burden of having to take medication”, respectively. Conclusion. A significant proportion of Romanian physicians would use LT4 in some groups of euthyroid patients, contrary to current evidence. The preferred treatment for hypothyroidism was LT4. Alternative LT4 formulations (liquid solution) are considered in specific clinical conditions. Diversification of available thyroid hormone formulations was readily incorporated into everyday practice.",

    "abstract": "The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Activity of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) forms the basis of the HPAaxis. Behavioral and endocrine responsivity to threat and their ontogenetic changes may be mediated by PVN. Methods. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) remains the most widely used substance in animal models for inducing highly reproducible brain lesions. In our study, parvocellular neurons from the PVN of male Wistar rats were chemical lesioned by right-unilateral stereotaxic injection of two different doses of 6-OHDA (8µg/3µl and 16µg/3µl) and were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess spatial memory formation (radial arm-maze task) and anxiety (elevated plus maze). Further, we were interested in knowing whether a 6-OHDA lesion of the PVN would result in an imbalance in neuronal oxidative stress levels. Results. 6-OHDA-induced PVN lesions significantly increased the number of working memory errors, suggesting effects on short-term memory, without affecting longterm memory, explored by number of reference memory errors in radial arm-maze task. In elevated plus maze measuring anxiety, 6-OHDA significantly diminished anxiety-like behavior in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the neurotoxin induced a reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) specific activities, while malondialdehyde (MDA) level was found increased in the temporal lobe of rat brain, the most vulnerable cortical area to oxidative stress effects. Conclusion. Results suggest that 6-OHDA lesion of the PVN affects behavioral performance via interactions with systems governing arousal level and possibly by increasing neuronal oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Background. Advances in imaging techniques have led to increasing discovery of adrenal and pituitary “incidentalomas”, tumors with normal endocrine function and no compression mass effects. We evaluated the age at diagnosis (AD) in patients with benign non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas, as compared to pituitary non-functioning tumors, in a series of patients from a national center of endocrinology. Methods. From 2,123 consecutive patients with adrenal and pituitary tumors hospitalized between 1977 - 2009, 2,069 patients were analysed. The study groups included: group A - 137 patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AI), group B - 534 patients with pituitary incidentalomas (PI). Control groups included 1,398 patients: group C1 147 patients with adrenal carcinomas or benign hormone-secreting adrenal tumors, and group C2, 1,251 patients with pituitary secreting adenomas or large non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas (NFA). Imaging was done by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance after 1981 and by skull X-ray or pneumoencephalography before 1981. Results. Mean age AD is more advanced in patients with AI (53 ± 11.9 years, range 21 - 78 yr) than in patients with PI (36.8 ± 13.1 years, range 10 - 81 yr), p < 0.01. AD was higher in AI than in patients with secreting adrenal tumors, but similar in patients with adrenal malignancy. There is an age-related increase in the proportion of AI among patients with adrenal tumors, and of NFA, but not of PI, among patients with pituitary tumors. In patients aged over 65 years, 74% of patients with adrenal tumors have AI, while only 18% of patients with pituitary tumors have PI and 42% have NFA. AD in NFA (49.3 ± 13.1 yr, range 12 - 79 yr) was more advanced than in PI (p < 0.01). AD does not correlate with tumor size. Tumor growth occurred in 24% of AI (follow-up 3.0 ± 2.8 yr) and only in 0.7% of PI, p<0.01 (follow-up 3.1 ± 2.5 yr). Conclusions. Adrenal non-functioning benign tumors show a clear association with ageing, in contrast with pituitary incidentalomas. It seems unlikely that most pituitary incidentalomas in young patients become large NFA, whose development seems to be also age-related. It is tempting to suggest that pituitary tumorigenesis starts earlier than adrenal tumorigenesis.",

Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), the master transcription factor of Tregs, plays a pivotal role in Treg function.Herein, we investigated the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Foxp3 gene with HT development.A total of 129 HT patients and 127 healthy subjects were genotyped for rs3761548 (-3279 A/C) and rs3761549 (-2383 C/T) in the Foxp3 gene, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.Genotypic and allelic distribution of rs3761548 SNP showed a significant association with HT. The CC genotype was observed in 37.2% of patients versus 22.1% of the controls [P<0.008, odds ratio (OR): 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.6] and the AC genotype in 41.1% of patients compared to 54.3% of the controls (P<0.025, OR: 2.1; CI: 1.2-3.6). In addition, higher frequency of C allele in patients compared to controls (P=0.05, OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 0.9-2) suggested that patients with the CC genotype and C allele had increased susceptibility to HT. There were significantly higher serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) antibody in patients with the rs3761548 CC genotype (1156±163 IU/mL) compared to the other genotypes (≈582-656 IU/mL; P<0.004). We observed a greater frequency of the AC genotype in patients who had decreased ATPO antibody levels (P=0.02).The association of the rs3761548 SNP with risk of HT and its influence on ATPO antibody levels suggested an important role for Foxp3 in the biology and pathogenesis of HT.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SCFAs on adiponectin and leptin expression in adipocytes, and also to determine whether the effects of SCFA treatment in visceral adipocytes obtained from healthy subjects are different relative to the effects in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes.Human pericardiac preadipocytes and human pericardiac preadipocytes type 2 diabetes were differentiated into adipocytes for 21 days in 48-well plates. After differentiation, two kinds of mature adipocytes, human pericardiac adipocytes (HPAd) and human pericardiac adipocytes-type 2 diabetes (HPAd-T2D) were incubated with or without 1 mM of acetic acid (AA), butyrate acid (BA), and propionic acid (PA).

In addition, mRNA levels of adiponectin, leptin and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ) were determined by Real-Time PCR system.In HPAd, SCFA supplementation did not inhibit lipid accumulation. By contrast, both AA (p<0.01) and PA (p<0.01) significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in HPAd-T2D. Regarding mRNA levels of adiponectin, no significant changes were found in HPAd, while all three types of SCFAs significantly increased (p<0.05) adiponectin expression in HPAd-T2D. Leptin mRNA expression levels were significantly increased by treatment with all three types of SCFAs in both HPAd (p<0.05) and HPAd-T2D (p<0.05).SCFAs inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and leptin in T2D-derived adipocytes.",

Oxytocin, orexin A and B, α-MSH, β-endorphins, neurotensin and substance P were investigated using a quantitative multiplex assay or a competitive-ELISA method.Plasma oxytocin levels differed between the groups (F (2, 24) =6.48, p=0.006, η2=0.35, observed power=86%): patients with the mild ASD had higher values of plasma oxytocin than those with the severe form (average difference=74.56±20.74pg/mL, p=0.004).These results show a negative correlation between plasma levels of oxytocin and the severity of ASD and support the involvement of oxytocinergic mechanisms in ASD.",

NLR and PLR were calculated. Serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipid levels, calcium phosphorus product, PTH and vitamin D values were investigated. The relationship between NLR-PLR and laboratory parameters, GFR (MDRD-GFR), PTH and vitamin D were investigated.48 male and 253 female patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 57.57±13.28. NLR correlated negatively with albumin, hemoglobin, vitamin D, calcium and cholesterol and it positively correlated with creatinine and PTH. Multiple regression analysis showed that main determinants of NLR were PTH, albumin, LDL-cholesterol, hemoglobin and gender.In this study NLR and PLR correlated negatively with hemoglobin and cholesterol. Positive correlation between NLR and creatinine could be explained by increased degrees of inflammation associated with more pronounced degrees of renal dysfunction. The impact of PTH on NLR was independent of GFR. In multiple regression model this suggests that PTH could be a pro-inflammatory parameter independent of the degree of renal dysfunction.",

Recent studies revealed a prominent role of newly discovered Th17 subset in the induction of autoimmune disorders and that the signaling induced by IL-23 on Th17 cells is crucial to obtain a pathogenic and sustained phenotype. The objective of this study was to provide the involvement of interleukin IL-23/IL-17 axis in pathologic processes.Serum levels of IL-23 and IL-17 in controls and HT patients were studied in different stages of disease activity.We investigated 93 patients with HT: 33 patients with newly diagnosed euthyroid HT (Group I), 11 patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroid HT (Group II), and 49 subjects treated with Levothyroxine (Group III). Thirty healthy subjects were included as controls. Concentrations of IL-23 and IL-17 in the serum samples of patients and controls were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum level of IL-23 was significantly higher in all HT patients (p<0.0001) as well as in subgroups of patients in comparison with controls (p<0.01). Serum concentrations of IL-17 were statistically increased in the group of HT patients (p=0.014); the differences in IL-17 levels between groups I and III in comparison to healthy controls were also significant, but not for group II.Our results highlight the involvement of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the development of HT and its severity. Moreover, upregulated secretion of IL-23 could be a biomarker for progression and monitoring of HT.",

Patients' demographics, biochemical, radiological, and pathological results were retrospectively assessed.Four hundred sixty nine patients were evaluated. Among 469 patients who underwent thyroidectomy, 132 (28.1%) were malignant, while 182 patients were diagnosed with HT (38.8%). PTC was ranked first at 92.4% (n: 122). The prevalence of HT was 54.9% in patients with PTC and 33.1% in patients without PTC diagnosis (p<0.001). Younger age and the presence of HT were independently associated with PTC. The presence of HT was associated with increased risk of development of PTC (OR: 2.2, %95 CI: 1.4-3.5, p<0.001) but not with TNM stage or recurrence. Lymph node metastasis at presentation was the strongest predictor of recurrence (OR: 13.9, CI: 3.5-54.6, p<0.001).HT was an independent risk factor for development of PTC.

Analyze of the endocrinological findings did not determined differences in transcranial groups from transsphenoidal groups. Overall complications were identified in the transcranial cohorts, while cerebrospinal fluid leakage still represent the main problem in transsphenoidal groups. The majority of studies found included extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approach, which shows results of great potential.For the surgical treatment of pituitary adenoma, transsphenoidal procedure with or without extended approaches is preferred, but they're cases when a craniotomy is mandatory for a feasible gross tumor resection. Combined \"above and below\" simultaneous procedure or a two-staged intervention is recommended for giant pituitary adenoma, to maximize tumor resection and lower the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage.",

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone that can regulate glucose metabolism. It has been recognized that serum levels of FGF21 are significantly increased in diabetes and insulin resistance states. The objective of this study was to determine the serum FGF21 levels in women with GDM compared with non-GDM women and its correlation with insulin resistance.Thirty GDM patients and 60 healthy pregnant controls that matched for maternal and gestational age were selected. Women with previous history of GDM, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, renal or liver failure and drug consumption with effects on glucose or insulin levels were excluded. FGF21 was determined and correlated with biochemical parameters of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.FGF21 concentration was significantly higher in GDM (264.5±196.2 ng/L) as compared with control groups (59.1±36.5ng/L). Correlation of FGF21 with insulin resistance was not significant. A cut-off 82.07 ng/L of FGF21 had sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85% for prediction of GDM.FGF21 is increased in GDM and it is independent of insulin resistance. We suggest that FGF21 resistance could be directly involved in pathophysiology of GDM.",

STZ (60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (ip) injected as a single dose for diabetes induction. One week after STZ administration, MT was injected daily as ip for 14 days. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total thiol and glutathione, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were measured in gastric tissue. Serum concentrations of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were also determined.Serum glucose significantly increased in diabetic group compared to control group. STZ induced a significant decrease in gastric tissue levels of total thiol, glutathione, catalase and SOD activities and a significant increase in MDA concentration. In diabetic rats, serum TG, LDL and TC were significantly higher and HDL was significantly lower than in the control group. Treatment of diabetic rats with MT caused a significant increase in gastric total thiol content and glutathione concentration as well as SOD and catalase activities. Gastric MDA concentration and serum LDL, TG and TC were significantly lower in MT-treated groups when compared with diabetic group.These data suggested that MT has a therapeutic effect on gastric oxidative damage and dyslipidemia induced by diabetes that possibly may be due to its antioxidant effects.",

Endocrine professionals are involved in this battle, as far as many patients with endocrine co-morbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal disorders) are most affected by the disease. Specific recommendations for the management of endocrine disorders were released by European experts. Most rely on the same principles of epidemiological safety measures, delaying non emergency admissions and transforming the routine follow-up in telemedicine clinics. Special attention is required to adrenal disorders, either central in the context of pituitary patients or primary. Corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment in Covid-19 infection, therefore it is important to consider all aspects involved by high doses, including metabolic adverse reactions especially in diabetic patients. Other endocrine disorders, thyroid dysfunctions or nodules, parathyroid, adrenal, and pituitary diseases should follow specific recommendations for management. Surgery is postponed for non-emergency situations, restricting most planned surgeries, either thyroid, pituitary or adrenal. Laparoscopic surgery, if required in emergency, is including a supplementary risk, therefore all involved in the operating theater should wear PPE. In conclusion, a coordinated response should be organized in the multidisciplinary management of endocrine patients.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or disease (PCOD) is one of the most common causes of female infertility.The objective of this study was to find out the influence of insulin on LH, testosterone and SHBG in diffrent PCOS categories.A total of 800 women who were subjected to infertility treatment at infertility clinics were selected. About 60 healthy females with regular menstrual cycles were considered as control. The data were collected from hospital records using subject's consent.Relationship of insulin to LH and testosterone was positive and significant (p<0.05) in the entire PCOS group and in five PCOS subcategories with increased LH rise (i.e. 1.3, 2, 3, 4 & 5 times of LH rise in relation to FSH levels in each group respectively). The correlation pattern showed an increasing trend from lower to increased rise of LH compared to FSH. The relationship between insulin and SHBG was negative and significant (p<0.05) in all PCOS subcategories, except for the group having similar LH and FSH levels and also in another group with FSH levels higher than LH levels. A strong positive correlation was established between insulin and SHBG in normal subjects. The percentage of negative correlation was strong in PCOD subcategories with elevated rises of LH.This study established the influence of insulin on other marker hormones (LH, testosterone an SHBG) in various PCOS categories in view of their percentage of relationship.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in 1990 and 1993, respectively, as well as of the two main endocannabinoids, anandamide in 1992 and 2-arachidonylglycerol in 1995, was an important step in identifying the strongest homeostatic system in the human body, namely the endocannabinoid system. Ever since, research has highlighted the crucial part played by this system in all the reproduction stages: folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, oogenesis, fecundation, transport of the egg through the fallopian tubes, blastocyte implantation and pregnancy progression, as well as its implications in the physiopathology of the reproductive system: in endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, preeclampsia, endometrial cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cancer. A special attention must be paid to the phytocannabinoids, natural components originating especially from the Cannabis plant inflorescences, whose medical effects are well-established nowadays with also acting on the receptors of the endocannabinoid system. The most recent research mainly focuses on the reproductive dysfunctions and disorders of the reproductive tissues, respectively, through its action upon the endocannabinoid system. Medical cannabis is nowadays legalized in more and more countries all over the world. At the same time, recreational cannabis remains one of the most consumed drugs (in Romania the most consumed one by young adults). Therefore, it is mandatory for specialists in obstetrics and gynecology, endocrinology, public health, hygiene or for general practitioners, to permanently update their information on this subject.",

    "abstract": "Epidemic of obesity is ongoing and did not slow down. Causes of obesity are numerous and very complex. Among them, the concept of bidirectional signaling within the brain-gut-microbiome axis was recently proposed as possible pathophysiological mechanism and become a hot topic in the explanations for the control of food intake. Discoveries of new anti-obesity drugs that are analogs for the receptors for some hormones derived from gastrointestinal tract contribute to the investigations in this area. The human gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in human health and disease and it is considered that it represent an endocrine organ that participate in energy homeostasis and host immunity. Role of gut microbiome has been investigated in metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Gut microbiome participate in regulation of various mechanisms inside the gastrointestinal tract due to its production of different bacterial metabolites. In our manuscript we present current knowledge about microbiota in the gut; the relation between gut microbiota and brain; neuroendocrine system and gut-brain axis; immune system and gut-brain axis; endocrine system and gut-brain axis; the role of gut microbiota in obesity development and possible use of gut microbiota for the treatment of obesity.",

In last WHO/ADA classification, main forms of this disease are Type 1 (T1DM) and Type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. According to same classification, pathogenesis of T2DM is considered to include a progressive insulin secretory defect on background of insulin resistance. Recently, controversies surround concept of peripheral insulin resistance emerging in 70's as an attempt to explain differences from T1DM phenotype whose autoimmune nature was as that time revealed. The insulin resistance hypothesis was based on supposition that high plasma insulin levels are result of a primary molecular defect against which normal beta cells will react with an increased insulin secretion. This hypothesis has been used to explain both pathogenesis of T2DM and metabolic syndrome, named also for a short period of time the insulin resistance syndrome. We will try to argue that what it is attributed to peripheral insulin resistance belongs in fact to obesity. Special emphasis is put on role of adipocytes, including secretion of different adipokines with secondary lipotoxicity, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory reaction, explaining complex relationship between obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1-α (PPARGC1A), a key transcription factor involved in the control of metabolism and energy homeostasis, is an important biological and positional candidate of the metabolic syndrome. Association studies of its polymorphisms, however, yielded inconsistent sometimes conflicting results, pointing to important ethnic differences, which call for replication in various populations.In order to study its most common - potentially functional - polymorphism Gly482Ser (rs8192678), we carried out a case-control study in a central Romanian population.Two hundred and ninety six patients affected by the metabolic syndrome diagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation proposed criteria and 166 middle-aged control subjects have been investigated. Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP, using the restriction enzyme MspI.While the G(Gly)/A(Ser) allele frequencies (66.89/33.11 vs. 71.68/28.31 %) and GG/GA/AA genotype distribution (45.27-43.24-11.48 vs. 54.21-34.93-10.84 %) differed in the metabolic syndrome and control group, the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome did not reach the limit of statistical significance (OR=1.43; p=0.06, CI 95%: 0.97-2.09). Metabolic parameters in the two study groups did not show significant differences according to the genotype (p>0.05).rs8192678 could be a functional polymorphism contributing to the development of the metabolic syndrome, but probably its effect is minor, and might depend on gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Clarification of very small effects would require larger sample sizes.",

There are a limited number of studies evaluating the prevalence of celiac-related antibodies in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.This study aimed to further investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the relationship between these two autoimmune disorders in these patients.This study was performed on 82 women aged 20-50 years including 40 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 42 healthy age-matched individuals. Anthropometric assessments were performed and biochemical parameters including thyroid hormones (TSH, T3 and T4), antithyroid antibodies, anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-gliadin antibodies were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The prevalence of IgG and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and IgA anti-gliadin antibody was higher in Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients compared with control group (15% vs. 7%, 22.5% vs. 17% and 15% vs. 12% respectively).

Confusion is even more for subjects with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT).In this study, we aimed to evaluate the fat distribution and metabolic profile of subjects with euthyroid HT as well as to establish an appropriate cut-off level of TSH for the development of metabolic syndrome (Mets) in both groups.All subjects were euthyroid whether under levothyroxine replacement or not. We recruited 301 volunteers (99 with HT and 202 without thyroid autoimmunity). Together with some metabolic variables, we measured the waist circumference, hip circumference, neck circumference manually; the total body fat with a body composition analyzer; and the visceral fat/trunk fat percentage via abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis.A significant positive correlation was established between TSH levels and insulin, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR and body mass index (r=0.28; p<0.001; r=0.27; p<0.05: r=0.32; p<0.001: r=0.13; p<0.05 respectively). The prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (Mets) was comparable in HT and control groups (27.3% vs. 30.7%; p>0.05). The prevalence of Mets was similar when HT subjects using levothyroxine or HT subjects with accompanying thyroid nodules were taken into consideration. Similarly, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were similar in both the HT group and the control group.We were unable to establish the TSH cut-off level by ROC analysis with desired sensitivity and specificity (AUC: 0.563 with 95% C.I. p=0.35; standard error 0.76).Although weight gain is frequently encountered in subjects with HT, such subjects with thyroid function tests in the euthyroid range have a similar prevalence of Mets and similar metabolic and anthropometric measurements compared to subjects without autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Context.The inhibition of adipocyte differentiation has a significant role on the prevention of obesity and obesity-associated complications.Objective.In this study, we aimed to detect whether hyperoside is able to inhibit the conversion of pre-adiposits into mature adiposits.Design and Methods.3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were stimulated so as to differentiate into mature adipocytes.Hyperoside in non-cytotoxic concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 µM) were separately applied to differentiated 3T3-L1 cells.Oil red O staining was performed and triacylglycerol contents were measured.Furthermore, gene and protein expressions of transcription factors, adipogenic genes and adipokines were examined in order to investigate the effect of hyperoside on adipocyte differentiation.Results.Hyperoside in high concentrations significantly suppressed the adipogenic process by inhibiting the expression of transcription factors and adipogenic genes and reducing lipid accumulation in adipocytes (p<0.05).Low doses of hyperoside are able to inhibit adipogenesis, but higher doses are needed to reduce fat accumulation in mature adipocytes.In the case of maturing preadipocytes, 5 µM of hyperoside exerts its antiadipogenic effect at the early stages of adipogenesis, whereas 10 µM of hyperoside acts at the later stages (p<0.05).Conclusion.These results suggest that hyperoside has a beneficial effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have addressed the impact of sarcopenia on various health outcomes. As the most critical issue is the early identification of individuals, a short screening tool may help clinicians to simply test for sarcopenia and start early management of the disease. Recently, a simple questionnaire, Sarc-F was provided that may adequately realize this aim.To validate the questionnaire we translated the original Sarc-F according to the recommended methodology. A total of 80 people, aged 65+ were evaluated for sarcopenia. Muscle mass, strength, and physical performance were measured. Volunteers completed the Sarc-F as well as other two questionnaires. Discriminative power, reliability, construct validity analyses, specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive value evaluations were made.A good discriminative power and internal consistency were found. With the functional sarcopenia diagnostic criteria the test demonstrates a high specificity (84%). The positive and negative predictive values were: 78% and 77%. Using the more conservative diagnostic criteria the negative predictive value was: 85.4%, sufficient to rule out those not at risk of having sarcopenia and eliminate the need for further investigations.A valid Romanian Sarc-F questionnaire is now available to simply detect patients at risk/no risk of sarcopenia.",

According to the long-term mechanism, vitamin D causes the proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells by gene transcription.We aimed to evaluate the relationship between muscle strength and serum vitamin D levels in elderly men.Cross-sectional study.Male patients over age 50 were included in the study. Study population was divided into 2 groups with handgrip strength according to body mass index, either as subjects with weak or with normal handgrip strength test (HGST). Vitamin D levels and other variables compared between weak and normal groups.Vitamin D level of weak and normal groups were 7.5 (3-19.9) μg/L, and 11.6 (11.6-34.9) μg/L, which means significant reduced vitamin D levels in weakness group (p=0.01). Vitamin D levels were significantly correlated with HGST levels (r:0.362, p=0.001). Vitamin D levels were found to be an independent predictor of weakness according to HGST in logistic regression analysis (OR: 0.453, 95% Cl:0.138-0.769, p=0.05).Low vitamin D level is an independent risk factor for muscle weakness in men aged more than 50 years. Therefore, vitamin D levels should be screened and early replacement should be initiated for the sake of improvement of muscle strength in elderly subjects that vulnerable for frailty.",

This study aims to examine the relationship between serum concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the ingredients of MetS in obese population.This case-control study included 40 obese subjects (20 with MetS and 20 BMI and age-matched control individuals). The age range of the participants was 20-50 years and the participants' anthropometric characteristics were measured. Serum lipids and the concentrations of oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), insulin, hs-CRP, CCK, PYY, and ghrelin were assessed with commercial ELISA kits.Serum levels of hs-CRP, total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) in patients with MetS were significantly higher while CCK and insulin concentrations were higher in obese non- MetS group (P <0.05). PYY had a negative association with waist circumference (WC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ghrelin had a positive association with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and TC in obese control group (P < 0.05). In obese patients with MetS, hs-CRP had a strong positive association with TG.The current study revealed the possible role of hs-CRP and several GI- hormones in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases and MetS.

The age of the patients ranged from 10 to 76 years, with an average of 47.8 years. Statistical analysis was done comparing differences among groups of MIFTC and WIFTC.There was an unexpected high percentage of WIFTC and also an increased number of biochemically persistent and/or recurrent disease in patients with MIFTC. A stronger correlation was observed with the tumour dimensions, rather than with the histopathological subtype.This research observed that overall survival was associated with tumour size rather than histopathological subtype and there is an important need to perform further studies to assess the effectiveness of treatment strategies.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors, through which coronavirus enters the cells of different organs, have been detected in the thyroid gland. The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis is Graves' disease in which thyroid-receptors antibodies (TRAb) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production and release.A 22-year-old woman had symptoms of palpitation, tremor, muscle weakness, anxiety and sleep disturbance. 3 weeks before the onset of these symptoms, the patient suffered from COVID-19, which lasted 14 days and was characterized by a course of moderate severity with fever up to 38°C, general weakness without shortness of breath. The patient had no pre-existing thyroid problems. Her TSH was <0.01 mU/L, FT4, FT3 and TRAb were increased. Antithyroid drugs, glucocorticosteroids and β-blockers were prescribed. During 3 months of treatment doses of methimazole, methylprednisolone and bisoprolol were gradually reduced due to the improvement of the patient's condition and thyroid tests normalization.COVID-19 infection can cause Graves' disease and thyrotoxicosis. The onset of this disease after SARS-CoV-2 does not depend on the presence of pre-existing thyroid pathology and requires the appointment of glucocortisteroids.",

In Romania, breast cancer accounts for 26.9% of all female cancer diagnoses, with an increasing incidence and significant mortality rate despite one of the lowest incidence rates in Europe. The study highlights the disparities in breast cancer outcomes across Europe, with Romania showing lower survival rates compared to Western European countries. This disparity is partly attributed to the low participation in breast cancer screening programs, where only 9% of eligible Romanian women underwent mammography in 2020, far below the European average of 60%. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Commission emphasize the importance of organized population-based screening for women aged 50-69, yet many barriers, including low health literacy, lack of awareness, and socio-economic challenges, hinder effective participation, especially among vulnerable populations. This study, conducted over three years at the \"Alessandrescu Rusescu \" National Institute for Mother and Child Health, involved 1,705 patients and aims to provide insights into improving breast cancer screening participation and outcomes in Romania.",

Hyperthyroidism caused by the acceleration of the energy metabolism leads to the occurrence of cellular oxidative stress. The aim is to evaluate the pro-oxidant / antioxidant balance and the effect of vitamin E supplementation in damage caused by the excessive administration of thyroid hormones. Materials and Methods. White, male Wistar rats were used in the study. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (1:control group, 2:animals treated with LThyroxine 10 μg/animal/day for 30 days, 3:L-Thyroxin treated rats protected with vitamin E 10 mg/animal/day). Malondialdehyde (MDA), the marker of lipid peroxidation, carbonyl proteins, SH groups, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined from the serum, while MDA, carbonyl proteins, SH groups and GSH were determined from the thyroid tissue homogenates. The results showed increased levels of carbonyl proteins (1.31±0.33 nmol/mg protein, p=0.0001) in serum in thyrotoxic group versus control, while MDA levels did not differ significantly from the control. Significantly low values of the SH groups, GSH and SOD were found (p<0.001) in the plasma of Thyroxin treated rats. Vitamin E supplementation significantly increased plasma MDA levels in the Thyroxin treated group as compared with the control group (p=0.01) and with the animals treated only with Thyroxin (p=0.04). Carbonyl protein levels in plasma of the hyperthyroid supplemented rats were also increased as compared to controls (p=0.0002). Antioxidant capacity markers in plasma of group 3 were decreased compared with group 1. The marker of lipid peroxidation (MDA) significantly decreased in thyroid homogenates of the group 2 as compared with group 1 (p=0.004). Significantly high levels of the SH groups (p=0.0006) and low levels of GSH (p=0.0001) were found in thyroid homogenates of the L-Thyroxin treated group as compared with controls. These results suggest that experimental hyperthyroidism is accompanied with increased oxidative stress and with the consumption of antioxidant enzymes in induced oxidative aggressions. No protective effects of vitamin E on oxidative stress induced by excessive administration of thyroid hormones were detected.",

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are more prone to abnormal production of some regulatory proteins secreted from the adipose tissue. This study aims to investigate serum levels of adiponectin and their correlation with metabolic and endocrine indices in PCOS.This study was conducted on 61 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women whose age and body mass index (BMI) were matched. Adiponectin serum levels were assessed and correlated with parameters of metabolic and hormonal disturbances.In PCOS women, serum levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, testosterone, LH, and LH/FSH were significantly higher, while SHBG was lower than in healthy women. Lower adiponectin was observed in both PCOS groups compared to the control group. Serum levels of adiponectin correlated inversely with BMI (r=- 0.56; p<0.001),WC(r = -0.452;p<0.001), insulin levels (r= - 0.409; p<0.001), HOMA-IR (r= -0.368; p<0.001), and free androgen index (FAI) (r= - 0.53; p<0.001).

    "abstract": "In August 2015, FDA published a black box declaring that DPP-4 inhibitors may cause severe joint pains. The impact on autoimmunity marker positivity of these drugs has not been comprehensively evaluated. We compared the incidence of arthritis/arthralgia in patients with T2DM who were using DPP-4 inhibitors and patients who were not using.A number of 93 DPP-4 inhibitor users and 107 non-users were included into the study. Arthritis/arthralgia were found in 41 of 93 (44.1%) DPP-4 inhibitor users and in 19 of 107 (17.8%) non-users (p<0.05).No inflammatory rheumatological condition was identified in 27 of 41 (65.9%) patients in DPP-4 inhibitor user group as well as in 13 of 19 (68.4%) patients in non-user group (p>0.05). After adjusting for gender the incidence for arthritis/arthralgia was significantly increased in the DPP-4 inhibitor user group (p value for any DPP-inhibitor <0.05). There was 3.77 times increased risk for arthritis/arthralgia in the DPP-4 inhibitor using group (p value= 0.001) and this risk increases 2.43 times for each year of DPP-4 inhibitor usage.Arthritis/arthralgia were more common among T2DM patients who were using DPP-4 inhibitors compared to non-users, but the seropositivity did not differ between DPP-4 inhibitor users and non-users.",

Curative treatment of PHPT is surgery and bilateral neck exploration has been replaced by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP), with the advanced imaging technologies combined with radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL).The present study analyzes the MIP data from 45 patients who underwent surgery for parathyroid adenoma and debates if MIP is a feasible technique for the treatment of PHPT.The study presents the MIP excision data of 45 hyperparathyroidism patients with a 58-month follow up period.Forty-five operations were performed for 48 parathyroid adenomas. The mean duration of operation was 22.7 (12-55) minutes. Mean follow-up was 14.2 (6-26) months. All patients had normal postoperative calcium levels and PTH levels were normal in the follow-up period, except for one persistent hyperparathyroidism.ROLL-guided MIP is a feasible technique for parathyroid surgery and reduces surgeon based failure. It also provides the widespread application of parathyroid surgery by decreasing the need for specific experience.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin is a complex molecule involved in a variety of biological processes at both the central and the peripheral level.Although its role was initially associated almost exclusively with birth and breastfeeding, recent studies are suggesting that in fact oxytocin could be involved in many other physiological and pathological processes.In this way, lately there is a growing interest towards a possible involvement of oxytocin in many etiopathogenic and psychopathological processes, as for example in the affective disorders, where the roles of oxytocin are not yet clearly understood.In this paper we shortly describe the main aspects regarding the relevance of oxytocin administration or its mechanisms in the affective disorders, as well as its relations with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cortisol secretion.It seems that although the researches on the importance of oxytocin in the affective disorders are rather at the beginning, an increasing number of evidence is supporting the involvement of oxytocin in the pathogenic processes of these psychiatric disorders.Still, the studies covering this topic are still in their early days, and the results that are trying to understand if there is a major role of oxytocin in affective disorders are not consistent enough to draw definitive conclusions and establish with certainty where the place of oxytocin in the affective disorders pathology is.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D (VD) levels were correlated with different health conditions, including reproductive disorders in males. Vitamin D action is mediated through vitamin D receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor. VDR gene promoter is embedded in a GC-rich island. The VDR gene has been shown to have several polymorphisms that affect the receptor function.To examine the relationship between Cdx-2 polymorphism (rs17883968), the methylation status of VDR's promoter and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in male infertility.A total of 69 infertile men and 37 age-matched controls were enrolled in this study. Vitamin D level assessments were detected using the electrochemiluminescent method. Cdx-2 VDR polymorphism identification was performed by PCR on DNA samples from blood, followed by restriction. Methylation of VDR gene promoter was assessed by qMS-PCR using bisulfite-treated DNA from fresh sperm.Vitamin D levels was found to be significantly decreased in infertile groups compared the controls (p=0.0279). The GG genotype was found in a higher percentage in controls and the AA genotype was higher in infertile group (p=0.0056). Infertile homozygote (GG) and heterozygote (GA) individuals had significantly higher vitamin D levels than AA homozygote. Methylation is higher in individuals with lower vitamin D levels and AA genotype is characterized by higher methylation values.The results provide new insights of Cdx-2 polymorphism is involved in vitamin D deficiency, highlighting the important role of epigenetic modification of vitamin D receptor and male infertility along with the genetic context.",

Twenty-five out of the 33 patients at whom 25OHD3 was measured had levels in the range of deficiency. 25OHD3 was not correlated with PTH or calcium levels, but was negatively correlated to the adenoma volume and positively to the PTH/volume ratio (p = 0.041 and p = 0.048, respectively).The volume of parathyroid adenoma seems to be related to preoperative PTH and 25OHD3, but not to calcium level. Vitamin D deficiency is frequently found at patients with pHPTH and may contribute to particular disease profiles, including larger parathyroid adenomas.",

ECG revealed sinus tachycardia, long QT, negative T from V1 up to V4. Chest X-ray, cardiac ultrasound and contrast cardiac MRI confirmed dilated left chambers, severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (left ventricle ejection fraction=15%) due to diffuse hypokinesia and restrictive type of diastolic dysfunction. Patient status insignificantly improved with specific heart failure depletion treatment but important signs of hypocalcemia occurred. Low levels of total and ionic serum calcium were detected (total serum calcium 3.6 mg/dL, ionic calcium=2.2 mg/dL) along with low serum levels of parathormone (10 pg/mL) and high level of phosphatemia (6.4 mg/dL). After one month of parenteral treatment with calcium and oral vitamin D, hypocalcemic signs disappeared and heart failure significantly improved.This rare adult condition is refractory to heart failure conventional therapy but promptly responds to restoration of normocalcemia. It is important to be aware of this pathophysiological setting, in order to treat it correctly.",

We present the 8-year experience of the National Institute for Mother and Child Health (INSMC) in using MEDILOG national registry for the neonatal screening of CH.Neonatal screening for CH, done by TSH measurement in dried blood spot, is organized in 5 regional centers, each with a reference laboratory.In 2018 80% of all the newborns, from 80% of the maternity hospitals, were registered in MEDILOG. After re-testing of TSH and T4/FT4 from venous blood in positive cases, the incidence of confirmed CH in 2018 was 1/3576 - 1/ 4746. In INSMC center (which includes 26 counties and Bucharest, out of 41 counties), in 2018 the incidence of positive CH cases at screening was 1/2094 (TSH cut-off ≥17 mIU/L) and of confirmed CH cases 1/3576 newborns. For positive screening cases, the median duration from birth to the INSMC laboratory result was 19 days: median of 9 days between screening and laboratory registration and 6 days between registration and test result.MEDILOG registry is a practical instrument for monitoring the steps of neonatal CH screening, the incidence of CH, the evolution of the diagnosed cases, for evaluation of iodine deficiency (by neonatal TSH), and also for research, with the aim of improving early disease detection and treatment.",

Median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. Data regarding region of provenance, smoking habits during pregnancy, education level, iodized salt intake, bread intake, iodine supplements, comorbidities (iron deficiency anemia) and birth weight were assessed. Morning urine was collected to measure median UIC. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee.Median UIC in the study group was 206 mcg/L, reflecting iodine sufficiency during pregnancy. There is a statistically significant difference between pregnant women with and without iodine supplements from rural areas (281.5 versus 196.1 mcg/L, respectively, p=0.023). In the subgroup without iodine supplementation, there was a significant difference between overweight and obese subjects vs. normal weight subjects (232.5 versus 194 mcg/L, p=0.012). Only in the subgroup with a daily intake of less than 5 slices of bread (usually containing iodized salt) we found significant differences between those with and without iodine supplements (245.2 versus 128.3 mcg/L). Iron deficiency anemia was found in 29.66% and 19.49% were current smokers during pregnancy.Median UIC in the study group was 206 mcg/L, reflecting iodine sufficiency during pregnancy. The difference between the subgroup with iodine supplements and the subgroup without iodine supplements was not statistically significant, probably due to the excessive consumption of bread and other bakery products which is traditional in Romania.",

Endocrinopathy such as thyroid dysfunctions, hypophysitis, primary adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, or hypoparathyroidism were reported and called immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Practical guidelines for monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of ICIs related endocrine toxicities are constantly updated.

In addition to the traditional explanation using the so-called caloric model, the field of endocrine disruptors (EDs), especially subgroup called obesogens, offered more light on the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. After the Second World War a correlation between an increased production of exogenous pollutants and actual obesity epidemic was suggested. \"Obesogen hypothesis\" implies that molecules called obesogens inadequately stimulate the development of adipose cells and lipid accumulation in existing adipose cells, as well as change metabolic balance or hormonal control of appetite and satiety, leading to an increase in body fat mass. The list of obesogens includes some industrial chemicals, biocides, pharmaceuticals, pollutants, and smoke. EDs from the group of obesogens may exert their effects by the impairment in the programming development of adipocytes, by an increase in energetic depot in the adipose tissue, and by influencing neuroendocrine control of appetite and satiety. Increased scientific evidence on obesogens and their mechanisms of action may help to prevent obesity and mitigate deleterious effects of the environment on human life and development. New translational studies are needed to explain the possible mechanism proposed.",

The aim of the present study was to translate ThyPRO and ThyPRO-39 into Romanian, and to evaluate reliability and cross-cultural validity. Standard methodology for translation and linguistic validation of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) was applied. The questionnaire was completed by 130 patients with benign thyroid diseases seen at Department of Endocrinology in the Emergency County Hospital, Tîrgu Mureş, Romania, between October 2015 and March 2016. Internal reliability of the Romanian version of the ThyPRO (ThyPROro) scales was assessed for multi-item scales using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. An efficient method for testing cross-cultural validity is analysis of differential item functioning (DIF). Uniform DIF between the Romanian and the original Danish sample was investigated using ordinal logistic regression. The translation process proceeded without difficulties, and any disagreements were revised by one of the developers and the language coordinator. Internal reliability for ThyPRO was satisfactory. Cronbach`s alpha coefficients for the 13 scales ranged from 0.78 to 0.93 for the ThyPROro and 0.78 to 0.87 for the ThyPROro-39. In the 85-item ThyPRO, nine instances of DIF were found. Most were minor, explaining <3% of the variation in scale score, but DIF in positively worded items were larger, with explained variance (R2's) around 10-15%. The ThyPROro questionnaire is ready for assessment of health-related quality of life in Romanian patients with benign thyroid diseases.",

The link between inflammation and MetS is not yet fully understood.

A total of 108 subjects (59 female, 49 male) who were not under any dietary restrictions and older than 17 years were selected and divided into two groups (54 with MetS and 54 healthy controls).Increased levels of IL-6, C3 and Apo-B/Apo-A1 ratios and decreased levels of Apo-A1 and TNF-α (except in patients with hypertriglyceridemia) were detected in the MetS group. Apo-A1 and TNF-α exhibited decreased levels, and IL-6, fibrinogen, C3 and Apo-B levels and Apo-B/Apo-A1 ratios increased as higher numbers of MetS criteria were met in the total study group.We found that inflammatory marker levels were not affected by an increased number of MetS criteria met in the MetS group although these levels increased in the control group with higher numbers of MetS components. The presence of a high number of MetS components does not have an additive pro-inflammatory contribution for subjects already diagnosed with MetS.",

Each specimen was scored with a semi-quantitative score system (H-score).The analysis of T staging system showed a linear correlation between the size of a tumor, expression of VEGF-C and recurrence of a disease, with a statistical significance (p < 0.0001). There was a clear and significant correlation between VEGF-C expression and T stage in patients with papillary carcinoma (p = 0.0294). Analysis of invasion of a surgical margin demonstrated significant positivity in patients with papillary thyroid cancers who expressed VEGF-C (p = 0.0207) indicating the worse prognosis of a disease. Also a statistically significant correlation was between VEGF-C and extrathyroid extension, indicating the worse prognosis (p = 0.0133) in papillary cancers. The level of VEGF-C expression was statistically significant in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (p = 0.039).This study undoubtedly demonstrates that VEGF-C expression is an evident negative prognostic factor in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, along with the classic prognostic factors, such as a larger tumor size, tumor margin involvement, extrathyroid extension, i.e. local aggressiveness.",

Total body fat mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The linear regression analysis was used to predict equations for total body fat mass from abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness acquired by ultrasound. Then, these predictive equations were tested on the validation group. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used as a further measure of agreement.When fat mass prediction equations were tested on the validation groups, measured- and estimated-total fat masses in males (p=0.9) and females (p=0.5) were found similar. A good level of agreement between measurements in males (CCC=0.84) and females (CCC=0.76) was attained.The abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness obtained from a single region by ultrasound might provide a non-invasive and quick evaluation.",

Data was statistically analysed by Student's t - test and Pearson's correlation analysis.Of the total PCOS women, 45% were obese and 34.37% had raised anti-TPO. The biochemical profile of obese PCOS women showed significantly raised FBG (p<0.0001), LH (p<0.0001), Testosterone (p<0.0001) and DHEA-S (p=0.0021) as compared to non-obese PCOS women. The LH/FSH ratio was significantly raised in PCOS women as compared to control (p<0.0001). Pearson's correlation analysis showed a significant association of anti-TPO with FBS, testosterone, LH and LH/FSH in obese PCOS and with Testosterone and LH in non-obese PCOS women using SPSS 21.The current study shows a high prevalence of AITD in euthyroid PCOS women and suggests a strong link of euthyroid obese PCOS women to autoimmunity due to the hyper-anderogenism and a higher LH/FSH ratio.",

    "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune polymorphous disease that primarily affects women of reproductive age. This gender disparity has suggested the importance of investigating the role of reproductive hormones in the pathogenesis of the disease. Estradiol, the most potent form of estrogen, plays a key role in shaping the immune system including the production of lymphocytes, the peripheral differentiation of regulatory T cells (T-regs), antibody production, and the complement and interferon systems, and has been studied in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It operates by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) α and β, initiating cellular responses including alterations in gene expression. Regulatory T cells are instrumental in preserving immunological self-tolerance and moderating immune responses. Estradiol's serum levels correlate with the expansion of CD4+CD25+ and FoxP3+ in healthy females. However, this response is reduced in lupus patients. Estradiol also interacts with microRNAs (miRNAs) in gene regulation. Hsa-miR-10b-5p, a miRNA targeting SRSF1, is overexpressed in SLE patients and its levels increase with exposure to estrogens. Other miRNAs also show correlation with plasma Estradiol levels. The precise role of Estradiol in the pathogenesis of SLE remains complex and multifaceted and is a topic for further research.",

The aim of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between these negative effects and cognitive impairment or clinical depression. Methods. Thirty nine Nigerian adults with diabetes completed the WHO Quality of LifeBrief version (WHOQoL-Bref), modified mini mental state examination (mMMSE) and a rating scale for depression (Beck’s Depression Inventory). There were two matched groups composed of 21 subjects undergoing treatment for diabetic foot ulcers (index) and 18 subjects without foot related morbidity but with evidence of peripheral neuropathy as measured by Semmes-Weinstein 5.07(10 gm) monofilament (control). Results. Patients with diabetic foot ulcers had significantly poorer scores on domains of WHOQoL particularly in physical, psychological, overall quality of life and overall health score. There was evidence of depression in both groups with the index group more significantly depressed. There was no evidence of clinically significant cognitive impairment in either group. There was a relationship between clinical depression and negative effects of diabetic foot ulcer on health related quality of life. Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that the negative impact on healthrelated quality of life in diabetic patients with foot ulcers may be more severe than in diabetics without foot related morbidity. The negative effect did not seem to cause cognitive impairment in either group.",

Also, extrapituitary malformations have been described in some cases. Genetic defects were identified only in 5% of cases. MRI findings are considered predictive for the endocrine phenotype. We aim to describe two cases with PSIS without central diabetes insipidus, anosmia and extrapituitary malformations, except for minor head dysmorphic features. The first case was referred at the age of 4 years for short stature (-4SDS for height, bone age 2 years), diagnosed with severe GH deficiency and developed central hypothyroidism and hypoprolactinemia during five-years follow-up. The second case, a 26 year old male with birth asphyxia, cryptorchidism, poor growth in childhood and adolescence (-3 to -4 height SDS), absent puberty and normal adult height (-1.18 SDS; bone age 15.5 years and active growth plates) had GH, TSH, ACTH deficiency and low normal PRL levels. Increasing medical awareness on PSIS clinical and endocrine heterogeneity may help a more early and accurate diagnosis. Corroboration of neuroimaging and endocrine data will improve our knowledge and understanding and will create premises for molecular diagnosis, genetic counseling and a better patients' management.",

Conclusion.The shape and size of goitres is important in carefully planning surgery.CT imaging with cross-sectional reconstruction should be analysed before operation.The proposed classification helps treatment planning and allows comparison of outcomes by anatomical complexity.",

The most common causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease (GD) and toxic nodular goiter (TNG). The aim of our study was to demonstrate if the underlying mechanism of hyperthyroidism, in other words autoimmunity, has an impact on the type of cardiac arrhythmias accompanying hyperthyroidism.Twenty patients with TNG and 16 patients with GD who had overt hyperthyroidism were included in the study. Age, sex, thyroid hormone levels, thyroid autoantibody positivity, thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy results were recorded. 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring was performed in all patients.Mean age was significantly higher in the TNG group compared to the GD group (62.9±11.5 vs. 48.9±8.6 years, p=0.001). Free T3 was significantly higher (7.87±3.90 vs. 5.21±1.53 pg/mL, p=0.033) in the GD group while free T4 and TSH levels were similar between the two groups. In 24-hour Holter ECG recordings nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) rates were significantly higher in the GD group than in TNG group [18.75% (n=3/16) vs. 0% (n=0/20), respectively, (p=0.043)]. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) rates were significantly higher in the TNG group compared to GD group [(30% (n=6/20) vs. 0% (n=0/16), respectively, (p=0.016)].Although free T3 levels were lower, paroxysmal AF rates were found significantly higher in the TNG group which may be associated with significantly higher age of this group. On the other hand, higher rate of nonsustained VT in the GD group may be related to either significantly higher free T3 levels or autoimmunity.",

The control group included 83 subjects, matching the patient groups by age, gender and presence of AH. GH was measured by an immunofluorometric method, while IGF-1 by IRMA method. All patients and controls were subjected to one- and two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography, color and pulse Doppler.We found a thickening of the left ventricular walls and an increase in the left ventricular mass. However, these changes were not statistically significant in all groups and no correlation with disease duration could be demonstrated. As markers of diastolic dysfunction, increased deceleration time and isovolumetric relaxation were registered, which were dependent mainly on age in a binary logistic regression analysis, but not GH or IGF-1. Using absolute values, ejection and shortening fractions were increased in some groups. Using cut-off values, a higher percentage of systolic dysfunction was demonstrated in patients compared to their corresponding controls. Engagement of the right heart ventricle was also found - increased deceleration time and decreased e/a tric ratio.In conclusion, functional impairments of both ventricles were present, with a predominance of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.",

For the induction of diabetes, 45 mg/kg streptozotocin was applied to the rats in the DM and DM+NSO groups as a single intraperitoneal dose. NSO (400 mg/kg) was orally administered through an intragastric catheter once a day over 21 days. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the myocardium were evaluated histopathologically and immunohistochemically.Compared to the control, NSO, and DM+NSO groups, the myocardial tissue samples from the rats in the DM group had significantly higher myositis, hyaline degeneration, and Zenker's necrosis. Moreover, the Bcl-2 expressions were significantly higher in the control, NSO, and DM+NSO groups than in the DM group.NSO has a protective effect on the myocardium of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, most likely via suppressing apoptosis.",

Adequate maternal iodine nutrition and maternal circulating thyroxine (T4) concentrations are essential to ensure optimum T4 placental passage which in turn will ensure transport of T4 into fetal brain cells. These processes are discussed and the role of thyroid hormone transporters is considered. The emphasis on isolated maternal hypothyroxinaemia (IH) as an important factor affecting brain development is discussed from the animal experimental point of view as well as in the clinical setting. There is evidence of neurocognitive impairment as assessed by different modalities in children up to the age of 8 years and some suggestion of increased psychiatric disorder in older persons whose mothers had IH during gestation. Although international guidelines have not in general recommended thyroxine therapy for IH the recent demonstration of adverse obstetric outcomes in women with isolated maternal hypothyroxinaemia may warrant a revision of this strategy.",

    "abstract": "Denosumab,a monoclonal IgG2 antibody directed against RANK-L,is used as a neoadjuvant therapy for inoperable or metastatic giant cell tumor of bone. Many side effects like as hypocalcemia during treatment and rarely severe hypercalcemia especially in children after discontinuation of denosumab occurred. The unpredictable onset and recurrent episodes of severe hypercalcemia increase the duration of hospitalization and the risk of complications. Persistent hypercalcemia and difficulties in management have prompted the search for different more effective therapeutic options. To share our experience with the use of oral bisphosphonate in acute and long-term therapy of severe hypercalcemia following high-dose denosumab therapy and to review the literature on this subject. We report the management of a case of severe hypercalcemia that developed 4 months after the completion of 18-month denosumab treatment in a 9-year-old girl who was followed up with a giant cell bone tumor for 6 years. Based on an evaluation aiming to determine etiology, hypercalcemia was considered as \"rebound-linked\" upon denosumab discontinuation. Severe hypercalcemia attacks recurring with an interval of 2 weeks were treated with IV bisphosphonate, but when mild hypercalcemia developed again, treatment with 70 mg per week of oral bisphosphonate was planned. After the second dose of alendronate, the calcium level always remained below 10.5 mg/dl. In the 14-month follow-up, no hypercalcemia attack was observed again. Rebound hypercalcemia can occur as an unpredictable recurrent episode at any time after denosumab cessation. Thus, the patient should be closely monitored especially in childhood due to rapid bone cycle. In long-term follow-up, oral biphosphonates can be used effectively to reduce hospitalization time and the management of especially life-threatening recurrent attacks.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is associated with different cancers, and is identified as a key pathogenic mechanism in ovarian cancer. The purpose of our study was to evaluate systemic inflammation markers, as predictive and prognostic factors, in ovarian cancer patients with initial surgical treatment. We performed a retrospective study on 60 ovarian cancer patients with primary cytoreduction surgery, between 2010-2018, with a follow-up period of at least one year. We analyzed systemic inflammation markers and their correlations with the clinical, paraclinical, tumor characteristics, or treatment particularities, and evaluated them as prognostic factors for overall survival. In the univariate analysis, no statistically significantly differences were observed, by correlating the systemic inflammation markers with age, reproductive status, FIGO stage, or type of cytoreduction. Higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were statistically significant associated with deceased patients, and lower lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) had statistical significance for living patients. For the patients in the group, the increase of NLR, as well as of PLR leads to the increased risk of death, and the increase of LMR leads to the decrease of this risk. In the multivariate regression analysis, the increase of NLR determined an increased risk of death by 9.7%, and for LMR a reduced risk of death by 46.9%. Systemic inflammation markers had no statistical significance correlated with age, reproductive status, FIGO stage, serous cancer type, or type of cytoreduction but only with overall survival. NLR is an independent risk factor, while LMR is an independent protection factor as well as optimal cytoreduction.",

Size, systolic to diastolic flow velocity (S/D) ratio, pulsatility index (PI), and resistive index (RI) of each nodule were recorded. Nodules were diagnosed as PTC or benign nodules based on histopathology. DDUS parameters were compared between PTCs versus benign nodules and micro PTCs (≤ 10 mm) versus large PTCs (> 10 mm). A correlation analysis was performed between the size and DDUS parameters.140 thyroid nodules (30 PTCs, 110 benign nodules) were obtained. The mean S/D ratio, PI, and RI values were significantly higher in PTC than in benign nodules (p values were 0.0001, 0.0003, and 0.0001 respectively). The optimal cut-off values of S/D (0.732), PI (0.732), and RI (0.738) had accuracy rates of 71%, 69%, and 69%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between micro PTC and large PTC with regards to DDUS parameters. The size and DDUS parameters of PTC showed no significant correlation.PTC has a high resistive flow pattern regardless of its size; however the clinical utility of DDUS to differentiate a PTC from benign nodule is limited.",

Anthropometric and nutritional measurements were assessed and biochemical factors including serum VEGF, IL-23, Nesfatin-1 and serum lipids were measured.Waist circumference was higher among patients with lower serum TSH concentrations. Serum HDL and T4 concentrations were lower and serum IL-23 was higher among patients with higher TSH concentrations. BMI, WC and serum HDL were negative predictors of serum TSH while IL-23 was positively associated with TSH concentrations. Serum lipids including TC, TG and LDL were also negatively associated with T3 and T4 concentrations.According to our findings, VEGF and serum IL-23 were potent predictors of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, further studies are warranted to better clarify these associations and underlying pathologic mechanisms.",

In pregnancy iron supplementations are given to all the females in India. Data are not available on the relationship between serum ferritin and GDM in Indian populations.Case control study was done on 90 women (30 GDM patients approx 28 weeks of gestation and 60 control subjects without GDM) referred to the tertiary care hospital at New Delhi. Ferritin was analysed by ELISA kit. They were analyzed for the correlation of ferritin with blood glucose in GDM patients.On comparison with blood glucose the levels of ferritin were statistically significantly high in GDM cases as compared to controls (p value 0.008). There was a negative correlation of ferritin with blood glucose level (r value -0.039, p value 0.794).Pregnancy is an equivalent of an inflammatory state and the high levels of ferritin can help in determining the need of iron supplementation given in pregnant females. Women who had high serum ferritin had the greatest risk of GDM.This study suggests a possible link between elevated serum ferritin and low-grade inflammation. Further studies in larger populations are required to establish this study.",

Demographics, symptoms, blood pressure, preoperative hormones, imaging, histology, hospital stay, complications and three subgroups [based on the modality of diagnosis - incidentaloma group (IG), genetic group (GG) and symptomatic group (SG)] were noted.86 patients included IG 51 (59.3%), GG 10 (11.62%) and SG 25 patients (29.06%). Incidence was 5.30 cases/1 million population. 33.34% of the IG had a delayed diagnosis with a mean interval of 22.95 months (4-120 months). Females presented more often with paroxysmal symptoms (PS) (p=0.011). Patients with PS and classic symptoms were younger (p=0.0087, p=0.0004) and those with PS required more inotropes postoperatively (p=0.014). SG had higher preoperative hormone levels (p=0.0048), larger tumors (p=0.0169) and more likely females. GG are younger compared with those from the IG (p=0.0001) or SG (p= 0.178).Majority of patients had an incidental and delayed diagnosis. If symptomatic, patients are more likely to be young females with higher hormone levels and larger tumors.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the class of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) modulators, especially new nonsteroidal antagonists. MR is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues and cell types. Aldosterone, the most important mineralocorticoid hormone and MR agonist, has many unfavorable effects, especially on the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, by promoting fibrosis and tissue remodelling. Classical synthetic MR antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) have proven useful in clinical practice through their antihypertensive effects in resistant forms, and through benefits on morbidity and mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These benefits are associated with important side effects, hyperkalemia being the main limitation. In the latest years, a new generation of MR modulators with a nonsteroidal structure has emerged. These compounds are more selective than classical MR antagonists, with much higher affinity for the MR than for the glucocorticoid, androgen, or progesterone receptors. Recent clinical and experimental observations suggest that nonsteroidal MR antagonists, especially finerenone, have proven superior renoprotective properties, antiproteinuric efficacy, inhibition of inflammation and heart fibrosis in animal models, without sharing the side effects of steroidal MR antagonists. Nonsteroidal MR modulators represent an interesting new therapeutic approach for the prevention and progression of chronic kidney disease and for patients with heart failure and renal disease. Despite these promising data, there are still many issues to be clarified and it is necessary to accumulate solid evidence from studies on larger numbers of patients and from head-to-head clinical trials.",

Regional, ethnic, racial or nutritional factors obscure cross-population applicability of IGF-1 reference values. Establishment of population- and assay-specific reference values requires sizable representative cohort of healthy subjects.In representative sample of healthy adult population of Serbia (N=1200, 21-80 years, 1:1 male:female) serum IGF-1 was analyzed by Siemens Immulite 2000 assay under uniform laboratory conditions. Upper and lower limit of reference range (5th - 95th percentile) were calculated for each of the 12 quinquennial age intervals. IGF-1 distribution was normalized and standard deviation score (SDS) calculated by Logarithmic and LMS methods.IGF-1 and age correlated significantly, with most prominent decline at 21-50 years, followed by a plateau up to age of 70. Gender differences were not significant overall. Plateau in age-related IGF-1 decline was less prominent in women. Correlations of IGF-1 with body mass index (BMI) or waist to hip ratio (WHR) were insignificant. Superior IGF-1 SDS transformation was achieved with LMS method, while logarithmic method was simpler to use.Normative age-specific serum IGF-1 reference values were established on a representative cohort of healthy adults in Serbia. Our results support recommendations against necessity for gender-specific or BMI- and WHR-specific reference ranges. Population-based data serve to generate IGF-1 SDS, which is valuable in rational application of consensus guidelines, proper longitudinal follow-up, advancement in efficacy and safety and personalization of treatment targets.",

Membranous/cytoplasmic staining patterns were considered as positive. Specimens without staining were considered as 0, < 5% positively stained cells as 1+, 5%-25% as 2+, 25%-75% as 3+ and >75% as 4+.CK19 was negative in most cases of FA while positive in most WDT-UMP and FV-PTCs, p<0.001.

After 42 days of treatment with testosterone (2mg/kg/day) or voluntary exercise alone or in combination, the heart of the rats has been removed and MicroRNA was extracted from the heart using miRCURYTM RNA isolation kit.Our results showed that either testosterone or exercise increased miRNA-126 expression levels in the heart of diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with testosterone and exercise at the same time had a synergistic effect on miRNA-126 levels in the heart. Furthermore, in castrated diabetes group, miRNA-126 levels were significantly decreased in heart, whereas either testosterone treatment or exercise training enhanced expression of this miRNA. Also, simultaneous treatment of castrated diabetic rats with testosterone and exercise had an additive effect on miRNA-126 expression levels.This study showed that testosterone and exercise promote an increase in the expression of miRNA-126 in the heart tissue and this may be related to cardiac angiogenesis. These results may indicate that testosterone and exercise can help to prevent progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy due to impaired angiogenesis in the heart.",

Body weight and height, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure were recorded. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance (BIA) on a Tanita BC 420 MA analyzer (Tanita Inc., Japan). Serum 25(OH)D Total, Insulin, High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood glucose, total, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. The insulin resistance index was calculated (HOMA-IR). Participants with BMI>25.0 kg/m2 underwent standard 75 g OGTT. Statistical analysis was performed on an IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 for Windows platform (Chicago, IL).Normal weight was found in 27.2 % of the participants, 24.6 % had overweight, 29.2 % -class I obesity, and 18.9 % - class II or III. Vitamin D was weakly and inversely correlated to different variables in the whole group - such as weight, WC, WC/Height, % body fat and HOMA-IR index (r=-0.231, -0.283, -0.307, -0.339, -0.328 respectively, all p<0.001). Building subgroups based on BMI led to loss of significance. Backward analysis revealed Total-C/LDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio as strongest predictors of serum vitamin D (p=0.001; R2=0.204).The association of vitamin D with blood pressure, plasma lipids, glucose and insulin is very weak on an individual level. However, several obesity indices (WC, WC/height ratio, % Body fat from BIA) might be used as a screening tool for subjects at risk for vitamin D deficiency.",

The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) are benign intratesticular masses that occur in male patients with CAH. TARTs are quite common in patients with 21OHD who were diagnosed late.A 41-year-old male patient with CAH secondary to 21OHD. The patient was referred to our endocrinology department from the andrology clinic for bilateral adrenal masses. Bilateral orchiectomy had been performed due to bilateral testicular masses and azoospermia two years ago. The pathology was reported as Leydig cell tumor. In hormonal assessment, baseline cortisol levels were low, 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels with baseline and after cosyntropin stimulation test were high. As a result of clinic and laboratory assessment, the patient was diagnosed with simple virilising CAH due to 21OHD and adrenal insufficiency. Then, prednisolone replacement was initiated. Bilateral orchiectomy tissue blocks of the patient were re-assessed and were considered TART. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral adrenal masses with 88x55 mm on the right and 41x22 mm on the left. Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was applied and pathology was reported as myelolipoma. Follow-up of the mass on the left adrenal gland is ongoing. The patient is monitored under prednisolone and testosterone replacement therapy. Early diagnosis of CAH is very important because of the complications it causes. It should be considered especially for bilateral testicular and/or adrenal masses. Both fertility and adrenal glands can be protected with an early diagnosis and an early glucocorticoid replacement.",

Systemic involvement did not develop in the two-year follow-up of the patient who did not receive additional chemotherapy treatment.It is difficult to diagnose LCH in the thyroid gland before surgery. Although surgical treatment with or without chemotherapy is recommended, surgery is not recommended alone since it is generally systemic involvement.

Demographic, clinical, biochemical, surgical and histopathological factors were assessed. Statistical multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk of IP.IP was evident in 22 (28.5%) patients who underwent TT, TT with lymph node dissection of the central compartment (CLND) and reoperation for previous hemithyroidectomy with CLND. Early symptomatic hypocalcemia 24 hours after TT was demonstrated in 12/22 (54.5%) patients, with PTH value of <14pg/mL in 7/12 (58.3%) patients, and in 6 of these 7 patients (85.7%) the PTH value was <6.3pg/mL. In 5/22 (22.7%) patients the IP was associated with biochemical hypocalcemia <8.4mg/dL, and in 5/22 (22.7%) patients anatomical damage was not associated with a reduction in plasma calcium levels. The severity of early post-op hypocalcemia was not correlated with the number of parathyroid glands left in situ. The multivariate analysis did not show statistically significant values between the clinical-pathological variables and increased risk of IP.No IP clinical-pathological risk factors have been identified during thyroid surgery. In all cases of TT, with or without CLND, the meticulous identification of the parathyroid glands, whose incidental removal is frequently associated with clinical and biochemical hypocalcemia, is recommended.",

    "abstract": "SGLT-2 inhibitors have gained importance in recent years because of their cardio-protective and reno-protective properties in diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitors, when introduced in diabetic patients, may cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. A 55-year-old woman presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, and lethargy. She was started on dapagliflozin two years back. On workup, she was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) and was managed accordingly. She improved clinically while her dapagliflozin was stopped. With a literature search, we have identified 15 case reports of EDKA with dapagliflozin since 2015. There are no standard guidelines regarding the monitoring of patients for this rare but potentially morbid complication. Moreover, the exact mechanism for this is unknown. Various precipitating factors are linked with SGLT-2 inhibitors in promoting EDKA. We recommend that customary plans should comprise educating the patient about this rare complication before commencing medication, close follow-up with serial electrolyte monitoring, and discontinuing medications in the state of infection, dehydration and recent surgery and serious illness requiring hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To assess in a bicentric study the current iodine status of schoolchildren, ten years after implementation of the universal salt iodization (USI) in Romania. Subjects and methods. 102 children from 2 towns, aged between 6 and 11 years, were included in the study group: 66 children from Sibiu, a previously endemic area for iodine deficiency disorders and 36 children from Bucharest, a previously borderline iodine intake area. Body mass index (BMI), total body surface area (BSA), median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and prevalence of goiter were evaluated. Thyroid volume was measured by ultrasonography. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. An informed consent from the parents was obtained. Results. From the 102 schoolchildren in the study group, 59 were girls and 43 were boys. Median UIC in the total number of samples was 175.2 mcg/L, reflecting a sufficient iodine intake, with statistically significant differences between the two urban regions. The median UIC was 187.35 mcg/L in the Sibiu subgroup and 160.2 mcg/L in the Bucharest subgroup (p < 0.001). The total percentage of goiter in the studied subjects was 5.88%. Percentage of goiter, determined by adjusting ultrasound thyroid volume to sex and BSA, was 1.51% in Sibiu and 13.88% in Bucharest, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.011). None of the subjects showed ultrasonographic pattern suggestive of Hashimoto thyroiditis or macronodules. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentages of overweight or obesity in the two subgroups. Conclusions. Ten years after implementation of USI in Romania, a bicentric study suggests that our country is iodine sufficient in urban areas. In order to prevent recurrence of mild iodine deficiency in schoolchildren, a persistent surveillance, use of sustainable measures and public awareness are required. Recurrence of mild iodine deficiency should be avoided, because even mild iodine deficiency impairs cognition in children.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the main cause of androgen excess in women of reproductive age, is a multifaceted, dynamic and clinically heterogenic disorder. Rotterdam 2003 ESHRE/ASRM definition criteria were recently reinforced at the NIH Consensus Meeting 2012. Concomitant identification of the clinical phenotypes of the syndrome is mandatory in medical care and clinical studies, as these are strongly related to reproductive, cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. Documentation of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) is challenging, with the AE/PCOS Task Force 2014 suggesting a threshold of ≥25 follicles/ovary in 1835 years old women when using high-frequency transducers. Elevated levels of total testosterone and/or free testosterone and/or low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) stand for androgen excess in women, as stated by the ESE Position Statement 2014. Despite evidence of increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk, increased prevalence of cardiovascular events linked to PCOS status per se is still insufficient documented, mainly because of the clinical heterogeneity of studies populations and lack of prospective data. First-line therapy in the medical management of PCOS is metformin, at least 1.5 g/d, in all patients with documented insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. According to Endocrine Society Guidelines 2013, other insulin-sensitizers (e.g. thiazolidinediones) raise safety concerns on the long-term, whereas statins need further evaluation to demonstrate their benefits in the treatment of PCOS, however, are indicated in dyslipidemic patients. Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptives (COC) are targeting androgen excess, particularly in non-insulin resistant patients, with an overall benefit to risk ratio in PCOS favoring benefits.",

Metastasis of the non-thyroid cancer to the thyroid gland was detected in 4 nodules. Twenty seven nodules from 15 patients were removed with surgery. There were 3 malignant nodules found after surgery (1 papillary, 1 follicular and 1 medullary cancer). In addition to these three thyroid cancers, two patients with benign nodules had co-incidental thyroid cancer detected after surgery. Finally, 11.1 % of thyroid nodules which underwent thyroid surgery had malignant histopathology except for co-incidental and metastatic cancers.The frequency of thyroid malignancy seems not to be substantially increased in incidental thyroid nodules detected in patients with non-thyroid cancer when these patients were evaluated in nodule-based approach.",

In women with impaired ovarian function, it seems that COCs have a positive influence on BMD. Progestin only-pills may not affect BMD, but further research is needed.

Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded, and serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were obtained. Local and systemic levels of total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) were assessed biochemically.No statistically significant difference was found among the groups regarding TAS, TOS and OSI values in serum and saliva samples (p>0.05).

Oocytes that liberated polar bodies were injected with processed semen, and were used to evaluate SDF level. Based on SDF, the data were categorized into two groups.

Unfertilized oocytes were stained by Hoechst 33258 and examined to evaluate the undecondensed sperm head in oocyte. The rates of maturation, fertilization in fertilized IVM oocytes and the percentage of undecondensed sperm in the unfertilized oocytes were assessed according to SDF.Out of 146 GV oocytes that were subjected to IVM, 101 (69 %) developed to metaphase II. The fertilization rate of IVM oocytes in group II was significantly lower than that in group I (P < 0.05). Moreover, group I, had 25 % of their unfertilized oocytes containing condensed sperm, while group II had a significantly higher number (53 %) of unfertilized oocytes containing condensed sperm (P < 0.05).SDF had a negative effect on the rate of fertilization in matured in vitro GV oocytes and could lead to an increase in the percentage of undecondensed sperm in IVM oocytes from stimulated cycles.",

    "abstract": "Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) assay is becoming the best indicator of successful IVF treatment response to fertility drugs and could be a useful marker of embryo implantation potential. Various protocols are being used for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), but there is an uncertainty regarding the implementation of the best protocol for endometriosis patients and also little evidence is available concerning the clinical value of AMH levels in endometriosis.This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of serum AMH levels for pregnancy in COS using GnRH-agonist(GnRH-a) and GnRH-antagonist(GnRH-ant) protocols in endometriosis patients.This is a cross-sectional study between March 2012 and November 2015.Data were collected from 249 COS cycles of endometriosis patients, including 129 cycles with GnRH-a and 120 cycles with GnRH-ant. Patients in each group were classified into three subgroups based on their serum AMH levels. The outcomes of ICSI program were evaluated.The ROC curve analysis showed that embryo and oocyte counts and AMH were equally predictive for pregnancy, as demonstrated by a similar area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for prediction of positive pregnancy were 70.91% and 67.01% for embryo counts, 70.91% and 67.53% for oocyte counts at the cutoff values of 5 and 7, respectively, and 83.64% and 52.58% for AMH levels at the cutoff values of 1.3ng/mL.This study demonstrates that AMH as a single test has substantial accuracy in the prediction of pregnancy using the GnRH antagonist protocol for patients with endometriosis. In other words, AMH assay prior to ovarian stimulation initiation guides the clinicians to choose the antagonist stimulation protocol for the patients with two extreme AMH levels. AMH levels can be used to individualize control ovarian stimulation in endometriosis patients.",

CK18 and CTC were found predictive for anthracycline related response in preoperative setting. Soluble E-cadherin is promising, a retrospective analysis showing a direct correlation with clinical response. CEA, CA 15-3 and HER2 ECD are not of interest for their predictive role.",

Conclusion.AMH is an important hormonal parameter for the diagnosis of PCOS.Larger clinical controlled studies are necessary in an effort to further investigate the inclusion of AMH measurement in the diagnostic criteria of PCOS.",

The prescription of pharmaceutical derivatives of opium is limited due to their possible harmful effects on the body's metabolism and tolerability by patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic opium consumption on some sexual and thyroid hormones in diabetic and non-diabetic male and female rats.This experimental study was conducted on 56 Wistar rats. The animals were divided into diabetic addicted (DA), diabetic non-addicted (DNA), non-diabetic addicted (NDA) and non-diabetic non-addicted (NDNA) groups of male and female rats. Peripheral blood samples were collected to measure the thyroid and sex hormone levels. Student's t-test was used to compare the mean values of the hormones between two groups.T3 serum level in male addicted groups significantly increased in comparison with non-addicted ones in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups. The testosterone level of male rats decreased due to the consumption of opium while it was significantly increased in diabetic and NDNA female rats in comparison with non-addicts. In DNA female animals, the mean level of 17-hydroxyprogesterone increased significantly compared with non-diabetic groups, however, it decreased in addicted females (diabetic and non-diabetic) in comparison with non-addicts. The level of DHEA-S increased significantly in diabetic and NDA male rats as compared with the non-addicted group.Opium affects the endocrine system in a sex-dependent manner, and opium could have different effects in diabetic and non-diabetic conditions.",

However, they are now extensively utilized as off label in a myriad of diseases despite their frequently serious metabolic side-effects and hyperprolactinemia.The purpose of our study was to observe long-term (one year) prolactin level change in first episode schizophrenia patients treated with one of the four AAs: olanzapine, quetiapine, amisulpride, ziprasidone.This study is an analysis of the prolactin level associated with the atypical antipsychotics used in European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST) study.Seventy-three first episode schizophrenia patients from the 113 patients, randomized to one of the four AAs treatment arms. Prolactin level was obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months for all the four AAs. Analyses have been done for each antipsychotic separately for each sex.For the male patients neither of the four antipsychotics have been associated with a statistically significant increase of prolactin level in the entire study (p>0.05). In case of the female patients, treatment with olanzapine (p=.021) and ziprasidone (p=.005) has been associated with a decrease of prolactin level in one year compared with baseline.In both men and women, the administration of these four AAs is not associated with the increase of prolactin levels, moreover, in women's case, there is a reduction of prolactin values at administration of Olanzapine and Ziprasidone. These results are optimistic, suggesting that long term administration of these antipsychotics is safe regarding prolactin level.",

A 70 year old male patient, laryngeal cancer survivor, presented with central diabetes insipidus (CDI). MRI revealed an intra-suprasellar mass of uncertain origin. Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in an efficient lesion resection with maximal pituitary sparing. Pathological report has confirmed SXG without conclusive identification of preexisting sellar lesion. Age at presentation and gender were atypical for SXG. The most frequent presenting signs of SXG were absent. Most SXG are initially misdiagnosed as CP, RCC or PA. Preoperative clinical and radiological uncertainty may impact operative planning. Differentiating from CP is crucial, due to divergent operative target goals and prognosis. Intraoperative frozen section analysis could guide surgical extensiveness. Close collaboration must include endocrinologist, neuroradiologist, neurosurgeon and pathologist. Quantity and quality of provided tissue are essential for avoiding bias in pathohistological analysis of cystic or heterogenous lesions. Awareness is needed of new pathological entities in the sellar-parasellar region. SXG should be considered in differential diagnosis of CDI-causing sellar lesions.",

Clinical presentation of Cushing syndrome can be pleomorphic, and establishing diagnosis can be difficult. Early recognition and rapid control of hypercortisolaemia are necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality in these patients. We report a series of 6 endogenous Cushing's syndromes of different etiologies (4 Cushing's disease and 2 adrenal Cushing's syndrome) assessed in our endocrine department over a decade (2009-2019). In order to highlight the diversity of clinical forms, diagnostic tools and specific management of this condition we labelled each case suggestively: the typical Cushing's disease, the Pseudo Cushing's, the elusive Cushing's disease, the mild autonomous cortisol hypersecretion, Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy and Cushing's disease with thromboembolism. We discussed their particularities which were revelatory for the diagnosis, such as dermatologic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, or reproductive signs, reviewing literature for each manifestation. We also discuss the commonalities and differences in laboratory and imagistic findings. Therapeutic approach can also differ with respect to the particular condition of each patient and the multiple choices of therapy will be reviewed.",

IRS-1 Gly971Arg polymorphism can modify tyrosine phosphorylation at a specific site of IRS-1 and may have a critical role in the development of insulin resistance (IR).The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between this polymorphism and IR in Iranian patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes.The study was conducted on 114 individuals with newly-diagnosed T2D and 118 healthy matched controls, aged 20-80 years. Fasting blood glucose and insulin were measured by the enzymatic method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Insulin-resistance was calculated by homeostasis model assessment estimated-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The gene polymorphism was examined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.There are significant differences between IRS1 Gly971Arg polymorphism and studied individuals (P<0.0001). The findings showed that the risk of developing T2D in individuals who had R-alleles was 3.74 folds higher than those without R-alleles. However, IRS1 Gly971Arg polymorphism was not associated with high HOMA-IR, high BMI and familial history of diabetes.Even though there was not a significant relationship between IRS-1 G971R polymorphism with insulin resistance and high BMI, this polymorphism was correlated to newly-diagnosed diabetic patients. Thus, the evaluation of IRS-1 G971R polymorphism may be helpful for predicting T2D new cases.",

Tumor localization was especially on the right adrenal gland (n=52, 50.98%). Primary origin of the adrenal gland tumors was in 82 cases (80.39%) and a metastatic origin in 16 cases. Average dimension for surgical resected tumors was 4.02 cm (0.9-12 cm) for the LS group as compared to 7.22 cm (1.3-19 cm) for OS group with a predominant type of surgery represented by adrenalectomy and a conversion rate of 2.94%. The hospital stay was 7.22 days (5-12 days) in the LS group versus 12.72 days (6-57 days) in OS group with significant differences (p<0.01). Also, the postoperative recovery was significantly different (6.5 days versus 2.62 days, p<0.01).Laparoscopic approach represents the gold standard in adrenal gland tumors less than five centimeters in size. Adrenalectomy is mostly performed by LS and adenoma is the most frequent histopathologic type, while pheochromocytoma is operated through OS. LS has a significantly reduced hospitalization and postoperative stay compared to OS.",

Demographic parameters, BMI, thyroid function tests, laboratory parameters for malabsorption were recorded.We observed at least two-fold increase of free thyroxine levels during the test, which was considered pseudomalabsorption. Euthyroidism was achieved in two patients by increasing the LT4 dosage and in one patient with a change in the preparation. TSH decreased significantly after being informed about compliance in one patient. Another one was given LT4 twice weekly, but TSH remained elevated because of nonadherence.The LT4 loading/absorption test is a valuable tool to confirm the diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption. Informing patients, changing the preparation, increasing the dose, supervised intake of daily/weekly LT4 forms are treatment options for managing these cases.",

Chromogranin A (CgA) seems to potentially be a good marker for tumors of chromaffin origin.To assess the differentiating value of CgA in the diagnostic work-up of pheochromocytoma.Retrospective study of operated patients with adrenal incidentaloma with lesions > 10 Hounsfield's units (HU) on CT.Thirty patients (11 males, 19 females; aged 61.5±21 years) were enrolled in the study. Patients using medications interfering with the assessment of CgA and metanephrines were excluded. Two groups were formed: those with pheochromocytoma (Ph, n=16) and those with non-pheochromocytoma (N-Ph, n=14) lesions. Data included radiological features of masses, serum CgA and 24-hour urine metanephrines (24 - HUM) concentrations.No difference in 24-HUM level nor tumor size or density was found between groups Ph and N-Ph. Median serum CgA concentration was higher in Ph group compared to the N-Ph: 99.35 (68.12-172.73) vs. 52.92 (34.37-101.26) ng/mL, respectively (P=0.04). In Ph group, the size of the lesion correlated negatively with density (r= -0.53, P=0.042). No significant correlation in CgA, 24-HUM, density or size of the lesion was found. Performed curve receiver operating characteristic (ROC) showed AUC=0.7232 for CgA. Taking into account CgA serum value of ≤ 50 ng/mL (sensitivity: 93.75%, specificity: 50.00%, P=0.012), we proposed an algorithm for management of lesions > 10 HU on CT.CgA level ≤ 50 ng/mL might be useful in initial screening evidence for the exclusion of pheochromocytoma.

The binding sites of melatonin have been identified in all GIT tissues. Melatonin can modify activities of the gut and liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of melatonin against gastric motility and secretary responses in Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. Methods. Streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose of 60 mg/kg for diabetes induction. One week after inducing diabetes, Melatonin (5, 10, 20 mg/kg/day, IP.) was injected for 14 days. Gastric acid and mucus were measured in all animals by chemical methods. Gastric motility was investigated by powerlab system. Results. Streptozotocin induced a significant increase in blood glucose levels (p<0.001) and significant decrease in gastric acid, mucus, motility and body weight in diabetic groups. Treatment of diabetic rats with melatonin significantly reduced blood glucose (p<0.001) and increased gastric mucus (p<0.001) and motility (p<0.01 and p<0.05 in groups 4 and 5 respectively) with no effect on body weight and gastric acid concentration. Conclusion. These data suggested that melatonin treatment has a therapeutic effect on diabetic gastrointestinal disturbances by reduction of serum glucose and increasing gastric motility and gastric mucus levels, but no effect on gastric acid and body weight.

According to the results of the thyroid function tests, the subjects were divided into two groups as primary hypothyroidism (levothyroxine sodium replacement therapy given), (n = 57) and the healthy control group (n = 58). The fractal dimension (FD), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), mandibular cortical width (MCW), gonial index (GI) and mandibular cortical index (MCI) values of all patients were calculated on DPRs. The statistical analysis of all data was performed with SPSS version 22.The distributions of age and gender in the primary hypothroidism group were similar to control group (p = 0.19 and p = 0.62, respectively). The two groups did not differ statistically significantly in terms of FD, PMI, MCW, GI, and MCI.We determined that mandibular cortical and trabecular bone structure did not significantly differ between healthy individuals and patients receiving drug replacement theraphy due to hypothyroidism, but our results should be further supported with the investigation of clinical parameters.",

There were analyzed the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment for thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer published by the European and American Thyroid Associations (ETA, ATA), by British Thyroid Association, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE) and endocrine surgeons (AAES), by European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and American and European Societies of Clinical Oncology (ASCO and ESMO). We studied the national cancer registry, the institutional cancer registry and the database of nuclear medicine departments from Romania, regarding the limits and instruments as are registered at the National Nuclear Committee. The significant increase of the incidence of thyroid cancer and of the epidemiological data concerning the high percentage of clinically and ultrasoundly detected thyroid nodules, requires a debate around a consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of the differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Abnormally increased hepatic glucose production contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes. Interventions that suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis should be beneficial in improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes.It has been suggested that hepatic FTO is involved in glycemic control by regulating gluconeogenesis. Both FTO and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) positively regulate the expression of gluconeogenic genes in the liver, suggesting the possibility that ATF4 mediates the stimulatory effect of FTO on hepatic gluconeogenesis. The present study aimed to determine the effect of altered expression or activity of FTO on Atf4 and gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocyte cells.Mouse hepatocyte AML12 cells were treated with the FTO inhibitor rhein or transfected with an FTO-expressing plasmid. Levels of gluconeogenic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and Atf4 mRNA and protein were measured.Rhein treatment significantly reduced G6pc mRNA levels as well as Atf4 mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, enhanced FTO expression caused an increase in G6pc and Atf4 mRNA levels.These findings support the hypothesis that hepatic FTO participates in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene and ATF4 expression. Reducing the activity of the hepatic FTO-ATF4 pathway may be beneficial in reducing hepatic glucose production and ameliorating hyperglycemia in diabetes.",

Association between both polymorphisms and established coronary heart disease (CHD) was also analyzed in both groups with diabetes.A greater proportion of homozygous individuals for the risk allele C of rs2070744 was found among subjects with ACKD. Association between ACKD and rs2070744 was observed in a recessive genetic model, both for comparison to subjects with diabetes but no ACKD [OR 2.17 (95% CI: 1.17-4.00), p=0.014] and for comparison to healthy controls [OR 1.61 (1.03-2.52), p=0.036]. The frequency of the C allele was significantly higher among subjects with CHD, but only in the group with ACKD. No associations were found for rs1799983.NOS3 rs2070744 is associated with ACKD in population with type 2 diabetes from Gran Canaria. A link between this genetic variant and CHD in Canarian subjects with type 2 diabetes could be restricted to cases with ACKD.",

The aim of this study is to present the personal experience of the authors regarding the use of positron emission tomography-computer tomography fusion image (PET/CT), with 18 Ffluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Patients and Methods. Twenty seven cases of DTC admitted and treated in the “Prof. Ion Chiricuþa” Institute of Oncology Cluj-Napoca (IOCN), performed PET/CT investigation between 2007 and 2009, in DOTE Centre Debrecen (Hungary) and Pozitron Center Oradea (Romania). The patients underwent the surgical intervention and had histology of differentiated carcinoma; they received radioiodine therapy with I-131, had suppression therapy with thyroid hormones and had in the follow-up whole body scans (WBS) with I-131, neck ultrasound and serological determination of thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg). All patients were referred to PET/CT after radical treatment, after a negative WBS I-131 and a dynamic increase of the serological level of Tg or anti-Tg, without any clinical signs of recurrence and no neck ultrasound pathological findings. Results. All patients included in this study presented abnormal levels of Tg: between 2.76 ng/ml and 4173 ng/ml, with a median value of 43.15 ng/ml. In 23 cases (85.1%) the PET/CT results revealed the neoplasm recurrence, in 3 cases we obtained true negative results and in 1 case a false negative image; in 2 cases (7.4%) we found a second malignancy. All patients needed to change the treatment strategies. Conclusion. The significant increase of the number of DTC and the more aggressive behaviour of the disease in some situations, determines the existence of a clear strategy of treatment and monitoring, where the role of PET/CT is well defined.",

Serum salusin α, TNF α, sCRP, glucose, insulin and lipid levels were tested for all groups and results were evaluated with SPSS statistical analysis method.HDL, sCRP, salusin mean values were statistically significantly different in all 3 groups. HDL level was statistically significantly higher in control group compared to treatment group. sCRP level was higher and salusin level was lower in both treatment and non-treatment hypothyroidism groups compared to control group. When treatment and non-treatment hypothyroidism groups were compared, there was no statistically significant difference for salusin α, but HDL level was high and insulin level was low statistically significant in treatment group.Salusin α that is shown to be protective for coronary artery disease and hypertension, is found to be significantly low in hypothyroidism, thus it is a marker that increases the cardiovascular disease risk in this specific patient group.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in 1969 was the definitive step in decoding the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis, thereby opening up the era of neuroendocrinology, while it also revolutionized the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with thyroid diseases. TRH, produced in the hypothalamus, is the central regulator of the HPT. It functions via neurons originating in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which integrates multiple neuronal and humoral signals and resets the HPT axis according to variations of external and internal environmental conditions. The TRH activates TSH in the pituitary that stimulates the secretion of thyroxine from thyroid which, in turn, exerts a negative feedback on TSH and TRH secretion. However, various factors are involved in the regulation of the HPT axis. Leptin has both indirect and direct effects on TRH regulation, the former by regulating agouti-related peptide (AGRP) in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) that antagonizes the α-MSH stimulatory activity on pro-TRH gene expression in the PVN, and the latter by stimulating hypothalamic TRH expression, TRH transcription via stimulation of pro-convertase 1 and 2 expression, which lead to enhanced processing of pro-TRH into TRH. The interplay of TRH with leptin and the recently reported influence of ghrelin on the HPT axis can alter the setpoint of the axis. The polyphenol resveratrol, as recently observed, exerts an anxiolytic and antidepressant activity in subclinical hypothyroid (SCH) rats. Resveratrol, by decreasing both TSH and TRH mRNA expression, regulates the HPT axis, while in parallel it regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the hippocampus. These findings open up possibilities for the therapeutic use of resveratrol as coadjuvant, especially in overt and SCH states marked by anxiety and depression. The clinician should be aware of clinical changes that can invalidate the normal regulation of the HPT axis, the most commonly observed being medications and comorbidities.",

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), phosphate (PO4), total calcium (tCa) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were measured, along with demographic and past medical history data.Hypovitaminosis D was equally prevalent in Controls and CKD (91% vs. 96% had 25OHD<30ng/mL). Increasing proportions of hyperparathyroidism (33% - stage 2 to 100% - stage 5; p<0.001) and hyperphosphatemia (2% - stage 3 to 38% - stage 5; p<0.001) were found. Hypocalcemia was more prevalent in stage 5 (25% vs. 6% in stage 4, none in stage 3 and Controls, p<0.001). Mineral metabolism parameters correlated with eGFR. In addition, iPTH was directly associated with PO4, AP, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), but inversely with tCa and 25OHD, while negative correlation of 25OHD with age, AP, ACR, and C-reactive protein emerged. In multiple regression, eGFR was the only predictor of iPTH (Beta -0.68, 95%CI -1.35 to -0.90, R2 0.46, p<0.001), whereas age and ACR were the determinants of 25OHD (a model which explained 14% of its variation).Hypovitaminosis D was very common irrespective of CKD presence and severity, and it seems worsened by older age and higher albuminuria. Hyperparathyroidism preceded hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, and it seems mostly dependent on kidney function decline.",

The availability of these tests is limited in many laboratories, so prompt recognition and therapies are late. We present the case of a 70-year-old patient diagnosed with right lower lobe bronchopulmonary neoplasm who presented to the emergency department with an altered general condition and hypoglycemic coma. The evaluation revealed low levels of insulin and C-peptide along with an elevated IGF-2/IGF-1 ratio of more than 10, suggesting a diagnosis of lung sarcoma with production of IGF-2. Because the tumor could not be resected in this case, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed, along with glucocorticoid therapy to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia. In the case of a patient with lung sarcoma and recurrent hypoglycemia (especially severe hypoglycemia or coma), extrapancreatic non-hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia should be determinate tumor IGF-2 secretion.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying anovulation in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear, although an excessive number of small antral follicles at ultrasound scans and discrepancies with selected follicles sustain the hypothesis of altered follicular development. Anti-Mullerian (AMH) hormone is a member of TGF-b super family of growth factors produced by granulosa cells of pre- and small-antral follicle. The 2 to 3 fold increase in the number of growing follicles in the ovary from PCOS women is reflected by an increase in serum concentration of AMH and thus, this hormone may be a good marker of PCOS. Aim. This study was intended to implement ultra-sensitive ELISA measurement of serum AMH from PCOS women and search for a potential correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters. Subjects and methods. Sera from patients with PCOS (n = 42) and control women (n = 22) were used for ELISA measurement of AMH (AMH-EIA, Beckman Coulter) with sensitivity of 0.7 pmol/L. Results. We found a serum concentration of AMH almost 3 folds higher in patients with PCOS compared to controls (73.7 ± 7.5 vs. 25.7 ± 3.9 pmol/L, P < 0.0001). Differences were even higher in lean subjects. A positive correlation was found between total testosterone and LH levels, but not with serum FSH or insulin. Moreover, AMH concentration was correlated to more hyperandrogenic PCOS and with amenorrhea, and thus to the severity of the syndrome. Conclusion. Measurement of serum AMH may be used as a valuable marker for PCOS to confirm diagnosis and evaluate the extent of follicular dysfunction in relation with hyperandrogenism and menstrual disturbances.",

Testosterone secretion, expression of StarD7, StarD7 mRNA, β-catenin and changes of β - catenin localization in Leydig cells of testis of rats were tested in the four groups.mRNA and protein levels of StarD7 and β-catenin increased significantly, upon stimulation with 1 nmol/L annexin 5. Accumulation of β-catenin inside the cells and the nucleus, was observed by immunofluorescence staining, in cells treated with annexin 5. These findings indicate a possible role of StarD7 and β-catenin in the process of annexin5-mediated stimulation of testosterone synthesis.Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and StarD7 are involved in the process of annexin5 stimulation of testosterone synthesis. Activation of Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway by Annexin5, and increase in StarD7 expression lead to elevated expression of key regulatory enzymes in testosterone synthesis, thus promoting testosterone synthesis.",

We excluded patients with other causes of liver disease. Liver steatosis and fibrosis were evaluated through transient elastography, yielding two parameters: liver stiffness as an indicator of liver fibrosis stage, expressed in kPa, and liver steatosis stage, assessed by controlled attenuation parameter, expressed in dB/m. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.The analyzed group comprised 113 patients. Elastographic measurements showed that 93.8% of the patients had steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter ≥232.5 dB/m) and 70.8% severe steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter ≥290 dB/m). Severe steatosis was more common in women (75.7%) than in men (68.1%) (p<0.0001). From the patients with steatosis, 47.2% had liver stiffness values suggestive for fibrosis and 19.8% for cirrhosis. Most patients with steatosis and severe fibrosis were obese (66.7%). Triglycerides/HDLc ratio >4 correlated with hepatic steatosis (p=0.04), being more common in patients with severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (58.3%) than in those with absent or mild fibrosis (36.2%).Our study found a clear correlation between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence of liver steatosis. It correlates with body mass index, waist circumference (in men) and triglycerides/HDLc ratio. Controlled attenuation parameter is a useful noninvasive method for detection and quantification of liver steatosis.",

Hypopituitarism may also follow surgery, when hypovolemia, anticoagulation, fat/air/bone marrow microemboli can provoke a pituitary infarction/hemorrhage. Other causes of abrupt hypophyseal hypoperfusion, as hypovolemia during a septic shock, could also contribute. In the last mentioned situation, due to the complex endocrine-immune interrelation, sepsis could be masked and improperly managed.We report a case of a 72 years-old Caucasian woman, previously healthy, who underwent an orthopedic surgery for a femoral fracture. This event apparently triggered a central-origin hypothyroidism, misinterpreted as \"post-surgical psychosis\", which, in turn, masked a symptomatology of a subsequent severe sepsis. The patient was admitted in the infectious diseases department with a severe gut-origin sepsis, needing surgery and long course antibiotics. The pituitary insufficiency was reversed.Pituitary apoplexy is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening disease, and could be precipitated by successive events - in our case an orthopedic surgery and a subsequent severe sepsis. It needs recognizing (has intrinsic severity and could mask other serious conditions), treat and monitor (could progress and/or reverse).",

A thyroid storm diagnosis was initially thought, but after laboratory results showing neutrophil count near 0.06x109/L, sepsis due to neutropenia seemed the most logical hypothesis. Cephepime was promptly initiated. For thyrotoxicosis management, cholestyramine and atenolol were prescribed. In her second day of hospitalization, subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was started for an earlier medullar response. The patient was discharged after 7 days with atenolol 50mg/day and instructed to have a definite treatment for Graves disease as soon as possible.Such case purpose is to remember clinicians that sepsis diagnosis can be challenged, especially when a thyroid storm is a possible diagnosis as well.

Despite periods of panic, the scientific community demonstrated an incredible innovation potential and energy ending up in one year with new vaccines to be used in population. Researchers are interrogating on how individual genetic differences contribute to the diversity of clinical manifestations or ethnic and geographic disparities of COVID-19. While efforts were spent to understand mechanistically the infectious potential of the virus, recent progresses in molecular genetics and bioinformatics allowed the characterization of viral sequence and construction of phylogeographical maps of viral dispersion worldwide. These data will help understanding epidemiological disparities among continents and ethnic populations. Much effort was also spent in analyzing host genetics by studying individual genes involved in innate and immune responses or explaining pathogenesis of comorbidities that complicate the fate of elderly patients. Several international consortia launched already Genome wide Association Studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing strategies to identify genetic markers with immediate application in patients at risk of respiratory failure. These new genetic data are important not only for understanding susceptibility factors for COVID-19 but they also contain an important message of hope for mankind warranting our survival and health.",

On evaluation she had hypercalcemia with elevated iPTH suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of neck and 99mTc sestamibi SPECT/CT incorrectly localised the lesion as right inferior parathyroid adenoma leading to a failed initial surgery. Later CECT of the neck identified adenoma posterior to right common carotid artery which was confirmed on repeat surgery and the patient was cured.Ectopic parathyroid adenomas are both difficult to localise and are a common cause of failed initial parathyroid surgery. Surgeons should exercise caution while removing a visually normal parathyroid gland. In case of any discordance with the pre-operative localization, a meticulous systematic dissection using the conventional approach should be performed and the possibility of an undescended gland in the carotid sheath should be considered.",

Until recently \"local\" administration (inhalation, topical, intra-articular, ocular and nasal) was considered devoid of important systemic side effects, but there is no administration form, dosing or treatment duration for which the risk of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome (CS) and consequent adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be excluded with certainty.We present the case of a pregnant woman who developed overt CS with secondary AI in the second trimester of pregnancy. She had low morning plasma cortisol 6.95 nmol/L (normal non-pregnant range 166 - 507) and low ACTH level 1.54 pg/mL (normal range 7.2 - 63.3), suggestive for iatrogenic CS. A thorough anamnesis revealed chronic sinusitis long-term treated with high doses of intranasal betamethasone spray (6 - 10 applications/day, approximately 10 mg betamethasone/week, for 5 months). After decreasing the dose and switching to an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist spray, the adrenal function recovered in a few weeks without manifestations of AI. The patient underwent an uneventful delivery of a normal baby. A review of the literature showed that only a few cases with exogenous CS and consequent AI caused by intranasal GC administration were described, mostly in children, but none during pregnancy.Long-term high doses of intranasal GC may induce iatrogenic CS and should be avoided. Low levels of ACTH and cortisol should prompt a detailed anamnesis looking for various types of glucocorticoid administration.",

The need for long-term levo-thyroxine (L-T4) administration in order to control TV, as well as to normalise thyroid function, has not been well defined.Retrospective data on TV in 94 adult women with HT were analysed in an ambulatory setting in Liguria, an area of moderate iodine sufficiency. TV was evaluated by means of ultrasonography (US). Thyroid function, anthropometric data, smoking habits and pharmaceutical drugs were registered at each examination.At the baseline, an atrophic gland was noted in 16% of the women, and goitre in 13%. The women were evaluated 56 and 102 months after the baseline examination. At the time of each examination, 50%, 78% and 83% of women, respectively, were on L-T4 treatment. Baseline TV was not significantly different in women on/off L-T4 treatment. However, in those on L-T4, TV decreased significantly over the period of follow-up, while in those without L-T4 treatment, it did not change. By the end of the study, the percentage of L-T4-treated women with an atrophic gland had increased to 27%, and that of women with goitre had dropped to 6%; in untreated women, only minor changes were noted. There was a significant negative correlation between TV% change and baseline TSH levels in HT women on L-T4 treatment.The majority of HT women living in an area of moderate iodine sufficiency have normal TV. Moreover, long-term L-T4 treatment can be used to control TV, as well as to maintain normal thyroid parameters.",

Evidence has suggested the hypolipidemic effect of Fenugreek; however, its actual mechanism has not been determined yet.The purpose of our research was to investigate the effect of Fenugreek on lipid profile, liver histology and LDL receptor gene expression in male hamsters fed with high cholesterol diet.These animals were given normal diet (ND), high cholesterol diet (HCD: 2% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid added to ND), HCD supplemented with 2g and 8g fenugreek per 100g ND (HCD+FG2 and HCD+FG8) respectively for four weeks. At the end of treatment, serum lipids, lipoproteins and liver enzymes were measured. Finally, LDL receptor (LDLR) gene expression was determined in the liver of the studied animals using Real Time-PCR method and liver histological changes were evaluated by H&E staining method.A significant reduction was observed in serum triglyceride (p<0.01), total cholesterol, low and very low density cholesterol, aspartate and alanine transaminases in HCD+FG8 group (p<0.05) compared with HCD group, while serum level of HDL-c (p<0.01) increased. In addition, LDLR gene expression in HCD+FG8 group increased 7.8 folds. The results confirm the protection effect of liver tissue in HCD+FG8 group against pathological changes. There was no significant change in LDLR gene expression in HCD+FG2 group. In conclusion, fenugreek ameliorated dyslipidemia by up-regulation of LDLR gene expression and can be used as a protective agent against hypercholesterolemia.",

The malignancy rates were higher in AUS/FLUS cases with cytological atypia (28.8%). After surgery the most common malignancy was papillary thyroid carcinoma, followed by follicular carcinoma.The risk of malignancy of AUS/FLUS cases is quite high because of the heterogeneity of the group. The sub-classification of this category according to cytological or/and architecture atypia may be more useful in predicting malignancy risk. Further larger studies with ancillary techniques including molecular analysis may be more useful in determining the malignancy risk and appropriate management of this heterogeneous category.",

The second stage of the study started when the rats became obese and therefore qualified for the bariatric procedure and the third stage consisted of post-operation supervision and care. The surgical procedure, performed on 10 obese rats, consisted in reducing the size of the stomach by partial gastrectomy of a 1.5 - 2.0 cm wide and 6.5 - 7.5 cm long area on the large curvature.Showed rapid improvements in body weight and blood sugar control after 9 days.After putting the rats on a diet high in carbohydrates, sugars, lipids and fats and administering them STZ, the induction of type 2 diabetes was successful and the partial gastrectomy led to a better blood sugar control. The bariatric procedure provides a faster therapeutic response than conventional diets.",

They were first tested for baseline levels of butyrylcholinesterase, cortisol, free triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin. Secondly, chlorpyrifos was administered. Next samples were taken to determine the level of all the above-mentioned parameters.Butyrylcholinesterase was significantly decreased after exposure (p<0.001). Cortisol levels were significantly higher after clorpyrifos administration (358.75±43 vs. 241.2±35 nmoL/L)(p<0.01). Although prolactin had a growing trend (450.25±24.65 vs. 423±43.4 uI/mL), the results were not statistically significant. Both free triiodothyronine and thyroxine were significantly higher after exposure. Surprisingly, thyroid-stimulating hormone level almost doubled after exposure with high statistical significance (p<0.001), suggesting a central stimulation of thyroid axis. Butyrylcholinesterase level was proportional with thyroid-stimulating hormone level (p=0.02) and thyroxine level was inversely correlated to the cortisol level (p=0.01). Acute cholinesterase inhibition may induce high levels of cortisol, free triiodothyronine, thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. From our knowledge this is the first study dedicated to the assessment of acute changes of hormonal status in weanling animals after low-dose organophosphate exposure.Conclusion. Acute cholinesterase inhibition may cause acute phase hormonal disturbances specific to shocked patients.",

Although human tear proteomics identified many abnormal expressed proteins and proposed several pathogeneses of TAO, most of these studies focused on the active stage or mixed types in TAO. In this study we identified significantly changed proteins and preliminary revealed the potential signalling pathways and mechanisms of TAO with the late, inactive stage.Tears from TAO patients (n=6) with a CAS score < 3 and 6 control healthy subject were collected. The pooled tears were further fractionated using high pH reversed-phase chromatography, then submitted to LC-MS/MS and subsequent bioinformatic analysis.Proteomic profiling identified 107 significantly changed proteins between the inactive stage of TAO patients and healthy cases. Among these proteins, 62 were upregulated, and 45 were downregulated in TAO cases compared to healthy individuals. Enrichment analysis revealed that the immune system, cell cycle, metabolism (carbohydrate metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins), protein synthesis and degradation might play a vital role in the progress of inactive TAO. The present investigation represents the first proteomic tear study of TAO patients in the inactive stage.The results shed light on the differences between inactive TAO patients and healthy cases, thus enabling us to understand better the molecular mechanisms and potential targets for the treatment of inactive TAO.",

Cervical ultrasound illustrated a multinodular aspect of the thyroid with solid nodules and cystic-component nodules; the larger one represented a multinodular complex with necrosis areas in the left thyroid lobe, ACR TI-RADS score 4 (moderately suspicious). Functional nuclear imaging was performed for accurate differential diagnosis between thyroid vs. parathyroid localization, between cold vs. hot nodules, and eventually, for guiding the choice of a subsequent Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB). Scans described an early intense 99mTc-sestaMIBI uptake with no 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake in the left thyroid lobe larger nodule. Due to the suspicion of malignancy for this nodule, we performed an additional scan (1 hour before the classical 2 hours parathyroid delayed scan). The intense uptake persists in both delayed scans suggesting no malignant phenotype and which was confirmed after surgery by benign histology. In conclusion, using a 99mTc-sestaMIBI personalized protocol, related to the radiotracer cellular uptake mechanisms: 1 hour scan (supplementary image, corresponding to the maximum uptake pattern of 99mTc-sestaMIBI for cancer cells) and 2 hours scan (for parathyroid washout evaluation) may avoid unnecessary extensive thyroid surgery.",

Despite the extensive accumulation of knowledge about this topic, the definition of stress hyperglycemia is not updated since 2007.We performed a narrative review about stress hyperglycemia in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), aiming to improve its current definition and to give evidence supporting this.The definition of stress hyperglycemia in 2021 we recommend is: \"SH is a high ABGly in an AMI patient irrespective of DM status. It can be calculated as e.g., \"stress hyperglycemia ratio\" or \"admission glucose delta\"/\"glycemic gap\". This definition may serve to start a consensus document of the experts in the field. The evidence accumulates supporting the possibility to recognize stress hyperglycemia also in AMI patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) by calculating glycemia during the previous 2-3 months using glycated hemoglobin. Moreover, it is now obvious that 2007 definition of stress hyperglycemia did not take into account the necessity to separate cut-offs for the subgroups with vs. without DM.We demonstrated the insufficiency of the current 2007 definition of stress hyperglycemia, provided evidence-based recommendation for the improvement and suggested the need for a consensus of the experts on this topic. In order to optimize the treatment of stress hyperglycemia in numerous critical illnesses, we ought to have its universal definition (as we already have the universal definition of AMI).",

However, there are not many data on the mechanism of action.Our objective was to determine if heredity influences fracture rate: independently or through the bone mineral density; to identify also the strongest independent risk factors of osteoporotic fractures among our study population.We processed data of 541 women outpatients with an average age of 55 years, participating in an osteoporosis screening program.Our results confirm that the presence of family history significantly increases fracture prevalence, (37% vs. 17%, p<0.001, OR 2.853, p=0.001) and decreases BMD scores. Fractures occur at higher (better) T and Z-scores. The risk of having T values in the range of (0- -1) and Z values in (-1--2) is much higher in the positive group. The logistic regression analysis confirms the BMD-independent influence of heredity on fracture risk.Parental history of osteoporosis negatively affects bone density and significantly increases the incidence of fractures. The latter happens also independently of the bone density values. Timely intervention in these easy-to-detect cases may be the most effective prevention of osteoporotic fractures.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal thyroid function affect spermato-genesis and male infertility. For men, the aromatase deficiency can cause infertility. In this study, the aim is to investigate the effect of maternal hypothyroidism on offspring testicular morphology and cytochrome-P450-aromatase (P450arom) immunoreactivity.Eighteen Wistar albino pregnant rats were divided into three groups, namely A, B and K groups. Hypothyroidism was induced by adding 0.01% of propyl thiouracil (PTU) in drinking water. Hypothyroid mothers, group A: given PTU for 21 days during pregnancy, group B: given PTU for 21 days prior to pregnancy; control mothers, group K, given only water. Hypothyroid and control group mothers' pups at postnatal day (PND) 15 and 60 were sacrificed. We determined immunoreactivity intensity of P450arom and mRNA levels by RT-PCR performed in the testis tissues. ELISA method was used for thyroid function tests for T3, T4 and TSH. Structure of seminiferous tubule was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining.It was seen that the aromatase expression in 15-day-old maternal hypothyroid groups was similar to the one in the control group while there was a decline in the aromatase expression of 60-day-old groups. As for mRNA, it was determined that it had a tendency to increase over time in all groups but this increase was not significant. The tubule diameter and Johnsen's Testicular Biopsy Score diminished in all hypothyroid groups in comparison to the control group.The changes that occur in the early period of testis development due to maternal hypothyroidism negatively affect testis development in the next stages of life. This situation leads to a decline in aromatase expression in the following years.",

    "abstract": "Background.Ovarian Leydig cell tumour is a very rare steroid hormones producing mass, causing clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism.Even if the level of evidence is based on case studies, many authors (but not all) agree that raised androgens increase the cardio-metabolic risk thus early diagnosis and treatment are necessary On the other hand, the endocrine features pointing an ovarian tumour source of testosterone do not indicate the specific histological finding which needs a post-operative conformation.Case presentation.We report a case of a 60-yearold woman with a 4-year history of progressive virilisation in association with hypertension, high number of red blood cells, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia.Total testosterone was 20 times above normal with suppressed gonadotropins, inadequate for menopause.Trans-vaginal ultrasound and pelvic and abdominal computerized axial tomography imaging revealed a right ovarian solid nodule, and no evidence of alteration in the adrenal glands.Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed.Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of Leydig cell tumour.After surgery, androgen levels returned to normal and the doses of anti-hypertensive drugs were reduced.Conclusions.The hyperandrogenic state with elevated plasma testosterone and progressive signs of virilization raises suspicion of an ovarian androgen-secreting tumor.For a postmenopausal patient with hyperandrogenism the diagnosis of Leydig cell tumour should be considered.However, the exact diagnosis is provided by post-operative histological exam.Prolonged exposure to hyperandrogenism may generate cardiovascular abnormalities and metabolic syndrome which after tumor excision and removal of the source of androgen hormones are expected to significantly improve.",

It has been shown that circulating levels of irisin are low in patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. However, the information about the level of circulating irisin in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is controversial.Serum irisin was measured by an ELISA in a longitudinal prospective cohort study in 221 women. There were 156 healthy pregnant and 65 women with GDM.Circulating irisin levels were significantlly higher in the middle pregnancy compared with early pregnancy levels in healthy pregnant women and in women with GDM. Serum irisin levels were found to be lower in GDM compared to healthy pregnant women during first trimester but the difference was not observed throughout the pregnancy and it was comparable in middle pregnancy. There was a significant inverse correlation of BMI with serum irisin (r = -0.193, p = 0.004) and between HbA1c and mean glucose of OGTT with serum irisin (r =-0.377, p =0.0001) and (r = -0.147, p:0.03) in the early pregnancy of pregnant women repectively.The present study shows that serum irisin level increases throughout the gestational period from early to middle pregnancy in women with GDM, but there is no effect of irisin on the development of GDM.",

Retrosternal goitre as a cause of superior vena cava syndrome is a rare occurrence. We report the case of a middle aged man that underwent surgery for retrosternal goitre with compression of both innominate veins presenting as superior vena cava syndrome.A 50 year old man presented with a 2 year history of cyanosis of the upper limbs, head and neck, marked facial edema, plethora, dyspnea on exertion and choking sensation. Pemberton's sign was present. Computer tomography diagnosed retrosternal goitre at the level of the aortic arch, tracheal compression and important collateral circulation. Endocrine evaluation showed normal thyroid function (fT4 15.8 pmol/L) with low-normal TSH (0.5mU/L), normal calcitonin (<2 pg/mL). The patient underwent successful total thyroidectomy with cervical approach and his symptoms dramatically improved. The facial oedema persisted for the next 3 weeks.Less than 3% of superior vena cava syndromes are secondary to a variety of benign causes. Superior vena cava syndrome caused by slow growing retrosternal goitres is very rare and can be asymptomatic for a long period due to venous collateral development.Superior vena cava syndrome secondary to retrosternal goitres, a very rare occurrence, is an indication for total thyroidectomy, with low postoperative morbidity and dramatic resolution of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetic characteristics of a compound as well as the immediate consequences of its physicochemical behavior during interactions with biological structures, represent the key issues for its pharmacodynamic profile, starting from the most fundamental global aspects (i.e. central and / or peripheral action) to the most detailed ones (i.e. molecular mechanism of action). Successive metabolic reactions lead to either bioactivation or bioinactivation of the molecular entity. A particular importance is currently assigned to several molecular physicochemical descriptors, for instance the polarity degree (mirroring the changes of partition coefficients and of the permeability of biological structures), and emphasizing on distribution and renal excretion rate. The active metabolite (9-hydroxy-risperidone) of the atypical antipsychotic agent risperidone has an increased polar character and, consequently, its pharmacokinetic profile is modified compared to the parent drug: especially the penetration through the bood brain barrier and the efflux pump mediated transport were considered. In this context, the kinetic characteristics and their correlation with the pharmacodynamic properties for the two active entities, as well as the consequences dealing with the antipsychotic efficacy, the safety and efficacy profiles can be anticipated. The present approach critically asseses the available data from literature corroborated with the personal findings over the last years.",

To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and serum profile of adipokines in children with overweight or obesity. Methods. Fifty two out of 62 referred children were included in the study, with a body mass index (BMI) that exceeded 85 th percentile. Waist circumference and blood pressure (BP) were recorded, followed by the determination of: glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, insulin, adiponectin and leptin. The insulin resistance was then calculated by HOMA2 index. Results. Of the 52 children included, 28.8% have met the criteria for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. BMI and BP values were higher in children with metabolic syndrome. The higher values of leptin (69.59 ± 50;89 vs. 58.44 ± 42.28 ng/ml) and insulin resistance (1.65 ± 0.74 vs. 1.41± 0.78) in the group with metabolic syndrome were without statistical significance. We found a positive correlation, statistically significant between BMI and serum leptin (r = 0.32, p =0.02), BMI and plasma insulin (r = 0.33, p =0.01), BMI and insulin resistance (r=0.33, p=0.01), respectively. This was not noticed for serum adiponectin. Conclusion. Metabolic syndrome has a high prevalence in childhood obesity. Serum leptin (but not adiponectin) seem to have a very good correlation with some clinical and bioumoral features of the metabolic syndrome.",

Clinical data of these patients were recorded and they were screened for DPN by vibration perception threshold test (VPT), 10-G nylon monofilament test, temperature identification, and the tendon reflex test.The total combined rate of patients who were tested positive for DPN with all four screening methods was 68.7%. Patients tested positive for DPN were significantly older and had a longer disease duration than those who were tested negative (p<0.01); however, glycated hemoglobin levels, presence of hypertension, and gender did not differ significantly between them (p>0.05). Among screening methods, the highest positive rate observed among patients screened with the VPT test was 63.64% as compared to other tests. The total positive rate for temperature discrimination, 10-G monofilament and tendon reflex test were 26.79%, 11.96 % and 17.22 % respectively. In asymptomatic group VPT showed the highest positive rate for DPN (48.41%).The combination of four simple methods can improve the detection rate of DPN and identify subclinical cases. Abnormal vibration perception was the most common feature of DPN and it was associated with both disease duration and the age of the patient.",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from 23 adipose tissues of TED patients versus 20 samples from normal controls.A protein-protein interaction network of DEGs was constructed by using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes and Cytoscape 3.6.0. Several hub genes/proteins were extracted from the protein-protein interaction network based on connectivity degree. Furthermore, we used the iRegulon plugin of Cytoscape3.6.0 to predict the transcription factors (TFs).A total of 678 DEGs (538 up- and 140 down-regulated genes) were identified in TED patients. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), interleukin 2 (IL-2), G protein subunit gamma 3 (GNG3), CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPAR3), CXC motif chemokine ligand-8 (CXCL8), etc., were considered as the hub genes among the DEGs. There were 6 TFs predicted to be differentially expressed in regulating the DEGs related to TED. A total of 71 DEGs had been reported to be associated with TED in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.Through this analysis, we have identified plenty of potential biomarkers and pathways which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of TED. However, these findings require verification by more detailed future experimental studies.",

ATC tumors are automatically labeled as stage IV disease regardless of standard criteria such as tumor burden or metastasis. ATC tumors require a diversified treatment approach that includes surgical resection, followed by a complete an aggressive combination of radiation and chemotherapy and/or palliative care. Despite best efforts, 1-year overall survival of patients is 20% to 40% with nearly universal mortality rate. Consequently, novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunotherapy) have been studied, alone or in combination, to improve the dire prognosis of these patients. BRAF V600E mutation is the most common genetic mutation found in ATC. We report the case of a 57-year-old man diagnosed with stage IVc (undifferentiated) ATC with hepatic and osseous metastases. The molecular analysis of the tumor revealed a V600E BRAF-mutation. The patient was treated with Dabrafenib and Trametinib, and achieved remission 5 weeks after starting the treatment. Subsequently, he had a thyroidectomy, and pembrolizumab was added to the two tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 9 months later he is still in remission. This case illustrates the importance of obtaining molecular information in anaplastic thyroid cancer and the urgent need of studies investigating the combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and check-point inhibitors in patients with V600E BRAF- mutations.",

In the first case thyroid agenesis was diagnosed and cCMV infection was also confirmed for the hypotonia persistence after L-thyroxine treatment. In the second case thyroid dyshormonogenesis was diagnosed with maternal CMV serological conversion in the first trimester of gestation and confirmed post-neonatal infection. Incidence of CH has increased in the Italian region of Piedmont in the years 2014-2019 up to 1:1090 with higher incidence of cCMV infection in the babies with diagnosis of CH (12/1000 vs. 5-7/1000 in the newborns without CH). To our knowledge, no data on the association of cCMV infection with a CH condition have been reported in the literature to date.The described cases could be useful to alert caregivers in case of maternal seroconversion to avoid maternal and foetal hypothyroidism. On the other hand, when the clinical condition of newborns with CH diagnosis do not improve after l-thyroxine treatment, it might be important to consider cCMV infection.",

The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) plays a vital role in dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress is involved in atherogenesis.The study aimed to determine the association between Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARγ2 gene(rs1801282) and CAD risk in T2DM patients in the Iranian population.A group of 145 T2DM patients with a history of CAD were enrolled, together with 145 sex and gender-matched individuals who had neither CAD nor history of T2DM who were enrolled in a case-control study.Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was applied to genotype the PPARγ2 gene polymorphisms. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22.CC and GC genotypes of Pro12Ala had a higher frequency in the control and case groups, respectively. The GC genotype was associated with a significantly increased CAD risk compared to the CC genotype (adjusted OR= 2.66, 95% CI = 1.5-29.5, p<0.01). The mean triglycerides and total cholesterol level were significantly higher in the CC genotype than the GC genotype in both case and control groups (p<0.05). The mean level of fasting blood glucose was significantly higher in the CC genotype compared to GC genotype in the case group (p<0.05). The mean of creatinine, lipid profiles, microalbuminuria, and hemoglobin A1c had no significant difference between CC and GC genotypes in both groups (p>0.05).PPARγ2 Pro12Ala polymorphism could be an essential indicator for the increased risk of CAD in the Iranian people with T2DM.",

We aim to study the mechanism of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) on hypoxia ovarian cancer cells (OCC) and its mechanism was investigated.Knockdown and overexpression of HOTTIP in human OCC (SKOV-3, OVCAR3) were performed. The expression levels of HOTTIP and HIF-1α were monitored by qRT-PCR and WB. Transwell was conducted to validate the cell migration and invasion. ELISA was performed to calculate VEGF concentration in cells. Cell viability was monitored by CCK-8. Cell apoptosis and cycle were tested by flow cytometry. RNA pull-down was used to analyze the interaction between HIF-1α and HOTTIP.HOTTIP was highly expressed in OCC. After HOTTIP knockdown, HIF-1α expression and VEGF concentration in OCC were decreased. Cell migration, invasion, and cell viability were decreased. Cell apoptosis rate and G0/G1 phase cells were increased. RNA pull-down indicated a direct interaction between HIF-1α and HOTTIP.HOTTIP formed a positive feedback loop with HIF-1α to promote the development and metastasis of hypoxia ovarian cancer. This study provided theoretical support for the development of new OC treatment strategies.",

Antibodies directed against programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) interrupt the ability of the cancerous cell to depress the immune system.We report three patients who developed different endocrine abnormalities after treatment with nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1. First, we report a 76-year-old male presenting with generalized fat loss after treatment with nivolumab which predominantly affected his face and trunk. Second, we described the development of thyroiditis that presented with thyrotoxicosis and the expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb). Finally, we observed the emergence of adrenal insufficiency due to hypophysitis in another case.Although immune checkpoint inhibitors are an effective anticancer treatment modality, adverse effects are evident that can affect the endocrine system. These adverse events may relate to different endocrine systems that include the thyroid and pituitary glands. Also, acquired generalized lipodystrophy should be suspected in patients developing unusual fat loss after treatment with ICIs.",

In examinations, medical doctors have higher scores than the other groups in two scales. The video scores were statistically correlated in DISCERN and GQS (r: 0.874, p<0.05). In the multiple regression analyzes, a statistically significant relationship was found between the DISCERN score and duration of the videos among video features (p<0.05). On the aspect of view counts and view ratios were similar within groups (p>0.05).YTB contents may be useful for diabetes patients with cautious research.

    "abstract": "Estimation of osteoporotic hip fracture incidence and Romanian FRAX model were based on nationally reported hospital ICD 10 coding admissions of all hip fractures (without a validation process).We aimed to calculate, based on individual hospital charts analysis, the incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture in the main urban area of Romania and compare it with data reported to the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH).We retrospectively analyzed the charts of all patients (>40 years old) admitted for hip fracture in a 12-month period in hospitals with an Orthopedic Department in Bucharest and surrounding Ilfov County (11.8% of Romania population).All ICD 10 fracture and event/fall codes were validated against the charts. We calculated the age and sex adjusted incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture and used the national reported hip fracture data base for comparison.There were 2203 hip fractures of which 1997 (90.65%) were fragility fractures. The crude incidence of low-energy hip fractures was 171/100,000 (225/100,000 in women, 103/100,000 in men). The incidence rose with age to a maximum rate of 1902/100,000 in women >85 years. The NIPH-reported incidence of hip fracture was 181/100,000 for the region of interest and 176/100,000 at the national level.The incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture was lower than the incidence based on hip fractures reported codes in the national database, but the incidence of fragility fractures calculated by our group was higher than the incidence reported in previous national studies. Nationwide studies are warranted.",

Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were also found in GD patients.We aimed to assess TRAb, IgE and ANA in GD and GO patients and to evaluate the relationship between the immunological markers and smoking.This was a comparative cross-sectional study carried out in a single tertiary care center from June 2018 to January 2020.A total of 103 GD patients (mean age 51.2, 84 females) were divided into three subgroups: moderate-to-severe GO (n=36), mild GO (n=32) and \"only GD\" subgroup (n=35). Forty healthy controls (HC) (mean age 51.2, 36 females) were also included. TRAb were measured by a thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) assay in GD patients; IgE and ANA - by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all subjects.GD patients had higher IgE-positivity rate (p=0.04) and similar ANA-positivity compared to HC. Moderate-to-severe GO subgroup had the highest TBII (p<0.01), the lowest TBII-negativity rate (p<0.01) and the highest ANA-positivity rate (p=0.03) and was the only subgroup whose IgE-positivity rate was significantly higher than HC (25% vs. 7.5%). Mild GO and \"only GD\" patients had comparable TBII, TBII-negativity rate, IgE and ANA.Both GO subgroups had significantly higher smoking rate than \"only GD\" patients. Smoking was positively associated with IgE positivity (φ=0.22, p=0.03), and negatively with TBII negativity rate (φ=-0.24, p=0.02).GD patients exhibit different immunological patterns depending on the presence and severity of GO. Smoking might be just one of the factors responsible for the clinical and immunological variety of GD. Further studies are needed.",

She was referred to our clinic for the presence of an open fistula on the left groin, fibrotic scars and visible alteration of the vulvar anatomy due to numerous surgical interventions. The patient shared features of the metabolic syndrome (obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, aortic atherosclerosis), but showed no signs of virilism and no hormonal abnormality. HS was controlled using antiseptics, topical retinoids and antibiotics.This case is of particular interest given the late onset of HS, long time after menopause. The development of HS requires a complex interaction between genetic predisposing factors, endocrine dysregulation, metabolic alterations, bacterial overgrowth and an aberrant inflammatory response. Evidence points to an important role of sex-hormones in the emergence and progression of the disease, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. A better understanding of HS pathogenesis is needed to elucidate the precise way in which endocrine factors influence the disease onset and course. This would guide the way to novel therapies and a better control of this challenging disease.",

Several biochemical factors have been described to suggest severity of disease and may be correlated with preoperative imaging.This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent parathyroidectomy over a 3-year period. Preoperative calcium, PTH, vitamin D levels, ALP (alkaline phosphatase), vitamin D, serum phosphate and US and SPECT-CT positivity was noted.176 patients underwent parathyroidectomy and these were divided into 4 groups based on preoperative calcium. Overall, 61% of patients showed concordance between imaging and operative findings. Severe hypercalcaemia was associated with higher PTH levels, lower vitamin D levels, an increased rate of abnormal ALP levels, lower phosphate, male gender and highest rate of imaging concordance. Imaging positivity was associated with severe hypercalcaemia and elevated PTH levels. Level of PTH >125 pmol/L and hypercalcaemia >2.8 mmol/L are the most accurate cut-off levels for scan positivity.Biochemical factors associated with severity of the disease are directly correlated with positivity of preoperative imaging while ALP and vitamin D did not influence the preoperative imaging positivity but are associated with disease adversity. Serum phosphate level independently predicted results of parathyroid US.",

Percent identified as Asian was 26% (higher than local prevalence of 8%). Average BMI was 21.6 kg/m2. Clearly identifiable causes of osteoporosis were noted in 57% (inflammatory disorder, glucocorticoid or antacid exposure, prolonged immobilization and alcoholism were most prevalent). Of the remainder, full work up was performed only in 8%. Endocrine consultation and white race predicted thoroughness of secondary work-up.Fragility fractures, leanness and Asian race were common in women with very low T-score.

    "abstract": "Aim: to evaluate the type of surgery performed in pulmonary carcinoids. Methods. Retrospective study on database of 2282 cases of surgical patients operated in the Clinic of Thoracic Surgery between 1994 and 2004, in which 92 cases of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors were included, representing 4% of lung cancers. From these 92 cases, 32 were typical and 60 were atypical carcinoids, 29 women and 63 men. Results. The mean age was 39.2±18 for typical carcinoid and 51.9±13 for atypical carcinoid. More than half of the carcinoid tumors were in 1B stage - 48 cases; the rest of the tumors were staged as: stage 3A - 20 cases, stage 2B - 12 cases, stage 4 - 5 cases, stage 3B - 4 cases and stage 1A - 3 cases. As surgical interventions, there were performed: 63 classical lung resections, 23 bronchoplastic lung resections, 5 bronchial resections without lung parenchyma and 2 biopsies: 1 lung biopsy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and 1 pleural biopsy by thoracoscopy. In 9 cases of atypical carcinoids, associated surgical procedures were imposed by the tumoral extension or by the associated disorders. Conclusions. The bronchoplastic and bronchoanastomotic procedures have the major role of preserving the most of the functional pulmonary parenchyma in case of low-grade malignancies, such as carcinoid tumors. Along the pulmonary resection, the authors consider that mediastinal lymphadenectomy is mandatory, even in case of typical carcinoid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To describe an unusual case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in a man, presenting with an elevated serum Insulin like growth factor-1(IGF-1) level. Case report. We report the case of a 27 year old male presenting with a 2 week history of severe headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an adenoma-like pituitary. The physical examination was normal, laboratory tests revealed secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism along with an elevated IGF-1. Complete transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary mass was done. Tissue analysis was diagnostic for lymphocytic hypophysitis. No evidence of a somatotroph adenoma was found. After surgery the patient developed panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Discussion. IGF-1 is a sensitive disease related marker in acromegaly and corresponds to disease activity. However, it should not be used as the sole marker for diagnosis of disease. Inflammatory lesions of the pituitary gland, such as lymphocytic hypophysitis, can clinically and radiologically mimic tumors of the sellar region. Conclusion. We report an index case of a young male who presented with elevated serum IGF-1 level in the setting of lymphocytic hypophysitis. This case illustrates the dilemma associated with reliance on the IGF-1 levels for diagnosis of acromegaly, since an elevated IGF-1 level in the presence of a pituitary mass may not always be a somatotroph tumor. We propose the differential diagnosis should also include autoimmune hypophysitis.",

    "abstract": "Recent updates on the epidemiology, diagnosis, complications and therapy in acromegaly have been published in the 1st 2017 issue of Pituitary journal. A review of 12 epidemiological studies published since 2004 shows that the prevalence of acromegaly ranges 2.8 - 13.7 cases per 100,000 people and the annual incidence rates range 0.2 - 1.1 cases/100,000 people. The median age at diagnosis ranges between 40.5 and 47 years. At the time of diagnosis, over 2/3 of the patients have macroadenomas. Acromegalic osteopathy is characterized by increase in bone turnover, alterations in bone microarchitecture and high risk of vertebral fractures, which occur in about 1/3 of acromegaly patients. Fractures may occur even in the presence of normal bone mineral density (BMD), in close relationship with male gender, hypogonadism, and active acromegaly. Following treatment for acromegaly in 48 patients, the mean trabecular bone score decreased by 3.0 (±7.0) %, whereas BMD at the lumbar spine increased by 3.2 (±4.9) % (both P<0.01). Alterations in trabecular bone architecture may explain the persistent fracture risk despite the increase in BMD after disease control. Stereotactic radiotherapy in acromegaly after surgery and/or during medical therapy provide tumor control in 93-100% of patients at 5-10 years and endocrinological remission in 40-60% of patients at 5 years, with a hypopituitarism rate of 10-50% at 5 years. Hypofractionated radiosurgery is an optimal option for tumors located near the optic structures, due to its lower toxicity for the optic nerves compared to single-dose radiosurgery. A dose-response model for visual pathway tolerance to SRS has been recently published.",

Immunohistochemical stainings of HGF and c-Met were analysed by using antibodies against HGF and c-Met.We found the degeneration in seminiferous tubule epithelium and disorganization of spermatogenetic cell series in testis tissues of diabetic rats. We also determined decrease both in seminiferous tubule diameter and Johnsen's scores in diabetic group. The expressions of HGF and c-Met in seminiferous tubule epithelium and in spermatogenic cells (especially spermatocytes and spermatids) were significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to those of control. Insulin treatment significantly reduced the diabetes-induced morphological changes and HGF/c-Met over expressions in the diabetic rat testis.HGF/c-Met pathway might have a role in diabetes- induced testicular damage. Drugs acting on this pathway might be effective to prevent or delay the testicular damage induced by diabetes.",

Changes in NP levels and their roles in cardiovascular adaptations in pregnancy and labor have not been clear.The present study aimed to investigate the changes and correlations in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and OT during labor and the postpartum period.Blood samples were collected from 29 healthy pregnant women in the active phase of spontaneous labor, 15 minutes after delivery and 3 hours postpartum. Plasma levels of OT and the stable N-terminal fragments of NPs (NT-proANP, NT-proCNP, NT-proBNP) were measured using enzyme or electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.The plasma levels of NT-proANP and NT-proCNP significantly decrease 3 hours postpartum compared to the active phase of labor and to 15 minutes after delivery. The plasma NT-proBNP levels significantly higher after delivery and 3 hours postpartum compared to the active phase of labor. A significant correlation exists between OT and NT-proANP levels during the active phase of labor and 15 minutes after delivery.The data show that during labor and postpartum, the plasma concentrations of the NPs change differently. Elevations in NT- proBNP after delivery suggest that BNP may be involved in postpartum adaptations. The correlations between OT and ANP levels indicate that OT may be partly responsible for the increased levels of ANP and may have a role in the modification of the cardiovascular system.",

    "abstract": "The expression of menin in the thyroid gland has long been debated. Animal models with targeted inactivation of menin in the thyroid gland have shown that its inactivation might play a role in the progression to a more aggressive type of cancer. Human studies are conflicting, some have identified mutations in the MEN1 gene in a sub-type of oncocytic thyroid carcinomas, while others have not identified a higher prevalence of thyroid cancer in MEN1 patients.To analyze the immunohistochemical expression of menin in different types of thyroid carcinomas.48 thyroid tumours (12 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), 6 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), 12 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTC), 5 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC), 5 oncocytic follicular carcinomas (OC), 3 oncocytic adenomas (OA) and 5 goiters (G)) were tested for nuclear expression of menin using an anti-menin antibody. The expression was considered positive, negative or decreased.The expression of menin was positive, identical to normal tissue, in 39 cases (81.25%). The expression was decreased (n=8) or absent (n=1) in 9 tumours (18.75% - 2 PTC, 5 PDTC, 2 OC) accounting for 42% (5/12) of the PDTC and 40% (2/5) of the OC.Our results show that the expression of menin is generally preserved in human thyroid carcinomas, but it can be decreased or absent in certain types of thyroid cancer. Further molecular studies are needed to evaluate to potential of menin protein in tumorigenesis.",

Focusing on 4 patients who received DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy at enrolment, switching to repaglinide also significantly improved HbA1c levels. No hypoglycemic symptoms or severe hypoglycemia was reported in patients who completed the period of 12 weeks.We demonstrated the efficacy of repaglinide in patients with T2D and severe RI. In case that DPP-4 inhibitors are not enough to achieve targeted range of glycemic control, repaglinide is another good candidate.",

So, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these drugs on male infertility caused by diabetes. Methods. In this experimental study 40 adult male NMRI mice (2025g) were obtained and randomly divided into 5groups: controls, diabetes model, diabetes+C-peptide, diabetes+Nicotinamide, diabetes+C-pepti de+Nicotinamide. Diabetes induced was confirmed 3 days after administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (65mg/kg) 15 min after an intraperitoneal injection of Nicotinamide (120mg/kg). Then C-peptide (25nmol/kg) and Nicotinamide (100mg/kg) were injected for 28 days. 24h after the last drugs injection serum samples, testes and cauda epididymis of animals were removed for hormonal, testis morphology and sperm count assessment. Results. Diabetes induced could decrease serum testosterone level and sperm count significantly (p<0.001, p<0.05 respectively). Serum LH, testosterone levels and sperm count increased in Diabetes+Cpeptide+Nicotinamide versus diabetes group (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.01 respectively). Also administration of Nicotinamide alone showed an increase in serum testosterone (p<0.001). Conclusion. The results of this study demonstrated that combined administration of Nicotinamide and C-peptide improved diabetes induced male reproductive disorders by enhanced serum LH, testosterone levels and sperm count in diabetic mice.",

Recently, a study performed on a nationwide cohort of 6671 Danish healthy pregnant women and published in June 2016 in Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (4) showed first trimester values of TSH varied according to gestational week. Up to sixth week of pregnancy, TSH levels had nonpregnant reference ranges. During weeks 9- 12, TSH serum level were 0.4 mUI/L lower than non-pregnancy upper limits, with lower range of 0.1 mUI/l. So, the use of uniform limits of TSH normality for the entire first trimester may lead to frequent misclassification and unnecessary treatment given. Although with indolent behavior, patients with encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) are often treated as classical papillary thyroid carcinoma. In a retrospective study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology(5), authors reevaluated 268 EFVPTC. In group 1(noninvasive EFVPT), patients observed for 10 -26 years and all were alive with no evidence of disease. Based on this low risk of adverse outcomes of patients from group 1, authors suggested a new nomenclature for this thyroid tumor: \"noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)\".",

We included patients with biochemically proven PHPT and positive pre-operative localization studies. We excluded patients with negative localization studies, suspected multiglandular disease, concomitant thyroid disorders and chronic renal failure.60 patients were included, 27 in group A (Romanian cohort) and 33 in group B (UK cohort). We noted significant differences between groups in pre-operative serum calcium and phosphorus levels (p<0.5). There were no differences between groups regarding the presence of symptoms; in group A we had significantly more patients with renal calculi history (p=0.02), digestive symptoms (p=0.006) and osteitis fibrosa cystica (p=0.01). Two patients from the UK group had lithium associated hyperparathyroidism and 2 patients had genetic disease. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement (ioPTH) was available only for group B and frozen sections were selectively used in both groups. Both the adenoma size and weights were significantly higher in group A. The median operative time was significantly longer in Romanian group (p=0.001); in this group we noted the single conversion to traditional cervicotomy (3.7%) from all studied patients. In group A we noted two patients (7.4%) with failed parathyroidectomy and persistent PHPT; the cure rate was 92.5% for Romanian group and 97% for the UK group.OMIP can be performed safe with a high cure rate in \"small\" volume endocrine centres with results comparable to western experienced endocrine centres. Romanian patients presented with more severe PHPT with more frequent end-organ damage, due probably to late diagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of FOXO-1, P27Kip1, miR-27, and miR-186, and Akt1, Akt-P proteins in patients with EC and endometrial hyperplasia compared to control subjects.Samples of the endometrial tumor (n=30), normal (control) (n=30) and endometrial hyperplastic (n=30) tissue were obtained from patients referring to Arash and Imam Khomani hospitals, Tehran, Iran. Expression levels of genes and microRNAs were evaluated by qRT- PCR. Western blot analysis was applied for protein evaluation. The data were analyzed using t-test, Mann -Whitney U, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, ANCOVA and ANOVA.There was significant decrease in FOXO-1 in EC tissue compared to control tissue (p<0.05). Significant increase was observed in expression of miR-27 in patients with EC (p<0.001) and hyperplasia (p<0.01), whereas miR-186 expression level increased significantly only in patients with EC (p<0.05). P27Kip1 expression level did not significantly change in patients with EC and hyperplasia. There was a significant association between expression levels of miR-27 with FOXO-1 and P27Kip1 in patients with EC. Western blot analysis revealed higher endometrial AKT1-P protein levels in patients with EC and hyperplasia than control subjects (p<0.05).Our findings suggest that FOXO-1, miR-27, miR-186, and Akt1-P/Akt1 protein have the potential to serve as tissue biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and progression of EC in the human reproductive system.",

Magnesemia and calcemia were observed in relation with other metabolic parameters, before and after the treatment.60 obese children were compared with 35 normal weight children. Each obese child received daily, one pill, containing: 130mg docosahexaenoic acid, 25mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, vitamin A 200µg, vitamin D 1,25µg, vitamin E 2,5mg and vitamin C 30mg for three months. All the participants were instructed not to change their lifestyle.The serum values for these minerals and for 25(OH) vitamin D were lower in obese children. The obese children had insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and an imbalance of serum adipocytokines. In obese children, the body mass index was negatively correlated with calcemia (r=-0.34) and serum 25(OH) vitamin D (r=-0.33). The HOMA-IR was negatively correlated with magnesemia (r=-0.34) and serum adiponectin (r=-0.29). The treatment improved the mineral serum level, the insulin sensitivity and the adipocytokines levels.In obese children, the intake of Omega-3 fatty acids associated with antioxidant vitamins, for three months improved calcemia and magnesemia and increased insulin sensitivity.",

From the radical approach of total thyroidectomy with prophylactic central lymphatic dissection to \"active monitoring\" and opinions such as \"papillary microcarcinoma is not carcinoma\".To investigate the factors of invasiveness in papillary microcarcinoma.We included 184 patients with thyroid microcarcinoma, operated in the Department of General Surgery \"Kaspela\",Plovdiv, for a period of five years.Intra-organ metastases or multifocal growth was identified in 38 of the patients. Positive for micro and macro metastases lymph nodes in the central lymphatic basin are found in 54. In 46 of them we identified metastases in the ipsilateral, and in 21 in the contralateral central neck nodes. The analysis of patients with lateral metastases found 7 unilaterally and 3 bilaterally. Skip metastases were registered in 4 of these 10 patients.The results of our study show that despite the favorable prognosis and non-aggressive behavior of papillary microcarcinoma, factors attesting to the invasive nature of the tumor occur in 44.5% or almost half of patients. This requires careful and individual approach constructing therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with papillary microcarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Antithyroid drugs are first treatment for Graves hyperthyroidism worldwide. Although remission can be achieved in approximately 40-50% of patients in 12-18 months with antithyroid drugs, this period can be extended up to 24 months. We aimed to evaluate the effect of individual clinical/biochemical variables and GREAT score in predicting response to antithyroid drug in Graves disease.This is a retrospective single-center study including 99 patients with the first episode of Graves disease treated for at least 18 months. The patients were classified into two groups as those who responded to antithyroid medication at 18-24 months (group 1) and those who did not respond at 24 months and continued with low-dose antithyroid medication (group 2).Medical treatment response was obtained in 38 (38.3%) of the patients at 18 months, and in 19 (19.1%) patients at 24 months. Long-term medical treatment (>24 months) was given to the remaining 43 patients due to the lack of response to medical treatment. Thyroid volume and free T4 levels were higher in those followed up with long-term antithyroid drugs, and orbitopathy was more common in this group. Median anti TPO value was significantly higher in group 1 when compared to group 2 (593 U/l and 191.6 U/l respectively). More patients were classified as GREAT class 3 in group 2 when compared to group 1 (46.5% and 12,5% respectively). We analyzed the Thyroperoxidase Antibody(anti TPO) titers, which we divided into three levels, according to groups 1 and 2. Post-hoc Chi-Square analysis revealed that falling into the highest anti TPO category was significantly associated with response to medical therapy in 24 months (p <0.05).According to our study, GREAT score and anti TPO Ab titers at presentation may help predict response to ATD in Graves disease.",

Sertoli cells are found in seminiferous tubules, they are part of the blood-testis barrier. Sertoli Cells Only Syndrome (SCOS) also known as germ cell aplasia is characterized by azoospermia in which the seminiferous tubules of testicular biopsy are lined only with Sertoli cells. The expected hormone profile in SCOS is increased FSH with normal T and LH. The expected hormone profile in LCT is increased/normal FSH and LH with increased T or E2. A patient presented to our clinic with a well-circumscribed mass in his right testicle and underwent radical orchiectomy. Tumor markers were negative. Azoospermia was detected in the spermiogram. T and E2 were normal, FSH, and LH were high. Right radical orchiectomy was performed. A combination of LCT and SCOS were reported in pathology results. Azoospermia cases secondary to high androgen levels are frequently encountered in LCTs. As in the case we have presented, two different testicular pathologies may present at the same time and create an unexpected hormonal picture. Such situations can cause the laboratory to mask the clinical truth.",

The patients were divided into two groups based on the existence of distant metastasis.The two groups showed no significant difference in age, gender, WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and whether the tumor was multifocal. In the univariate analysis, significant differences were found in tumor size (p=0.021), lymphocyte (p=0.012), NLR (p=0.027), and LMR (p=0.007). According to the ROC curves, NLR had an AUC of 0.612 ± 0.097 with a cut-off value of 1.845, sensitivity of 60.0%, and specificity of 66.2% (p=0.027). LMR had an AUC of 0.638 ± 0.095 with a cut-off value of 4.630, sensitivity of 84.6%, and specificity of 35.4% (p=0.007). In the multivariate analysis, larger tumor size (OR=5.246, 95% CI 1.269-10.907, p=0.009) and higher NLR (OR=2.087, 95% CI 0.977-4.459, p=0.034) were statistically significant for distant metastases.This research reveals that pre-ablation NLR and tumor size are significantly statistically correlated with distant metastases in patients with DTC.",

But, the half life of neuromuscular blocking agents used has a reverse correlation with reliability and effectiveness of IONM. This study aimed to research the effect of Sugammadex Sodium, a specific nemuromuscular blocking agent antagonist, on nerve conduction and IONM.Twenty patients who underwent thyroidectomy under IONM followed an enhanced NMB recovery protocol-rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg at anesthesia induction and sugammadex 2 mg/kg at the beginning of operation. To prevent laryngeal nerve injury during the surgical procedures, all patients underwent intraoperative monitoring. At the same time, the measurement of TOF-Watch acceleromyograph of the adductor pollicis muscle response to ulnar nerve stimulation was performed; recovery was defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio ≥ 0.9. Age, sex, recurrent laryngeal nerve transmission speeds prior to and after operation, BMI, duration of surgery, the change in nerve transmission after drug administration and complications were analyzed.The mean age and the mean BMI were 47.6±11.82 years and 28.74±3.20, respectively. The mean operation duration was 52.65±5.51 minutes. There was no difference in either right or left RLN monitoring values before and after surgery. Following the drug injection, the TOF guard measurements on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th minutes were 23.5±4.90; 69.5±6.86; 88±4.1 and 135.9±10.62, respectively.Neuromuscular blocking antagonist use and monitoring nerve transmission speed with TOF-guard can provide a safer resection.",

Obese patients present unique challenges in the diagnosis of CHF and also therapeutic particularities. The genetic differences may be a possible explanation for the fact that some people, irrespective of their lifestyle and common classical cardiovascular risk factors, are more susceptible to develop heart failure. Moreover, the adipose tissue, a huge endocrine organ which secretes adipokines, is also a well-established source of all renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system components, being strongly involved in the pathogenesis of CHF. That is why this review will explore the possible links between the RAS genetic polymorphisms and leptin secretion in obese HF patients, trying to bring a more precise understanding of this relationship, which will undoubtedly facilitate a more appropriate treatment of HF in obese patients. We also try to explain the possible incriminated mechanisms, and plausible biological explanations for the relationship between RAS genetic polymorphisms and adipokines secretion in obese heart failure patients.",

    "abstract": "It is a challenge to determine the origin of Cushing syndrome (CS), especially in patients with low-normal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations.To evaluate the reliability of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test in patients with CS whose origin of disease was not clearly identified using ACTH values, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST), and imaging in a single tertiary referral center.Twenty-one patients with CS who were admitted to the endocrinology-metabolism clinic between 2004 and 2016 whose ACTH concentrations were 5-20 pg/mL and needed CRH stimulation test were retrospectively assessed.Nine out of 21 patients were diagnosed as having Cushing's disease (CD) and 12/21 had adrenal CS. The CRH stimulation test had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 8%, and positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 45% according to the current diagnostic criteria, respectively. An increase in ACTH ≥115% at 15 minutes and cortisol ≥86% at 60 minutes after CRH were associated with the highest likelihood ratio. The sensitivity and specificity of ACTH was 67% and 83% (AUC=0.75±0.12, 95% CI: [0.5-0.9]; p=0.03), and for cortisol it was 75% and 78% (AUC=0.71±0.15, 95% CI: [0.5-0.9]; p=0.03). Cortisol suppression of more than 64% from basal level in the HDDST suggested CD with the highest likelihood ratio. When these cut-off values were used together, both tests were negative in the patients with CD.The CRH stimulation test has low specificity to localize CS in patients with ACTH concentrations of 5-20 pg/mL according to the current diagnostic criteria. Different diagnostic criteria may be used in the CRH stimulation test and also in the HDDST in this group of patients.",

Abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis (A-BIA) is a simple method for the measurement of VAT and is a promising tool in screening and follow-up of abdominal obesity. However the role of A-BIA in dieting individuals has not been evaluated adequately in longitudinal follow-up studies.The aim of this study is to determine the role of A-BIA in identifying the changes in metabolic predictors after diet and/or exercise therapy.All patients who sought weight loss treatment underwent baseline assessment and were prescribed a program of diet. After a mean follow-up of 3.2 months, data were analyzed.Ultimately, 103 participants who reported adhering to the diet, enrolled to the study. We tested associations between changes in body composition measures and changes in laboratory measures using correlations and multivariate linear regression analysis.Mean loss of body weight was 3.4±2.8 kg. All but waist-to-hip ratio, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels changed significantly (p<0.001). Decreases in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and VAT level significantly correlated with decreases in fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin level, and HOMA-IR score (r=0.230-0.371). In multiple linear regression analysis changes in BMI and VAT significantly correlated with change in HOMA-IR score (F(7.93)=2.283, p=0.034, R2=0.147).Decreases in BMI and VAT, as determined by A-BIA, were predictors of changes in metabolic laboratory measures. A-BIA is useful for follow-up of patients receiving diet therapy for weight loss.",

Diabetes was induced in 24 of the rats by a single injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin dissolved in saline. 5 units/day NPH insulin injection was started to 10 rats as treatment group and 11 rats were followed untreated. 6 rats constituted the control group. Induction of diabetes failed in 3 animals and 3 untreated rats died during the study. After 21 days, all rats were sacrificed and their kidneys were removed to obtain histological sections to be evaluated by light microscopy.Ten treated and 8 untreated diabetic rats and 6 healthy controls, totally 24 rats completed the study. There was a significant weight loss in treated and untreated diabetic groups and a weight gain in the control group (p<0.05). Final blood glucose levels were significantly higher in untreated diabetic group when compared to treated diabetic and control groups and higher in treated diabetic group when compared to control group. Histological analysis of kidney sections showed normal morphology in control group. Changes like increased mesangium, tubular atrophy and tubules with dilated lumen and irregular cell shapes were found in the untreated group whereas, glomerulus and mesangium showed similar morphology with control group with a few changes in tubules, in insulin-treated group.In DM, renal changes start at an early point and it is possible to prevent/delay those changes at this point with early intervention of insulin treatment.",

PCOS is a prevalent disorder characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries, which benefitted from several GWASs in Asians and Europeans revealing more than 20 potential culprit genes near associated single nucleotide variations (SNV). Translation of these findings into the clinical practice raises difficulties since positive hits are surrogate SNVs linked with causative mutations by linkage disequilibrium (LD). Studies in Mediterranean populations (e.g. Southern Europe and North Africa) raise supplementary problems because of a different LD-pattern, which may disrupt the link with causative mutations. Our experience in MEDIGENE program between Tunisia and France enforces the necessity of genetic anthropology studies before translating GWAS data. Tunisians are a heterogeneous population with ancestral Berbers, European, Arab and Sub-Saharan African components while South Europeans display a high level of genetic diversity, partially explained by gene flow from North Africa. Human diversity studies require sampling from Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region that will help to understand genetic factors in complex diseases.",

Our study aims to evaluate the role of VEGF and Angiotensin II (ANG II) in the development of early severe OHSS, in high risk patients under prophylactic Cabergoline therapy.We recruited 192 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures with high risk for OHSS development. Out of these, 106 patients with OHSS were enrolled in the study, of which 28 subjects had a severe form of disease (group I), and 78 patients had a mild/moderate form (group II). We collected blood and follicular fluid from our study participants and determined serum and follicular VEGF and ANG II levels using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique.Follicular VEGF, ANG II, and serum VEGF levels were significantly higher in group I versus group II. Serum VEGF titers were 645.97 versus 548.62 (p = 0.0008), follicular VEGF titers were 2919.52 versus 1093.68 (p < 0.0001), and follicular ANG II levels were 281.64 versus 65.76 (p < 0.0001). No significant differences have been shown between the two groups for serum ANG II levels.Our study results provide evidence of a OHSS phenotype that is more prone to undergo severe clinical forms of disease, despite treatments with VEGF receptor blockers, and show that ANG II appears to play a major role alongside VEGF, in the development of these severe forms of disease.",

    "abstract": "In vitro studies of the changes about osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis potential of BMSCs were not clear. As it is the critical pathway for osteogenic differentiation and bone formation, whether or not Wnt/β-catenin signalling is involved in the changes of osteogenic and adipogenic potential of BMSCs and participates in bone content decrease of ovariectomized (OVX)osteoporosis rats has been rarely reported.BMSCs from femurs of ovariectomzed rats were isolated and cultured in vitro. The proliferation potential of BMSCs was analysed by CCK-8 assays . Osteoblastic and adipogenic differentiation potential of the BMSCs was assessed by ALP activity assay, Alizarin red S staining, Oil red O staining and RT-PCR analysis.The results demonstrated that BMSCs from bilateral ovariectomization rats were endowed with lower proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation potential but higher adipogenic potential than the control group in vitro. In addition, β-catenin was found to have been decreased in OVX BMSCs, indicating that Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways were suppressed in OVX BMSCs .Results suggested that changes in the Wnt canonical signalling pathway may be related to imbalances of osteogenic and adipogenic potential of BMSCs, and this may be an important factor related to bone content decrease in ovariectomized osteoporosis rats.",

Patients with the neurofibromin gene mutation are more likely to develop malignancies. We report the case of a 57-year-old female with NF-1 who presented during her lifetime three neoplasms: endometrial cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). We describe the clinical, radiological and histopathological features of this rare condition. There have been reported only 10 cases of ACC together with NF-1 and 18 cases of ACC with other tumors. To the best of our knowledge it is the first reported case of NF-1 diagnosed with three cancers. Our report indicates the importance of careful and all-embracing care of patients with NF-1 in order to make a thorough investigation of any symptoms that might be a manifestation of a malignant disease.",

Fasting blood samples of these 42 diabetics were collected to study adiponectin levels and other routine parameters.The average hemoglobinA1c value was 7.3±1.3%. CMT of the vitrectomized eyes were significantly correlated with atherogenic index of plasma, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and uric acid (UA). On the other hand, CMT of the nonvitrectomized fellow eyes significantly correlated with glucose levels and diabetes duration. Adiponectin, adiponectin/body mass index, adiponectin/fibrinogen were found significantly higher in the subgroup with CMT≥300μm in the vitrectomized eyes (P<0.05). UA levels were higher in the subgroup with CMT≥300μm in the fellow (nonvitrectomized) eyes (P<0.05).Although there was no relationship between CMT and hemoglobinA1c values, CMT seemed to be affected by atherogenicity, prooxidant chemical alterations in the course of inflammation, so determination of adiponectin and UA levels may be suggested before surgery to predict the atherosclerotic damage and the postoperative CMT value. Vitrectomy performed at the proper time may be helpful in metabolic remodeling process of the retinal tissue along with life style changes, well control of diabetes, and intraocular treatments.",

Our study aimed to explore the association between obesity and the negative outcomes of COVID-19 worldwide. The prevalence of obesity and overweight per country was extracted from the World Health Organization information system and, for measuring the COVID-19 negative outcomes, we calculated the cumulated notification rate and the mortality for the interval since starting of pandemic till the 29th of November 2020. We explored the linear relationship between COVID-19 and obesity by a bivariate Spearman rank correlation, interpreted using the rule of thumb for 95% level of confidence. We found globally a positive, moderate, and statistically significant correlation between prevalence of obesity and overweight and the negative outcomes of COVID-19. Some of the results found at global level were confirmed in the disaggregated analysis per WHO regions. Due to the linear association of obesity with the COVID-19 negative outcomes, effective actions are needed for keeping the health systems resilience during the COVID-19. Preventing the obese and overweight people to be infected, prioritizing access to vaccination and to adequate care and treatment could be effective.",

The inflammatory disorders of the urinary bladder represent one of the most frequent disorders associated with hormonal unbalances caused by menopause. The involvement of estrogens and mast cells in this complex mechanism mediated by neuro-hormonal pathway is well known, but the pathogenesis through which the hormonal deprivation is affecting the Estrogen Receptor expression and is predisposing to urinary bladder inflammatory changes is still argued. Objective. To determine the structural changes associated with surgically induced menopause, and the effect of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in the urinary bladder morphology, mast cell population and Estrogen Receptor (ERα) expression. Subjects and methods. The effect of ovariectomy and ERT was monitored by quantifying the number of mast cells and the structural changes that the urinary bladder suffers. By immunohistochemistry we assessed the changes of the Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) expression in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. The study was carried out on ovariectomised female rats over a period of 42 days. Results. The main alterations associated with the hormonal deprivation were represented by the growth in number of the bladder mast cells, atrophy of the urothelium and amplification of the expression of ERα from the urothelium, but not from the detrusor muscle. ERT significantly decreased the tissue expression for ERα, reduced the severity of bladder atrophy and the number of mast cells. Conclusions. The estrogenic hormonal substitution can diminish the severity of the atrophic, inflammatory and ERα changes in bladder disorders associated with ovarectomy in rat.",

Conclusion.Growth deceleration in MGD subjects is partly due to defective growth hormone secretion and partly due to growth hormone insensitivity.MGD subjects are at high risk for occurrence of gonadal tumours.Gonadectomy or biopsy of underlying dysgenetic gonads is essential prior GH therapy.Close surveillance for second neoplasm is to be considered in subjects with history of gonadal tumors prior starting GH for short stature.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of neck ultrasound, parathyroid incidentaloma (PI) emerges as an additional opportunity for incidental detection of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).This study aimed to investigate PHPT cases detected by PI and to compare them with other PHPT patients. A retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed PHPT patients between 2014 and 2020 was conducted in our hospital.The cohort of 124 subjects was divided in two groups: 22 (17.7%) PHPT patients detected by PI (PI PHPT group) and the rest of 102 PHPT patients (non-PI PHPT group). Overall, 21 PIs were discovered on ultrasound and one was found during thyroid surgery. Clinical features, work-up and management of two study groups were compared.The PI PHPT group had lower ionized calcium at diagnosis (p=0.034), lower peak serum calcium during follow-up (p<0.01), less fractures (p=0.022) and was less likely to meet the international criteria for parathyroidectomy (p<0.01). Positive sestamibi scan (p=0.022) and confirmed concordant localization in at least two different parathyroid imaging techniques (p=0.033) were more likely in the PI PHPT group. The frequency of surgical management did not differ between groups.PHPT detected by PI is clinically relevant and mostly comparable to PHPT in other patients with some features that correspond more often to a mild disease. Higher rate of positive preoperative localization in PHPT detected by PI might encourage parathyroidectomy even without the international criteria met.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic tumors account for 5-10% of all ovarian malignancies. They are usually bilateral tumors with a multinodular surface and extensive extra ovarian spread. Lung cancer is a rare source (0.3% of metastatic ovarian tumors). Among synchronous primary cancers, ovarian cancer is most frequently associated with endometrial cancer. The differential diagnosis between a primary ovarian carcinoma, synchronous primary cancers, and metastatic ovarian carcinoma is very important, as the treatment and prognosis are markedly different. We report the case of a 25-year-old woman who had been diagnosed and treated for stage IIIB small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Imaging undertaken for abdominal pain revealed a unilateral 8.5 cm ovarian tumor for which adnexectomy was performed. Histology and immunohistochemistry led to the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis from SCLC, a high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumor. This patient's particular features, all infrequent in a metastatic tumor, are the lesion's unilaterality (atypical for ovarian metastases in other cancers, but often observed in SCLC), the smooth ovarian surface with intact capsule, and the absence of intra-abdominal dissemination. The patient developed liver and vertebral metastases. This report focuses on the differential diagnosis between primary and metastatic ovarian neoplasms. We performed an extensive search of the literature on SCLC and ovarian metastases. Immunohistochemistry is essential for diagnosis when imaging and the pathological evaluation of the ovarian tumor cannot make the differential diagnosis.",

Type 2 diabetes was induced by high-fat and high-sugar diet and intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). The successfully-induced diabetic rats were divided into diabetic group (DM=18) and adiponectin intervention group (APN=18). APN group was injected with APN 10 μg/kg*d. The rats were separately sacrificed at the 4th, 8th and 12th week after the intervention. Bone microstructure and adipose tissue were observed via HE staining. Bone marrow was extracted from one side of the femur, and the supernatant was achieved by centrifugation. After BMD assessed by DXA, the other side of the femur was for further HE staining. Runx-2 expression in the bone marrow cells was detected by RT-PCR. BALP and AOPPs in bone marrow supernatant were assayed by ELISA. AGEs were detected by immunohistochemical staining.With the feeding time over, blood glucose, AOPP, and AGEs were increased, and Runx-2 mRNA, BALP, BMD were decreased in diabetic rat group(P<0.05). Oxidative stress (OS) maker (AOPP) was decreased and osteogenesis makers (Runx2 mRNA, BALP) were increased after intervention with exogenous adiponectin (P<0.05). At the 8th and 12th week, the trabecular bone became thinner and broken, and the fat cell number increased in all 3 groups, especially in the DM group. The adiponectin intervention group showed that the trabecular bone structure was moderately restored.OS is obvious in bone micro-environment in diabetic rats. OS may have an inhibitory effect on regulation of osteogenic differentiation factor Runx2, causing down regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Adiponectin may improve OS response and protect the bone structure.",

After completing his medical and scientific education in Paris under his mentor, Etienne Lancereaux, considered the founder of modern physiology, he returned to Romania where he founded the first Department of Physiology at \"Carol Davila\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy. His scientific career is marked by the publishing of 88 original research articles in renown international medical journals of the time and two Treatise on Physiology (comprising in total 8 volumes and 5976 pages). His activity as an endocrinologist reaches the peak with the discovery of insulin with the article Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive published in the Archives Internationales de Physiologie (Liege, Belgium) on August 31st, 1921. While he was not internationally or even nationally acclaimed for the discovery of insulin, his contribution to the reformation of the national education and medical system and the recommendation of his students to pioneers of their fields of interest still have reverberations even today.",

In the present article, a seven-month-old male, with renal failure and laboratory hyperthyroidism due to biotin interference is presented.High free T4 (fT4), free T3 (fT3), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG) and low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were detected in a seven-month-old male patient who has metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and suspected of metabolic disease. Anti-thyroid drug therapy was started. However, when he was re-evaluated due to the absence of euthyroidism with anti-thyroid therapy (methimazole 0.8 mg/kg /day), it was found that the patient had been given 20 mg/day biotin for acidosis for two months. Biotin interference was considered in hormone measurement. Thyroid function tests were found to be normal 12 days after discontinuation of biotin therapy.Immunoassay measurements which use biotin should be done 2-7days after the last dose of biotin in patients under biotin treatment, but this time may need be much longer in renal failure patients. During this period or if the biotin therapy cannot be stopped, alternative methods should be preferred for analysis.",

    "abstract": "Aim. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent naturally occurring antioxidant and in the past years several studies suggested the fact that ALA can have positive effects on glucose metabolism. We intended to evaluate in an open-label, non-randomized study, in usual ambulatory settings, the effect intravenous ALA infusion on fructosamine level, in patients with type 2 diabetes and painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Patients and methods. 28 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy, treated with 10 daily infusions of 600 mg ALA in 300 ml of normal saline, were included in the study. Fructosamine was measured with a colorimetric method. For the analysis of the results we have used the non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Results. There were 15 women and the mean (± SD) age and duration of diabetes were 59.39 (± 7.92) and 9.46 ± 6.19 yr respectively. Mean (±SD) HbA1c at enrolment was 7.77 ± 1.18 %. The mean (±SD) value of fructosamine decreased significantly from 568.14 (±190.67) µmol/L to 467.10 (±126.98) µmol/L (p < 0.0001). The mean decrease between the first and second measurement was 17.8%, 101.03 (±132.17) µmol/L in absolute term. Conclusions. Decrease in fructosamine concentration can be described at least as a “positive side effect” of ALA used for the treatment of the painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. As far as we know there is only one study that used fructosamine as a criterion for evaluating the safety and tolerability of orally administred ALA in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims. Increased fat accumulation associated to increased cardiometabolic risk factors is a prominent feature of type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, increased fat accumulation is not prevalent and its metabolic impact has not been fully evaluated. We aimed to evaluate differences in body composition, clinical and metabolic profile in type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients with varying degrees of adiposity. Materials and methods. Clinical, biochemical and body composition data (using a bioelectric impedance analyzer) from 96 type 1 and 253 type 2 adult diabetes patients have been collected. Results. In type 1 patients estimated visceral fat area (eVFA) increased significantly (84.3±27.9 vs. 103.0±27.9 vs. 128.1±29.1 cm 2 , p=0.006, 0.003, and 25 kg/m 2 ) type 1 patients there were no significant differences either in triglycerides (128.7±135.6 vs. 92.8±50.6 mg/dl, p=0.1), HDL-cholesterol (53.6±15.9 vs. 52.3±13.7 mg/dl, p=0.6) and uric acid levels (3.4±2.0 vs. 2.9±1.2 mg/dl, p=0.2), or in hypertension (39.5% vs. 40.0%, p=0.7) and nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis (NASH) (10.0% vs. 10.5%, p=0.6) prevalences. In type 2 patients, BMI (32.3±5.9 vs. 29.5±5.1 vs. 27.9±5.0 kg/m 2 , p=0.001, p=0.04, p<0.001) and BFM (34.5±12.7 vs. 29.6±10.2 vs. 27.1±10.8 kg, p=0.007, p=0.11, p <0.001) decreased, while eVFA did not differ across age tertiles, suggesting that older age increases central fat distribution. Compared to normal weight, overweight type 2 diabetes patients had greater triglycerides (218.8±303.4 vs. 110.9±44.9 mg/dl, p=0.01), uric acid (4.5±2.4 vs. 3.3±1.4 mg/dl, p=0.01), and lower HDL-cholesterol (43.9±12.9 vs. 54.1±15.4 mg/dl, p<0.001) serum levels, and higher prevalences of hypertension (71.8% vs. 39.4%, p=0.005) and NASH (59.1% vs. 25.0%, p=0.005). Conclusion. Visceral fat accumulation is associated with older age in both types of diabetes, but only in type 2 diabetes is associated with cardiometabolic anomalies.",

Patients and methods. Patients with moderate (Group1) and severe hypothyroidism (Group 2) were evaluated before any therapy and after 6 months of combined folic acid and levothyroxine substitution, versus control subjects. Hcy, folic acid, thyroid hormones and lipids were measured for all subjects. Thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin antibodies were measured only for Group 2. Results. Only 17 % of the cases had basal Hcy at non risk level ( 12 mmol/L ) and positive thyroglobulin. After 3 months of combined therapy, significant decrease of Hcy (p<0.0001) was observed compared with the basal level. Normalization of Hcy appears during next 3 months even with reducing the folic acid supplementation. Conclusion. Our results report moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in hypothyroid patients. This may exacerbate the cardiovascular risk traditionally attributed to lipid changes. Six months of combined therapy (L-thyroxine and folic acid) corrected hyperhomocysteinemia excluding the additional risk.",

Due to its propensity for adrenal involvement, histoplasmosis is an important differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with adrenal mass, bilateral in particular.Data on clinical presentation, pattern of adrenal involvement, radiological appearance and long-term follow-up of adrenal histoplasmosis are relatively sparse; hence we looked at it.This record based single-centre retrospective study was conducted in one of the tertiary care hospitals, situated in eastern India catering the Gangetic delta.Data on demographic characters, presenting manifestations, biochemical & hormonal parameters and radiological appearance of confirmed adrenal histoplasmosis cases (n=9), admitted between 2015-2019 have been retrieved. The treatment outcome and condition of patients after 1-4 years of follow-up has also been discussed.Four out of the nine (44.4%) patients had predisposing immunocompromised conditions in the form of diabetes and/or chronic alcoholism while rest were immunocompetent. Seven out of nine patients (77.8 %) had signs and symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, while two (22.2%) presented with only pyrexia of unknown origin. All of them had bilateral adrenal mass, though the radiologically appearances were different. All patients received anti-fungal agents with/without hydrocortisone and/or fludrocortisone. One patient died (11.1%), while majority responded favourably to treatment. Adrenocortical function did not recover completely.The possibility of adrenal histoplasmosis should always be considered in patients presenting with bilateral adrenal mass, irrespective of adrenal morphology. Treatment is effective, but many of them require supplemental hydrocortisone for quite a long period, if not lifelong. Mineralocorticoid deficiency, however, is not permanent.",

We discuss here three cases of PI3K inhibitor induced hyperglycemia and discuss the mechanism of action of these medications and treatment of this class side effect.Alpelisib (Piqray) is the newest PI3K inhibitor used in conjunction with Fulvestrant to treat specific types of breast cancer. Since PI3K is a critical mediator of insulin signaling, hyperglycemia is an on-target, unfortunate side effect of this treatment. We present a case series of severe hyperglycemia induced by the alpelisib in three women without a history of diabetes.All three women in this study had hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) negative, PI3K mutated breast cancer. They were referred to our clinic by Oncology for alpelisib-induced hyperglycemia.Review of laboratory values and glucometer values were conducted during each visit allowing treatment decisions. Two of these women are actively managed by us for their diabetes. One woman recently died due to progression of malignancy.All three women presented with new onset of severe hyperglycemia after the initiation of PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib. At least one case noted maximal glucose elevation in the hours following drug ingestion. In another, cessation of Alpelisib reversed the hyperglycemia within the span of one week.Hyperglycemia induced by PI3K inhibitors can be recalcitrant and might necessitate interruption of chemotherapy. Optimal glucose-lowering therapy remains unclear as exogenous insulin has the theoretical potential to overcome PI3K inhibition.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the incidence of malignancy in nodules whose first FNAB result was ND, and ultrasonography (USG) findings affecting malignancy and the effectiveness of repetitive biopsies.In our clinic, 156 consecutive nodules whose first FNAB were ND according to the Bethesda system and underwent thyroidectomy between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2018, directly or after repeated biopsies, were retrospectively analyzed.Malignancy was detected in 44 (28%) of 156 nodules that were ND in the first FNAB. Twenty-two (31%) of 72 nodules that underwent FNAB for the second time resulted in ND again. The malignancy rate of nodules with two consecutive ND results was 23%. Of the USG features, a significant correlation was found between malignancy and solid nodule structure (p<0.001), microcalcification (p=0.025), cervical lymphadenopathy (LAP) (p=0.004) and medium-high risk USG pattern (p=0.002). In multivariate analysis, only the solid nodule structure (p<0.002) and the presence of cervical LAP (p=0.013) resulted as independent predictive factors.Diagnostic thyroidectomy is an effective method for reaching the diagnosis in selected patients considering the USG findings.",

A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis and the choice of therapy embodies another challenge due to lack of standardized protocols. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of initial treatment, whereas the second and third-line therapy include immunomodulators and cytotoxic drugs, in addition to monoclonal antibodies. This report presents an unusual case of panhypopituitarism in a 32-year-old previously healthy male patient due to isolated hypothalamo-pituitary sarcoidosis confirmed histologically, refractory to pulse-dose glucocorticoids and then successfully treated by methotrexate. Based on our report, in patients requiring additional therapy usage of the methotrexate as the second line agent should be considered, however the time frame and the dosing schedule of methotrexate are still unknown and deserve further investigation.",

Patients were examined for presence of lipodystrophy, insulin injection frequency and dosage. Lipodystrophy was evaluated with visual inspection and palpation of all injection sites. Patients were evaluated into three categories according to daily insulin dose requirement: Group 1= Standard-dose insulin users 0.6 U/kg/day; Group 2= Medium-dose insulin users 0.61-1.9 U/kg/day, Group 3= High-dose insulin users ≥2 U/kg/day.Lipodystrophy was seen in 28% of the patients. Lipodystrophy was significantly higher in group 3. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of lipodystrophy size. Duration of insulin treatment, daily total insulin dose, daily insulin dose per weight and number of daily insulin injections were significantly higher in the group with lipodystrophy. Daily injection number of long-acting, rapidly-acting analog and total insulin injections were significantly higher in group 3 than group 1 and 2. Number of daily insulin injections and lipodystrophy frequency were significantly higher in basal-bolus insulin user group. Multivariate analysis showed that insulin injection frequency is the independent risk factor for lipodystrophy.Lipodystrophy is still a clinical problem in patients with high-dose insulin requirement and frequent insulin injections. Reducing daily insulin requirement and daily number of injections should be given priority in the management of patients to prevent the development of lipodystrophy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited neurocutaneous disease characterized by multiple hamartomas in multiple organs. However, there is limited evidence about neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in patients with TSC, and routine screening of NETs is not recommended in the guidelines. Insulinomas are also an extremely rare disease. According to our knowledge, we presented the 10th TSC patient diagnosed with insulinoma in the literature. Thirty-two years old male patient diagnosed with TSC at the age of 27 due to typical skin findings, renal angiomyolipoma, history of infantile seizures, and cranial involvement was referred to our clinic. The main symptoms of the patient were palpitations, diaphoresis, confusion, and symptoms were improved after consuming sugary foods. Seventy-two hours fasting test was performed, and a low glucose level at 41 mg/dl, a high insülin level at 21.65 µIU/mL, and a high C-peptide level at 7.04 ng/mL were found at the 8th hour. In addition, a 12x7 mm lesion in the pancreatic tail was detected in abdominal imaging. Ga-68 PET-CT (gallium-68 positron emission tomography-computed tomography) detected an increased uptake of Ga-68 in the pancreatic tail. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, and pathological evaluation was consistent with an insulinoma. The patient's symptoms improved postoperatively. Since in nearly all TSC cases, as in our case, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, such as epilepsy, are one of the main disease manifestations, and these symptoms may be confused with the clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia in insulinoma. Therefore, patients with newly developed neurological symptoms and behavioral defects should be evaluated in terms of insulinoma.",

Partial adrenalectomy and cortical sparing techniques have evolved to actually compete with total adrenalectomy, the historical gold standard treatment. Much refined imaging techniques can readily identify smaller adrenal lesions that can be addressed surgically or percutaneously given the indication. The trend towards partial adrenalectomy is straightforward in bilateral disease where steroid replacement can be avoided while for unilateral disease, normal hormonal levels can be obtained. The reviewed publications offer deep insight into the advancement of partial or cortical sparing adrenal procedures from pioneering work to large cohort studies.",

Evaluation can be made by echocardiography or biological markers among which plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The aim of our study is assessment of BNP levels in patients with PE associating or not RVD as diagnosed by classic echocardiographic criteria. We prospectively assessed 40 patients with deep venous thrombosis and confirmed PE (age range 52.5 ± 9.14 years, 22 men and 18 women), with (14) or without (26) RVD on echocardiography. Plasma BNP levels were significantly higher in RVD patients (190 ± 171.2 pg/mL vs. 15.75 ± 18.85 pg/mL, P < 0.0001). A cut-off level of plasma BNP = 50 pg/mL had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of RVD of 84% (C.I. 79% - 88%), 80% (C.I. 75% - 85%), 83% (C.I. 77% - 87%) and 79% (C.I. 75% - 84%), respectively. There was a significant correlation between plasma BNP levels and end-diastolic RV diameter (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001), RV systolic pressure (r = 0.50, P < 0.001) and the presence of a Qr complex in V 1 -lead on ECG (r = 0.55, P < 0.05). Four patients with RVD on echocardiography and syncope, all admitted relatively soon after the onset of their symptoms, had BNP in normal range. In conclusion, PE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with dyspnoea and increased plasma BNP levels. A cut-off level of 50 pg/mL could identify the RVD in patients with PE with a good sensitivity and specificity. Normal range plasma BNP levels do not exclude even a severe PE and should be interpreted with caution, especially in highly symptomatic patients with recent symptom onset.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a worldwide public health problem (both in developed and developing countries), the most frequent nutritional disease in the world, with considerable morbiditymortality and high costs for the public healthcare systems. Bariatric surgery has been found to be the only method capable of maintaining proper and long-lasting weight loss for morbid obesity. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for bariatric procedures. We studied a group of 341 patients who underwent different types of laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) and laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion (LBPD). They were evaluated preoperative (weight, BMI, comorbidities) and followed-up for 1 year: 238 patients LAGB, 46 LSG, 49 LGB and 8 LBPD. Mortality and conversion rate were nil for all groups. A significant reduction in patients’ weight was shown at 12 months postoperatively. BMI decreased from 45.6 kg/m 2 to 37.9 for LAGB, from 54.12 to 40.8 kg/m 2 for LGB and from 49.1 to 31.2 kg/m 2 for LSG. The excess weight loss for LBPD was 63%. A significant improvement of co-morbidities was noticed; all patients with type 2 diabetes have normal serum glucose levels at 1 year after surgery. Bariatric surgery is safe with a low complication rate and the outcome was similar to literature data. Although we do not benefit of a long time follow-up, the favorable results allow us to state that minimally invasive surgical techniques deserve an important place in the efforts of struggling against obesity and its consequences.",

    "abstract": "Studies of platelet function in diabetics are inconsistent, some studies reporting higher platelet reactivity, while others showed no change.We aimed to evaluate platelet indices and in vitro platelet aggregation in rats with long-lasting (28 weeks) diabetes mellitus.Twelve controls and 14 diabetic rats were investigated. Diabetes was induced in 11-week-old rats using streptozotocin (60 mg/kg,i.p.). Platelet indices and in vitro adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) agonist-, and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation were assessed at the age of 38 weeks.Compared to controls, diabetic rats presented lower platelet count and plateletcrit (both p≤0.001), and higher mean platelet volume (p<0.01). ADP- (p=0.04) and AA-induced (p<0.01) platelet aggregation were lower in diabetic compared with control rats, whereas PAR4 agonist-induced platelet aggregation was similar between the two groups (p=1.00).This study demonstrates a paradox of high intrinsic platelet reactivity and low in vitro ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregation in diabetic rats compared with non-diabetic controls. The relevance of in vitro platelet aggregation to the contribution of platelets to in vivo thromboembolic events in diabetic rats remains questionable.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia1 (MEN1) syndrome may present with various tumors. The present study reports a case of adrenal incidentaloma with unrecognised MEN1 syndrome associated with breast cancer.A 48-year-old woman presented with a 2.4cm left adrenal incidentaloma on abdominal computed tomography. Her history revealed primary amenorrhea, recurrent peptic ulcer and nephrolithiasis. Laboratory and radiologic examination revealed two pancreatic tail mass lesions with markedly elevated gastrin levels (1462 pg/mL), hypercalcemia with increased parathyroid hormone levels (72 pg/mL), a 1.5cm pituitary mass with hyperprolactinemia (234 ng/mL), a 1.0cm meningioma and a nonfunctional left adrenal mass. During this image work up, a 0.6cm nodule in the right breast was incidentally detected. Surgeries (laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, parathyroidectomy and wide local excision of breast) and pathologic findings confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and breast cancer. Carbergoline treatment for 12 months decreased prolactin levels to 27 ng/mL. Genetic testing using peripheral blood revealed a pathogenic variant in MEN1 on chr11q13 (NM_000244.3:c.1365+1_1365+11 del, GTGAGGGACAG, heterozygous).Considering the increasing incidence of adrenal incidentaloma and 20% prevalence of adrenal tumors in patients with MEN1, it is important to rule out MEN1 association in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Additionally, breast cancer was detected during MEN1 work-up in this case. Female patients with MEN1 are at increased risk for breast cancer. Therefore, intensified breast cancer screening at a relatively young age should be considered in female MEN1 patients.",

A 49-year-old male patient was consulted when he was admitted to the department of neurology in our hospital.The physical examination demonstrated the characteristics of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.The neurological examination shows bilateral symmetrical bradykinesia, dysphagia, and moderate dysarthria.In the laboratory examination PTH: 46.5 ng/L(15-65), Ca:8.6 mg/dL (8.6-10.2),P:2.7 mg/dL (2.3-4.5) were detected and were all within the normal ranges.Consequently, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism was decided as a diagnosis.G protein alpha subunit mutation (Gsα) was not detected due to technical limitations.Conclusion.When a patient is diagnosed as Fahr's syndrome, we should keep in mind parathyroid disorders.Fahr's syndrome must be evaluated in patients showing intracranial calcification accompanied by parathyroid diseases.",

The primary variable was patient/caregiver-reported treatment adherence (assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months on a 5-item Likert scale), secondary variables included treatment satisfaction assessed by the treating physician and patient/caregiver on a 5-point scale.Most patients did not miss any treatment injections in any 3-month period between assessments (≥79.8% of patients were 100% compliant). The incidence of missed injections was higher among patients <7 years of age than older children, but no differences between genders was observed. At study end, 94.3% of patients/caregivers and 94.3% of physicians reported complete satisfaction with treatment.Overall treatment adherence to NutropinAq was high in the Romanian GHD paediatric population, and a high level of treatment satisfaction was reported by patients/caregivers.

    "abstract": "The risk of needing lifelong thyroid hormone supplementation is an important factor affecting treatment decisions for both patients and clinicians ahead thyroid lobectomy. The purposes of this study were to assess the predictive factors of levothyroxine medication after thyroid lobectomy.We retrospectively reviewed 252 patients who had undergone lobectomy for benign thyroid nodules between April 2009 and April 2017. We conducted two independent analyses: patients who started taking levothyroxine after surgery were compared with those who did not, and patients who did not need levothyroxine at last follow-up were compared with those who required continued treatment. We investigated the correlations of patient clinicopathological characteristics and levothyroxine medication after lobectomy.Ninety-eight patients started levothyroxine after surgery. Of these, 34 patients successfully ceased medication and 64 patients continued treatment as of their last follow-up. In multivariate analysis, older age and preoperative TSH ≥2.0mIU/L were associated with levothyroxine initiation after surgery. In terms of continuity of levothyroxine, both older age and TSH ≥ 3.0mIU/L showed a significant correlation with continuous medication. We created a risk-scoring system to predict likelihood of starting and maintaining levothyroxine using the two significant factors in each comparison. A risk score of 3 or more indicated an increased risk of starting levothyroxine (specificity = 81.8%; sensitivity = 48.0%). A risk score of 3 or more indicated increased risk of continuous medication, (specificity = 94.2%; sensitivity = 35.9%).Greater age and higher preoperative TSH levels correlated with initiation and continuity of levothyroxine medication after lobectomy.",

    "abstract": "If not diagnosed at birth, congenital hypothyroidism (CH) can cause deleterious, irreversible neurodevelopmental sequels. The importance of thyroid newborn screening (NBS) is therefore well established.To evaluate the efficacy of NBS for CH in North-East Romania.Retrospective, descriptive study involving 271662 newborns screened between 2010 and 2019 for CH and phenylketonuria in maternities from six Romanian North-Eastern counties by measuring neonatal TSH (neoTSH) in the whole blood extracted from the heel between days 3 and 5 after birth. Values found higher than a cut-off level of 10 mIU/L were followed by serum evaluation of TSH and fT4 for the confirmation of CH. Thyroid ultrasound was further performed at children found with CH.NeoTSH was found elevated in 417 newborns, but CH was subsequently confirmed in only 57 cases (1/4766 newborns). Mean age at the time when diagnosis was communicated was of 37.2 ± 15 days (between 9 and 157 days). Mean age when therapy was started was of 44.2 ± 17.9 days (between 13 and 160 days) with a mean delay of one week from diagnosis (between 0 and 62 days). Thyroid ultrasound revealed athyreosis in only 3 cases, atrophic thyroid gland in other 10 cases, whereas the thyroid was described as present in the remnant 44 cases. The number of first year follow-up visits greatly varied from 0 to 5, with an average of 2.NBS allowed rapid diagnosis of CH in North East Romania. The communication of diagnosis to families and therapy onset were however often delayed. Diagnosis and therapy onset before the age of two weeks, as well as a tighter follow-up should be assured by the healthcare system. Etiological diagnosis should be more accurate, for a better prognosis of disease severity, as well as the possibility of genetic advice in selected cases.",

It is difficult to diagnose and manage due to recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.We present a peculiar case of hyperparathyroidism as the parathyroid tissue was in unusual location. Scintigraphy done revealed a lesion suspicious for ectopic parathyroid tissue in the retrosternum in a 58 years old female patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. No pathologic lesions were found on neck exploration, subsequently, sternotomy was performed and suspicious lesion removed but microscopic evaluation of the frozen section found no parathyroid tissue in the resected specimen. A decision to perform thymectomy and total resection of pericardial fatty tissue was made. Final histopathology revealed parathyromatosis and confirmed the first case of pericardial type 1 parathyromatosis.Long-term remission is rare in these patients, sometimes needing medical treatment and multiple surgeries. In this patient, there was no recurrence during the four years follow-up. In patients with no history of neck surgery, primary parathyromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.",

Pregnancy is associated with gradually increased maternal levels of these molecules, also detected in significant amounts in umbilical cord blood serum samples. Aim, patients and methods. To establish the relationships of maternal and umbilical adiponectin, resistin and OPG levels to both maternal and fetal anthropometric measurements and insulin sensitivity, 28 mother-newborn pairs were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected in a fasting state, after delivery, and serum insulin, C-peptide, sex hormone-binding globulin, adipocytokines, OPG and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were measured. Results. Compared to maternal values, umbilical serum adiponectin levels were about 3-fold higher; additionally, significantly higher resistin and lower OPG levels were observed. Stratification of umbilical and maternal adiponectin levels according to tertiles of birth body weight demonstrated significantly lower maternal adiponectin levels by tertiles of neonatal body weight. No relationships were noticed between infant birth weight and maternal or umbilical serum resistin and OPG, respectively. Umbilical resistin was significantly associated to both maternal resistin and umbilical adiponectin. Multiple regression analysis showed that maternal BMI, umbilical insulin, C-peptide and resistin explained 71.83% of umbilical serum adiponectin variability. Umbilical resistin was independently predicted by umbilical adiponectin, umbilical C-peptide and maternal BMI, and the model explained 81.49% of umbilical resistin levels. Conclusions. In human, umbilical serum adiponectin and resistin levels are significantly higher compared to adults. These adipokines may mediate the effects of maternal body mass on fetal development. The biology of the OPG/RANKL cytokine system in fetuses and newborns needs further research.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes is continuously growing worldwide, with enormous costs for individuals as well as for society. In the last decades, bariatric surgery has emerged as a possible solution for ameliorating metabolic control or even obtaining diabetes remission. Observational trials and metaanalyses demonstrate consistent improvement of type 2 diabetes following various bariatric procedures, but they are generally uncontrolled or they use historic controls as comparators. In recent years, several randomized trials studying the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetes have been conducted and they all show substantial benefits, with the observation that the majority are shortterm trials. With the increased popularity of diabetes surgery, concerns about its immediate and long-time safety have also grown. The most frequent peri-operative are ulcers or stenosis, obstruction, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and other pulmonary complications, with a mortality of less than 1%. Gastro-intestinal diseases, nutritional deficiencies and psychiatric disorders are the most important longterm problems to be addressed. The uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of bariatric surgery, together with its potential for morbidity and mortality, underline the necessity of large, long-term, randomized clinical trials comparing the best medical therapy with bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Background. Repeated implantation failure (RIF) is the most important problem in assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In the process of embryo implantation, accurate function of progesterone through progesterone receptors (PR) is crucial for establishment of a receptive endometrium. FKBP51 and FKBP52 are two co-chaperones acting as negative and positive regulators of PR function, respectively. Studies have shown that any deficiencies in expression of PR or its co-chaperones causes reproductive disorders. Materials and Methods. In this study we evaluated the PR protein expression by immunohistochemistry and expression of PR, FKBP51, FKBP52 genes by quantitative real-time PCR in endometrial tissue of normal and RIF women during the window of implantation. Results. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the PR protein expression in stromal cells is significantly higher in the endometrium of normal women than RIF women (P< 0.001). In addition, a significantly lower PR and FKBP52 gene expression was observed in endometrial tissue of RIF women compared to normal women (P< 0.001 and P< 0.001, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference in PR protein in epithelial cells (P= 0.3) and FKBP51 gene expression between the two groups (P= 0.6). Conclusion. The results indicate that altered expression of PR protein in stromal compartment and gene expression of PR and FKBP52 gene in endometrial tissue can be related to endometrial receptivity defects and occurrence of RIF",

The authors present the case of a 17 years old male with complaints of chest pain with a very recent onset, constant, experienced after physical effort. All medical history and physical examination findings were normal, the poster-anterior chest X-ray revealed a heterogenous opacity in the middle third of the right hemithorax confirmed on computerized tomography as a large solid anterior mediastinal mass with a diameter of 7.5/10.3 cm. By thorax surgery the mass was identified in the anterior and superior mediastinum and total resection was achieved for the tumor mass and thymus. Pathology examination showed poor small and medium epithelial cells proliferation and the tumor was classified as thymoma type 1B. Mediastinum is a rare location of space occupying processes in children. Also, there is a high rate of asymptomatic lesions in this area, considering that half of them are incidentally discovered for various chest X ray examinations. Many causes of chest pain in children are benign; nonetheless, some serious events do exist sometimes and pediatricians must pay attention to identify and manage those cases.",

Conclusion.In most cases of idiopathic bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, patients are treated with steroid replacement therapy due to adrenal insufficiency.In some other cases, patients are treated with steroids despite the absence of adrenal insufficiency.Here we reported a very rare case of idiopathic bilateral adrenal hemorrhage sequentially to emphasize that before initiation of adrenal hormone replacement therapy, it is important to determine whether adrenal insufficiency is present.If there is no evidence of adrenal insufficiency, adrenal replacement therapy should be postponed until the presence of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed.",

Several studies have also shown that RAI is frequent in patients with stable cirrhosis without sepsis. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the incidence of RAI in patients with stable cirrhosis.Forty-seven patients with hemodynamically stable liver cirrhosis without sepsis were prospectively included. RAI, assessed by using low dose-short Synacthen test (LD-SST), was defined as either a basal total cortisol concentration below 3.6 µg/dL or a peak total serum cortisol ≤ 16 µg/dL at 30 min after stimulation.RAI was present in 10 (21.3%) of 47 cirrhotic patients. Peak cortisol level was negatively correlated with the severity of cirrhosis evaluated by Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) (r=-0.46; P=0.001) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) (r=-0.51; P=0.001) scores. The frequency of RAI increased from CTP-A (10%) to CTP-B (30%) to CTP-C (60%).RAI diagnosed by LD-SST is frequent in patients with stable cirrhosis and is related to the severity of liver disease. Further studies are needed to define clinical importance of RAI in stable cirrhotic patients.",

    "abstract": "There is limited information on the long-term natural history of adrenal function in adrenal hemorrhage following sepsis. The 19-year history of a patient is described who suffered adrenal hemorrhage during pneumococcal sepsis. Adrenal reserve using Cosyntropin testing with the 250 mcg dose was evaluated at seven time points during this interval, and a close observation of the patient enabled clinical correlation with adrenal status. The cosyntropin testing showed a 60 minute cortisol level post-hemorrhage of: 303.4 nmol/L (11.0 mcg/dL), one month; 656.6 nmol/L (23.8 mcg/dL), 1 year 10 months; and 714.5 nmol/L (25.9 mcg/dL), 19 years. Over the years the patient experienced hypoadrenal symptoms requiring both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone until her adrenal function consistently demonstrated a 60 minute cortisol level of ~ 717.3 nmol/L (26 mcg/dL). Adrenal calcifications were visualized by ultrasound imaging and ultimately resolved. In conclusion, the patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system appeared to have ultimately restored normal basal adrenal function 19 years after the initial hemorrhage, and the dynamic cosyntropin data indicate that normal adrenal function should not be assumed with a 60 minute cortisol level of 496.6 - 551.8 nmol/L (18 - 20 mcg/dL). Finally, mineralocorticoid as well as glucocorticoid may be important for improved mental acuity in primary hypoadrenalism.",

Therefore, accuracy of diagnosis should be confirmed; factors affecting the response to treatment should be defined. The present study is performed to evaluate auxiliary diagnostic parameters and factors affecting treatment in growth hormone deficiency (GHD).In this study, 142 patients under the age of 16, with at least one year of treatment, were included. Treatment dose of somatropin was 0.2 mg/kg/week in all cases. Response to treatment was evaluated by measuring annual height and height standard deviation score (SDS) gains every 3 months.Male to female ratio was 79 to 63, and follow-up duration before the treatment was 0.89±0.38 years. Annual growth rate before the treatment was 2.92±1.02 cm, and age at the treatment initiation was 9.97±3.22 years. Height gain SDS at the end of the first year was significantly higher in cases which were at the prepuberty, had severe short stature, low height SDS-mid parental height SDS (HSDS-MPHSDS), and initiated treatment at earlier ages. Correlations in height gain and height SDS gain at the end of the first year were significant between bone age at treatment baseline, delta SDS factors, L-dopa and clonidine stimulation results (both are p<0.01).Height gain was positively related to body mass index, whereas negatively to bone age at treatment baseline, responses obtained from stimulation tests, and delta SDS values. In the treatment evaluation, the parameters which can affect according to model chosen by the investigator, may differ.",

The lipid peroxidation in the organs examined generated consistent results, showing high levels of peroxidation expressed through high values of MDA in the groups with Omega 6 supplements respectively no supplementation, and low levels of antioxidants expressed through glutathione and thiols.Endocrine secretion of adipokines from the adipocytes and the recruited macrophages of obese mothers is positively correlated with placental and tissue lipid peroxidation level and routine biochemical parameters.",

In our study, we aimed to investigate the thyroid diseases coexisting with PHPT and the relation between these two clinical situations. Methods. We retrospectively investigated 255 patients who were diagnosed as PHPT between 2004-2009 in our clinic. The general characteristics of the patients, laboratory tests, which were performed preoperatively, neck ultrasonography, thyroid and parathyroid scintigraphy and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results were assessed. Cytological results of the nodules with preoperative FNAB were compared with the postoperative histological results. Results. Of the patients, 49 were male (19.2%) and 206 were female (80.8%). Mean age was 54.5±12.8. Bilateral neck exploration (BNE) was performed on 69 cases (27%), minimal invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) on 78 cases (30.5%) and BNE plus thyroidectomy on 108 cases (42.5%). When all thyroid diseases were taken into account, prevalence of the coexisting thyroid disease was 65%, prevalence of nodular thyroid disease 52.1%, thyroid cancer 16.7% and thyroid dysfunction 11.8%. The mean age of the patients with a nodular goitre was significantly higher than of the patients who did not have nodules (p<0.001). General demographic data, calcium and PTH levels did not show any difference. Number of nodules was correlated with age (p<0.001, r=0.227). Conclusion. The relation between PHPT and nodular thyroid diseases is coincidental and this can be explained by the fact that both diseases occur in advanced age.",

Sometimes pituitary surgery was performed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in 111 patients with macroprolactinomas, hospitalized in the Institute of Endocrinology, Bucharest, between 1978-2005. There were two groups, according to the length of DA therapy: group A =41 patients, treated more than 4 years and group B =70 patients, treated less than 4 years. Overall, 25 patients underwent additional radiotherapy, 13 in group A and 12 in group B. 28 patients were submitted to pituitary surgery, 9 in group A and 19 in group B. RESULTS: The cure rate (i.e. normalization of prolactin=PRL level and absence or minimal residual tumor mass, stable minimum 2 years after DA withdrawal) was 5/41 (12.1%) in group A and none in group B. 48 out of 111 patients achieved significant improvement (serum prolactin level less than 20 ng/ml and tumor shrinkage more than 50%) during DA therapy, but not after DA withdrawal: 17/41patients (41.5%) in group A and in 31/70 patients (44.3%) in group B, p=NS. Radiotherapy produced an additional improvement: in serum PRL levels only in group A, in 4/13 patients- 2/8 patients responsive to DA therapy and 2/5 patients resistant to DA therapy. In group B, the 3 patients resistant to DA submitted to radiotherapy were evaluated before the interval necessary for maximal effect of radiotherapy, but in 4/9 patients responsive to DA, we noticed further reduction in tumor volume, 2/4 progressing from mild to significant tumor shrinkage and ¼ progressing from no shrinkage to mild shrinkage. After radiotherapy, the medium prolactin level was 5.1 ng/ml in 10 patients from both groups on low bromocriptine (BRC) dose (7.5 mg/day), significantly less than in patients without radiotherapy, i.e. than in 19 patients from group A",

None was receiving vitamin D supplementation andthey were not taking drugs affecting bone and mineral metabolism and were not sufferingfrom such diseases. Estimation of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone status was made bydetermining 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and PTH-intact (PTH) serum concentrationsfrom a single blood sample using immuno-enzyme methods.The results were compared using Student’ t test for unpaired values and linearregression to establish the correlation. All data were expressed as mean value ± standarddeviation and a value of p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.In a previous study we reported for premenopausal normal women the mean value for25OHD at 26.58±10ng/ml.

We aimed to evaluate patients with TS (n=33) for cardiac and aortic pathology using thorax magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).Clinical findings, karyotypes, echocardiogram (ECHO) findings and thorax MRA results were evaluated. Aortic dimensions were measured and standard Z scores of aortic diameters along with aortic size index (ASI) were calculated.Mean age of the patients was 13.7±3.4 years. MRA revealed cardiovascular pathology in 10 patients (30%). CoA (n=4), aberrant right subclavian artery (n=3), dilatation of the ascending aorta (n=1), tortuosity of the descending aorta (n=1) and fusiform dilatation of the left subclavian artery (n=1) were found. Two of the four patients with CoA found on MRA were detected with ECHO. Mean diameter of the sinotubular junction was found to be elevated [mean±SD: 2.4±1.5]. Z scores for the diameters of the isthmus, ascending aorta and descending aorta were in normal ranges. 45,X patients were found to have significantly higher ASI values than non 45,X patients (p=0.036).Our findings indicate that patients with TS should be evaluated with MR imaging studies in addition to ECHO to reveal additional subtle cardiac and vascular anomalies. CoA which is very distally located or which has mild nature may not be seen by ECHO. The increase in ASI observed in 45,X patients may herald the development of life-threatening complications. Therefore, frequent follow-up is warranted in these patients.",

The thyroid is also frequently affected in the HCV chronic infection.The objective of this study is to determine the effects of COVID-19 infection on the presence and severity of thyroid disorders associated with chronic HCV infection, at short and mid-term follow-up.We prospectively evaluated patients with documented HCV- associated thyroid disease (with sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy).The study group consisted of 42 patients with HCV- associated thyroid disease, diagnosed with COVID -19 infection between April and October 2020. We determined serum values of thyroid-stimulating hormone, freeT3, free T4, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies at one and three months after resolution of infection and compared them to the baseline characteristics of the patient. We also evaluated the changes in thyroid substitution treatments or antithyroid drugs.At baseline, out of the 42 patients, 5 presented hypothyroidism under levothyroxine substitution therapy, while 2 presented hyperthyroidism under methimazole therapy; 37 patients had positive antithyroid antibodies. At one month follow-up, we note an increase in serum values of antibodies, with a decrease in TSH, freeT3 and freeT4 levels, correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Two patients required discontinuation of levothyroxine. At 3 months follow-up, lower levels of antithyroid antibodies were recorded, with an increase in TSH levels. No medication doses were adjusted at this time.Among the systemic effects of COVID-19, the impact of thyroid dysfunction should not be underestimated, especially in the presence of pre-existing conditions, such as HCV infection.",

In UA group 92.6% of the patients went into remission, whereas during follow-up 3.3% had recurred and another 3.3% were found to have post-adrenalectomy persistent SH. Patients in UA group had lower final cortisol level following dexamethasone suppression (p=0.003) and higher final adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels (p=0.001) than patients in PWA group. In UA group, final basal cortisol level (p=0.009) and final cortisol level after 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (p=0.004) were lower than corresponding levels at the time of diagnosis.Our study demonstrates unilateral adrenalectomy targeting the side with the larger lesion is an effective approach to reduce excess cortisol levels in bilateral AI patients with SH.",

This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting ectopic pituitary adenoma in the nasopharyngeal region.We report a 37-year-old male patient with thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting ectopic pituitary adenoma in nasopharyngeal region.A patient suffering from sweating, palpitations, dizziness and abnormality in thyroid tests was referred to our clinic. Thyroid function tests showed high basal levels of free thyroxine (FT4), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), and serum TSH. TRH stimulation test results indicated blunted response. Scintigraphy showed increased radionuclide uptake (iodine-123), and a thyroid ultrasound scan revealed diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland. A pituitary MRI indicated a normal pituitary. However, MRI showed a mass in the nasopharynx that was confirmed with endoscopy. Endoscopic total endonasal resection was done and the mass was removed. The pathology reported a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.In this report, an identified case of thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting ectopic pituitary adenoma in nasopharyngeal region is reported and it is the only tenth case in the literature indicated in the nasopharyngeal region. Ectopic TSH-omas should be considered during inappropriate secretion of TSH as a candidate cause to enable correct diagnosis and improve the treatment of patients.",

In our department the standard surgical procedure for multinodular goiter used to be subtotal resection. Over the years, total thyroidectomy has progressively replaced subtotal resections and is performed in most of our patients at present. Patients and Methods. In a prospective cohort, observational study, we assessed the immediate surgical outcome in 742 consecutive patients with multinodular goiter (MNG), admitted for surgery and operated in our hospital. Of all patients, 664 were women (89.5%) and 78 men (11.5%), aged 15 to 85 years, mean (±SD) of 48 ±13.8 years. Pathology was done on frozen and permanent sections. The complications directly related to surgery in subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) were compared to total thyroidectomy (TT) or near-total thyroidectomy (NTT) patients: temporary hypoparathyroidism, temporary RLN injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism and permanent RLN injury. The y} test (95% confidence interval) was used and values of p<0.05 were considered significant. Results. There were no significant differences among the patients with SST for MNG, NTT or TT , and TT for recurrent MNG or completion thyroidectomy, with respect to temporary and permanent RLN injury. Significant differences were found for temporary hypoparathyroidism in STT for MNG (9 out of 361 patients. 2.45%) and NTT or TT for MNG (21 out of 266 cases, 7.89%) (p<0.01) and between STT for MNG (9 out of 361 cases, 2.45%) and TT for recurrent MNG for completion thyroidectomy (8 out of 45 cases, 17.77%) (p<0.01) and no difference between NTT or TT for MNG (21 out of 266 cases, 7.89%) and TT for recurrent MNG or completion thyroidectomy (8 out of 45 cases, 17.77%) (p=0.11). We registered no permanent hypoparathyroidism in our patients. Conclusions. Total thyroidectomy is now the preferred option for the management of patients with bilateral benign MNG. However, TT is associated with a considerable rate of complications, higher than of STT. In patients with bilateral MNG and no malignancy, STT remains in our opinion, a valuable option. Key words: multinodular goiter, subtotal thyroidectomy, total thyroidectomy. ^Correspondence to: V.

    "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a frequently diagnosed endocrine disorder that has characteristic clinical signs and symptoms. The frequency of myopathy in hypothyroidism ranges from 30 to 80%. The major symptoms related are: weakness, muscular cramps and myalgia. The pseudohypertrophic form is called Hoffman's syndrome and is quite rare, reassign diagnosis difficulties both to endocrinologists and neurologists. The pathogenesis of this form of myopathy is still unclear. We report the case of two patients, daughter and father with pseudohypertrophic myopathy and hypothyroidism by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The two were previously treated for hyperthyroidism: first by antithyroid drugs and secondary by surgery (the daughter) and radioiodine (the father). Both developed iatrogenic hypothyroidism that vas treated by thyroxin replacement therapy. The muscular symptoms: progressive proximal weakness, muscle hypertrophy accompanied by stiffness, spontaneous muscular pain, muscular cramps and fatigue during mild exercise have developed during the year before admittance. In both patients Hashimoto's thyroiditis was revealed by the high level of TPO antibodies and the thyroid appearance in sonography. Hormonal dosages confirmed hypothyroidism. Elevated values of CPK and electromyography established the diagnosis of thyroid myopathy. Muscular symptoms were improved but not remitted by the thyroxin replacement therapy in adequate doses, but CPK normalized. It is the first time that a familial case of Hoffmann syndrome is described, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to the development of the syndrome.",

Few studies are available on the temporal sequence and effect of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and environment on pubertal changes leading to sexual maturation in boys; therefore, we describe normative values for developmental changes in physical and endocrine characteristics at onset and during progression of the pubertal process in a cohort of Pakistani boys. Design. This cross-sectional study involved 234 healthy, 8-18 years old, school-based boys. Methods. Body weight, height, appearance of pubic hair patterns and testicular volume (TV) along with serum FSH, LH, testosterone and GH levels were measured. Results. Pubarche was first recorded at a mean age of 11.3 years [Tanner stage 2]. TV of 3 ml and the first significant increase in mean serum FSH and LH levels were detected at 10 years of age. The mean percent increase in TV/year was maximal from 12-14 years, coinciding with rising testosterone levels. The levels of gonadotropins increased more than 2-fold between 12-14 years. Whereas, LH continued to increase in postpubertal boys and FSH levels plateaued at 15 years. GH concentrations were shown to be maximal at 12-13 years and declined thereafter to prepubertal values. However, BW and height were significantly correlated with age; yet no significant correlation was seen between body mass index (BMI) and age. Conclusion. The present data among boys indicates an earlier transition to the Tanner stage 2 and an increase in TV, resulting in a slightly more extended period of pubertal development, as compared to European and American children pointing to ethnic, social and economic differences.",

The karyotype is 46 XX and FISH analysis reveals SRY translocation on one of the X chromosomes. Ultrasound exam does not reveal any mullerian structures and a hCG test proves the testes to be functional. A short course of treatment with hCG is recommended in order to induce the proper development of the scotal sac. The patient will need monitoring, in order to identify the development of hypergonadic hypogonadism, which characterizes such patients in later life.

    "abstract": "Introduction.Pituitary adenomas (PA) are the third most common intracranial tumors, with an incidence rate of 10-15%.More than half are invasive, infiltrating adjacent structures.The primary objective of this project was to determine whether MGMT expression is associated with the invasiveness of PA.Material and Method.All patients who underwent surgical decompression consecutively between 2007-2012 were included.All data were obtained from the case records.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and then examined via light microscope.Paraffin blocks that lacked necrosis and hemorrhage were chosen for histologic examination.In addition to an immunoprofile battery that consisted of Ki-67 and p53, MGMT, S-100 and Pan-CK were evaluated as well.Results.The subjects included 25 women and 15 men.The mean age was 48.9 ± 14.5 years.Of these, 63% of cases involved the invasion of adjacent structures.Of the PA, 17 (42%) were non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA).There was a statistically significant relationship between the invasiveness and Ki-67, p53, MGMT expression, and prolactinoma.Gonodotropinomas were mostly non-invasive.FPAs presented invasive features more frequently than NFPAs.Pan-CK was positive in GH-secreting adenomas but negative in FSH-and LH-secreting adenomas.Conclusion.Ki-67 and p53 in lower expression level can be used for evaluating invasiveness but not for recurrence.MGMT expression can be a useful IHC indicator for invasiveness.However, Pan-CK cannot be used for invasiveness or aggressiveness.",

    "abstract": "The non-effectiveness of levothyroxine administration in hypothyroidism depends on many factors and mechanisms influencing its absorption in small intestins or bounding of circulating hormone with different active molecules.Thyroid hormones, TSH, rT3, TGl, TPO-Ab, TG-Ab, were measured using commercially available assays. For anti-T4ab, radioiodine-labeled T4 was added to the patient's serum and the IgG fraction subsequently precipitated by addition of 15% polyethylene glycol. Background was determined by testing 100 control sera from individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease.A 42-year old woman (71.5 kg) with Hashimoto thyroiditis receiving levothyroxine (L-T4) 150 µg and liothyronine (L-T3) 37.5 µg was admitted to the hospital with clinical data of hypothyroidism, TSH-23.8 mU/L, FT4-6.18 pmol/L (n.range 9-19 pmol/L), TPO-Ab 696 IU/mL, TG-Ab 818 IU/mL, circulating T4- antibodies positive. She has a good adherence to medication, malabsorption or administration of other drugs were excluded. L-T4 absorption test revealed 44% increase of serum FT4 at 120 min after ingestion of 150 mcg L-T4 (2.1 mcg/kg). Methylprednisolone pulses of 500 mg i.v. administered in three consecutive days at equal doses of L-T4/L-T3 resulted in a rapid increase of FT4 to 14.5 pmol/L, fall of TSH to 0.18 mU/L and decrease of anti-T4 antibodies to referent range; TPO-Ab and TG-Ab also decreased significantly. Monotherapy by 150 mcg L-T4 was continued in the next three months. A recurrence of hypothyroidism with increase of circulating T4-Ab was observed 100 days later. New administrations of methylprednisolone two pulses of 500 mg revealed a similar normalization of thyroid hormones and anti-T4 antibodies.The data showed that T4-antibodies might be a cause of insufficient effects of levothyroxine therapy in autoimmune hypothyroidism. This could be overcome by glucocorticoid administration probably resulting in FT4 release from circulating immune complexes.",

Macrosomia, respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic and electrolytic disturbances, and increased rates of congenital structural defects are well-known neonatal complications associated with maternal diabetes, even if well-controlled.A macrosomic infant born from an insulin-dependent mother, with uncontrolled diabetes and lack of adequate prenatal care, prenatally diagnosed with hydrocephaly showed a complicated postnatal course. Initial respiratory distress syndrome and transient hypoglycemia, rapidly corrected under treatment, were followed by persistent hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia due to hypoparathyroidism and evolving hydrocephaly. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting was followed by resolution of hypocalcemia, but seizures associated with schizencephaly and recurrent respiratory tract infections, aggravated by spondylocostal dysplasia, concurred to infant's demise at the age of 5 months.The reported case is rare due to multiple aspects: persistent hypoparathyroidism, uncommon association of schizencephaly, and even rarely association with spondylocostal dysplasia, all these conditions requiring a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Also, the reported case is evocative for challenges associated with infants born from diabetic mothers.",

We found 38 neuroendocrine malignancies: 12 typical carcinoids, 3 atypical carcinoids, 4 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) and 10 small-cell lung cancers (SCLC). Limits of the study are: variable lymphadenectomy technique; absence of PET - CT and EBUS-TBNA (EndoBronchial UltraSound - TransBronchial Needle Aspiration) for staging; incomplete data for disease-free survival.We performed 13 pneumonectomies, 22 lobectomies and 3 non-anatomical resections. There were 5 bronchoplasties. The 5-year survival difference between NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer - 42.9%) and SCLC (40.53% - one of the best from the literature) is not statistically significant (p=0.4780). Five-years survival was 100% for typical and atypical carcinoids - the best published. We found lymph node metastasis in 2 typical carcinoids, in 2 atypical carcinoids and in 6 SCLCs.For typical and atypical carcinoids, radical resection with lymphadenectomy offers 100% 5-years survival. Early-stage SCLC may benefit from radical resection; lymph node dissection is mandatory because of the well-known precocious lymphatic dissemination.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the function of female sexual hormones on the gastric damage induced by I/R in male rats.Forty (40) Wistar rats were randomized into five groups: intact, ischemia- reperfusion (IR), IR + estradiol (1mg/kg), IR + progesterone (16 mg / kg) and IR + combination of estradiol (1mg / kg) and progesterone (16 mg/ kg). Before the onset of ischemia and before reperfusion all treatments were done by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. After animal anesthesia and laparotomy, celiac artery was occluded for 30 minutes and then circulation was established for 24 hours. Results expressed as mean ± SEM and P <0.05 were considered statistically significant.The Glutathione (GSH) concentration significantly decreased after induction of gastric IR (P<0.001). Estradiol (P<0.001) and combined estradiol and progesterone (P<0.001) significantly increased GSH levels. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentration significantly increased after induction of gastric IR (P<0.001). Different treatments significantly reduced MPO levels (P<0.001). The gastric acid concentration significantly increased after induction of gastric IR (P<0.001). Treatment with estradiol, progesterone (P<0.05) and combined estradiol and progesterone (P<0.01) significantly reduced gastric acid levels. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration decreased after induction of gastric IR. The SOD levels were not significant.These data suggested that female sexual steroids have a therapeutic effect on gastrointestinal ischemic disorders by reduction of MPO and gastric acid, and increasing gastric GSH & SOD levels following gastric IR.",

The surgical technique involved the use of a 3.0 × loupe during spermatic cord dissection at the level of the internal inguinal ring under spinal anesthesia. Semen samples were analyzed for sperm concentration, motility, and sperm morphology before the varicocelectomy and after 3 months. All the infertile patients were followed-up postoperatively for more than 1 year.There were 9 (3.0%) varicocele recurrences and 3 (1.0%) hydroceles. After varicocelectomy, sperm concentration and motile spermatozoa increased. In addition, spermatozoa with normal morphology improved significantly postoperatively. Of the 303 subjects treated, 153 (83.2) had a 1-year preoperative history of infertility; the spontaneous pregnancy rate of the spouses during the follow-up period was reported to be 61.4%.The results of this research indicated that varicocelectomy using loupe-assisted inguinal technique could improve semen parameters and pregnancy rate with a low postoperative complication rate.",

The prednisolone groups were given once-daily doses for 30 days, orally. In addition, the rats were weighed, and their height and waist circumferences were measured once a week. At the end of 30 days, vaspin and glucose levels were measured from blood samples.In the prednisolone groups, the vaspin levels significantly increased when compared with the control group. The control group has a serum vaspin level of 155 ± 20.99 pg/mL and this level has been increased by prednisolone administration in a dose dependent manner. In the prednisolone groups, especially the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg groups, the glucose levels increased in a dose dependent fashion.Prednisolone administration significantly increased serum glucose and vaspin levels in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the increase in the serum vaspin levels could be related to the increase in the serum glucose concentration. Vaspin can be a molecule that is released in response to increased glucose and can be a rebound defense mechanism to modulate the blood glucose concentration. We suggest vaspin as a potential target for the treatment and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders.",

The data were analyzed statistically.We found that the overall minor allele frequency was 0.12 in cases and 0.095 in controls. In terms of genotype distribution and allele frequencies among the cases versus controls in the population studied, only the gender-stratified analysis revealed a significantly higher frequency of Pro/Ala genotype within males. The polymorphism was associated with significantly higher weight, height, waist circumference, central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR), lean body weight as well as dry body weight, but not overall adiposity (total body fat percentage, TBF) in cases carrying Ala allele (Pro/Ala or Ala/Ala). However, in the subjects carrying Ala allele of the control group, WHR values were found significantly lower.Our results showed that the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARγ2 gene is associated with obesity in the studied adult population from Turkey. These data suggest that the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARγ2 may be a potential genetic risk factor for central obesity.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Vitamin D deficiency has been proven to have a deleterious effect on bone remodeling and bone mineral density, by inducing secondary hyperparathyroidism. The lack of a present consensus on optimal serum 25(OH)D levels required for the preservation of physiologic bone metabolism renders its follow-up difficult. Materials and Methods. The cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 69 healthy men aged 50-70. Serum 25(OH)D, total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, s-CTX (Crosslaps), and osteocalcin were assessed. BMD was measured by DXA at lumbar spine and hip levels. Statistical relationships between these parameters were calculated. Results. We found a significantly negative correlation between 25(OH)D and s-CTX (r = -0.30. p<0.05), but not between 25(OH)D and osteocalcin, although s-CTX correlated positively with osteocalcin (r = 0.49, p<0.001). Serum CTX was negatively correlated with lumbar BMD (r = -0.35, p<0.001), while osteocalcin was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p<0.01). Comparing mean s-CTX levels in insufficient and sufficient subjects at different cut-off points for 25(OH)D, significant differences appeared the strongest at 60 ng/ml. The percentage of 25(OH)D deficient or insufficient subjects was 50.7% at a 30 ng/ml cut-off point. Conclusions. The results of the present study confirm the benefit in maintaining a normal bone turnover offered by serum 25(OH)D in the upper normal range. The large percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency reinforce the necessity of a specific follow-up and of epidemiologic studies dedicated to our geographic area.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Estrogens are known to have a neuroprotective role and to influence the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB). An ongoing debate exists on the changing effects of estrogens on target tissues with advancing age and at menopause and on the potential disruptive role of increasing gonadotropin levels. The aim of the present study was to assess the permeability of the BBB for estradiol, FSH and LH in three physiological states: early follicular phase, preovulatory phase and at menopause. Method. Hormonal levels were assessed simultaneously in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 15 women at menopause (mean age 60±8 years), 16 of reproductive age in early follicular phase and 11 in preovulatory phase (mean age 31±7 years), all undergoing surgery for benign gynecologic disorders. FSH, LH and estradiol levels were assessed using chemo luminescence and are expressed as median and 10-90 percentile interval. Statistical analysis assessed the serum-CSF correlation and the CSF/serum ratio for each hormone between groups. Results. Estradiol serum levels were 26.2 pg/ml (6.4-43.5) at menopause (n=15), 58.5 pg/ml (25.7-75.9) in early follicular phase (EFP, n=16) and 221.2 pg/ml (113.7-405.5) in preovulatory phase (PREOV, n=11). CSF estradiol is 18.5 pg/ml (0.4-30.5) at menopause, 5.4 pg/ml (2.2-10.2) in EFP (p<0.001) and 17.3 pg/ml (10.3-34.6) in PREOV patients. Estradiol serum and CSF levels correlate positively in the fertile cycle (r=0.72, p<0.0001) and negatively at menopause (r=-0.88, p<0.05). The CSF/serum ratio for estradiol is 0.8 (0.01-4.4) at menopause, 0.1 (0.04-0.13) in EFP and 0.1 (0.03-0.13) in PREOV patients. FSH serum levels were 75.8 mUI/ml (35.9-129.8) at menopause, 7.7 mUI/ml (3.511.4) in EFP and 7.3 mUI/ml (3.1-10.7) in PREOV patients. CSF FSH is 2.7 mUI/ml (0.4",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of weight loss following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on clinical, renal parameters and urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in diabetic and non-diabetic obese patients.Nineteen morbidly obese patients (10 diabetic and 9 non diabetic) who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were evaluated clinically (anthropometric measurements) and biochemically before surgery and at 6 months from surgery.Significant decreases in weight, BMI, FPG, PPG and HbA1c levels were observed in the diabetic group when the baseline and 6th month parameters of the patients were compared. There was also a significant decrease in SBP and DBP. At 6th month following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, renal parameters such as creatinine, mAlb/creatinine, NGAL/creatinine did not differ in the diabetic group. In the nondiabetic group, serum creatinine levels were significantly decreased, but other renal parameters such as mAlb/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine were not significantly different.Our findings revealed significant decreases in weight, body mass index and glycemic parameters after sleeve gastrectomy in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, while no significant alteration was noted in renal functions, urinary NGAL and microalbumin levels.",

We also report a β-TI patient who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer six months before our screening.In this cross-sectional study, 178 patients with β-thalassemias referred to the Thalassemia Clinic in a tertiary hospital affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were investigated, from January to June 2016, by US.Thyroid nodules or cysts were detected in 11 patients [total: 6.17 %; 8 patients with β-TM (8.2%) and 3 patients with β-TI (3.7%)]. All nodules were < 1 cm in diameter and were not suspicious of malignancy. All patients, after 1 year of thyroid US follow-up, did not show any significant change in favor of malignancy.Based on our results, the frequency of thyroid nodules was similar to what was reported in the general population. However, a long-term follow-up of these patients is recommended because of the potential carcinogenic effects of iron and hepatitis C infection (HCV).

Parathyroid adenoma or lymphadenopathy were the differential diagnosis. After two years, the endocrine surgeon decided to operate her multinodular goiter and her probably benign lesion. Intraoperatively, the blood pressure and pulse rate increased markedly and intravenous antihypertensive treatment was administered. She was discharged after blood pressure control. A 2 mm micromedullary thyroid carcinoma with C-cell hyperplasia located on the left lobe of the thyroid was detected. The aforementioned mass lesion was also reported as typical cervical paraganglioma. Because of concomitant medullary thyroid carcinoma with C-cell hyperplasia and paraganglioma the patient was subjected to genetic counseling and molecular testing for hereditary cancer syndromes.

In all patients, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed, using qualitative and semiquantitative analysis. The tumor to non-tumor tracer uptake was conducted by using a region-of-interest technique. Adrenal to background (A/B) ratio was calculated in all cases.99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy showed a high statistical significance between A/B ratios, while other two tracers resulted in a lower sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Futhermore, 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC could have a high diagnostic yield to detect adrenal tumors (the receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis, A/B ratio cut-off value of 8.40).A semiquantitative SPECT analysis showed that 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC is a highly sensitive tumor-seeking agent for the accurate localization of adrenal tumors.",

The first-visit patients of physician 1 were placed in the traditional group: the activity of 131I (mCi) was calculated using the routine formula: [empirical activity (0.07-0.12 mCi/g) × thyroid mass]/[24-h thyroid 131I uptake]. The first-visit patients of physician 2 were placed in the personalized group. The activity of 131I (mCi) was calculated in two steps. First, the initial activity was calculated: 0.1 mCi/g × thyroid mass (g), and then a personalized and quantitative calibration table of 131I activity was used to obtain a final 131I activity. The cure rate with a single activity of 131I was recorded 1 year later.The traditional and personalized groups included 241 and 282 patients, respectively. Interestingly, the personalized group achieved a higher cure rate [86.5% (244/282) versus 73.4% (177/241), P = 0.000] with a relatively higher 131I activity for the first treatment [8.7 (7, 3.5-30) mCi versus 6.7(6, 2.5-30) mCi, P = 0.000] compared with the traditional group, while the incidence rate of permanent hypothyroidism was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.175).The empirical method designed in this study was reliable.",

Irisin level was negatively correlated with weight, height, BMI, fat free mass, skeletelal muscle mass, basal metabolic rate (r= -0.40, p= 0.011; r=-0.32, p=0.046; r=-0.366, p= 0.022; r=-0.423, p= 0.007; r=-0.430, p=0.006; r=-0.416, p=0.009, respectively); there was a strong correlation between LDL-C and irisin levels (r=0.367, p=0.02). In multivariate linear regression analyses model, irisin concentrations were correlated with weight (ß-coefficient= - 0.391, p= 0.015). LDL-C is associated, but not correlated significantly with irisin levels, (ß-coefficient =0.272, p=0.084).As a result, weight and LDL-C were the predictors of circulating irisin. To our knowledge, this study is the first examining association between irisin levels and body composition comprehensively, in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",

Serum values of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T3, free T4, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxydase antibodies were determined and compared to baseline levels.At baseline, 44 patients had positive antithyroid antibodies, 6 had hypothyroidism in substitution and 2 had hyperthyroidism under treatment. During COVID-19 we found an increase in serum values of antithyroid antibodies, and decreased levels of TSH, freeT3 and freeT4 levels. Specific therapies were discontinued in one patient with hyperthyroidism and 3 patients with hypothyroidism.There is a significant impact of COVID-19 on the thyroid homeostasis; a long-term prognostic value for patients with HCC infected with COVID-19 required further extensive research.",

    "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) and concomitant thyroid nodules can be found in up to 44% of all cases, of which up to 17% are determined as malignant tumors. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) seems to be found extremely rarely, which causes belated diagnosis.A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with GD. Neck ultrasound revealed suspicious thyroid nodule, a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, and it revealed microfollicular hyperplasia, Bethesda IV. The patient was operated on and the histological examination confirmed MTC. Genetic testing revealed the sporadic form of MTC. Six weeks after the initial surgery, elevated tumor markers confirmed the persistence of the disease. The patient underwent a pyramidal lobe removal with a unilateral central compartment lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed typical changes of MTC and a spread of the disease. 2 months after the lymphadenectomy, tumor markers and imaging examination revealed suspicious lymph nodes; this discovery was followed by a bilateral lymph nodes dissection and persistence of MTC confirmation.An early detection of sporadic MTC with concomitant GD is challenging. We want to emphasize the benefits of calcitonin (Ctn) measurement in the blood sample and a Ctn immunocytochemistry detection in the case of an autoimmune thyroid disease and suspicious thyroid nodule before the radical treatment, despite the lack of universal recommendations for routine Ctn measurement, in order to reach an earlier diagnosis of the cancer, and to perform a more radical surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "The cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecules-4 (CTLA-4) is related to the relapse of Graves' disease (GD) after anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) withdrawal. We performed a meta-analysis to generate large-scale evidence on whether the CTLA-4 exon 1+49A/G polymorphism can predict the relapse of GD after ATDs withdrawal.The PubMed, EMBASE,the Cochrane Library and reference lists of relevant studies were searched to identify eligible studies from inception to Jan, 2021. Ten eligible studies consisting of 1450 GD patients with a total of 848 relapsed patients were included in the meta-analysis.In Caucasians patients, the CTLA-4 exon 1+49A/G polymorphism significantly elevated the relapse risk of GD in additive (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.18-3.62, P=0.011), dominant (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.17-5.41, P=0.02), homozygote model(OR = 3.264, 95% CI: 1.25-8.52, P=0.016), except recessive (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 0.98-4.86, P = 0.062) and heterozygote model (OR = 2.141, 95% CI = 0.958-4.786, P = 0.064). In Asian subgroup, none of these genotypes show any associations with the relapse of GD after ATDs withdrawal.This meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4 exon1 +49A/G polymorphism is associated with the relapse risk of GD after ATDs withdrawal in Caucasians, not Asians. Compared with the AA genotype, Caucasian patients with GG genotype have 3.264 times risk of relapse. A more aggressive treatment such as radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy, or longer periods treatment of ATDs should be recommended in Caucasian patients with the GG genotype.",

Modern diets are high in advanced glycation end products (dAGEs), derived from processing methods, exerting a pivotal role in promoting diabetic retinopathy risk. In present study, we investigate the relationship between dietary and serum levels of AGEs and DME in type 2 diabetic subjects.This case-control study was conducted between July 2018 and February 2019 on 50 case subjects with DME and 40 healthy controls without DM without DME. The sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional status, and anthropometric measurements were evaluated. The advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and receptor for AGEs (sRAGE) levels in serum were analysed.The AGEs levels of the DME group were higher than in the control group (p <0.05). sRAGE levels were higher in the DME group, but not statistically significant (p >0.05). The dietary intake of AGEs was higher in the DME group (p <0.05). It was found that an increase in neck circumference increased the risk of DME (p <0.001).A positive correlation was found between DME and AGEs, dAGE, neck circumference, and waist circumference. For the validity of these results, studies, including controlled nutrition interventions, are needed.",

Poor adherence was suspected based on previous laboratory investigations. A low dose thyroxine absorption test using 400 µg of levothyroxine taken orally was performed. FT4 increased by 4.7 pmol/L at 3 hours and 6.6 pmol/L at 5 hours, following ingestion, effectively ruling out malabsorption. Her cardiac hemodynamic profile, measured noninvasively, also improved following levothyroxine intake, further supporting our diagnosis. Poor adherence was successfully managed by implementing twice weekly visits by a registered nurse and an improvement in both thyroid function tests and cardiac parameters was seen at the one-month follow-up visit. We suggest using a lower dose thyroxine absorption test, owing to its efficacy in establishing diagnosis and a safer alternative compared to higher doses in particular in high-risk cardiac patients.",

The prevalence of bone demineralization in HIV/HCV patients was 31.7%, more frequently at lumbar spine. Fat mass and lean mass were significantly lower in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients than in controls. Lipodystrophy was found in similar percentages in all three evaluated groups (80.4% in HIV/HCV, 92.5% in HIV, and 95% in the HCV group).

We, herein, report a heterozygous GCK gene mutation in a large family with GCK-MODY and insulinoma in one individual from the same family.The proband, an 11-year-old male, was referred for asymptomatic mild hyperglycemia (fasting glucose:121 mg/dL) and HbA1c of 6.1%. Segregation analysis of the family revealed multiplex members with asymptomatic fasting hyperglycaemia or non-insulin-dependent diabetes and 33-year-old maternal uncle of the proband case had a history of distal pancreatectomy due to the diagnosis of insulinoma. His preoperative investigations were revealed fasting glucose of 31 mg/dL, insulin: 7µU/mL, C-peptide: 2.6 mg/dL, and a low HbA1c(4.0%) which was suggestive for recurring hypoglycaemia episodes. Post-pancreatectomy he developed mild fasting hyperglycemia (115-136 mg/dL).Genetic analysis revealed heterozygous p.Ser453Leu(c.1358C> T) mutation in the GCK gene in the proband. In segregation analysis, the identical heterozygous p.Ser453Leu(c.1358C> T) GCK gene mutation was detected in all of the other affected family members for whom a DNA analysis was applicable. The maternal uncle was first diagnosed with insulinoma and underwent a pancreatectomy. He also had an identical mutation in a heterozygous state.We, to the best of our knowledge, firstly identified these two entirely distinct phenotypes of glucose metabolism, GCK-MODY and GCK-HI, due to an identical heterozygous p.Ser453Leu (c.1358C> T) mutation in the GCK.

After multiple regression analysis, CT-1 was significantly positively correlated with total testosterone, hs-CRP and carotid IMT.CT-1 was associated with other cardiovascular risk markers and its use as a cardiovascular risk marker might be suggested. Cardiovascular risk was increased even in lean PCOS patients without MS and it might be associated with elevated androgen levels.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of primary NETs (neuroendocrine tumors) is challenging and often late due to tumor heterogeneity, and a wide variety of general symptoms. Low grade NETs are often indolent and have a good prognosis, especially in the early stages. Even so, some tumors are diagnosed using SPECT/CT either in the metastatic stage or directly as a metastasis with an unknown primary tumor.This study aims to characterize well and moderately differentiated NETs, using Tektrotyd SPECT/CT imaging as well as from the viewpoint of NET immunohistochemical biomarker expression.Patients diagnosed with low grade neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids) investigated over a period of 2 years, using SPECT/CT with 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-Octreotide (Tektrotyd) and confirmed through at least two immunohistochemical neuroendocrine markers were evaluated.Twenty-seven cases with neuroendocrine tumors were analyzed. Four patients met the inclusion criteria. Staining intensity was scored using a weak, moderate, or strong scoring system. CD56 was quantified using criteria derived from Her2 cell membrane staining evaluations.Patients included in the study had two well differentiated (G1) NETs and two moderately differentiated (G2) NETs. SPECT/CT with Tektrotyd showed variable intensity ranging from discreet to strong. All tumors expressed chromogranin A with at least moderate intensity, weak to moderate intensity for synaptophysin and variable CD56 intensity.Chromogranin A and synaptophysin staining patterns may aid in primary tumor identification. CD56 stain intensity showed an inverse correlation with Tektrotyd uptake in carcinoids. Additional studies merit further investigation for use in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Prognostic considerations include assessing the risk of liver fibrosis in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).This study evaluates the use of hematologic and metabolic parameters regarding liver steatosis and fibrosis scores (FLI and Fib-4) in non-obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2DM) patients with NAFLD.Subjects underwent abdominal ultrasound examinations, and FLI and Fib-4 scores were calculated to evaluate liver steatosis and the risk of liver fibrosis non-invasively: 61 non-obese NAFLD subjects with t2DM were included in the cohort study and were divided into 2 groups depending on the t2DM treatment regimen.Fib-4 and WBC count demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (OR = 0.509, p = 0.007). WBC count had an R2 of 0.237, indicating that this marker could account for up to 23.7% of a variation in Fib-4. Fib-4 and FFA had positive correlation which did not achieve statistically significant prediction (OR=7.122, p=0.062). Additionally, a significant prediction of HbA1c (OR=1.536, p=0.016) and haemoglobin (OR=1.071, p=0.020) for FLI was revealed.HbA1c and other haematological and metabolic parameters, such as haemoglobin and WBC, may be another non-invasive tool for determining whether non-obese NAFLD patients with t2DM are at risk of developing liver steatosis and fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the kidney and cleaves angiotensin II to Angiotensin (1-7), annihilating the deleterious effects of angiotensin II which is known to be a strong activator of oxidative stress.We aimed to evaluate the relationship of oxidative stress to urinary ACE2 (uACE2) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.We included consecutive normo or microalbuminuric T2DM patients in an observational transversal study. Routine laboratory investigations, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA, fluorimetric thiobarbituric method) as a marker of prooxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase (SOD, cytochrome reduction method) and catalase (CAT) activity (in erythrocyte lysate by the modification of absorbance method) as two measures of serum antioxidant capacity and uACE2 (ELISA method) were assessed.MDA showed a negative correlation with SOD (r=-0.44, p=0.001), CAT (r=-0.37, p=0.006), uACE2 (r=-0.33, p=0.016) and a positive correlation with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (r=0.49, p<0.001) and associated cardiovascular disease (r=0.42, p=0.001). CAT as also positively correlated to uACE2 (r=0.29, p=0.037). SOD was also negatively correlated with glycemia (r=-0.71, p<0.001) and HbA1c (r=-0.53, p<0.001). Patients with lower MDA (when divided according to median value of 3.88 nmol/mL) had higher uACE2 57.15(40.3-71.2) pg/mL compared to 38.5(31.8-45.95) pg/mL in patients with higher MDA (p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression uACE2 was the only predictor for MDA above or below its median (OR=0.94, 95%CI[0.90-0.98], p=0.002).Increased prooxidant serum capacity is associated with lower uACE2 levels in T2DM patients.",

We present here a rare case of identical female twins who developed consecutively Graves' disease within a few months and had three HLA susceptibility alleles for the development of Graves' disease.A 28-year-old woman was referred to our hospital complaining of thirst, sweating, palpitations, tremor and skin rash. Laboratory data showed hyperthyroidism with antibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor and ultrasonography of the thyroid revealed enlargement with hypervascularity. Her identical twin was referred to our hospital because of similar symptoms.We diagnosed them with Graves' disease and both were treated with methimazole. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping showed that both twins possessed the DRB1*04:05, DQB1*04:01:01, DPB1*05:01 haplotype, which confers susceptibility to Graves' disease.This case supports the hypothesis that interaction of multiple human leukocyte antigen susceptibility alleles as well as genetic background and environmental factors might synergistically contribute the close timing in Graves' disease onset.",

Nuclear magnetic resonance of the thigh showed inflammatory changes in the external vastus with hyperintensity on T2 sequence and edema of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. After other possible etiologies were ruled out, a clinical diagnosis of spontaneous muscle infarction was established. The patient needed hospital admission for two months, during which the renal function worsened until she required hemodialysis. No other possible triggers of kidney injury were identified.Up to our knowledge, this is the first described case where muscle infarction is suspected to have caused exacerbation of an existing chronic kidney failure. Monitoring the renal function should be considered in patients with diabetic nephropathy presenting with this rare complication of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Despite CT being generally used in thymic pathology, in the case of regions with the same tissue density, only functional radioisotopic imaging can hint towards malignity.To assess the usefulness of 99mTc MIBI scintigraphy for diagnosis and treatment planning in thymoma, in relation with the radiotracer uptake mechanism.99mTc MIBI thymic scans for 19 patients diagnosed with thymic disorders were assessed using tumor uptake ratio (UR). Specimens of thymectomies were examined and cytological assessments were correlated with the UR.The UR of all surgical patients was higher than 1.2, with a 1.5 cutoff between lymphoid hyperplasia and thymoma. The UR values were correlated with the histopathologic diagnosis (Pearson correlation 0.91, significant at p<0.01). The highest UR was 3.24, found in the case of an AB thymoma where the rate lymphocytes/epithelial cells (L/E) was 1.6. In B1 thymoma UR was 1.14 and L/E was 2.46.Phenotype differences between thymoma types correlate with 99mTc MIBI cellular uptake: lower rate L/E corresponds to higher UR, higher malignity potential and invasiveness. A thymic 99mTc MIBI UR higher than 1.5, corresponding to a CT tumoral image, is suggestive for a thymoma, requiring surgical treatment first.",

Tg, TgAb and TSH level measurements were completed two weeks postoperatively and during the follow-up period.Twenty-nine patients fulfilled all criteria. The median serum Tg level at two weeks after surgery was 3.8 ug/L (0.3 -300) with a serum TSH level of 69.9 mU/L; 11-227. At the two-week measurement, 16 (55%) patients had serum Tg levels lower than 5 ug/L and 4 patients had levels between 5-10 µg/L.Postoperative early serum Tg could be an alternative to values measured six months after surgery and could be used as a predictive tool to make earlier therapeutic decisions.",

Staging Ga-68 positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed two pathological uptake regions in the superior segment of the right lung lower lobe (SUVmax: 80.61) and 6th thoracic vertebral body (SUVmax: 3.70). Contrast-enhanced MRI findings suggested that vertebral lesion may be compatible with atypical hemangioma or osseous metastasis due to T1 isointensity, T2 hyperintensity and contrast-enhancement on the lesion. Therefore, characteristic imaging findings of hemangioma were seen on axial and sagittal or coronal sections of CT, respectively called as 'polka dot' and 'corduroy cloth'. Thus the mild vertebral Ga-68 DOTATATE uptake was accepted as false positive finding. Surgical intervention was decided. She underwent a right lung lobectomy. The last follow-up of the patient was done 2 years after the initial diagnosis. The follow-up Ga-68 DOTATATE PET-CT revealed no pathological increased uptake in the whole-body except the 6th vertebra showing similar uptake (SUVmax: 3.50) with the previous scan without size increase on CT. The patient was asymptomatic with normal serum chromogranin A level.",

This is resulting in modulation of neuroendocrine regulation with consequent developmental irregularities and derangements, causative infertility, endometriosis as well as premature ovarian insufficiency or polycystic ovary syndrome. A number of experimental clues was obtained on female animal models using various EDs such as synthetic estrogens and phytoestrogens, neurotransmitters, pesticides or various chemicals. These substances lead towards consequent derangement of the neuroendocrine control of reproduction from early phases of reproductive development towards different phases of adult reproductive period. This text will address some novel insights into the effects of EDs on neuroendocrine regulation of gonadal axis, effects on ovaries as well on endometrium during implantation period.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is a component of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome and it increases in the presence of chronic inflammation. Lately, \"neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio\" (NLR) has been used as an indicator of inflammation. This study evaluates the association between IR and NLR in obese women.Obese female patients who were followed up in a university hospital for the last two years were included in the study. Homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), C-peptide, NLR, bioelectrical impedance measurements of 83 patients were analyzed.The C-peptide levels of our patients showed a highly significant correlation with HOMA-IR (p<0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between fasting plasma C-peptide levels and NLR (r=0.36 and p<0.003) in obese women. The increase in C-peptide levels had a significant effect on the increase in NLR (r2=0.31, p=0.002), however insulin had no similar effect on NLR (r2=0.01, p=0.544).Plasma C-peptide levels are better correlated with NLR compared to other parameters of IR. C-peptide may be used as an efficient laboratory marker with high relevance in IR and chronic inflammatory conditions in obese women.",

The covariates of interest included the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the total form of thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Furthermore, the inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lymphocyte were measured. To analyze the data, the t-test, the nonparametric test for comparing the medians, and the Spearman correlation were used.The median (interquartile range) of ages was equal to 53 (41-66) years old, including 54 men (56.8%). As the severity of COVID-19 progressed from moderate to severe, increasing, though non-significant, trends of thyroid dysfunction were observed, the most remarkable for TSH. The only significant association between thyroid hormones and inflammatory markers was a Spearman correlation of -0.28 between TSH and LDH. Moreover, a direct association was found between the severity of COVID-19 and the LDH levels (p-value<0.001).A direct relation between the severity of COVID-19 and the LDH level and a reverse association between the LDH level and the thyroid hormone, TSH was obtained.",

Marine Lenhart Syndrome (MLS), on the other hand, is defined as the coexistence of Graves disease and hyperactive nodules,although the diagnostic criteria are not clearly defined. Fifty five years old male patient with no concomitant disease had been diagnosed with MLS and accompanying subclinical hyperthyroidy for two years. He had dysphagia for a year. Neck ultrasound revealead retrosternal goiter with multiple hypoechoic nodules with the largest size of 33x30 mm. He had normal FT3 and FT4 levels with a decreased level of TSH. Scintigraphy revealed diffuse thyroid uptake with a hyperactive nodule of 16x11 mm on right upper lobe. Due to compressive sypmtoms and MLS he underwent surgery and diagnosed with thyroid isthmus agenesia peroperatively. MLS and TIA are rare thyroid pathologies and their etiopathogenesis has not been clarified yet. This case is thought to be the first case in which MLS and TIA coexistence was reported. Even though it is a rare disorder,having a basic knowledge about TIA can be an important step in establishing a treatment plan and avoiding possible complications. Especially in management of MLS, when surgery is considered the physician should be careful for presence of a TIA.",

Patients were divided into two groups according to HbA1 c level (HbA1c levels below 7 (Group 1, n=69) and above 7 (Group 2, n=185)). We analyzed prevalence of health anxiety, factors associated with health anxiety between poor and good glycemic control and evaluated of T2DM patients according to health anxiety scale scores.SHAI scale scores were low in 52 (28%), intermediate in 58 (31.2%) and high in 76 (40.8%) of the patients. We found the severity of depressive symptoms was positively correlated with health anxiety in both groups. As a result of this study, there was a relationship between high education and low socioeconomic level, having a job, exercise and anxiety level and low SHAI score in T2DM patients. Depression, stressful life events in the last 6 months were related with high health anxiety. Although the level of health anxiety was not different between groups, low blood sugar levels were related with high health anxiety.This study found that the prevalence of health anxiety in T2DM patients was higher than expected irrespective to poor or good glycemic control, but level of health anxiety in patients with T2DM is not a good predictor for the HbA1c level.",

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass, adjusted for body size was used to asses muscle quantity. Physical performance was measured by gait speed test. We divided women in groups: group A - patients with newly diagnosed thyrotoxicosis and group B - patients who had started treatment.The values of muscle strength, muscle mass and gait speed were lower in group A compared to group B. Three of the patients in group A were diagnosed with severe sarcopenia. Thus the frequency of sarcopenia was 50% in this group. None of the women in group B met the criteria for sarcopenia.Despite the small number of women in this study, we can conclude that untreated thyrotoxicosis is a risk factor for decreased muscle strength, quantity and physical performance and could cause secondary sarcopenia.",

One hundred of them were included in the study - 50 with PHPT only and 50 with PHPT and HT. Two control groups were defined: 37 with HT and 37 without PHPT and HT. Serum markers of calcium-phosphate metabolism, bone markers (RANKL, Osteoprotegerin, β-CTX, Osteocalcin) and interleukin-17A were measured.The frequency of HT among patients with PHPT was 37.6% (95% CI 31-43%) and did not differ significantly from that in the general population, 32.5% (95% CI 30-35%). Age, BMI, markers of calcium-phosphate metabolism, bone markers and interleukin-17A weren't significantly different in PHPT with and without HT or between the two control groups. The participants with PHPT had higher levels of interleukin-17A, β-CTX and Osteocalcin (p<0.05) than those without the PHPT. RANKL and Osteoprotegerin in these groups did not differ.Interleukin-17A correlated positively with serum calcium, PTH and RANKL and negatively with serum inorganic phosphate and 25(OH)D. Controlling for HT and age did not change the correlation.In our study, HT has not additional effect on bone metabolism in the patients with PHPT. Higher levels of interleukin-17A in PHPT suggest a possible role in the PTH-induced bone remodeling.",

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SPHT) frequently emerges as a complication in the early stages of renal insufficiency, it is an adaptive response to uphold mineral balance. It is a component of the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The development of SHPT in CKD involves multiple factors and it is important to understand them in order to properly manage it, starting with early diagnosis and continuing with proper treatment. In children with CKD and SHPT, the difficulty in case management is due to non-adherence to proper diet which makes it difficult for the pediatric nephrologist to manage the case.

Hyponatremia could be due to medications e.g. antidepressants/antipsychotics or secondary to psychogenic polydipsia. They often present with altered consciousness, seizures and falls. Rapid correction of hyponatremia in patients with psychogenic polydipsia has been associated to cause rhabdomyolysis, an under-recognized yet serious condition which if left untreated can result in various complications e.g. acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities. We report a case of young patient who had background illness of schizophrenia and presented to department with severe hyponatremia secondary to psychogenic polydipsia and was eventually diagnosed as case of rhabdomyolysis due to rapid correction of hyponatremia. Objective of case report is to highlight the correct diagnosis of underlying cause of hyponatremia and challenges associated with managing rhabdomyolysis with IV fluids that can result in worsening of hyponatremia, hence emphasizing the importance of close monitoring of sodium levels and measurement of creatine kinase in any patient who presents with severe hyponatremia, particularly in the presence of other risk factors for rhabdomyolysis and consideration of careful fluid administration strategies in relation to the relative onset and risk of over-correcting hyponatremia.",

However, the increasing use and longer follow-up periods of treatment also pose risks of developing various adverse effects, ranging from common ones, including infections, to uncommon thyroid neoplasms. Adalimumab (ADA), a fully human monoclonal antibody targeted against TNF-α, is indicated for AS. We describe the case of a patient with AS who developed a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) while on therapy with ADA. Cervical lymphadenopathy and a heterogeneous nodule in the right thyroid lobe were detected in the 48-year-old female patient who had been using ADA (40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks) for 2 years with the diagnosis of AS. Fine-needle aspiration cytology confirmed PTC. ADA treatment was discontinued, and a total thyroidectomy surgery was performed. We believe that the thyroid gland should also be taken into consideration while screening for malignancy before and during TNF inhibitors (TNFi).",

However, the correlation with clinical features is weak, without an agreement upon pathological predictors of tumor behavior. The aim was to determine the immunoreactivity for anterior pituitary hormones and alpha subunit in 276 consecutive pituitary adenomas patients, aged 22-79 years (44.3 ± 8), 154 F/ 122 M: 83 acromegalics (ACM), 173 nonfunctioning adenomas (NFA) and 20 prolactinomas (PRM) submitted to surgery via transfrontal (81) or transsphenoidal (195) along 10 years (1995-2005). In addition, clinical data, hormonal secretion and tumour size were evaluated before pituitary surgery. Local ethical committee approved the study design. The immunoreactivity performed by the avidin-biotin-complex method was evaluated for beta FSH, LH, TSH, alpha subunit, PRL and GH, using a semiquantitative scale of stained cells: strong (>20%), positive (10-20%), weak (5-10%) and negative ( 10% of stained cells) was between 1-2 cm in 6 ACM, 21 NFA and 2 PRM, while positive bigger tumors (2-4 cm) were in 7 ACM, 24 NFA and 2 PRM. Giant, over 4 cm tumors were positive in 3 ACM, 8 NFA and no PRM. A similar trend of the tumor size distribution was observed in the monohormonal or null cell adenomas. In conclusion, tumor size and gonadotrophin plurihormonality are independent factors in the management of pituitary adenomas.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The necessity to determine the levels of pituitary hormones in the cerebrospinal fluid is motivated both by difficulties in the diagnosis of different neuroendocrine disorders, as well as by research purposes such as understanding the transport mechanisms of hormones through the blood brain barrier. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained with different immunometric methods for some pituitary hormones in the serum and CSF in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Materials and methods: The levels of LH, FSH, PRL and TSH were determined simultaneously in the serum and CSF with 3 different immunometric methods using commercial kits: IRMA, FIA and Chemiluminescence for 36 patients. The validation of IRMA method on CSF samples was performed using the dilution test. Results: The dilution test - as one of validation criteria of an immunoassay - proved that the results obtained in the CSF using the commercially available kits were correct. This enables the use of this sensitive method to accurately demonstrate abnormal levels of pituitary hormones beyond the blood-brain barrier. The correlation between IRMA and FIA: Hormonal concentrations values obtained by IRMA correlate well with those measured by FIA for serum with no significant differences of the mean concentration value for FSH (r=0.93, p: NS) and LH (r=0.99, p: NS), but with a significant difference for PRL (r=0.88, p=0.002). In CSF, mean concentrations values correlate well and we found no differences for TSH (r =0.97, p: NS) and LH (r = 0.94, p: NS), but significant differences for PRL (r= 0.98, p=0.001) and FSH (r=0.98, p=0.001). Statistically significant differences were also found for the CSF/serum ratio for PRL (p=0.08), FSH (p=0.001) and LH (p=0.001). The ratios CSF/serum are significantly higher with IRMA method than with FIA for all the hormones. Except for one patient for all the others we found the ratio CSF/serum less than 1 showing that the pathologic significance of this parameter is not modified due to the type of immunometric assay. A statistically significant difference (p<0.001) was found for mean FSH concentration in CSF with FIA and Chemiluminescent assays . Conclusions: Any immunometric method currently used for the determination of",

    "abstract": "Background. The occurrence of mixed dementia defined as the association of Alzheimer’s disease with vascular dementia is increasing due to the global aging of the human population. Since thyroid hormones play a role in cognition and alterations of the thyroid axis occur with aging it is reasonable to assume that thyroid function and cognitive decline in mixed dementia are linked. Objective. To investigate whether there is a link between TSH, oxidative stress, cognitive decline and depression in female patients with mixed dementia. Methods. Fourty female patients with mixed dementia and 10 healthy controls were included in the study. MMSE, depression score (Cornel Scale of depression), TSH, MDA, glutathione were determined. Serum TSH levels correlated with the cognitive decline measured by MMSE (r=0.55 p=0.0002) and with de depression score (r=0.34 p=0.0314). Furthermore an increase in the oxidative stress marker MDA (p=0.0004) and in the antioxidant defense marker Glutathione (p=0.0013) was observed in patients with mixed dementia. In addition the levels of Glutathione correlated with cognitive decline (r=-0.4997 p=0.001) and with the levels of TSH (r=-0.4997 p=0.001). Conclusion. Our results suggest that thyroid function, oxidative stress and mixed dementia are corelated. However, a possible cause and effect relationship is not yet proved.",

They are usually diagnosed after impotency, headaches and visual troubles. Other manifestations such as memory troubles, unconsciousness, meningitis, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and exophthalmos are unusual. We aimed to report two cases diagnosed after epistaxis. Case 1. A man, aged 38, suffering from chronic nasal bleeding and impotency was diagnosed with a huge prolactinoma [90x90x80 mm, PRL=3737 ng/mL (n<15)] invading the nasal cavity. Nasal biopsy confirmed PT with positivity to PRL antibodies. After dopamine agonists intake, PRL and tumour size were significantly reduced and nasal bleeding disappeared. Case 2. A male aged 29 was referred for a huge PT [PRL= 2586 ng/mL, tumour= 130x80x60 mm] diagnosed after epistaxis. Nasal endoscopy showed a bleeding greyish tumour whose immunostaining confirmed PT. Dopamine agonists stopped epistaxis after PT tumour reduction. Conclusion. Both cases suffered from epistaxis secondary to huge prolactinomas invading the nasal cavity. So, chronic nasal bleeding should be kept in mind as a possible sign of PT. Nasal biopsy should be kept in mind for diagnosis confirmation. Nasal invasion by PT can induce suppurative meningitis which is a life threatening condition, fortunately not observed in our cases.",

The metabolic effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) causing increased cardiovascular morbidity have begun to gain importance in medical science, and the number of studies investigating glucose metabolism disorders in asymptomatic PHPT patients is rare. Objective. To evaluate the relationship between glucose metabolism disorders and calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone concentrations in asymptomatic PHPT patients. Subjects and Methods. Fifty-five asymptomatic PHPT patients were included into the study. Control group consisted of 55 normocalcemic cases. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 75 g was performed with patients and controls. Insulin resistance was calculated by HOMA index. Results. No significant difference was present between groups regarding fasting plasma glucose, basal insulin and HOMA levels. Glucose levels measured at minutes 30, 90 and 120 after OGTT were higher in patients than in controls (p=0.041, p=0.025 and p=0.001, respectively). No individuals in both groups were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. While impaired glucose tolerance was detected in six patients with asymptomatic PHPT, no impaired glucose tolerance was determined in controls. A positive correlation was found between serum calcium levels, and fasting plasma glucose and OGTT glucose levels were measured at minutes 60, 90 and 120. Mean fasting plasma glucose was significantly higher in patients with serum calcium levels ≥ 10.5 mg/dL than those with serum calcium levels <10.5 mg/dL (p=0.008). No significant correlation was detected between serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels, and glucose levels were determined in OGTT and HOMA index. Conclusion. Increased levels of serum calcium affect glucose metabolism, so leading to glucose intolerance.",

    "abstract": "Pituitary adenomas are fully characterized only by immunohistochemistry. The technical limitations, gaps and peculiarities influence the pathology diagnosis. More and more data shows that clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas could synthesize or secrete hormones or their subunits. The tumor pathology is monomorphous or polymorphous, difficult to differentiate from normal adjacent tissue. Light microscopy (LM) qualitative analysis using basic or special stains can differentiate between tumor and normal tissue and allows elimination of artifacts. Electron microscopy (EM) completes the diagnosis in selected cases. Pituitary adenomas immunohistochemistry was done by LM in 120 cases (84 – clinically nonfunctioning adenomas – NFA and 36 acromegalics with or without PRL secreting adenomas - ACM) using the avidine-biotin complex method. In 26 cases we determined by EM the immunoreactive cells (17 NFA and 9 ACM) using the immunogold method. We observed high tumor immunoreactivity (mono or plurihormonal) in 43/84 (51%) NFA, 13/36 (36%) ACM respectively. Serum excess hormones and tissue immunoreactivity were significantly concordant for prolactin in NFA cases and for GH, in ACM cases (p<0.05). Mute pituitary adenomas have no clinical expression of hormonal products either they produce biologically inactive components or they synthesize but do not secrete hormones in sufficient amounts to increase serum level and to determine a systemic response. A concordance between LM and EM immunoreactivity was observed only for GH in ACM patients group (p<0.05). The differences could be due to dimensions of the samples or the number of granules inside of the cells (sparsely granulated adenomas are negative or low immunoreactive at the LM level). EM evaluation of NFA identified 2 oncocytomas and 4 null cell adenomas. The complete evaluation of pituitary adenomas includ a qualitative and quantitative analysis at the LM level using special methods, validated at the EM level in order to identify clinically mute immunoreactive cells – a possible target for specific drugs therapies in the future.",

    "abstract": "In some humans, the big and big-big prolactin variants represent the majority of circulating prolactin, considered to be without biological activity. Aims: to establish the clinical expression of macroprolactinemia and the interference with immunodiagnostic tests in a randomized group of 84 consecutive patients with hyperprolactinemia. IRMA and electrochemiluminescence (Elecsys) were used for PRL assay; gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and protein A precipitation test were used to reveal macroprolactinemia. Results: Macroprolactinemia was found in 16 out of 84 patients (group A), 62 patients had hyperprolactinemia of other causes (group B) and 6 had normal PRL levels and normal GFC (group C). Of 16 patients with macroprolactinemia, 6 showed normal PRL with IRMA and hyperprolactinemia with Elecsys. The difference between the two methods used (∆ = PRL determined by Elecsys, -PRL determined by IRMA) correlated with big big PRL level determined by GFC with Elecsys in all patients. The strongest correlation was found in patients with macroprolactinemia (group A, r=0.82, p<0.01) as compared with group B, without macroprolactinemia (r=0.39, p<0.01). Menstrual disorders were expressed, but less frequent in group A versus B (3/15 vs. 28/56, p=0.04), and the appearance of galactorrhea and infertility were not statistically different. Conclusions: In these patients, macroprolactinemia had clinical expression, but weaker than in true hyperprolactinemic patients. It determines high apparent variability of serum PRL level in current commercial assays.",

    "abstract": "Background. Alcohol ingestion can induce either a hypoglycemia or a hyperglycemia, in patients with acute and chronic ethanol poisoning, unknown with diabetes mellitus. Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 5 hours prolonged oral glucose tolerance test (5h-OGTT) is useful in evaluating the abnormalities of glucose metabolism in acute and chronic ethanol poisoning, in comparison with standard methods (fasting blood glucose - FBG, and/or 2h-OGTT). Methods. 497 consecutive patients were enrolled in a 34 months cross sectional study. In all cases, glucose tolerance was assessed by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance, OGTT 2 hours, prolonged to 5 hours. The relationship between clinical and biochemical variables of ethanol poisoning (liver status, lipid profile, metabolic syndrome) and glucose tolerance was investigated. Risk factors for hypoglycemia in ethanol poisoning were identified. Results. 349 subjects presented acute ethanol poisoning, and 148 subjects had chronic ethanol poisoning. 254 patients (51.10%) had documented alcoholic liver disease (ALD clinical, biochemical and imagistic criteria). Glucose metabolism abnormalities were recorded in 143 subjects with chronic ethanol poisoning and ALD (96.63%), and in 207 cases with acute alcohol poisoning (59.31%). 371 patients (74.65%) showed normal FBG, diabetes mellitus (DM) was diagnosed in 54 subjects (10.86%), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in 43 subjects (8.65%), delayed hypoglycemia in 172 subjects (34.60%) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) in 147 subjects (29.57%) using OGTT and ADA diagnosis criteria. Hypoglycemia was recorded in more than two thirds of acutely poisoned patients, when alcohol level was 0.5-1.5 g/L. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were recorded in half of patients with blood ethanol levels > 2.5 g/L. Conclusions. OGTT 2 hours and OGTT 5 hours revealed the same number of patients with diabetes mellitus. Frequent co morbidities in patients with ethanol poisoning influence the prolonged OGTT and revealed .especially delayed hypoglycemia, and IGT, as an indicator of alcoholic liver disease (ALD).",

The aim of this study is to select the most appropriate severity and activity criteria, respectively scores and to investigate a possible correlation among them. Subjects and methods. The study included 51 patients with GO (43 females, 8 males), mean age 46.8±11.2 years. The patients were evaluated by: clinical exam, laboratory parameters (TSH, FT4, FT3, thyroid autoantibodies) and imagistic means, performed in selected cases (CT or MRI). Results. The GO activity was assessed by the clinical activity score (CAS). We quantified the EUGOGO severity criteria, by allotting points for each selected parameter. According to the recommended criteria, the cases were divided into active (n=26) and inactive forms (n=25). There were no significant statistical differences regarding CAS between euthyroid cases (n=14) and dysthyroid cases (n=37). Serum thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb) levels did not correlate with CAS or severity scores. Severity scores correlated significantly with CAS (Pearson correlation index 0.546, r2=0.290, p=0.0001). Conclusion. Active forms of GO showed higher severity scores than the inactive ones. The severity scores correlated significantly with CAS scores. Neither CAS, nor severity scores correlated significantly with the severity of thyrotoxicosis.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoobstruction is an uncommon manifestation of hypothyroidism. However, hypotony of the bladder in myxedema is very rare, and there were only four such cases reported previously. We present a 45-year-old man with myxedema and ileus, who was started on thyroxine therapy and was detected to have bladder hypotony on the 5th day of admission. There was no evidence of bladder outflow obstruction, and both bowel and urinary symptoms improved with thyroxine therapy. Bladder hypotony may be more prevalent in patients of hypothyroidism than previously reported; hence, it is important to have a high clinical suspicion and perform early urodynamic studies to avoid back-pressure damage to the upper tracts.",

    "abstract": "Context. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic significance correlation between the endocrinopathy and the size of the pituitary adenoma with the sellar floor bone mineral density values using microfocus computerized tomography (µCT) analysis. Subjects and Methods. 16 consecutive patients with pituitary adenomas had full endocrinological and radiological work up prior to endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery. Multiple bony samples were collected from the sellar floor during surgery, and labeled and analyzed in a double blind fashion. Each bone sample was analyzed for bone mineral density (BMD) and Hounsfield units (HU) with microfocus CT. Results. There was no correlation between adenoma size and BMD values of sella floor but grade IV macroadenomas were found to have lower BMD levels. Statistical analysis showed that the level of correlation between grouped BMD ( 1.0) data with ACTH ( 46), IGF ( 303), and PRL ( 29.93) levels were insignificant (P=.569, P=.315, and P=1.00, respectively) Conclusion. We have found no clinical relationship between sellar floor BMD values and endocrinopathy and the size of the adenoma. However, it was found out that preoperative conventional CT evaluation seemed insufficient in predicting the sellar floor bone integrity and may mislead the surgeon.",

    "abstract": "The causes of premature death in untreated Cushing's syndrome are vascular disease (myocardial infarction/stroke), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and complications and infections. Long-term mortality outcome studies on pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease (CD) are limited to six studies in the English language literature. This paper reviews these studies on CD, other causes of Cushing's syndrome being excluded, because CD represents 80% of patients with the syndrome. The period covered by these studies (1970-1990) is when transsphenoidal surgery was well established as primary treatment for CD. Two studies were exclusively from surgical centres and are likely biased in favour of surgically resectable adenomas, so this needs to be borne in mind when interpreting their results. The criteria for remission of hypercortisolism and persistent disease were variable. The overall number of patients in each report is small, and the number of deaths even smaller by epidemiological standards giving very wide confidence intervals to the standardised mortality ratios (SMR). Moreover, follow-up time was relatively short (median 10-12 years) for a disease diagnosed in the patients' late 30s. Notwithstanding the above limitations of retrospective studies, and potential for positive bias, the overall SMR of around 1.5 was not significantly different from the relevant normal population for those patients deemed in remission. However, SMR was significantly worse for those patients with persistent disease. Where it was possible to analyse contributing factors to mortality, the presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, in addition to persistence of hypercortisolism, was shown to be significant. It remains possible that an overall SMR in 'cured' patients would be significant given a larger cohort, followed for longer, and with more deaths. What is clearly required is a multicentre prospective cohort study with >30 years' follow-up to answer the question definitively and identify the contributing factors in detail in order to achieve optimum long-term outcome.",

Midurination urine samples were taken into deiodinized plastic bottles and 2 mL of these samples were aliquoted to deiodinized eppendorf tubes.Median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 95.5 µg/L for pregnant women and 245 µg/L for their infants. Frequency of iodine deficiency was observed as 63.3% (n=114) (<150 µg/L) and 24.4% (n=44) (<100 µg/L) in mothers and their infants, respectively. UIC of the infants whose mothers used iodized salt was significantly higher than the one whose mothers used rocksalt (p=0.030).It was stated in our study that UIC of pregnants was lower than the target limit (<150 µg/L), suggested by World Health Organisation (WHO) and iodine deficiency in pregnants is still a problem in our city located in the centre of Turkey. Iodine deficiency was observed in 24.4% of the infants and this prevalence suggests us that iodine deficiency is still an important health problem in infants.",

Nine months after HAART initiation the viral load was undetectable (under 34 copies/μL) and the CD4 count reached 645 cells/mm3 (within normal range) after one year of treatment. Eight years after HAART initiation, based on clinical and laboratory findings, autoimmune thyroiditis was diagnosed. At this time immune competence with a normal CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio over 1 was achieved. The chronic inflammation status of an HIV infection is the reason that autoimmunity appears outside the IRIS period. Treatment was initiated with antithyroid drugs.Thyroid function should be monitored periodically in HIV patients undergoing HAART. Future observations must be made for HIV related thyroid disorders using new classifications and studies with a larger number of patients.",

DHEAS was 1.6 - 13.5 times more frequently investigated in women than in men. A peak of DHEAS evaluation test for women was at 25 years old and distribution was uniform in males over decades, excepting being lower in 0-9 and 75+ages. In the age group 10-24 years, DHEAS levels were higher in females. After 45 years, DHEAS was higher in men than in women. Analysis of 510 case records showed low DHEAS levels in boys (0-9 years) and in men aged 65 - 84+. Higher DHEAS levels were detected as a peak at 30 years old, but never after 55 years. In individuals with low DHEAS levels prevailed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (32%), adrenal tumours (30%) and primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (19%). High DHEAS levels prevailed in patients with arterial hypertension (26%), overweight-obesity -(19%), non-toxic goiter (17%) and alopecia (9%). In the normal DHEAS miscellaneous diagnoses were met most frequently - 40%. Disorders exceeding 5% were non-toxic goiter (19%), adrenal tumours - 17%, overweight/obesity - 16% and arterial hypertension- 8%. In 71 women and 124 men adrenal neoplasms were detected. Higher frequency of these was observed in women in their 30s. A peak of adrenal neoplasms in men was at their 70s. This gender difference was not conditioned by earlier attempts to seek medical care by women. A significant correlation of DHEAS, weight, body mass index and systolic blood pressure with diastolic blood pressure was found.Our study permits to determine which DHEAS secretion and clinical pattern might be associated in males of different ages.",

    "abstract": "On naked eye examination adrenal myelolipoma (AML) tissue appears to be an ectopic adrenal or renal tissue, based on the similarity to their external texture. This necessitates a histo-pathological study for confirming the origin of the tissue.To establish the origin and histological features of the incidental AML tissue found during cadaveric dissection and review the literature for similar findings with clinical picture and treatment description.Unilateral adrenal gland obtained from cadaveric dissection was subjected to histological study by H & E staining of the slides prepared. The literature review was done from articles published in PubMed indexed journals.A case of an incidental finding of AML during cadaveric dissection is presented which on naked eye examination was appearing to be an ectopic adrenal or renal tissue, based on the similarity to their external texture. On histological examination, a thin rim of adrenocortical tissue, surrounding the mature adipose tissue, and attenuated by islets of myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines in varying proportions, resembling the mature bone marrow morphology, was observed. The literature review on PubMed explains similar incidental post-mortem autopsy findings due to the asymptomatic nature of the tumor. The incidence of AML varied between 0.08% and 0.2% in the last decade of the 20th century, which increased up to 10 - 15% of incidental adrenal masses due to the widespread use of non-invasive imaging modalities leading to an increase in the diagnosis of the pathology.Before considering the ectopic incidence of tissue during cadaveric dissection, a histo-pathological examination is mandatory for confirmation. Adreno-myelolipoma is an asymptomatic post-mortem finding in 10-15% of cases of adrenal tissue which mimics ectopic adrenal gland or renal tissue due to its external texture.",

    "abstract": "The recall rate in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) newborn screening programs depends on several factors such as primary screening strategy, sample collection guidelines, and cut-off. A recall rate of 0.05% is recommended but recall rates of 0.01-13% are reported worldwide.The aim of the study was to assess the recall rate in association with the age of the newborn at sample collection and with a lower cut-off.This was a retrospective correlational study concerning TSH results in CH screening program.All newborns from a tertiary center in Targu Mures, Romania between 2013-2018 were included. Four groups were created and a correlation test between TSH median value and age in days was performed. The recall rate was calculated using three cut-off levels for 8182 TSH results performed in 2018.90% of the DBS were collected in days 3-5 after birth and 1/79 live births from this group had TSH above the lower cut-off used (10 mUI/L). 2% of the samples were collected in less than 48 hours after birth and 1/21 live birth from this group had TSH > 10 mUI/L. The recall rate in our center in 2018 was 0.08%, higher than the recommended rate of 0.05%. With the cut-off value recommended by the Health Ministry a 0.03% recall rate was obtained.Sample collection in less than 48 hours increases the recall rate in CH screening with TSH primary testing strategy. A lower cut-off raises the recall rate with a higher rate of false-positive cases (94.12%) but with 100% negative predictive value.",

After recruitment, subgroup analyses of the patients were performed based on their calcium and vitamin D levels.A total of 81.101 elderly patients, who had been evaluated for their vitamin D levels, were screened. Of the 458 (0.6%) elderly patients with 25(OH)D>88 ng/mL according to our criteria, 217 patients with complete data were accepted into our study. The median 25(OH)D level was 103.7ng/mL (min-max:88.2-275.9). Most of the elderly patients (86.6%) with very high 25(OH)D levels were normocalcemic. When patients with hypercalcemia were compared with normocalcemic group, no difference was observed in the levels of 25(OH)D, intact parathormone (iPTH), phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and their age. However, the PTH suppression rate was significantly higher in hypercalcemic group (p=0.005).The elderly patients with very high 25(OH)D levels would appear to be mostly normocalcemic whereas life-threatening hypercalcemia would also occur. Treatment and follow-up planning should be done according to the clinical guideline recommendations.",

Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version. Gender identity problems were investigated using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria.The mean age of the sample was 11.02 years (SD: 3.25, range: 6-18). 51.1% of the patients had at least one lifetime comorbid psychiatric disorder. The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), tic disorders and enuresis nocturna. Tic disorders and ADHD were higher in males but they were not statistically significant. Two female patients were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and 18.5% of females showed variably masculinized behaviors. The girls with gender identity problems expressed lower satisfaction with their sex than other girls and boys.Children and adolescents with CAH had many psychiatric disorders, especially neurodevelopmental disorders. ADHD and tic disorders should be kept in mind during assessment especially in male patients. Gender dysphoria and masculine behaviors seem to be common in female patients with CAH so they should be carefully investigated.",

Cysteine increased linearly with metabolic unwellness from NW to MUHO. Lysine and glutamine were significantly higher, and asparagine was significantly lower in NW and MHO than in MUHO.By trend and group analysis we identified specific changes in serum AAs along with the progression of metabolically unwellness.",

    "abstract": "Paget's disease of bone is a metabolic skeleton disorder with different epidemiological patterns: increased incidence up to 3% of the Northern Caucasian population over the age of 55 or a very rare occurrence as in Asia. We present a case of a 69 years old female patient with diffuse bone pain, suspected of osteoporosis after a DXA investigation of bones. She has developed progressive skull deformation over the last 17 years and bilateral sensoneural deafness. On admission in our hospital, she had alkaline phosphatase serum levels five times higher than the upper normal value and low values of 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Parathormone and calcium levels were in normal range. Radiologic findings confirmed the monostotic type of Paget's disease. Other biomarkers of bone remodeling: serum osteocalcin for bone formation and serum beta Cross Laps for bone resorption, showed moderately increased levels. High dose therapy with alendronate and alphacalcidol were given with the normalization of bone markers after 9 months of sustained treatment. The vitamin D deficiency of this patient is an independent, associated disease, producing a decrease of bone mineral density as shown by DXA measurement. The case presentation and the review of the medical literature on this subject are intended to remind clinicians of the importance of appropriate diagnosis and therapy in this disease, as well as the importance of establishing the prevalence of Paget's disease of bone in Romania.",

This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of androgen replacement therapy with the new long-acting intramuscular (i.m.) testosterone undecanoate (T.U.) in comparison to oral T.U. in adult men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Patients and methods. In 41 patients with central hypogonadism (30 with pituitary tumors or craniopharyngiomas, 11 with non-tumor hypogonadism), aged 20-62 years, we evaluated, before and after androgen replacement therapy, morning serum total testosterone (T), hemoglobin, hematocrit, cholesterol, triglycerides (measured with commercial kits in venous blood sampled at 8.00-9.30 a.m) and the sexual dysfunction (SD) by questions on libido, frequency and quality of erections. Results. In group A, including 28 patients treated with oral T.U. median dose 120 mg/day (range 80-160) in 3 divided doses, for 4-60 (median 14) months, T rose from 0.37 ± 0.40 ng/mL (mean ± standard deviation) to 1.43 ± 1.36 ng/mL (p<0.01), reaching normal levels only in 4 patients (14%). In group B, including 20 patients treated with 1000 mg i.m. T.U. at 12 weeks intervals, for 1-12 (median 6) months, T rose from 0.88 ± 0.83 ng/mL to 5.88 ± 3.50 ng/ml (p<0.01). T was low in 1 patient (5%) and above normal in 6 patients (30%). A subgroup (C) of 7 patients was switched from oral to i.m.T.U. T was higher after i.m. than after oral T.U in group B vs. A and within subgroup C (p < 0.01). SD improved in 7/16 patients (43.7 %) on oral T.U. and in 11/12 patients (91.6%) on i.m. T.U (p < 0.05). Hematocrit increased significantly from baseline in both groups, while serum cholesterol and triglycerides did not change significantly on either T.U. treatment. Conclusions. Clinical efficacy, judged by normal morning T and sexual dysfunction improvement, was reached in over 90% of patients with central hypogonadism after i.m.T.U. and in less than half after oral T.U.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) is a rare genetic autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations of RET gene (Chr 10q11.21). Clinical features include medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with 90-95% penetrance, pheochromocytoma (50% penetrance) and primary hyperparathyroidism (20-30%). Screening for RET gene mutation allows early identification of asymptomatic carriers who may benefit from prophylactic thyroidectomy, thus preventing morbidity and death. Aim. Implementation of RET mutation detection as screening procedure for Romanian MEN 2A families. Subjects and methods. We studied a three-generation MEN 2A Romanian family with one affected male (age 75) in the first generation, his affected descendants (one male-45y, one female-42y old) in the second generation and four asymptomatic subjects at risk (three males aged 15, 19 and 22y and one 18y old female) in the third generation. Mutation detection was performed by automated DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified exons 10 and 11 of RET gene. Results. A Cys634Arg (TGC/CGC) heterozygous mutation of RET gene was detected in affected individuals as well as in 3 asymptomatic male subjects, but was absent in one asymptomatic female. Sequencing results were confirmed by digestion of PCR products with HhaI restriction enzyme. Total thyroidectomy was proposed to all asymptomatic carriers, although this decision was postponed and patients continued biochemical screening. Conclusion. Despite success in implementation of mutation detection in clinical laboratory, this study illustrates the difficulty in acceptance of prophylactic thyroidectomy",

Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated by the FMD method. The relationship between endothelial dysfunction, specific humoral markers of acromegaly and traditional cardiovascular risk factors was analysed in both groups.Although the presence of cardiovascular risk factors was statistically significantly higher in the group of hypertensives (the most important were age, blood pressure, glycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and SCORE), the presence of endothelial dysfunction was higher in the acromegaly group (61.10% vs. 32.10%, p=0.02). The best correlation with endothelial dysfunction in acromegaly group was the level of GH (28.9±28 vs. 11.7±10.3, p=0.003).The presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with acromegaly is highly dependent on the level of GH and traditional cardiovascular risk factors are less important. In these patients the cardiovascular risk should not be evaluated in the same way as in normal population.",

Although thyrotoxicosis is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal dysmotility, there are limited studies focused on motility disorders in hyperthyroidism.We aimed to investigate the manometric measurements to determine if esophageal motility is affected in Graves' disease.Thirty patients with Graves' disease (18 female and 12 male) and 30, age and sex matched, healthy controls (22 female and 8 male) were recruited to the study between 2015 and 2016. Esophageal manometry was performed using MMS (Medical Measurement Systems bv. The Netherlands) Solar GI - Air Charged Intelligent Gastrointestinal Conventional Manometry.The mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) was 16.9 ± 5.3 mmHg in hyperthyroid patients and 20.1 ± 8.8 mmHg in the control group and there was no significant difference (p>0.05). It was observed that the duration of contraction was 3.9 ± 0.7 s in healthy subjects and, significantly shorter 3.2 ± 0.5 s in hyperthyroid patients (p<0.001). Duration of contraction was negatively correlated with TSH receptor Ab titer in patients (p=0.006, r= -0.48). Also, it was observed that the duration of relaxation was negatively correlated with fT4 levels in the patient group (p<0.05, r= -0.46).In this study, we observed that esophageal motility can be affected via shortened duration of contraction in Graves' disease. The gastrointestinal symptoms due to possible motility dysfunctions should be considered in the evaluation of hyperthyroid patients.",

In the current classification of diabetes among the so-called \"idiopathic phenotypes\", apart Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has been included provisionally term \"Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults\" (LADA). This has unclear characterization regarding the age at onset, the presence of anti-β-cell antibodies and the level of insulin secretory function, in conformity with C-peptide levels. According to several recent publications, there are no specific biochemical or genetic markers for Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), but only a gradual transition from T1D to T2D. In addition, the word \"latent\" in the construction of \"LADA\" term is inaccurate because in this phenotype nothing is latent: both the autoimmunity and diabetes are present and are even parts of the diagnosis. So that, the best term should be what in reality this sub-phenotype is: an Intermediary Diabetes Mellitus (IDM). Some recent genetic data strongly support this designation.",

Five weeks after viral injection, half rats in each group were given access to the HF diet. At 16 weeks, rat livers were collected. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Blood glucose levels were measured by the oxidase method, serum insulin, triglyceride, and TC levels were measured by Elisa. Pathological changes in the liver were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. AKT, p-AKT, and GSK-3 levels were measured by western blotting.Compared with AAVshCTL-injected rats, AAVshNPY-injected rats showed a significant decrease in blood glucose concentrations; serum insulin, triglyceride, and TC; HOMA-IR; and IRS-1 and PI3K mRNA levels (P<0.05). ISI, GSK-3, and p-AKT levels were significantly increased (P<0.05). HE staining showed that AAVshNPY-injected rats fed the HF diet had mild fatty degeneration.These results suggest that DMH NPY knock-down improves hepatic insulin sensitivity in HF diet-fed rats by activating the hepatic PI3K/AKT insulin signalling pathway.",

Body weight, blood glucose levels (BGLs), bone mineral density (BMD) and geometric/mechanical properties of bone tissue were evaluated. BGLs in diabetic rats were significantly increased compared to non-diabetic rats, while the body weights were decreased (p<0.05).A significant difference was not detected between groups with regard to cross-sectional area of diaphyseal femur (p>0.05). Maximum load, energy absorption capacity, ultimate stress, ultimate strain, toughness and displacement were shown to decrease and stiffness was shown to increase in DM rats (p<0.05).

Detection of this pathology during the neonatal period, especially in premature newborns, is difficult because of the electrolyte variations that occur as a result of the immature kidney function.The subject was a preterm infant with very low birth weight (VLBW) and persistent hypernatremic hyperosmolarity that developed polyuria and polydipsia in the first weeks of life.Taking into account blood and urine laboratory tests, vasopressin levels, as well as family history, the infant was diagnosed with congenital NDI. Early treatment allowed a good development, proving that the prevention of long-term complications is possible through multidisciplinary care and frequent monitoring. The particularity of this case was the presence of persistently elevated presepsin levels. This association prompted the investigation into underlying renal hypernatremia.NDI is a rare condition and the onset in the neonatal period is a sign of severity and hereditary causality. Early diagnosis, symptomatic treatment and multidisciplinary monitoring may decrease the risk of long-term complications.",

All patients had parathyroidectomy with BNE and thyroidectomy: 11 (22%) patients had micropapillary thyroid cancer (mPTC), 2 (4%) had papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).The results were inconclusive in clearly demonstrating which patients presenting with coexisted thyroid nodules should undergo thyroidectomy, rather than MIP, and which should be monitored for thyroid nodules after MIP. However, we consider that in cases who are not clearly indicated for thyroidectomy, MIP followed by monitoring of thyroid nodules can be the treatment approach.",

The term \"osteoporosis\" was searched using Google Trends between January 1, 2004 and September 12, 2024. Cosinor analysis was used to test the effect of seasonality on relative search volumes (RSV) for osteoporosis searches in the USA and worldwide. LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) was used to decompose a time series into its seasonal component, trend component, and residual component. We also analysed RSV values in US states according to income levels. It is seen that RSV values in the USA and the world have been in a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014, but after 2015, they have been in an increasing trend. According to the results of the cosinor analysis, RSV values in the US and worldwide are highest in the fall months and lowest in the summer months. Significant differences were found in search trends between seasons in both the US and the world (p<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference in RSV values by income level worldwide and in the USA (p>0.05). Osteoporosis appears to be a global health problem and a major focus of attention, both in the US and around the world. Health strategies to increase osteoporosis awareness can be planned to address different income groups, taking into account regional and seasonal effects.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between creatinine and cystatin levels and thyroid disorders. To further investigate the diagnostic value of serum creatinine to cystatin C ratio in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. One hundred eighty four thyrotoxicosis patients and 406 healthy controls were enrolled. We assessed at baseline characteristics, serum Cr:Cyc in thyrotoxicosis group, control group and subgroups and analyzed the relationship between the indicator and the etiology of thyroid gland toxicity. Subgroup analysis indicated that the Cr:Cyc ratio in the Graves' disease (GD) group was lower than those in the Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and subacute thyroiditis (SAT) groups (P<0.001). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the Cr:Cyc ratio was positively correlated with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) but negatively correlated with free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) in the GD group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) value of the Cr:Cyc ratio for the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis was 0.933 (P<0.001), and the AUC value for the diagnosis of GD was 0.778 (P<0.001). The Cr:Cyc ratio has clinical significance in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis and the identification of thyrotoxicosis etiology.",

In this retrospective study, we studied PTIs in a multidisciplinary clinical approach of nuclear medicine and general surgery clinics. US indications and reports of 41275 were reviewed retrospectively. Of these patients, PTI was suspected in 66 (0.16%) patients. Those with a pathology-confirmed diagnosis after surgery formed Group PCD and those without a pathology-confirmed diagnosis and operation Group NPCD. These groups were compared statistically according to demographic data, laboratory tests, imaging results and postoperative findings. The diagnosis of PTI was confirmed pathologically in 31 operated patients. Other pathologies rather than PTI on US were multinodular goiter, thyroiditis, thyroid nodule and perithyroidal lymph node. PTH and calcium levels were significantly higher in PCD Group;anti-TPO and anti-TG levels were significantly higher in NPCD Group. Lesions suspected of PTI on US should be followed-up with further evaluation by laboratory tests and imaging methods and a multidisciplinary working environment should be established.",

    "abstract": "Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability, and can be diagnosed in the early period through neonatal screening programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of CH and recall rates in the province of Adıyaman. This retrospective study evaluated the data of newborn screening program in Adıyaman province between January 2015 and December 2020. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) cut-off value in the screening program is 5.5 mIU/L and TSH values lower than 5.5 mIU/L are regarded as normal. Babies with TSH levels exceeding 5.5 mIU/L were defined as 'recalled'. TSH measurements and clinical diagnoses of the recalled babies were evaluated. TSH was <5.5 mIU/L in 62270 (90.08%) of the newborns, 5.5-20 mIU/L in 6114 (8.84%), and >20 mIU/L in 742 (1.07%). Venous T4-TSH values were normal in 673 of the 742 babies with TSH levels exceeding 20 mIU/L, while 63 babies were diagnosed with CH. Heel blood results were normal in 5880 of the 6114 babies with TSH levels of 5.5-20 mIU/L and for whom repeat heel blood was requested. TSH levels in repeat heel blood were >5.5 mIU/L in 184 babies and 93 of them were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The recall rate among babies undergoing heel blood TSH measurement in the province of Adıyaman was 9.9%. 156 babies were started on thyroid replacement therapy with diagnoses of CH. The incidence of babies diagnosed with hypothyroidism was 1/443. According to the CH screening results, the recall rate and incidence of CH in the province of Adıyaman were higher than the global general figures. Both the low TSH threshold value employed in neonatal hypothyroidism screening and the province falling within the iodine deficiency region may account for this.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder stemming from pancreatic dysfunction, is surging in India, notably among those aged 60 and above. The escalating disease prevalence in this demographic necessitates heightened medication use, escalating the risk of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). This underscores the vital role of ADR monitoring to curtail potential harm. A 12-month cross-sectional, prospective, observational study engaged 200 participants from the geriatric Outpatient Department (OPD). Diabetic patients in the geriatric OPD, willing to participate, underwent face-to-face evaluations using a structured questionnaire focused on adverse reactions to anti-diabetic medications. The study also included a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) assessment. Of the 200 patients, 57% were male, 43% female. Thirteen participants (7 male, 6 female) reported ADR encounters during therapy, predominantly categorized as mild in causality and severity. KAP assessments unveiled a robust understanding of ADRs, primarily shaped by physicians and reinforced by pharmacists. Anticipation of ADR occurrence was noted in 70% of respondents, linked to non-compliance and lifestyle factors. Educating caregivers about the critical importance of monitoring medication adherence among the elderly is imperative. Cultivating an attitude of reporting even minor ADRs to appropriate authorities is essential for harm prevention.",

The presenting complaints are painless hematuria, micturition syncope. It may be sporadic or associated with hereditary predisposition syndromes such as Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma Syndrome. A 70-year-old male presented with complaints of hematuria. The physical examination was unremarkable. The CT scan revealed an enhancing mass in the lateral wall of bladder. The mass was resected, and histopathological examination showed features of tumor cells arranged in Zell ballen pattern. Tumor cells show mild nuclear pleomorphism, round to oval vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant granular basophilic cytoplasm. Rare mitosis and no necrosis were noted. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were immunoreactive to Synaptophysin, S-100P and negative for CK7 suggesting Paraganglioma. The patient is doing fine after two years of follow up. Due to its rarity, there are no recommendations for treatment and monitoring but, their risk of malignancy forces a long-term follow up. Initial management included early reassessment by cystoscopy, transurethral bladder resection (TURB) and imaging.",

The etiology is multifactorial and is not fully understood. SS is separated in three subclasses: classical, malignancy-associated, and drug-induced. It was shown that this syndrome can reveal an underlying hematological or solid malignancy. We report the case of a 55-year-old female patient referred to the Urology department for management of pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland, revealed by abdominal imaging in another medical unit during the evaluation and diagnosis of multiple mucocutaneous lesions, characterized by erythematous-violaceous plaques and nodules, and painful aphthous ulcers of the tongue. The eruption of each lesion was preceded by low-grade fever and chills. The hormonal profile highlighted the presence of elevated normetanephrines. We performed 3D laparoscopic transperitoneal right adrenalectomy after preoperative treatment with alpha blocker therapy. The clinical outcome was favourable, given that the cutaneous lesions started to heal after the surgery. Sweet's syndrome in association with pheochromocytoma is a very rare condition, only few cases were described in literature to our knowledge. The multidisciplinary collaboration is extremely important in the management of such cases.",

A typical dose of iodinated contrast media (ICM) contains approximately 13,500 μg of free iodide and 15-60 g of bound iodine, representing an acute iodide load of 90 to several hundred thousand times the recommended daily intake of 150 μg. As a result of sudden exposure to high iodide loads, thyroid hormone regulation can be disrupted, leading to hypothyroidism (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) or hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon), particularly in those with underlying nodular thyroid disease. A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency room (ER) with clinical and electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction. Primary PCI with iodinated contrast was performed. After the intervention, laboratory analyses revealed thyrotoxicosis, and the patient was administered initial thyrosuppressive therapy along with cardiac therapy and discharged from the hospital. One week later, he returned to the hospital with signs of a thyroid storm. This case report aimed to raise awareness regarding the routine evaluation of thyroid function in patients with and without previous signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis who had undergone acute myocardial infarction and coronary angiography.",

Group 1 did not undergo any postpartum screening, Group 2 only underwent fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1c tests, and Group 3 only underwent oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Data on demographic characteristics and reasons for non-compliance were collected. Only 3.45% of women complied while 55.81% did not undergo any screening. Adherence was significantly higher among primigravid women. Statistically significant differences were observed based on education level, GDM treatment method, and information received during pregnancy or postpartum (p<0.001). The most common reason for non-compliance was normal FPG values observed post-delivery. This study emphasizes the crucial need for enhanced education and information provision to high-risk women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, both during pregnancy and the postpartum period, particularly during their hospital stay.",

The effects of orlistat treatment, either 360 mg/day alone or orlistat plus metformin at a dose of 1700 mg/day, were retrospectively examined in patients who had been compliant with therapy for at least three months and had also made adjustments to their diet and lifestyle. The mean age in the orlistat group was 46.26 ± 11.30 years, and 43.13 ± 11.37 years in the orlistat plus metformin group. Significant reductions in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) resulted from three months of orlistat treatment (p < 0.01). The combination of orlistat and metformin produced substantial reductions in weight, BMI, WC, systolic BP, diastolic BP, CIMT, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol levels, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and HbA1c levels (p < 0.01). The groups showed comparable weight, BMI, and WC. Neither group experienced notable side effects. Treatments with orlistat and orlistat in combination with metformin led to a significant reduction in body weight. Similar body weight changes were observed between the groups, whereas the alterations in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c levels were greater with orlistat combined with metformin treatment.",

    "abstract": "Increased body mass index (BMI) is considered a risk factor for breast cancer. Moreover, it is associated with an unfavorable prognosis of the disease. Overweight and obesity are a global public health problem. We aimed to describe the risk factor of high BMI in breast cancer patients through an observational study of patients diagnosed with mammary neoplasm. The study was performed on a sample of 172 women with breast cancer with a mean age of 58.8 (±SD) years and a control sample of 217 women without breast cancer with a mean age of 54 (±SD) years. Data collection was performed by questionnaires and by anthropometric measurements, during 2017-2021. Statistical analysis used numerical descriptive methods: mean, standard deviation, etc. and graphical methods. The sample of women with breast cancer compared to the control sample showed differences in BMI (26.27 vs. 24.45 kg/m2), p=0.001. Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer. This risk factor for breast cancer could be altered by the quality of the diet and by the adoption of an active lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: to determine the 24-hours profile and the clinical implications of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HCMA) following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Subjects and methods: prospective and observational study set in cardiac anesthesia and intensive unit. One hundred patients with cardiac procedures with CPB, mean age 56 years, mean body weight 71 kg, were enrolled. Sampling of arterial blood for gas, acid-base parameters (pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, base excess, concentration of bicarbonate and anion gap) and serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) were performed at four time points: 30 min after induction of anesthesia (T1), after completion of CPB (T2), at 6 hours (T3) and at 24 hours postoperatively (T4). The volume of fluids administered intraoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively as well as major complications: bleeding, arrhythmias and organ dysfunctions (renal, pulmonary or neurological) were also registered. For statistical analysis we used a t-test (p<0.05). Results: Seventy-three (73 %) of the patients developed metabolic acidosis during the observation period. Sixty-six (66 %) patients had HCMA. Mean chloride concentrations were at T1, T2, T3, and T4: 103 mmol/L, 113 mmol/L, 111 mmol/L and 108 mmol/L, respectively. The chloride concentration was significantly higher at T2 and T3 as compared to baseline. There were no statistical differences between patients with and without HCMA, neither in the amount and type of fluids administered perioperatively, nor in the incidence of bleeding, arrhythmias, and organ dysfunctions. Conclusions: HCMA is common after cardiac surgery. It is a transient and benign acid-base disturbance. In our low risk cardiac surgery patients, HCMA was not associated with major postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Severe hypokalemia is a life threatening event, which triggers a number of therapeutic and diagnostic attitudes. In this paper we present a case of 63 years old man, who presented with progressive lassitude, edema, weight loss. The mild hypertension and hyperglycaemia were treated with spironolactone and diet. Initial evaluation showed severe hypokalemia (1.7 mmol/l), hepatomegalia, hyperplasic/nodular adrenal masses; in addition, he has developed a right middle lobe pneumonia which improved with antibiotics. Referred for the suspicion of hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone values were normal (9.3-9.5 µg/dl), but ACTH was high (725 pg/ml) and did not suppress (710.8 pg/ml) to high dose DXM, as well as cortisol: basal values 27.78 ug/dl, high dose DXM 35.06 ug/dl, showing an ACTH dependent Cushing syndrome despite lack of suggestive clinical signs. Tumor markers suggested a neuroendocrine neoplasia: carcinoembryonic antigen=101 ng/ml (normal values=0.52-6.3 ng/ml), CA 19-9= 155 ng/ml (N < 33 ng/ml). Further radiological evaluation showed a 3 cm right lobe lung tumour. Despite high potassium supplements and spironolactone, the hypokalemia remained around 3.2 mmol/l, characteristic for an apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Because of aggressive evolution of the lung tumour, he died three months after the initial admission into the hospital. Pathology report showed a lung carcinoma. ACTH immunostaining of the lung tumour was positive and revealed a paraneoplastic secretion.",

Seventeen months prior to this admission, the child was diagnosed with acute adrenal insufficiency and was still on replacement therapy with dexamethasone and fludrocortisone. While on therapy the child presented several relapses that required treatment correction. MRI revealed cerebral atrophy lesions, which, together with the laboratory findings and clinical symptoms, conducted the diagnosis of ALD. This diagnosis was also supported by the pathogenic mutation detected in the ACBD1 gene identified in the pacient and patient’s mother and sister. The child died 8 months after the onset of neurological signs. Childhood ALD is classified as classical ALD form, the most frequent, affecting only boys aged 4 to 10 years. Family screening obliged by the identification of the homozygotes is helpful for the early therapy of heterozygotes, genetic counseling and disease prevention. The prognosis is still poor, the available treatment being hormone substitution therapy and psychological support.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate nonapeptide neurohormones constitute an evolutionarily conserved family, involved in vital functions, such as hydro-osmotic balance regulation, reproduction and social behaviour. Two human members of this family are known, vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT), with their highly homologous genes closely located on Chr 20p13. Presence of vasotocin (AVT) in man has been suggested, but remains controversial, and genetic evidence is lacking. AVT activity could be explained by the presence of a third distinct gene for AVT or an RNA-processing mechanism involving products of AVP and/or OXT genes. To test the first hypothesis, we developed bioinformatics and experimental approaches using genomic DNA and fetal tissues mRNAs. Family-specific primers for AVT and neurophysin were designed based on CODEHOP strategy and used in our experiments. Results of bioinformatics and genomic DNA experiments (family-specific and Alu step-out PCR) suggest there is no evidence for an AVT gene in the genome. RNA-based techniques 3’-RACE and Family-Specific Domain Restriction Fragment RTPCR provided evidence for new transcript species that could code for AVT. Further experiments will be needed to characterize them. We discuss potential mechanisms of AVT mRNA generation based on AVP and OXT mRNAs, by alternative splicing, heterologous transsplicing or RNA-editing. While all methods we developed proved feasible, current results suggest there is no AVT gene in the genome, but specific mRNAs could be present in fetal tissues. Their full characterization may potentially allow identification of vasotocin mRNA and shed light on",

    "abstract": "Aim: We have undertaken an attempt to compare the application efficacy of the proliferative activity markers in the differential diagnosis of thyroid Hurthle cell tumors using the PCNA and Ki-67 labeling and AgNOR visualization techniques. Materials and methods: The present work is a retrospective analysis of proliferative potential in 40 Hurthle cell tumors, on paraffin blocks: 10 Hurthle cell carcinomas (HCC), 16 Hurthle cell adenomas (HCA) and 14 hyperplastic nodules with Hurthle cell metaplasia (HCM). The evaluation of the mean number of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) per nucleus and the proliferative index (PI-the percentage of PCNA and Ki-67 positive cells) was performed using staining silver impregnation method and antibodies against PCNA (clone PC 10) and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1) in LSAB detection Kit and visualization with DAB (diaminobenzidine). U-Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis. The difference was considered significant for p<0.05. Results: The values of PI-PCNA, PI-Ki-67 as well as the mean AgNOR counts in nuclei were: 25.5, 12.8, and 5.0 in HCC; 7.6, 4.9, and 3.1 in HCA and respectively 5.1, 4.0 and 2.3 in HCM. Statistically significant differences were found in all the proliferative activity markers between malignant and benign tumors: HCM: HCC (p<0.0001) and HCC: HCA (p<0.001). Indifferently of the examined markers and the method of quantification of the reaction, we did not found significant differences between hyperplastic nodules with Hurthle cell metaplasia and oncocytic adenomas (p< 0.07). Conclusions: PI-PCNA, PI Ki-67 and mean AgNOR/ nucleus, used as markers for the appreciation of proliferative activity of oncocytic thyroid tumors (classified as adenomas, carcinomas and hyperplastic nodules with Hurthle cells), reflect differences between the studied thyroid lesions. Our results indicate the utility of these parameters in the differentiation of the benign oncocytic tumors from the malignant ones.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis continues to be a universal health problem and recent studies showed an increased incidence of all forms of this disease. We report the case of a 81 year old female patient with a large left cervical tumour and cutaneous lesions that proved to be an unusual form of tuberculosis. The patient had a 2 years history of slowly increasing left cervical mass with no significant clinical manifestation. Medical assistance was requested mostly by the family, concerned about the large mass visible on the left side of the patient’s neck. Clinical and laboratory investigation revealed: a large left laterocervical tumour and the presence of erythematous, non pruriginous skin lesions. No significant changes were shown by routine blood tests. Thyroid function was in the normal range. Neck ultrasound revealed the presence of a 5/6 cm, well defined hypoechoic mass and the thyroid scan showed no accumulation of the radiotracer in the cervical tumour. Routine tuberculosis test was negative and the patient had no sign of pulmonary involvement. Histopathological examination after ablation of this tumour showed the presence of granulomatous lesions suggesting tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The same aspect was seen after histopathological examination of the specimens from cutaneous biopsy. The diagnosis was certified by the PCR amplification of the DNA extracted from the skin lesions, which led to the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The cutaneous lesions were clearly improved after tuberculostatic treatment, supporting the hypothesis of a rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Thyroiditis developing post pituitary surgery in a case of TSH secreting tumor has been reported, albeit rarely. A 46 year old female was treated as a case of hypothyroidism for almost five years, however, TSH levels remained unsuppressed in spite of increasing thyroxine doses. A cyclic pattern of TSH with T3 secretion was observed after stopping thyroxine, though T4 levels were normal. T3 suppression test revealed a non suppressed TSH and MRI sella revealed a pituitary mass with Grade 1 cavernous sinus invasion. With a diagnosis of TSH secreting tumor, the patient was initiated on octreotide therapy. TFT normalized within 4 days of initiation of octreotide, tumor size reduced by about 30% within 2 months of therapy and goiter size reduced to almost half with octreotide therapy. Anti TPO levels which were initially negative became positive within a month of octreotide therapy and FNAC thyroid revealed thyroiditis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case report of development of thyroiditis after octreotide therapy. The immunomodulatory role of TSH and somatostatin may have a role in the development of thyroiditis in this case.",

    "abstract": "Context.Aromatase is a key enzyme in local estrogen production by androgen conversion, especially in women post-menopause.There have been controversies concerning aromatase localization in breast carcinomas and its association with current histopathological variables.Material and Methods.Using polyclonal antibody immunohistochemistry we assessed (by intensity and percentage scores) the immunolocalization of aromatase in 70 tissue samples, and described particularities within the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.Results.Aromatase was found in all tissue compartments: tumor (95.7%), stroma (58.6%) and adipose tissue (94.3%).Aromatase expression in tumor cells correlated inversely with tumor grading (p=-0.361,p=0.027), and positively with estrogen receptor status (ER, p=0.143, p<0.001).Dividing the study group by intrinsic subtypes, a strongly inversely association between tumor aromatase and grading (p=-0.486,p<0.001), and between stromal aromatase and Ki67-index (p=-0.448,p=0.048) was observed in luminal A breast cancer.Tumor aromatase and ER percentage scores had stronger correlations in luminal B HER2 negative (p=0.632, p=0.002), and positive (p=0.324,p=0.026) tumors.In contrast, in triple negative tumors, a positive association stromal aromatase and Ki67 index (p=-0.359,p=0.007) was observed. Conclusion.Local aromatase was linked to better tumor differentiation and proliferation in luminal breast subtypes, and not in triple negative cases, suggesting a potential prognostic role of aromatase in breast carcinomas.",

In this study, we try to identify novel thyroid hormone-targeting lipogenic metabolic genes and analyze their molecular regulative mechanism.Thirty-five promoters of twenty-nine human lipogenic regulative enzyme genes were constructed into pXP1 luciferase reporter plasmid (PFK2/FBP2-luc) and transfected into HeGP2 cells, respectively. Gene expression induced by triiodothyronine (T3) was detected by luciferase assay. The T3-activated gene promoter was then analyzed by sequence analysis, deletion and mutation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).After 10 nM T3 stimulation for 36 h, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) 3, and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT) 2 were significantly activated, respectively. A AGGTCA-like-direct-repeat-4 consensus thyroid hormone response element (DR4-TRE)-like sequence was found in the GPAT3 promoter, which was then verified to be necessary for T3-induced GPAT3 activation by gene deletion and mutation analysis. EMSA further identified that T3-thyroid receptor (TR) α-retinoid-X receptor (RXR) complex directly bound on the GPAT3 promoter.Triiodothyronine could activate the GPAT3 through DR4-TRE-like sequence binding to participate in lipogenic regulation. AGPAT2 may be another thyroid hormone target enzyme.",

Stem cells are typically found in a specialized microenvironment of the tissue, called the niche, which regulates their maintenance, self-renewal, fate determination, and reaction to external influences. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of stem cells in the initiation, invasion, and progression of pituitary adenomas.All specimens were collected between January 2007 and April 2015. Radiological classification (invasiveness) for all cases was performed according to the Wilson-Hardy classification system. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to all specimens for CD133, Oct4, Sox2 and nestin.The study included 48 patients. Of 48 patients, 17 (35.4%) were male and 31 (64.6%) were female. Mean age is 47.10±14.14 (17-86 yrs.). According to the Wilson-Hardy classification system, 27 (56.3%) were non-invasive adenomas. There was no statistical significance between the expression of pituitary stem cell markers (CD133, OCT4, SOX2, nestin) and invasiveness.All stem cell markers are stained extensively in pituitary adenomas, except for SOX2 which was stained weakly. However, there is no effect of stem cells on invasiveness of pituitary adenomas because we cannot find a difference of the staining level between invasive and non-invasive adenomas. Nestin was stained extensively in functional adenomas, especially for GH, PRL, and gonadotropin secreting adenomas. SOX2 was stained extensively for ACTH-secreting adenomas.",

Rats in the HFD group did not receive EA.In HFD-induced IR rats, EA inhibited body weight increase and water intake, which were observed in HFD rats. EA had no effect on fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood sugar levels. Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing revealed that EA enhanced insulin sensitivity in HFD-induced IR rats. Compared with NC rats, SIRT1 and GLUT4 were downregulated in the quadriceps femoris of HFD-fed rats but were increased after eight weeks of EA stimulation.EA enhanced HFD-induced insulin resistance by activating SIRT1 and GLUT4 in the quadriceps femoris.

Hypothyroidism causes abnormalities in cells, and organs, and induces gene expression changes. The use of salt supplements and vitamins considerably helps to treat hypothyroidism.To evaluate the effect of a food supplement containing iron, iodine, and folic acid on thyroid hormones changes as well as the quality and quantity of hypothyroid female rat's offspring.In the current experimental study, 40 female rats were divided into six experimental and two control groups. The study was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the role of a combinatory supplement along with levothyroxine to treat hypothyroidism by assessing T3, T4, and TSH hormones was investigated. In the second phase, the dose-depended effects of a combinatory supplement were investigated. Additionally, in the third phase, the quality and quantity of the next generation were measured in the hypothyroid female rats receiving the salt supplement.The plasma level of T3, T4 and TSH in hypothyroid rats receiving nutrient supplements indicated that the use of combinatory supplements along with levothyroxine could have desirable effects on the treatment of hypothyroidism to such an extent that the level of T3 and T4 hormones in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P≤0.01). The second phase demonstrated that the desired effects of combinatory supplements on the serum levels of T3, T4, and TSH hormones were dose-dependent so that by increasing the dosage of supplementation, a significant decrease in the TSH level was observed (P <0.05), while T3 and T4 levels increased (P <0.01).The results of the third phase demonstrated that salt supplements could be effective in reducing the number of dead or preterm pups, and the use of mineral salts along with levothyroxine could promote a healthy birth.Salt supplements have considerable effects on the health status of the offspring of hypothyroid rats, resulting in the birth of more healthy pups and reducing the rate of abortion or preterm births.",

    "abstract": "Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is a mainstay adjuvant treatment for thyroid cancer. Administration of RAI therapy after total or near-total thyroidectomy has shown a survival advantage in numerous properly selected patients. However, the role of RAI therapy after reoperation for persistent or recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) is unclear. One reason may be the possible downregulation of the I- transport system after primary surgery. RAI is transported by the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), PENDRIN, anoctamin 1 (ANO1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and emits β particles that destroy follicular cells. The identification of pathways of iodide (I-) transport has allowed use of the transport system to render tumours susceptible to RAI treatment via gene therapy. This review focuses on the effect of RAI therapy in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers and offers potential novel targets that enable improved radioiodine uptake and thus an improved prognosis of thyroid cancer.",

Empty sella (ES) is an anatomical condition of sella turcica that is partially or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid mainly due to intrasellar herniation of subarachnoid space. Here, we describe a patient who presented with clinical and biochemical features of acromegaly and who had an ES on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).A 73-year-old male patient was consulted in our clinic because of the acromegalic phenotype while planning for colorectal adenocarcinoma surgery. The patient noticed gradual enlarging of his hands, feet and nose for 30 years, but never consulted to any clinician for this reason. Serum GH was 20.6 ng/mL (normal <3 ng/mL) and IGF-1 was 531 ng/mL (normal, 69-200 ng/ml). An oral glucose tolerance test showed no suppression of GH values. T1-weighted MRI revealed an ES. 18F-FDG PET/CT and Ga-DOTATADE PET/CT did not show any finding consistent with ectopic GH secretion. Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) was within the normal range (<100mg/dL). He was treated with long-acting octreotide 20 mg per 28 days. At the 6th month of treatment, serum GH and IGF-1 levels were decreased to 5.45 ng/mL and 274 ng/mL, respectively.The mechanism underlying the association of acromegaly and ES remains unclear. Apoplexy on existing pituitary adenoma and then formation of necrosis can proceed to ES. Since our patient did not have a history of pituitary apoplexy and we could not find any reason for secondary ES, we considered primary ES.",

Histopathological examination revealed features of parathyroid adenoma with granulomatosis infection that supports tuberculosis. In order to confirm the pathological findings, the PCR study was performed on the pathology specimens. After obtaining a negative result, the treatment was stopped. We have reported a case of parathyroid adenoma that mimicking tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Gitelman Syndrome (GS) is a genetic tubulopathy frequently linked with insulin resistance. The possibility of developing Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in GS increases with the causes of insulin resistance. Hypokalemia is one of the most common electrolyte disorders in GS, and most diabetic drugs can cause hypokalemia. Considering this dilemma, we presented a DM treatment experience in a GS case.A 47-year-old male GS patient with a potassium-rich diet complained of weight loss and dry mouth for 2-3 months. The laboratory tests revealed a higher HbA1c level, as high as 11.8%. The remaining abnormal laboratory test results (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis) indicated a patient with GS. The patient was placed on a metformin+gliclazide-based treatment. Oral potassium and magnesium supplementation were started for the patient whose hypokalemia increased in the first control, and the potassium dose was doubled in the third control. In the first-month follow-up visit, it was observed that the blood potassium level was improved, and hyperglycemia was optimized.In brief, any treatment for DM can be selected in GS patients with DM by performing frequent electrolyte monitoring. Like our case, oral potassium supplementation was adequate for the metformin + gliclazide combination-coincidence hypokalemia.",

The risk factors associated with LN-prRLN metastasis were identified and validated through a developed nomogram model based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.A total of 615 patients (690 lesions) were enrolled for the training dataset and 207 patients (226 lesions) for the validation dataset with 54 (6.57%) patients developing LN-prRLN metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the preoperative ultrasound measurement of larger tumors (≥20 mm), higher TI-RADS category (category 5), and higher thyroglobulin level (9.86 ng/mL) in patients with PTC were predictive factors for LN-prRLN metastasis. The nomogram model was established and verified yielding a relatively good predictive performance in the training and validation dataset (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.851).The nomogram combining preoperative ultrasonography with clinical features in this study is highly predictive of LN-prRLN metastasis in patients with PTC, which may provide more personalized recommendations for clinicians in preoperative decision-making for complete dissection of LN-prRLN.",

Corticosteroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were initiated at each recurrence depending on the severity of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. The genotype analysis showed the positivity for HLA-B35:01 and B41:02 alleles. The anti-thyroglobulin antibody was detected positive after the last attack.

    "abstract": "Primary bilateral adrenal lymphoma is a very rare cause of adrenal insufficiency. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman who presented with signs and symptoms of impending adrenal crisis when referred for evaluation of large bilateral adrenal masses diagnosed on a computed tomography scan two weeks prior. Based on a high clinical suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, patient was initiated on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy prior to laboratory confirmation of adrenal insufficiency. After stabilizing the patient and excluding pheochromocytoma, we proceeded with adrenal biopsy that revealed a nongerminal center-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our patient was treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy, with good response after 3 cycles but eventually died after the fifth cycle from neurologic complications. This case highlights the notion that primary adrenal insufficiency should be considered in patients presenting with bilateral adrenal masses. Although primary adrenal lymphoma is a very rare adrenal malignancy it should be considered in patients presenting with bilateral rapidly growing adrenal tumors and primary adrenal insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Few prognostic analyses have been conducted for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients with preablative stimulated Tg >10 ng/mL. We investigated the therapeutic responses and prognosis of these patients after the initial radioiodine (RAI) therapy. We retrospectively assessed 256 patients with PTC who underwent RAI remnant ablation after total thyroidectomy, and all presTg levels were >10 ng/mL. We assessed therapeutic responses and influencing factors 6-12 months after the initial RAI therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze progression-free survival (PFS). After initial RAI therapy, excellent (ER), indeterminate (IDR), biochemically incomplete (BIR), and structurally incomplete (SIR) responses were identified in 5.1% (13/256), 22.6% (58/256), 46.9% (120/256), and 25.4% (65/256) of the patients, respectively. Among them, incomplete response (IR [BIR+SIR]), accounting for 72.3% of the responses. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that presTg (OR=1.047, 95% CI 1.027-1.066, p=0.000), sex (OR=3.356, 95% CI 1.613-6.986, p=0.001), and tumor size (OR=1.431, 95% CI 1.050-1.951, p=0.023) were independent risk factors for IR. ROC analysis identified presTg levels and tumor size cutoffs of 24.4 mg/mL and 2.3 cm, respectively, for predicting IR. The PFS was significantly shorter in the SIR group than in the ER, IDR, and BIR groups (p=0.020). At the last follow-up, the number of patients with SIR decreased significantly (65 to 44 cases). PresTg level, tumor size, and male sex were predictive of IR, and patients with initial SIR showed the poorest prognosis. Individualized interventions can improve the prognosis of patients with an initial SIR.",

    "abstract": "Understanding factors delaying recovery in thyrotoxicosis patients is crucial for optimizing treatment plan. This study aimed to identify predictive factors for the delayed thyroid function recovery in thyrotoxicosis patients. The study is a retrospective review of medical records of adult thyrotoxicosis patients diagnosed at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, from January 2014 to December 2021. The duration of follow-up for the main outcome was at least 18 months. Patients newly diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis who were age > 18 years old, had a TSH level <0.1 μIU/mL, received CBZ or PTU treatment, and demonstrated a subsequent TSH increase to above 0.4 μIU/mL, were included. The study included 443 patients. The average time to achieve normalized TSH levels was 6.9 months. Key factors associated with delayed TSH normalization included higher body mass index (BMI) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.12], elevated serum free T4 levels (OR = 1.97; CI, 1.44-2.69), and treatment with propylthiouracil (OR = 2.66; CI, 1.33-5.32). In contrast, factors such as sex, age, season of diagnosis, and comorbidities did not significantly impact the rate of TSH normalization. The study highlights the importance of considering individual patient characteristics, such as BMI and initial free T4 levels, in thyrotoxicosis management. The findings suggest a potential preference for carbimazole over PTU in achieving faster TSH normalization. This research contributes to the understanding of thyrotoxicosis recovery and supports the need for personalized treatment approaches in clinical practice.",

We describe the outcomes of BP (pamidronate) treatment in our patients. Data regarding clinical, laboratory, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, and bone mineral density measurements (BMD) were recorded before and one year after treatment (reevaluation). The severity of the clinical picture was assessed using the criteria of the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE). There were four female patients (patient 1, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; patient 2, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; patients 3 and 4, systemic lupus erythematosus) .All of them had been treated with high-dose prednisolone. Clinical picture of all patients were consistent with grade 3 according to CTCAE(: severe symptoms, limiting self-care ). ON lesions were multifocal in the lower limbs in all of them and none of them had any fractures. All of them had been treated with high-dose glucocorticoid. Patients were treated with pamidronate (1 mg/kg/day, with maximum dose of 60 mg/day, for two days, quarterly). At the time of re-evaluation(one year after treatment), the lesions were stable on MRI, and their clinical condition was consistent with grade 1 according to CTCAE(asymptomatic). No side effects related to the use of bisphosphonates were observed except for increased BMD (SD score of 2.9) in one of the patients. Pamidronate may be an effective treatment for the improvement of functional impairment and pain among patients with severe osteonecrosis (ON) lesions.",

    "abstract": "Acute or chronic burn injuries require hormonal responses that significantly influence patient prognosis. Elevated cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon levels, lead to important metabolic changes, such as hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, protein catabolism, free fatty acids oxidation, and secondary metabolic acidosis. These alterations impair immune function and wound healing and trigger a systemic inflammatory response. A multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to correctly manage the aforementioned endocrine and metabolic changes. During the acute phase, glucose monitoring, corticosteroid administration for transient or iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency and electrolyte balance maintenance are critical. Chronic phase requires hormonal replacement, nutritional optimization, and anabolic agents administration to counteract catabolic states. Despite continuous advances in burn care, understanding the complex interplay between hormonal changes and immune dysfunction remains challenging. Managing burn-associated endocrine responses could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies, including personalised and stage- adapted treatment.",

But in the absence of the typical acral phenotype it is difficult to know when CTS will appear as the first symptom. Here, we present a 27-year-old female patient with a history of numbness that first appeared in her right hand and 2 weeks later in her left hand. While the etiology of acute CTS was being investigated on cervical MRI, the hormonal evaluation of the incidentally detected mass in the sella turcica revealed that it was a clinically silent somatotroph adenoma. Considering the patient's age, desire to have children, lack of typical acral features, the fact that these adenomas may cause phenotypic changes over time, their aggressive course and more recurrences, the decision for transsphenoidal surgery was made. The patient, who has been followed for 14 years, has two healthy children and does not have any complaints, acral phenotype or GH hormone excess. Awareness that acute unilateral/bilateral CTS without any risk factors may be the first sign of clinically silent somatotrophinoma may improve the prognosis of acromegaly by preventing diagnostic delay.",

Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE were searched for studies about AEDs and bone health. The PRISMA statement was used. Chronic use of AEDs is associated with alterations in bone metabolism, low bone mineral density values, and increased risk of fractures. These effects appear to be more associated to the use of enzyme-inducing AEDs. Supplements with vitamin D and bone active treatments may have benefits in terms of bone mineral density gain and of mortality risk. More studies are required to determine the impact of non-enzyme-inducing AEDs on bone health and to gather useful information about the management of osteoporosis therapy in epileptic patients. Chronic AED use has a significant impact on bone health; it is therefore necessary to evaluate in such individuals the claim to vitamin D and calcium supplements and bone active treatments.",

Herein, we present a rare case of catastrophic Cushing 's syndrome due ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma in a 59-year-old woman, which was characterized by severe hypercortisolism, markedly elevated ACTH levels and rapidly progressed and persisting metabolic derangements, and complete resolution of symptoms and signs after adrenalectomy, despite no biochemical evidence of pheochromocytoma and the coexisting adrenal cortical adenoma. The timely recognition of findings sufficient to raise the suspicion of an ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma is crucial to plan surgical resection of the adrenal mass which is the only curative option enabling quick recovery with complete amelioration of symptoms and signs and restoration of organ functions. In this regard, our case highlights the likelihood of severe hypercortisolism even in the absence of typical Cushingoid features, and the consideration of suspected diagnosis of ACTH-releasing pheochromocytoma even in the absence of biochemical evidence on catecholamine hypersecretion when workup is suggestive of an ectopic source along with an adrenal mass on imaging.",

The rise of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy as the favored surgical approach emphasizes the significance of localization studies. This study aims to explore clinical and laboratory profiles of PHP patients and evaluate the efficacy of diverse localization methods in a substantial patient cohort. We analyzed clinical features, biochemical parameters, and imaging outcomes for localization, as well as postoperative histopathological findings in 327 diagnosed PHP patients who underwent surgery. Initial localization methods, which included ultrasonography (US), US-guided Parathormone (PTH) washout analysis, and 99mTechnetium-Sestamibi/123Iodine Scintigraphy (MIBI-SPECT/CT), were applied to all patients. Advanced techniques like Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4D-CT) and 18F-Fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FCH PET/CT) were used for cases where initial methods failed and/or for secondary intervention. Minimally invasive surgery accounted for 74% (n=241) of cases. Histopathological analysis revealed single adenoma in 94.5% (n=309) patients, hyperplasia in 5.2% (n=17), and cancer in 0.3% (n=1). Adenoma volume showed a significant positive correlation with serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (p<0.001). 82 and 26 cases required 4D-CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT respectively, for localization. Positive predictive values (PPV) for imaging modalities were: US (84.56%), US-guided PTH-washout analysis (87.30%), MIBI-SPECT/CT (92.1%), 4D-CT (81.94%), and 18F-FCH PET/CT (95.83%). Serum calcium and PTH levels estimate adenoma size. Initial localization studies (i.e.US, PTH washout and, MIBI-SPECT/CT) effectively localized most adenomas. 4D-CT showed notable efficacy, and 18F-FCH PET/CT had the highest PPV for adenoma localization when the initial studies failed.",

Patients with CKD complicated by refractory secondary HPT were included as the research subjects. Among them, 42 patients who received DP were assigned as the study group, while another 42 patients who underwent conventional total parathyroidectomy were assigned as the control group. The average operative time and postoperative average length of hospital stay of the study group were lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). The study group showed lower levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to the control group 1 day postoperatively, 7 days postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively, and 12 months postoperatively (P<0.05). The study group exhibited lower serum calcium levels than the control group 1 day postoperatively, 7 days postoperatively, 1 month postoperatively, and 6 months postoperatively (P<0.05). Additionally, the study group demonstrated lower serum phosphorus levels compared to the control group 1 day postoperatively, 7 days postoperatively, and 6 months postoperatively (P<0.05). The application of DP in patients with CKD complicated by refractory secondary HPT holds definite clinical value.",

    "abstract": "ARMC5 mutations are responsible for the development of primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH). In this study, we aimed to report a novel ARMC5 germline variant in a PBMAH patient family. CT examination and dexamethasone suppression test (DST) were used in the diagnosis of PBMAH. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the familial heredity. For the novel variant, protein predictive analysis was performed to study the changes of secondary and tertiary structures and hydrophobicity. A 45 years old male (proband, III-1) was diagnosed as PBMAH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, finding one mutation: c.719_ 724dup, p Arg240_ Pro241dup. Sanger sequencing showed the II-2, III-1, IV-1 with heterozygous gene, confirming the familial heredity. For protein predictive analysis, the predicted secondary structure of variants has one alpha-helix structure incomplete compared with normal ARMC5. The tertiary structure could draw the same conclusion, that hydrophobicity decreases after mutation. We reported a new-found ARMC5 germline variant in PBMAH using WES and protein predictive analysis. With the help of WES, early diagnosis of PBMAH could help variant carriers to prevent the occurrence of cancer by lifetime follow-up.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the effect of inflammation on the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has attracted considerable attention. However, the effect of the dietary inflammatory load remains unclear. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary inflammatory index (DII) score and serum chemerin concentration, biochemical hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. This study, which is a case-control study, was conducted on 44 women with PCOS and 44 healthy women who applied to Ankara Training and Research Hospital. Routine blood biochemical values were obtained from the hospital system and blood samples were taken for serum chemerin analysis. The questionnaire investigated the general information, physical activity status, and anthropometric measurements. The DII was calculated from three-day dietary records. The mean DII score of the in the PCOS and control groups is 3.8 ± 1.7 and 3.8 ± 1.4, respectively (p> 0.05). Serum chemerin concentration (3.6 ± 1.4 ng / mL) of the women in the PCOS group with a high DII score was significantly higher than the women in the control group (2.6 ± 1.7 ng / mL) (p <0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between DII score and insulin resistance, total and free testosterone, DHEA-S, LH, FSH, LH/FSH ratio and estradiol values (p>0.05). The highest serum chemerin concentrations was found in the PCOS group with the highest DII. Results suggest that an inflammatory diet may be associated with serum chemerin concentration in PCOS.",

    "abstract": "Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) has been widely shown to impact neurological disorders. Recently, growing evidence suggests that CUMS may also contribute to the development of metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to investigate blood glucose levels and histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in the endocrine pancreas in an experimental rat model of CUMS, as well as the potential protective effects of vortioxetine (VOR) treatment. A total of 28 rats were divided into four groups. The CUMS group was exposed to random stressors once daily for six weeks. Rats in the VOR and CUMS+VOR groups received VOR treatment. The VOR and control groups were housed separately, without exposure to CUMS. At the end of the experiment, blood and pancreatic tissue samples were collected from all rats. Blood glucose levels were elevated in the CUMS group compared to the other groups. Histopathological analysis revealed a reduction in insulin, amylin, and insulin receptor expression, along with a slight increase in glucagon expression and a small number of necrotic cells in the CUMS group. VOR treatment improved all these parameters. Our findings suggested that CUMS may contribute to endocrine pancreatic damage resembling diabetes mellitus, while VOR treatment may mitigate this effect.",

This approach was delivered to 100 type 2 diabetes patients based on their cognitive-social factors and metabolic variables. A randomized controlled trial study design was employed. Diabetes education videos were designed and were streamed to the smartphones of the patients. Data were collected from the control (n=50) and experimental (n=50) groups in the first interview, and metabolic control data were recorded. The second interview was held three months after the education process was completed. During this meeting, the survey instrument and the Turkish version of the Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire was re-administered to both groups, and metabolic control data were recorded. Following the distance video education, there was a significant decrease in the FPG (1.2 mmol/L) HbA1c (-1.04%), LDL (-0.4 mmol/L) and BMI (-0.7 kg/m2) values of the experimental group, and their cognitive-social factors were found to improve in terms of perceiving diabetes.

It is associated with major comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and depression. The obesity pathogenesis increasingly became clearer. It is thought to be the result of a neuroendocrine dysregulation of energy intake and energy expenditure. One of the most studied cytokines involved in obesity, leptin is secreted from adipose tissue, proportional to fat mass. It inhibits neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related peptide neurons and activates pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/ cocaine amphetamine-related transcript neurons in the hypothalamus, resulting in an anorectic effect.",

The most common presentation of thyroid cancer is a newly discovered thyroid nodule or increase in size of a preexisting nodule. The long-term outcome of patients treated effectively for differentiated thyroid carcinoma is usually favorable. Nine per cent of patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer die of their disease. All patients with thyroid cancer should be seen within a multidisciplinary team (MDT) framework. Supra-physiological doses of levothyroxine are used to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer recurrence. The surgeon should have training and expertise in the management of thyroid cancer and be a core member of the MDT. Tumor recurrence or progression can be diagnosed earlier by detecting a raised serum thyroglobulin (Tg) after TSH stimulation (sTg) than by measurement of Tg on suppressive levothyroxine therapy.",

In some patients, this elevates high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a cardiovascular risk biomarker.We wanted to determine if there is any correlation between repeated hypothyroidism episodes, elevated hsCRP and an increased cardiovascular risk as stated through myocardial perfusion.Between July 2014-January 2015, we analyzed serological levels of hsCRP for identifying our patients' cardiovascular risk; we performed a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy to observe the alterations.We included 27 patients (n=27), mean age of 52±10: CI (95%),14 female, all disease- free after thyroidectomy, radioiodine ablation and chronic thyroid hormone treatment. We assigned the cardiovascular risk category for each patient according to hsCRP levels; all patients underwent a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in order to determine the cardiac perfusion index (CPI).hsCRP has been higher in > 65 years old male patients with more than 5 thyroid hormone withholdings. hsCRP is significantly associated with CPI (p=0.001). Spearman's rank correlation indicates a strongly positive linear correlation between these two parameters (r=0.745).Repeated thyroid hormonal withdrawals in patients with DTC during the long-term follow-up elevated hsCRP at cardiovascular risk levels, having an impact on myocardial perfusion.",

Recently, results from a randomized controlled trial from the SPRINT Research Group have shown that among non-diabetic people with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mmHg resulted in lower incidence of major cardiovascular events and deaths from any cause. In limited area of the human brain, insulin acts in modulation of body weight by food intake and modification of metabolism: hypothalamus (the central regulator of whole- body energy homeostasis and of food intake), prefrontal cortex (inhibitory control of eating), hippocampus (memory) and the fusiform gyrus (recognition of food, positive emotions, reward). Pregnancy, obesity, increasing age and also with some common genetic variants in the genes of IRS1, FTO, MC4R, CNR2, APOE are linked with insulin resistance in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Memory deficits, anxiety and depression are often associated with diabetes, worsening diabetic patients' prognosis. Caffeine, a worldwide used psychoactive substance, is a candidate for improving these conditions.The aim of this study was to assess the behaviour in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats and to evaluate the behavioural effects of caffeine administration.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg BW streptozotocin (n=10), while control rats received the vehicle (n=9). After six weeks, behavioural tests for anxiety, memory and depression were performed: elevated plus maze (EPM) test, novel object recognition (NOR) test and forced swimming test (FST), respectively. The tests were repeated after further 2 weeks of continuous caffeine administration (20 mg/kg BW/day in drinking water).Diabetic rats manifested a high anxiety level, showed by a reduced exploratory activity compared to control rats (p<0.05) and long-term memory impairment, spending more time near the old object in NOR test. Caffeine administered for 2 weeks did not modify glycemic values in either group, and attenuated the behavioural changes observed in the EPM test. Also, in NOR test for long-term memory, caffeine administration induced an increased time spent with the novel object than with the old one in both groups.Our data suggest that chronic caffeine administration has an anxiolytic effect in diabetic rats and improves long-term memory in both diabetic and control rats.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic thymus could be located intrathyroidal, therefore fine ultrasound details are useful for this differentiation.To investigate differences in stiffness and vascularity properties among thyroid nodules and intrathyroidal ectopic thymus (IET) by obtaining quantitative data in children.Twenty-seven thyroid nodules and 20 IET in children were evaluated in terms of vascularity index (VI) via superb microvascular imaging (SMI) and stiffness by shear wave elastography (SWE). Differences in the volume, VI, and SWE parameters of the lesions were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Association of the age, lesion volume, SWE, and VI parameters was investigated by using Spearman's correlation analysis. The optimal cut-off values for stiffness and vascularity in the differentiation of nodules from IET were calculated with ROC analysis.The median (range) age of the participants with thyroid nodules and IET were 15.6 (10-18) years and 8.8 (3-14) years, respectively. The medians (range) VI of the IET and thyroid nodules were 4.7 (0.2-16) % and 23.8 (7.5-40)%, respectively. The median SWE values were 7.6 (4.4-9.5) kPa and 15.58 (8.5-23.4) kPa for IET and nodules, respectively. There have been highly significant differences among medians of volume, SWE, and VI values of the lesions. Significant positive correlations were found between VI and SWE parameters (p=0.001, r=0.64), and volume with VI (p=0.018, r=0.34) and SWE (p:0.001, r= 0.5). The diagnostic accuracies were 93%, 91% with the cut-off values as 9.2 kPa, 13% for the SWE and SMI, respectively. IETs were found to be less vascular and less stiff than thyroid nodules.IETs could be easily and confidently differentiated from nodules using SWE and SMI quantifications. This discrimination prompts the reduction of unnecessary interventional procedures.",

Only 12 cases have been reported so far.We aimed to evaluate the effects of the GnRH analog (GnRHa) on growth and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in TS and RPPP.The clinical and laboratory data was recorded at baseline and after treatment.An 8.1-year old girl with a karyotype of 45, X/46, XX presented with breast development at Tanner stage-2. Breast development advanced to Tanner stage-3 at the age of 8.7 years. Growth velocity (GV) was 8 cm/year. Bone age was 11 years with a predicted adult height of 152 cm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.69mIU/mL and estradiol was 33pg/mL, confirming the central puberty. AMH level was 6.33ng/mL. The sizes of ovaries and uterus were compatible with the pubertal stage, with an endometrial thickness of 5 mm. GnRHa was started for RPPP.After three months, GV declined to 0 cm/3 months and AMH level to 50% of the baseline. Growth hormone (GH) treatment was started for insufficient growth. GV improved with GH treatment, as well as a far more decreased AMH level.After three months, GV declined to 0 cm/3 months and AMH level to 50% of the baseline. Growth hormone (GH) treatment was started for insufficient growth. GV improved with GH treatment, as well as a far more decreased AMH level.GV usually declines before puberty in patients with TS, even if the mid-parental height is tall. RPPP should be considered if GV is increased. Excessive suppression of growth may be prevented with GH treatment. GnRHa treatment also plays a role in reducing AMH levels in patients with TS.",

If there is an artificial application of the ovulation induction injection, the success of the treatment is endangered and in some cases the cycle is discontinued, if the patient failed to administer the drug correctly. An alternative to cycle cancellation might be the maturation of the oocytes in vitro.on a 31-year-old patient in whom we performed an oocyte retrieval procedure 24 hours after triggering ovulation followed by in vitro maturation of the immature oocytes over a period of more than 12 h.

Respiratory gases and blood glucose samples were recorded every hour in hypoxia chamber (8 points in total), and blood lactate samples were collected at baseline, at 4 and 7 h to exposure.In females, basal energy expenditure was significantly higher at 2h, 4h, 6h and 7h compared with NOR group. Also, BEE was lower in females compared with men from 2h of hypoxia exposure. In the HYP group the blood lactate concentration increased significantly at 4h and 7 h relative to NOR group (P < 0.05) in males.An exposure to moderate normobaric hypoxia did not alter metabolic response, but induced a different response on substrate oxidation in adults men and women.",

    "abstract": "The topic of fertility preservation has been gaining increasing importance since the beginning of this century. The reasons for this development are the advances in oncological therapy over the past few decades, with cure rates of approximately over 90%, and the fact that starting families is increasingly postponed in later periods of life in industrialized countries. Since March 2020 the whole medical and non-medical world experiences a pandemic due to Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) which has never been seen before. This created a plenty of challenges for both, the patients and healthcare providers. This review article presents the fertility-protective methods currently available for women and men suffering from cancer with their clinical approach, value, advantages and disadvantages. Besides, it focuses on the changes and special considerations which have to be taken into account during pandemic times including preventive measures as well as the patient's access to the fertility preserving options. In conclusion every premenopausal woman and every man with incomplete family planning suffering from cancer should be counselled about the existing fertility preserving techniques before commencing cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although, many studies have been made on the clinical course of autoimmune thyroiditis, this study focused on women and the factors effecting the natural course such as Selenium.The study aimed to determine Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) clinical course in adults and the factors that could affect it.The study was in a retrospective manner between 2010-2018.101 patients with HT were followed for 60.7±32.7 months. Biochemical and ultrasonographic data were collected. We investigated whether the age at diagnosis, family history, smoking habits, levothyroxine replacement therapy, and serum selenium (Se) levels influenced the disease course.No relationship was observed between age and thyroid functions, thyroid volumes (TV), and autoantibody (Ab) levels at diagnosis. Ab levels were irrelevant with TV, echogenicity, and nodularity at diagnosis. However, initial TSH levels were significantly associated with anti-TPO levels (p=0.028, r=0.218). In the untreated group, thyroid functions seemed to be stable. TV decreased significantly in both treated and untreated patients (p<0.001). The decrease in TV was significantly higher in the treatment group (p=0.002). In euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid patients, levothyroxine therapy did not affect the decrease in TV. Ab levels remained stable in untreated patients, but anti-TPO levels significantly decreased in treated patients (p<0.001). Smoking seemed to increase only anti-Tg levels (p=0.009). Family history was not associated with any of the studied parameters. Serum Se level was negatively correlated only with thyroid echostructure and only in treated patients. TV showed a \"Gaussian distribution\" in all patients at the diagnosis and at the end, independent of levothyroxine treatment.Most euthyroid patients remained euthyroid during five years of follow-up. The decrease in TV was significantly prominent with LT4 treatment. Importantly, TV followed a normal distribution instead of the bimodal distribution that is classically described.",

An increase of platelet indices over time in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) could be a predictor of mortality.The objective of this study was to assess differences in platelet indices in patients with and without T2DM undergoing PCI, prior and more than one month after the procedure.In this retrospective observational study, patients undergoing PCI were included. Data were extracted from PCI Registry of the Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases and Transplantation of Tirgu Mures, Romania.Of the 718 patients included in the study, 222 (30.9%) had T2DM; 61% of patient underwent PCI for SCAD, the rest for NSTE-ACS or STEMI. Prior to PCI, MPV, PDW and P-LCR were not higher in T2DM patients irrespective of the indication for PCI. At a follow-up time of 69 (46-98) days, platelet indices were not different between TD2M+ and T2DM-, except from MPV (11.0 vs. 10.6, p=0.02) which were higher in TD2M patients with SCAD. Intraindividual variability of platelet indices was not different in diabetics, but MPV, PDW and platelet count decreased over time (3.5% and 8.4% respectively) in diabetics with STEMI (p=0.02).Platelet indices were not higher in patients with T2DM undergoing PCI, but we observed an important variation in platelet indices in diabetics after STEMI related PCI.",

The expression of this protein has been shown to be increased in thyroid tumours correlated with aggressive behavior from well differentiated to anaplastic.In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between immunohistochemically survivin expression and tumour-associated prognostic factors in papillary thyroid carcinomas.In patients with thyroidectomy, we compared the clinicopathological findings and immunohistochemical positivity for survivin.In 109 patients, sex, age, tumour size, histological tumour variant, tumour focality, tumour border pattern, tumour peripheral/intratumoural lymphocytic and stromal response, intraglandular spread, extrathyroideal spread, lymph node metastases, lymphocytic tiroiditis and relationships of these findings with survivin positivity were investigated.When we indicated the tumour size and compared it with survivin expression, tumour size correlates with, survivin expression (p = 0.016). Survivin expression was correlated statistically significant with lymphovascular invasion, without stromal response and with intraglandular extension respectively (p<0.001, p = 0.043, p<0.001). No significant correlation was found between other clinicopathological parameters and survival.Few studies have investigated the relationship of survivin expression with prognosis in thyroid papillary carcinomas and showed that survivin was a poor prognostic marker. If its expression is detected in preoperative cytology smears, it may affects the surgical treatment strategy. When it is detected in the tissue, postoperative radioactive iodine treatment plan may be modified and the need for more aggressive follow-up may be considered.",

These correlations are relevant, as they consume a large number of resources. Their better understanding can increase the effectiveness of incident reduction techniques and could provide better management and cost reduction of care.We compared the relationships between the glycemic variability (for a period of 10 days prior to completing the depression questionnaire) and the results of two standardized questionnaires: Hamilton anxiety scale - HRSA (group 1: 500 patients), Rosenberg self-esteem test (group 2: 490 patients) and Beck depression inventory (both groups).A statistically significant correlation was identified between the glycemic oscillation and depression as well as both anxiety and low self-esteem. The present data justify further research. Our results could be developed into a preliminary intervention protocol, using the daily glycemic values measurements, collected by patients. In conclusion, psychometric tests could be an important instrument in the management of diabetic patients.",

To investigate the relationship between BNP fragment (8-29) plasmatic level, ACE I/D polymorphism and BMI in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Methods. We studied 50 patients with HF, NYHA III and IV, mean age 64.96±13.24 years, 21 patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 vs 29 patients with BMI<30 kg/m 2 . BMI, ACE polymorphism, the plasmatic levels of BNP fragment (8-29) were determined. Results. Mean plasmatic BNP fragment (8-29) level was 1891.02±1008.06 pg/mL, mean BMI value 29.09±7.59 kg/m², with a negative correlation between the two parameters (r=0.46), stronger in women (r=-0.79 vs. r=0.32 in men). Significant greater value of BNP fragment (8-29) was registered in nonobese patients (2130.77±866.58 pg/mL vs. 1547.765±1135.744pg/mL, p<0.05). The distribution of ACE mutation was: DD allele 36%, II allele 24%, and ID allele 40%. In all three groups, the patients with BMI ≥ 30kg/m 2 presented lower values of BNP fragment (8-29) levels. Conclusion. In HF patients, there was an inverse correlation between BNP value and BMI, obese patients having lower BNP fragment (8-29) values, no matter the ACE polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disease, existing in both genders and in all age groups. Postmenopausal women are at particular risk of developing the disease and estrogen decline after menopause is suggested to affect the progress. Although PHPT is mild in its presentation with subtle or no subjective symptoms, it is associated with an increased risk of associated morbidity and also mortality i.e cardiovascular complications, psychiatric instability, concomitant metabolic abnormalities, obesity and decrease in bone mineral density. The current cure is surgical removal of the diseased gland/s, but other medical alternatives have been investigated. The disease is thoroughly explored in postmenopausal women but less is known about other populations groups. Since progression of the disease generally is slow, the underlying disturbance of the calcium homeostasis can be suspected to have been established a long time prior to diagnose with potential to affect associated morbidity. The general aim of this thesis is to clarify the expression of PHPT in premenopausal women and in elderly men and to explore how frequent the disease in these populations occurs. The women and men were investigated through population-based studies. Baseline data and prevalence of PHPT in premenopausal women age 40-50 years were studied (Paper I), the prevalence was 5.1% in this population and was associated with decreased bone mineral density and associated obesity. In a three years follow up of the female cohort, the effects of menopausal transition and associated morbidity was investigated (Paper II). The prevalence and expression of PHPT in men between 69 and 81 years and impact on bone mineral density, physical performance, fall and fracture prevalence was explored through data from Mr Os Sweden (Papers III and IV). In this population prevalence of PHPT was 0.73% and associated with lower bone mineral density and inferior physical performance.",

    "abstract": "Morris Syndrome is a pathological condition which needs a special approach regarding both diagnosis and treatment because of its rarity. While the diagnosis is based on karyotype test, the treatment should follow the idea of harmless and cosmetic benefits as well as complete gonads removal. This paper is presenting the usefulness and advantages of minimally invasive surgery as a feasible treatment for such a disease. A retrospective study was performed for two patients with Morris Syndrome, admitted to the “CI Parhon” National Institute of Endocrinology, Bucharest, Romania, followed-up for 4 - 16 years, and operated to the Department of Surgery, Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, Romania. Patients with primary amenorrhea have been clinically observed and three patients with 46, XY karyotype have been identified as Morris Syndrome cases needing surgical removal of the intraperitoneal gonads because of the risk of malignant transformation. A minimally invasive surgical technique has been chosen for proper treatment: the anterior transperitoneal laparoscopic approach. The surgery was adapted to every case, in according with preoperative imagistic diagnosis of the intraperitoneal testes (localization, dimensions, adjacent organs involvement, surgical access). No postoperative complications were noticed and specimens' pathology confirmed the final diagnosis. Cosmetic benefits were achieved for every young patient as well as rapid postoperative recovery (discharge after 48 hours). The authors concluded that Morris Syndrome patients could benefit from the laparoscopic surgery which is a feasible, safe and proper treatment for such cases.",

We aimed to report its association with a hot thyroid nodule and gigantism. Case report. A man aged 37, with a history of pigmented skin lesions and lameness was referred for acromegaly. He was giant (height = 1.94 m/ target stature = 1.68 m), and had “cafe au lait” spots. Biological analyses argued for pituitary mixed secretion (random growth hormone = 22 ng/ mL, N<5; prolactin = 27 ng/mL, N<10). Brain CT scan showed a pituitary process of 11x10 mm. Thyroid radioiodine scan revealed a hot nodule. Bone x-ray demonstrated large osteolytic lesions in the right femur and pelvis. He was operated on for endocrine tumours. The thyroid nodule was benign and immunohistochemistry pituitary was positive for GH, prolactin and α subunit. Conclusion. Somatolactotrop adenoma causing gigantism associated with MAS is exceptional. It should be known, diagnosed, and treated early to avoid bone deformations and malignant transformation of osseous",

    "abstract": "Background: Oncogenic osteomalacia (OOM) is a rare syndrome caused by a tumor that produces a phosphaturic factor: fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). These tumors can be extremely difficult to localize because they are small, slow growing and cause no local Symptoms. Patient and methods: Venous sampling for detection of a gradient of FGF23 has been used to limit the area of further imaging. We describe a case of OOM in a 73-year old woman, with two years of spontaneous fractures, severe musculoskeletal pain and phosphate wasting. Results: Her scrum FGF23 level was increased and whole-body intravenous sampling (11 sites) revealed a FGF23 gradient from the right leg. The second sampling indicated that the source of FGF23 was below the knee, but imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and octreotide scintigraphy, were not conclusive. A third sampling demonstrated increasing FGF23 the more distal one came in the lower leg. Imaging of the forefoot finally identified a 10 mm tumor that was removed. Histopathological examination showed a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor of mixed connective tissue type. The phosphate level and symptoms improved in days after surgery. Conclusion: Repeated determinations of a venous gradient of FGF23 may be used to localize tumors of OOM.",

    "abstract": "Vasopressin increases the serum level of IGF, binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) in humans through V2A receptor (1), a fact related with the adequate interpretation of the high IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) level, as predictor marker of gravity in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICU). Both vasopressin and IGFBP-1 are good prognostic markers for survival in highly stressful conditions such as the acute myocardial infarction (2,3). Arginin Vasopressin (AVP) is the first peptide hormone synthesized (4), and for a longtime has been used only for its antidiuretic properties, maximally amplified by biochemists in its analogues deamino-D-arginin vasopressin (DDAVP) (5). However AVP is not the single antidiuretic peptide hormone. Its phylogenetic ancestor arginine vasotocin (AVT) is the main antidiuretic hormone of all vertebrates, excepting mammals, and its relative oxytocin – also shows antidiuretic activities (revealed by water intoxication in pregnant women, excessively infused with oxytocin). By reverse, in the disease with vasopressin deficiency central diabetes insipidus, although the levels of serum vasopressin are low, there is an increased antidiuretic activity of the cerebrospinal fluid in adult patients (6). There are some difficulties in identifying nonapeptides and their origins (7), but there are data about sources of antidiuretic hormone, outside the wellknown hypothalamic nuclei, for example, in pancreas (8), in the adrenal gland, in human pineal fetal cells (9), in pineal gland of rats with hereditary central diabetes insipidus (10). A network of vasopressinergic fibers is spread within the brain, independent of supraoptico-hypophyseal tract. The relation of vasopressin with melatonin (11), was proved, as well as the relation with the brain visual evoked potentials (12). Three types of receptors produce vasopressin effects: V1A, in smooth muscles vessels and brain, V1B in pituitary and brain structures and V2 in kidney. The V2 receptors mediates the antidiuretic effect, i.e. activates the free water transport in Editorial",

    "abstract": "Craniopharyngioma is part of a spectrum of suprasellar cystic neoplasms, with two distinct clinicopathological entities: most are adamantinomatous tumors occurring more often in children and young adults, and radiographically are calcified, while papillary form develops more often in adults, lacks calcification, and have a better outcome. In this report we describe clinical, CT and MRI features, together with histopathological findings of an early recurrent papillary craniopharyngioma. Reviewing the CT and MRI findings and microscopic specimens of both the initial and the recurred craniopharyngioma, we identified the rapid relapse of the solid tumoral component and correlate it with low-grade basal cell dysplasia of the epithelial component that evolves from small patchy foci to more extensive areas in length and width. While low-grade basal cell dysplasia is not clearly malignant, once the pathologist sees these cellular changes in a papillary cranyopharyngioma, he must note them in his report as basal cell dysplasia could be the cause of an early tumoral recurrence. Although low-grade basal cell dysplasia in squamo-papillary craniopharyngioma is uncommon, when such a diagnosis is established, the radiologist must pay attention to MRI characteristic findings of the solid part (maximum diameters, enhancing aspects, shape, and location) and compare them with those from the previous data.",

The study was performed on 74 cases with postmenopausal osteoporosis, divided into two groups, according to the duration of estrogenic deprivation, compared with a control group (n= 20, postmenopausal women without osteoporosis). The serum levels of the discussed markers were measured by ELISA technique. BMD was measured using the DXA technique with the assessment of T score. Results. In the group I: BGP were 20.12±0.87ng/mL (p<0.03), those of BAP 13.76±0.6μg/mL (p<0.001) and sT spine were -3.63±0.65DS (p<0.001). In the group II: BGP were 15.12±1.55ng/mL (p<0.05), those of BAP 11.88±0.38μg/mL (p<0.001) and sT spine were -3.78±0.36DS (p<0.001). The control group presented: BGP of 16.22±1.62ng/mL, those of BAP of 8.68±0.44μg/mL and sT spine of -1.78±0.11DS. The serum levels of BGP in postmenopausal osteoporosis cases were increased in group I (suggesting an osteoblastic activation) and decreased in group II (probably secondary to the stimulation of osteoblastic apoptosis). The serum levels of BAP are significantly increased in postmenopausal osteoporosis versus control group, attesting osteoblastic activation. Conclusion. Bone resorption begins gradually to outrun a new bone formation rhythm associated with low BMD.",

We performed a cross-sectional study in type 2 diabetes subjects treated with biguanides in monotherapy, consecutively attending a standard diabetes outpatient clinic from a middle size town in Romania, during 2008-2009. We used the latest available visit at the Clinic for data regarding demographics, anthropometrics, biochemistry, micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Results. We investigated 814 subjects, under biguanides treatment, 463 (56.9%) females, mean age 62.6±10.5 years, age at diabetes onset 60±10.4 years, and a disease duration at study inclusion 2.6±3.9 years. Only 5.2% of females and 17.7% (p<0.01) of males had a waist circumference <80/<94 cm. A fasting plasma glucose <7.21 mmol/l was found in 40.4% of cases. The therapeutic target for blood pressure was achieved in 14.7% of cases for systolic blood pressure (<130 mmHg) and 29.6% for diastolic blood pressure (<80 mmHg). Conclusion. Individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with biguanides in monotherapy are poorly controlled, have a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome components as well as micro and macrovascular complications.",

The use of GnRH agonist showed a strong association with the number of follicles (GnRH antagonist: 11.45; GnRH agonist: 15.17), oocytes retrieved (GnRH antagonist: 10.66; GnRH agonist: 13.68) and embryos transferred (GnRH antagonist: 2.54; GnRH agonist: 2.89) (p 5 mIU/mL pregnancy (GnRH antagonist 30.8%; GnRH agonist: 21.8%) (p<0.05). Ongoing pregnancy rates between the two GnRH analogues showed no",

We aimed to study cardiothyreosis frequency and outcome in children and adolescents with hyperthyroidism diagnosed between 1980 and 2010. Material and methods. In this retrospective study we observed 160 clinical and biological hyperthyroidisms in children (≤ 16 years) and adolescents (16-20 years). Results. Among them four girls aged 3, 16, 17 and 18, without previous familial history of heart diseases, had congestive heart failure (2.5%) without rhythmic troubles. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency were resistant to digitalis and diuretics, but after anti thyroid drugs, there was an integral restitution of heart function in three cases and a persistent mitral, aortic and tricuspid regurgitation in one case arguing for heart rheumatic disease prior to hyperthyroidism. Conclusion. Heart failure secondary to thyroid hormones excess is extremely rare before age of 20. Among 160 paediatric and adolescent hyperthyroidisms seen in 30 years, four girls had life threatening congestive cardiac insufficiency (2.5%), but after euthyroidism, heart insufficiency disappeared totally in all cases which pleaded for a direct action of thyroid hormones excess on heart function.",

    "abstract": "Glucose intolerance (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] or diabetes mellitus) due to insulin resistance is a frequent complication of acromegaly due to excessive growth hormone (GH) production. Long-acting somatostatin analogs are known to reduce the GH and IGF-1 serum levels, and to inhibit at the same time the pancreas insulin release. The effect upon acromegalic patients who express IFG before therapy is controversial. We here present two male patients, 66 and 36 years old, with active acromegaly and IFG who were submitted to a treatment with long-acting somatostatin analog lanreotide. After being diagnosed with active acromegaly with high nadir serum GH levels along oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), i.e. 149 ng/mL and 43 ng/mL respectively, the patients underwent complex therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) which reduced the GH serum levels (20.7 ng/mL and 3.5 ng/mL respectively) without curing the disease. The patients developed IFG with fasting serum glucose levels of 113 mg/dL and 101 mg/dL, respectively. The treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analog lanreotide (30 mg i.m., every two weeks) decreased the GH serum levels close to normal limits (1.5 ng/mL and 1.6, ng/mL respectively). The treatment with lanreotide normalised the fasting serum glucose levels (91 mg/dL and 81 mg/dL, respectively) together with a reduction of serum insulin levels from 14.2 mU/mL to 8.7 mU/mL and from 25.4 mU/mL to 11.5 mU/mL, respectively (HOMA decreased form 3.96 to 1.97 and 6.33 to 2.3, respectively). We discuss the mechanisms by which lanreotide can improve glucose tolerance in patients with active acromegaly despite lowering the serum insulin levels through a direct effect on insulin secretion.",

She had a suppressed TSH (0.001mU/L) and normal fT4 showing subclinical hyperthyroidism. CT showed a heterogeneous density mass with calcifications, necrosis and prominent tumor buds, compressing trachea at diameters of 2.26/1.38 cm and displacing it to the right (Fig. 2). Maximum tumor diameters were 17/12/14 cm (Fig. 3). Total thyroidectomy was performed, with histological diagnosis of follicular poorlydifferentiated, highly invasive and angio-invasive carcinoma developed on a remnant of giant longstanding cervicalendothoracic goiter, staging: PT4B PNX ST4B G3 R1 V1 (Fig. 4) with a local relapse six weeks later. The high angiogenic propensity and the poor differentiation isolated cell pattern are markers of poor prognosis.",

Among patients with Down’s syndrome, prevalence of Graves disease (1-2%) may not be increased compared with the general population. About 15% of the patients with Turner’s syndrome have autoimmune hypothyroidism. Until 2006, only 15 cases of Graves disease have been reported among patients with Turner’s syndrome. We present two adult patients with chromosomial disorders (Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome) with Graves’ disease without clinical Graves ophthalmopathy. Clinical picture of thyrotoxicosis was oligosymptomatic in the patient with Down’s syndrome, probably because Down’s syndrome represents a syndrome of accelerated ageing. Both were pretreated with antithyroid drugs before radioiodine therapy. Both patients developed postradioiodine hypothyroidism: after 8 months in the case with Turner’s syndrome and after 11 years in the patient with Down’s syndrome. Adults with these two chromosomial disorders should be screened annually for autoimmune thyroid dysfunction.",

In the presented case we discuss the difficulties in the diagnosis of Paget's disease in a 77 year old patient with coexisting endometrium carcinoma. The patient was initially diagnosed with metastatic bone disease due to endometrium adenocarcinoma when she was admitted to oncology clinic with pelvic pain. Bone scintigraphy with Tc99 and (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT revealed an increased uptake on the bone lesions which were reported as metastatic bone involvement. Although the (18)F-FDG uptake was much higher than the levels that would generally be anticipated in a case with Paget's disease, high levels of bone turnover markers indicated further evaluation in the differential diagnosis and the definitive diagnosis of Paget's disease was established with the pathological evaluation of bone biopsy.",

In this respect, understanding the mechanism of uterine contractions at a molecular level helps shed some light on possible future prevention and treatment. New research has emphasized the role of endocannabinoids by two metabolic pathways with final products that act as antagonists: prostaglandins and prostamides (prostaglandin-ethanolamides), but with competition on substrates and enzymes. Thus, the dominant pathway will be selected on account of cellular and tissue environment.",

Arecoline treatment alone or in water deprivation (C: 68.31 ± 2.30, AR: 144.50 ± 4.33, AR+WD: 194.42 ± 3.35 μg/ mL) / food deprivation (AR + FD: 180.89 ± 4.51 μg/ mL) stress also stimulated adrenocortical activity as recorded in metabolic stress. In contrast, adrenomedullary activity was not altered following water/ food deprivation. Arecoline treatment alone or in metabolic stress suppressed adrenomedullary activity by showing depletion of chromaffin granules (E/NE?), epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations. Both the stress decreased blood glucose and liver glycogen levels. Arecoline treatment decreased blood glucose level, with a rise in liver glycogen level, but elevated blood glucose level in water deprivation unlike in starvation.Arecoline alone or in metabolic stress involves adrenal and probably other endocrine glands (pancreas, posterior pituitary and rennin-angiotensin system) to maintain homeostasis in metabolic stress in mice.",

Niemann-Pick A and B are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-1 (SMPD1) gene on chromosome 11p15. Type B is panethnic, although its frequency is increased in Turkish, Arabic and North African populations. Clinical features vary significantly among patients. It is a rare condition and information about its management an outcome during pregnancy and labor is limited. Both maternal mortality and morbidity due to severe postpartum hemorrhage has been reported. We represent a case of successful pregnancy outcome in patient with NPD type B.

The degree of lumbar disc injury in patients of different ages was also compared. Differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted via GEO database, and qPCR confirmation was determined by collecting cartilage endplates from two groups. ACAN, Col2A1, p16, p21, and p53 were detected by immunofluorescence, Western blot and qPCR in human nucleus pulposus cells. Changes of cell senescence were detected. The binding of Hsa-miR-183-3p to ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay.Degenerative discs showed elevated expression of hsa-miR-183-3p, which may be upregulated by TNF-α via NF-κB signaling pathway and target ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein regulation.Degeneration of the intervertebral disc can be accelerated by TNF-α. Additionally, Hsa-miR-183-3p passed NF-κB signaling pathway is blocked via up-regulation of TNF-α to reduce inflammation via targeting ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein. As a result, this negative feedback mechanism may assist in maintaining a low degenerative load and preserving chronic disc degeneration.",

The participants were given a questionnaire survey and underwent a physical examination. The aggregation of cardiovascular risk factors was defined as two or more cardiovascular risk factors occurring simultaneously in the same individual.Partial correlation analysis suggested that serum omentin-1 level was significantly correlated with waist circumference (R=-0.086, P=0.019) and Body Mass Index (R=-0.096, P=0.009). Logistic regression analysis showed that as the serum omentin-1 level increased, the risk of aggregation of cardiovascular risk factors decreased. Cardiovascular risk factors which were most closely associated with a decrease in the serum omentin-1 level were obesity calculated by Body Mass Index (OR=0.988, P=0.043) and central obesity calculated by waist circumference (OR=0.993, P=0.012).The serum omentin-1 level in adolescents is inversely associated with the aggregation of cardiovascular risk factors.

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggested that MPTP could cause gastrointestinal motility deficits additionally to its nonconclusive and controverted effects on the CNS (behavior and brain oxidative stress) in rats. A possible interaction between MPTP typical impairments and magnesium modulatory potential was previously suggested, as magnesium role was described in neuroprotection, gastrointestinal function, and oxidative stress.To investigate the possible modulatory effect of several magnesium intake formulations (via drinking water) in MPTP neurotoxicity and functional gastrointestinal impairment induction.Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 3-week magnesium intake-controlled diets (magnesium depleted food and magnesium enriched drinking water) previously to acute subcutaneous MPTP treatment (30 mg/ kg body weight). Gastrointestinal motility (one hour stool collection test), and behavioral patterns (Y maze task, elevated plus maze test, open field test, forced swim test) were evaluated. Followingly, brain and bowel samples were collected, and oxidative stress was evaluated (glutathione peroxidase activity, malondial-dehyde concentrations).MPTP could lead to magnesium intake-dependent constipation-like gastrointestinal motility impairments, anxiety- and depressive-like affective behavior changes, and mild pain tolerance defects. Also, we found similar brain and intestinal patterns in magnesium-dependent oxidative stress.While the MPTP effects in normal magnesium intake could be regarded as not fully relevant in rat models and limited to the current experimental conditions, the abnormalities observed in the affective behavior, gastrointestinal status, pain tolerance, peripheric and central oxidative status could be indicative of the extent of the systemic effects of MPTP that are not restricted to the CNS level, but also to gastro-intestinal system.",

Puberty then progressed to stage 3 of Marshall - Tanner and had stopped. In laboratory studies, the patient had anterior hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus (DI). In pituitary and hypothalamic MRIs, a mass-like enlargement of the pituitary stalk and pineal region was seen, but due to the small size of the lesions, stereotactic biopsy was not possible. During this time, the patient developed recurrent attacks of hydrocephalus. Serum and CSF β-subunit of Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were negative. Treatment was not started because different lesions could cause disease in this area. After one year, a biopsy was performed and the germ cell tumor was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was started and after treatment the vision disorder and diplopia disappeared, but DI and pituitary dysfunction remained. Treatment of intracranial germinoma is multidisciplinary. GCTs are very sensitive to radiation therapy. They are treated with combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, endocrine therapy and have a good prognosis.",

Duplications flanking the SHOX gene (upstream or downstream of the intact SHOX gene involving conserved non-coding cis-regulatory DNA elements - CNEs) have been described but their clinical involvement is still difficult to understand.We describe two cases with short stature and normal GH-IGF1 status. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and array comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) identified in both cases heterozygous duplications involving downstream regions of SHOX gene, within CNEs (CNE8, CNE9 and CNE4, CNE5, CNE6, ECR1, CNE8, CNE9 and surrounding areas, respectively). One of the cases showed a maternally inherited duplication. Although every case has several particularities, we consider that duplications in these non-coding regions of SHOX gene may explain the short stature phenotype.To our knowledge, these are the first Romanian-reported cases of ISS with a large duplication of downstream SHOX enhancers CNEs region. The spectrum of phenotypic consequences and the exact mechanism of the presumed clinical expression of these genetic alterations still needs to be evaluated and described.",

Patients with less than 6 months of follow up are excluded from the study.Patients were divided into two groups according to their scintigraphy results; with positive scintigraphy findings as group 1 (n:135) and negative scintigraphy findings as group 2 (n:50). Mean preoperative serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) values were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.02). Mean preoperative serum calcium, creatinine, magnesium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels of both groups were analyzed and there were no statistical differences between the two groups considering these parameters.

The cause of hemolytic anemia was G6PD deficiency. The patient had no previous episodes of hemolysis and had no relevant family history. Hypoglycemia did not occur during blood glucose regulation. The return of blood sugar to normal after a long period of hyperglycemia was thought to be the possible cause of hemolysis. In conclusion, G6PD deficiency should be considered when there is an episode of hemolysis in newly diagnosed children and adolescents with T1DM, especially in the absence of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.",

However, clinical symptoms and endocrine abnormalities were absent, the lesion was thought to be non-functional. Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed. Pathologically, this was diagnosed as an adrenal arteriovenous malformation.

    "abstract": "Only a few subacute thyroiditis (SAT) cases secondary to hypocortisolemia developed after successfully treating Cushing's disease (CD) have been reported. In this report, we present an SAT case, which developed immediately after discontinuation of steroid treatment for hypocortisolemia after the successful treatment of CD. A 54-year-old female patient who had recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to our center with complaints of proximal myopathy and obesity. Serum cortisol did not suppress adequately after the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test. Pituitary MRI of the patient with increased basal plasma ACTH level revealed a 6 x 5 mm right-sided adenoma. After successful surgical treatment, the patient was given ten months of steroid therapy due to a suppressed corticotroph axis. Shortly after the steroid treatment was discontinued, the patient was admitted with neck pain, fever, and thyrotoxicosis. The patient was diagnosed with SAT, and methylprednisolone treatment was started again. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in SAT cases that develop after the treatment of CD can only be speculated. One possible mechanism could be that the glucocorticoid deficiency develops after effective treatment of hypercortisolism alters the immunological responses or generates self-reactive cells and prepares an appropriate environment for the thyrolytic process.",

It is known that fertility in women begins to decline gradually from the age of 25 and decreases rapidly from the age of 35. On the other hand, many couples in the fourth decade of life are significantly involved in their careers and are sometimes even physically separated. This means that the probability of conception is inherently reduced, because sexual intercourse cannot take place regularly on fertile days. We report on a 35-year-old patient in whom we programmed the cycle with the progestin pill drospirenone, which resulted in a spontaneous conception and the birth of a healthy child.",

    "abstract": "Aim: The present study aims to assess the final outcome after combined therapeutic approaches in patients with macroprolactinomas resistant to dopamine agonists (DA). Patients: Records of patients with macroprolactinoma hospitalized in the Institute of Endocrinology, Bucharest, between 1978-2005, were reviewed. There were 29 eligible patients resistant to DA therapy (8 men and 21 women), out of 119 patients with macroprolactinomas; age at diagnosis ranged between 16-59 years. Methods: Rapid fluoroimmunoassay using Europium was used for hormonal levels; computed tomography imaging and/or MRI were used for tumor size. Study design: The resistance to DA drugs was evaluated using minimal criteria: the lack of prolactinoma response to current daily dose of Bromocriptine (BRC) 7.5 mg/day or to Cabergoline (CAB) up to 2 mg/week for at least 6 months (step 1) or maximal criteria: the lack of response to high BRC doses (30 mg/day) or CAB doses between 2.5-4 mg/week for at least 6 months (step 2). The lack of response was considered if PRL levels remained above the upper normal limit (20 ng/mL) and the tumor mass size decreased with less than 50%. All resistant cases at step 1 received thereafter maximal medical therapy with DA drugs, according to step 2. Thereafter, resistant macroprolactinomas after step 2 were submitted to step 3 high voltage radiotherapy ± surgery. Results: Outcome of medical therapy with DA (n=29): Overall, 7 resistant macroprolactinomas were solved by increasing BRC dose (n=5) or changing BRC to CAB (n=2). But 22/119 (18.5%) patients remained resistant to DA drugs independent of dose, duration or type of drug used. 14 patients failed to normalize PRL levels despite CAB treatment in doses up to 7 mg/week. Outcome of radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery (n=15): PRL normalization was achieved in 4 patients out of the only 7 assessed",

Symmetric uterine buds and fallopian tubes are consistant with type A and asymmetric - with type B MRKH syndrome, the latter being associated with other congenital anomalies (renal, skeletal, ear ovarian and cardiac). We studied four patients aged 18-45 years in which type A MRKH syndrome was established by clinical and gynaecological examination, pelvic and abdominal ultrasonography, explorative laparoscopy cytogenetic analysis and hormonal evaluation. Associated disorders were breast fibroadenoma and Graves disease in one case, congenital glaucoma, keratitis, hypocalcemia and simple goiter in another case and polycystic ovaries with clinical signs of hyperandrogenism in the case which can be related to the genetic defect underlying MRKH syndrome. The presence of associated disorders complicates the management of MRKH syndrome which is complex, requires multidisciplinary approach and decreases further the patient’s quality of life.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out on 1290 patients, whose choroids plexus and pineal gland were examined on computed tomography. Aim: To check the correspondence between the choroid plexuses and the pineal gland calcifications along age groups and sex; and the connections between these calcifications and associated pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of patients of both sexes, within six age intervals. RESULTS: In order to classify the calcification variants, eight types of combinations were ordered and can be seen in CT: two refer to extreme variants: totally uncalcified (type 1) and totally calcified (type 8); bilateral, symmetrical variants (types 4 and 5); the other four types include the asymmetrical calcifications (2, 3, 6 and 7). After the anthropological study the results demonstrate that there are significant differences between calcification of the choroids plexus and those of the pineal gland with the two sexes, on age groups and pathological ground. For type 1-totally uncalcified the maximum frequency is around 70% with ages under 19. For type 8 totally calcified, bilateral, the maximum frequency is around 50% with age groups 48-59 and 60-71. For type 4 calcification only of choroid plexus, one finds a continuous increase from about 10% at the first age group to about 25% at the last group, while for type 5calcification only of the pineal gland the frequency is 10%−20%. We started from the hypothesis that the presence of these calcifications is physiological, and has an active adaptative metabolic part depending on many factors, among which the individual constitutional ground is also present. CONCLUSIONS: The age is not the main cause of the calcification types, but a process of adaptative-reactive variability of interface type, playing an integrating mediating part.",

    "abstract": "The impressive progresse in biochemistry, biophysics and cellular biology in the latest decade has achieved many breakthroughs in the inner normal and pathological cellular processes, opening new vistas in the fundamental and applicative biochemical thinking and researches. As a fundamental biomedical science, physiology benefitted of these cognitive and applicative discoveries, becoming the reference system essential for various clinical and paraclinical biomedical acts. The homeostatic mechanisms of regulation, adaptation and neuro-endocrino-metabolic control have been first specified that lie at the basis of the “constant composition of the inner medium”, signalled by Claude Bernard (1852) (1). Brief data concerning homeostasis As a state of dynamic equilibrium of the constituents of liquid medium surrounding cellular level, homeostasis is essential for the survival and obtaining of various activity forms of the cells. About 100 trillion cells of the human body with structure, metabolism and highly differentiated functions are subject to a permanent adaptative control, starting with the self-regulation of the main functions of the organism and ending with the genetic control at the cellular level. The regulation and control systems necessary to maintain the cellular homeostatic equilibria are of two kinds: intrinsic (local) and extrinsic (nervous and endocrine). By these complex mechanisms the direct or reflex selfregulation of vascular tonus is obtained, as well as the differences of volume and circulating blood pressure, the concentration of constituents of the inner medium necessary for both extra and intracellular liquid exchanges (nutrient molecules, oxygen, carbon dioxide, salts, electrolytes, vitamins, hormones, mediators and chemical modulators, etc.) and for the thermal regulation, acido-basic equilibrium, concentration of secretion products and cellular degradation, etc. Thus, each cell, as part of various tissues and organs, contributes to the coordination and maintaining of local and general equilibria, a homeostasis absolutely essential for the organism normal activity.",

In the first case, a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), data were recorded from 38 to 49 years as follows: vitiligo (at 38 ys), alopecia areata (4-6 months afterwards), SLE (after 2 ys) and then GBD (after 8 ys). After 3 years, hyperthyroidism has spontaneously vanished, but vitiligo, AA, leucothrichia, SLE, goiter and ophthalmopathy persisted. In the second case, a man, data were recorded from 26 to 70 years and the disease was associated with psoriasis. The sequence of diseases was: vitiligo (at 26 ys), AA and GBD (after 8 ys), followed by iatrogenic 131 I hypothyroidism, and psoriasis (after 33 ys). Vitiligo and AA have spontaneously vanished before GBD began # . These multiple immune syndrome associations bring up the question: “Are these diseases multiple associations or a unique immune disease?” A possible point of view, related to immune network, suggests that these multiple associations represent in fact only one process, therefore they represent not many diseases, but different expressions in time (sequence) and space (organ-lesion) of the disease of the immune network.",

    "abstract": "We present a 6 months male infant with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI)- the former nesidioblastosis. The main presenting symptoms were recurrent episodes of hypoglycemic seizures (persistent hypoglycemic status of 30 mg/dL serum glucose) high requirements of i.v. glucose for maintaining euglycemic status. The main diagnostic markers were: high insulin to glucose ratio,negative urinary ketones, normal growth hormone level, normal cortisol level during hypoglycemia, no visible pathological masses on abdominal and cranial MRI . As a medical treatment we used Octreotid and we needed several adjustments of the dose to maintain euglycemic status, between 4 µg/kg/day s.c. and 10 µg/kg/day s.c. Our goal were to prevent the neurological damage and the minimum compromise in the fragile equilibrium of advantages and disadvantages of the treatment in order to maintain the best outcome we could get. Our patient is in his second year of treatment with no severe hypoglycemia during the last 12 months and with good neurological and physical development. The long term outcome is difficult to be predicted.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic posterior pituitary gland (EPP) is usually characterized by an abnormal pituitary stalk and hypoplasia of the anterior hypophysis. The genetic mechanisms involved in the development of EPP remain uncertain. The aim of this study is to determine whether mutations in the three genes, PROP-1, LHX2, and POU1F1, are associated with the risk for and the characteristics of EPP.In the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of \"Dr. Behcet Uz\" Children's Hospital, 27 patients with EPP were submitted to sequencing analyses of the PROP-1, LHX2, and POU1F1 genes.Growth hormone, thyrotropin, corticotropin, gonadotropin, and vasopressin deficiency were observed in 22 (81.5%), 23 (85.2%), 17 (63%), 14 (51.9%), and two (7.4%) patients. Thirteen patients (48.1%) presented with hyperprolactinemia. Fourteen patients (51%) had a history of birth dystocia, and 12 cases (42.1%) had a history of breech presentation. Central nervous system abnormalities included five cases with corpus callosum agenesis, one case with schizencephaly, and one case with Chiari type 1 malformation. We identified a homozygous p.S109* mutation in exon 2 in one male patient with EPP and two different PROP1 gene polymorphisms (A142T or c.109+3 G>A polymorphism) in thirteen patients.Our results suggest that PROP1 gene abnormalities might explain the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of EPP.",

Concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) were increased indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Low and high dose dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrated incomplete suppression of DHEAS concentration without connection between pulses of LH/FSH and DHEAS. Response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was normal. The morning/evening concentration ratio of DHEAS was very low in comparison with cortisol, ACTH and testosterone. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated petroclival meningioma without any adrenal or ovary abnormality. Menstruation started after treatment with 2 mg of estradiol. At control visit 1.5 years later she had no complaints. MRI did not demonstrate any signs of tumour progression.The main lesson learned from this case is that in searching the DHEAS secreting tumours one can find unusual cases with sustained high DHEAS and lack of confirmations of polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal or ovary tumours using available ultrasound, CT and MRI.",

Subjects and methods.A prospective study on a sample of 82 individuals aged over 65 years, who presented for laboratory evaluations in an outpatient setting.They were recorded socio-demographic and clinical data; depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Blood samples were collected and analyzed according to the protocol of the study.Results.Anxiety, identified in 57 persons, was not statistically significant correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers.For depressive disorder (37 subjects), both CRP and hs-CRP were significantly higher, with an almost medium effect size.Conclusions.The high levels of CRP and hs-CRP are associated with the presence of depression in elderly patients, but not with the anxiety.Further and complex studies need to validate these findings on this group of age.",

He was initially diagnosed with a left cervical PGL at the age of 23 years, treated by surgery. Then, he recurred and developed a multifocal disease. The second-line therapeutic option was a three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy performed in 2008. In 2013 the patient had clinical, hormonal, PET- and SPECT-CT data revealing a disease progression. The treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analogue Octreotide Lar was carried out till the patient's death caused by pulmonary embolism in December 2014.Complex treatment led to a long clinical and biochemical remission and control of tumor growth.Despite their usually benign behavior, multicentric SDHD-related PGLs can require a multimodal approach involving surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatment for providing a long-term control of the disease and maintaining a good quality of life.",

Healthy controls had higher leptin (37.6.±7.8 vs. 7.9±2.6 ng/mL in women and 11.9±4.6 vs. 1.4±0.34 ng/mL in men, p=0.0016 and 0.043) and lower adiponectin levels (9.3±1.1 vs. 14.9±1.1 µg/mL in women and 7.9±0.9 vs. 11.1±0.9 µg/mL in men, p=0.012 and 0.017) than RC patients.Adipokine profiles of patients with RC differ from the healthy population, possibly reflecting an adaptation to the disease rather than a triggering factor. These differences may find clinical applications for the prognosis of disease evolution.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is routinely measured by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).Positron emission tomography of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose combined with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is a valuable assessment tool for patients with cancer or staging tumors. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging can also be utilised to detect the metabolic activity of glucose in the adipose tissue, liver and muscles. The aim of this study was to determine insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscle visceral adipose and subcutaneous adipose tissue separately via18F-FDG PET/CT.Sixty three adult patients who underwent whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for clinical purposes (diagnosis or staging of cancer) between July and August of 2016 were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups according to their BMI (Group 1: BMI<25kg/m2, Group 2: BMI>25kg/m2). HOMA-IR,fasting glucose,insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL levels were measured. We calculated SUV as the tissue activity of the ROI (MBq/g)/(injected dose [MBq]/ body weight [g]) on PET images and measured the maximum SUVs (SUVmax) of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT),liver and rectus muscle ROIs (2 cm). SUV corrected by blood glucose level (SUVgluc) was calculated as SUVmax×blood glucose level/100. Student-t test, Chi-square test and Pearson correlation test were used for statistical analysis.Mean glucose,insulin,HOMA-IR levels of the group-2 were statistically higher than of group-1. Muscle SUVmax and liver SUVmax of group-1 were statistically higher than of group-2. Muscle SUVgluc of group-1 was statistically higher than of group-2. HOMA-IR was negatively correlated with both SUVmax(r=-0.340, p=0.01) and muscle SUVmax(r=-0.373, p=0.005).18F-FDG PET/CT has shown that the muscle tissue maximum FDG uptake was lower in the insulin resistance group. Therefore, 18-FDG PET/CT could be a valuable tool for diagnosing insulin resistance.",

The 72 adenoma specimens were divided into 22 monohormonal, 21 plurihormonal, 21 immunonegative and 8 unreliable specimens.

Statistically significant relationships between the immunohistochemical presentation and the preoperative diagnosis were found for prolactin and hyperprolactinemia, growth hormone and acromegaly and adrenocorticotropic hormone and Cushing's syndrome.The lack of full concordance between the clinical presentations and immunohistochemical staining was mainly a result of the presence of nonfunctioning adenomas, plurihormonal adenomas and unreliable specimens. The morphometric method introduced in this study, utilizing the immunoexpression index, provided a very precise evaluation of pituitary adenomas pathology.",

In this study, our aim was to identify PTDM incidence after LT in our center and the potential risk factors.In this study, 238 adult LT patients were evaluated in terms of PTDM development.Of 238 patients included in the study, 170 (71.4%) were male, 68 (28.6%) were female and the mean age was 43.5± 13.7 years. Of all patients, PTDM developed in 24 (10.1%). Transient-Hyperglycemia (t-HG) was detected in 31 (13%) patients. PTDM and t-HG patients had a greater body weight than non-PTDM patients (BMI kg/m2: 27.6± 5.3, 25.8± 4.3and 23.9± 3.3, respectively p<0.001 p= 0.028).

In the univariate analysis, the only independent risk factor for PTDM was age (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.31-2.97).Age is the most important risk factor for PTDM development after LT. PTDM was found more common in the patient group with greater body weight. Patients with older age and greater body weight should be examined more carefully for PTDM before LT.",

Patients were stratified by 24-h proteinuria levels: Group 1:≤1g/24h); Group 2:1-3g/24h; and Group 3:≥3g/24h. Renal outcomes were defined as having reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The proteinuria level's influence on the renal outcomes was evaluated using Cox regression analysis.Among subgroups stratified by proteinuria levels, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, BUN, cholesterol, DR and hypertension incidence, the incidences of patients who progressed to ESRD were the lowest in group 1 (P<0.05). However, eGFR, serum albumin and hemoglobin were highest in group 1. Patients with higher proteinuria levels had much lower five-year renal survival rates. Univariate analyses revealed that higher proteinuria levels were significant clinical predictors of renal prognosis (P<0.05), although they were not independent risk factors for progression to ESRD in the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis (P>0.05).The higher the level of proteinuria, the lower the 5-year renal survival rate of DN patients, but there was no significant correlation between proteinuria level and 5-year renal survival rate. Other factors in the proteinuria group may have more significant effects on the 5-year renal survival rate, such as lower baseline eGFR, serum albumin, hemoglobin and higher cholesterol, higher incidences of DR and more severe lesions.",

    "abstract": "The standard approach is to perform repeat FNAB (rFNAB) in thyroid nodules with non-diagnostic (ND) / insufficient (UNS) cytology. However, due to the nature of these nodules, recurrent FNABs may also be insufficient. Therefore, by comparing the clinical-radiological-pathological parameters of nodules with a definite diagnosis of excision, we questioned the possibility of patient management without rFNAB.Clinical-radiological parameters of 275 nodules belonging to 264 patients in the ND/UNS aspiration group with definite pathological diagnosis after surgery were determined. Under the guidance of these parameters, those with and without rFNAB were compared.The incidence of malignancy was found to be significantly higher in nodules without rFNAB compared to nodules with rFNAB (p = 0.036). In addition, the incidence of malignancy in BC-1 nodules without rFNAB was significantly higher than in nodules with rFNAB result also BC-1 (p = 0.009). In all cases, nodule size smaller than 10 mm and border irregularity were found to be statistically significant for malignancy (p <0.020, p <0.002). When looking at the distribution of rFNAB results, a significant correlation was observed with female gender, solid component, hypoechogenicity, border irregularity and halo loss around the nodule in patients with BC-4,5,6 cytology results (respectively, 0.005 / 0.031 / 0.001 / 0.012 / 0.004).rFNAB did not show the expected effect in ND / UNS nodules. We recommend direct surgical excision without rFNAB for nodules with border irregularity, solid structure, halo loss and hypoechogenicity, which should be considered more important in female patients.",

It describes total thyroidectomy for recurrent relapses of Graves encephalopathy (GE) despite medical treatment.A 33-year-old male presented with impaired consciousness and convulsions. He had post-thyroid surgery recurrent Graves' disease with a goitre. Based on this fact, high thyroid antibodies titres and the exclusion of other causes of such neurological manifestations, he was diagnosed to have GE. This is a rare variant of \"encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease\" (EAATD). Despite the administration of steroid therapy and other standard therapeutic measures, he developed five relapses within 17 months. Total thyroidectomy was advised. Unfortunately, he got another severe attack that required intensive care admission. After three days of discharging, he had urgent total thyroidectomy. The operation went well and for 18 months' follow-up he had no more attacks. However, thyroid antibodies remained high.The report provides details on the diagnosis, standard management and the indication for thyroidectomy for GE. It describes its challenges, precautions, technique and outcomes. It reviews the extent of surgery as well as the clinical and antibody outcomes of the previous three related reports, in comparison with the current one.For medically uncontrolled relapse of GE, thyroidectomy consistently results in ending the attacks. It, therefore, should be put in more consideration in the treatment protocols. On the other hand, one should not depend on antibody levels as a measure of treatment success.",

    "abstract": "Interventions that suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acids may be useful for improving glycemic control in diabetic patients.It was shown that administration of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist Mifepristone (MIF) leads to variously pronounced changes in the alanine-, aspartate-, tyrosine- aminotransferases (ALT, AST, TAT) activity in the liver of experimental animals. It has been suggested that this selective effect of MIF may be related to differences in the expression of the corresponding genes. The aim of the study was to investigate the gene expression and activity of ALT, AST and TAT in the liver of rats with streptozotocin-related diabetes (StD) under the long-term oral MIF administration.Male Wistar rats (n=48) with StD under the 10-days oral MIF administration were used. It was measured the activity of ALT, AST, TAT enzymes and relative expression of this genes in the liver of experimental animals.In rats with StD the gene expression of all three studied aminotransferases in the liver was statistically significantly increased and their activity was increased as well. MIF administration did not change the studied genes expression and enzymes activity to healthy rats and caused a decrease in expression of ALT and AST genes and activity of these enzymes to rats with StD. However, the expression of the TAT gene and the activity of this enzyme in the liver of rats with StD increased upon MIF administration in comparison with animals with StD.The introduction of MIF against the background of StD reduces the expression of genes and the activity of ALT and AST in the liver, what determine the transamination of amino acids to include them in gluconeogenesis, but increases the expression of genes and the activity of TAT, what determine the inclusion of tyrosine in the biogenic amines synthesis. The mechanisms of such selectivity require further study.",

    "abstract": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by congenital deficiency of enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex. In this article, we aimed to present a 29-year-old female patient with I2 splice point mutation detected in one allele and P453S mutation on the other allele of CYP21A2 gene associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Her further investigation revealed that her mother had P453S mutation and her father had I2 splice mutation.A 29-year-old woman with CAH was admitted to our clinic with the request of pregnancy. Her physical examination revealed a height of 151 cm, weight 59 kg, body mass index 25.8 kg/m2. According to Tanner staging, she had Stage 3 breast development and pubic hair. Her laboratory test results were as follows: Glucose: 79 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL), Creatinine: 0.6 (0.5-0.95 mg/dL), Sodium: 138 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L), Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L (3.5-5.1 mEq/L), Cortisol: 0.05 µg/dL, ACTH: <5.00 pg/mL (5-46 pg/mL), 17-OH progesterone: 7.67 ng/mL (0-3 ng/mL). Chromosome analysis revealed a 46, XX karyotype. CYP21A2 gene mutation analysis was performed for the patient whose clinical history and laboratory results were compatible with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. During the reverse dot blot analysis, I2 splice mutation in one allele and P453S mutation in the other allele were detected.Although the I2 splice mutation detected in our case was mostly associated with a salt-wasting form of CAH, it was thought that the other P453S mutation detected may explain the relatively good clinical course in our case.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a well known risk factor for COVID-19 patients. However, There is limited data to investigate the association between prediabetes and COVID-19.We aimed to evaluate the effect of prediabetes and mechanical ventilation on the course of COVID-19 and determine whether patients who recover from COVID-19 infection show changes in cardiac function and laboratory findings during follow-up.This study included 87 adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the WHO definition and were admitted for inpatient treatment between April 2021 and August 2021. They were classified into 3 groups, normoglycemia (n=40), prediabetes (n=25), and diabetes (n=22), and then divided into groups according to need for mechanical ventilation. Statistical analyses were performed to compare laboratory, echocardiographic findings and COVID-19 outcomes among the groups.The need of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in both diabetes and prediabetes groups than the normoglycemic group. Patients with diabetes and prediabetes had significantly higher LV E/Em (p=0.003, p=0.045) and RV MPI (p=0.032, p=0.021) and significantly shorter PAT (p=0.001, p=0.036) and significantly longer RV IVRT (p=0.021, p=0.017), respectively, compared to the normoglycemia group. Patients who required mechanical ventilation had significantly higher CRP (p=0.043), troponin (p<0.001), ferritin (p<0.001), HBA1C (P<0.001), glucose (p=0.019), monocytes (p<0.001), and monocytes-HDL ratio (MHR) (p<0.001) and significantly lower levels of HDL-C (p<0.001). Glucose, HDL-C, troponin, MPV, NLR, PLR level and RV and E/Em were found independently associated with the RVMPI.Prediabetes was associated with more impaired LV and RV diastolic functions compared to normoglycemic patients, comparable to those seen in diabetes. Our observations suggest that prediabetes should be considered as diabetes in the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19.",

Cytology was assessed by two pathologists with limited or no experience in thyroid cytology. We also got the corresponding sex, age, nodule diameter, EU-TIRADS score, Bethesda category and final pathology report.There were 1872 FNA in 1618 patients. Proportion of Bethesda 1 nodules decreased significantly (p for trend=0.003) from 17% in the first 100 FNA procedures to 4% in the 401-500 group of procedures, and remained constant between 9% and 4% (p for trend=NS) for the rest of the study. Proportion of Bethesda 2 rose steady from 26% in the first 100 nodules to 80.1% in the last 241 nodules (p for trend<0.001). Indeterminate lesions (Bethesda 3 and 4) decreased significantly (p for trend=0.001) from 16% and 35% in the first 100 nodules to 2.5% and 5.8% in the last 241 lesions. Proportions of Bethesda 5+6 categories varied non-significantly over time. There were no time trends in the malignancy rate of surgically removed nodules.At least 300 procedures are needed to reach the standard performance.

The observation period was set for 24 weeks.Twenty-one older adults (age, 60-79 years) with uncomplicated NCDs, who have performed 30-40 min MIE, 2-3 days/week at a hospital gym for over 1 year, were randomly divided into two groups: performing home-based MIE, comprising aerobic and resistance exercises, at least 20 min/day, 3 days/week (HOME, n = 11), or not performing home-based MIE (CON, n = 10). All participants completed the study and continued their gym-based MIE as usual.After 24 weeks, there were no significant differences in the values of any outcomes. Conversely, the decrease in waist circumference (WC) was larger in the HOME group (-2.17 [-3.98, -0.36] cm) than in the CON group (0.57 [-1.42, 2.56] cm) (p < 0.05), although not in other outcomes.Although further studies are needed, we found that adding home-based MIE had a positive effect on WC, but little effect on other metabolic functions in older adults with NCDs who have continued regular gym-based MIE.",
