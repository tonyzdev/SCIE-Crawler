Design of military uniforms is governed by protective functions, quality, and economic feasibility. Along with protection, key performance features include high strength, light weight, moisture management, and comfort. The surface of hydroentangled nonwovens and nylon-cotton blended woven fabrics were modified, and made superhydrophobic and superoleophobic to protect soldiers against the threat of hazardous chemical and biological agents. Scenarios for the use of nonwoven fabrics and computer-aided design in the mass production and customization of military uniforms are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The properties of conducting polymers deposited onto textiles were studied over 10 years ago by workers at Los Alamos and Milliken who also tested these materials as gas sensors [1-3]. More recently, workers at Wollongong have demonstrated that elastic textiles impregnated with conducting polymers, by in situ chemical polymerization, can act as strain sensors that can be used to track the motion of human joints [4]. A similar approach can be used to make pressure-sensing foams [5]. Others have studied the strain sensing mechanism in more detail and have shown that two effects are important. In one case, cracking of the surface layer on conducting polymer on a fabric leads to a reduction in conductivity as the fabric is stretched [6, 7] . On the other hand, tests on yarns and loops of conducting yarn show that conduction from yarn to yarn decreases as stress is applied to pull their surfaces into contact [8].",

Th e best elimination of non-cellulosic components used alkaline scouring followed by alkaline pectinase and acid pectinase scouring of cotton yarns. Mercerization changes the cotton surface by removing part of the cuticle components, turning it into a continuous thin layer that is more easily removed by alkaline and alkaline pectinase scouring.

    "abstract": "The effects of commercial antibacterial finishing agent application on the physical properties of cotton fabrics, including laundering durability, were investigated. Applications were performed by the pad-dry-cure method. All fabric samples were washed 40 times. The physical properties (i.e., fabric weight, pilling, burst ing strength, air permeability, and color efficiency) and antibacterial activity of the treated and untreated fabrics were tested before washing and after every 10 laundering cycles. It was found that pilling, air perme ability, and bursting strength of the fabrics were affected significantly, but color efficiency was not affected by the antibacterial treatments. Good antibacterial activity could be achieved even after 40 launderings with many different antibacterial agents. However, the antibacterial activity of the samples treated with different agents varied.",

If a product is durable, it will last for a long time and this means that it won't be discarded quickly, which keeps it out of the land-fill longer. If it doesn't need to be replaced often, the product's total environmental impact is reduced across its lifecycle. On the other hand, if something is designed to last for a long time, does that mean that it won't break down for a long time after it has been discarded—and if so, how can that be viewed as sustainable? Take plastic bags, for example. In the case of a product that is designed to be thrown away after relatively few uses, biodegradability is better than durability. So maybe it all depends on context.",

Since it was noticed that some of the agents have negative influence on human health, an eco-friendly agent Citric acid (CA), was used in the study for the purpose of simultaneous easy-care and antimicrobial finishing. Until now, except for the easy-care, CA has been used as binder in flame retardant finishing of cellulose materials (textile, wood and paper) where it has shown excellent results. Determination of antibacterial activity of finished products was performed according to ISO 20743:2005 standard before and after the 5 washing processes. Antibacterial activity was tested against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Bactericidal activity of cotton samples was additionally tested according to EN 1276:1997 under the dirty conditions, according to its practical applications. Antibacterial activity of cotton material treated with CA has shown to be in the same log range with quaternary ammonium (Quat) agent, currently on the market. Obtained results are confirming the possibility of eco-friendly CA application, for the purpose of antimicrobial finishing.",

The total amount of metals was determined by inductively coupled plasma – emission spectrometer after microwave digestion of materials with 7 M nitric acid. The results have shown that a possible cause of degradation of textile materials which occurres during bleaching treatment can be the presence of high concentrations of copper, which was found to be the dominant metal (8.1 -108.4 ppm), followed by iron (16.9 – 37.9 ppm). Cobalt, manganese and aluminum contents were under the detection limits (1.5, 0.1 and 28.3 ppb, respectively) for all samples tested.",

Since most of these reagents are much more expensive than N-methylol agents, which are still mostly used nowadays, they should impart extra end-use properties to justify high cost. Required quantities which are necessary for good easy care performance of cotton fabric are depending greatly on applied polycarboxylic acid (PCA). Finding an optimum catalyst system for PCA curing is still an open problem which must be solved. Best effects of esterification reaction followed by good strength retention and whiteness properties, have been obtained with sodium hypophosphyte (SHP), which is rather expensive as well. For the replacement of SHP, much cheaper catalysts based on the phosphonic acid, were tried to apply, alone or in different ratios with SHP. These catalysts were sodium salts of phosphonic acid in two different forms: tetrasodium salt of the hydroxyethylidene 1, 1-diphosphonic acid (HEDPA) and octasodium salt of the diethylenetriaminepentamethylenphosphonic acid (DETMPA). Addition of phosphono based catalysts as accelerators in a system with BTCA, CA and their mixture has enhanced their effectiveness as DP finishing agents in few cases. More significant is possible reduction of 50% SHP in CA treatment, and 30% in a case of BTCA treatment, while keeping good resiliency results.",

Homogenized samples were subjected to dry ashing, open-vessel digestion and microwave digestion and analyzed for presence of 28 elements. The best recoveries of all elements were detected after microwave digestion procedure. Dry ashing was the best method for determination of As, K, Mg, Mn and Na, while open-vessel digestion for Al, Be, Ca and Sb. For the determination of Cd and Co microwave digestion procedure achieved the highest recoveries. The accuracy of digestion methods was estimated by analysis of a certified reference material. Very good agreement within the certified and experimental values was found for the majority of the elements investigated.",

    "abstract": "Key Terms: Cotton, Enzymatic Scouring, Mercerization, Pectinase, Scouring, Yarns Consumer demand for improved cotton quaJit)' is on the rise as they become more aware of its influence on the properties of knitted fabrics (i.e., cotton quality affects dimensional stabihty, pill formation, and abrasion resistance). Knitted fabrics are mainly produced from ringor OE-spun cotton yarns. Researchers have studied the structural, physical, and mechanical properties of ringand OE-spun yarns. OE-spun yarns are more even; bulkier; and have lower tensile strength, elongation, and hairiness, but greater friction and abrasion resistance than ring-spun yarns.'^' For ring-spun yarns, fibers around the yarn center are almost parallel to the yarn axes.'' The use of OE-spun yarns for knitted fabrics offers several advantages, such as large package size, uniform strength and evenness, low hairiness, smooth fabric appearance, and a lower propensity to p'lWJ Despite the attractive yarn properties, fabrics knitted from open-end spun yarns have a somewhat harsh felling, due to the presence of wrapper fibers and a higher level of twist, often do not exhibit good stitch clarity, and have greater relaxation. These problems can be solved by yarn or knitted fabric treatments. Enzymes have found a variety of uses in textile applications. They are biological catalysts usually derived from a fungal or bacterial source. Enzymes consist of complex, three-dimensional proteins composed of polypeptide chains. These enzymes promote the hydrolysis of specific substrates, converting water-insoluble materials to water-soluble products that can be washed away. Ceilulases are most frequently used to remove surface hairiness and neps, and to improve hand and flexibility. Research has been done on enzyme treatment of cotton yarns as well as of knitted cotton fabrics made from differently-spun yarns.'Another way of improving the quality of knitted-cotton fabrics is mercerizarion of the yarns or fabrics. Mercerization can give these yarns or fabrics better dimensional stability, increased luster, increased dye and finishing-chemicals uptake, and better mechanical properties and smoothness. Yarn mercerization is usually done on raw cotton yarns. After mercerization, the yarns are scoured, bleached, or dyed (usually as hanks) and knitted into various knitted structures. Cotton yarn scouring can be done by traditional alkali treatment or by alternative commercially-viable enzyme treatment. Different enzyme classes have been investigated for use in scouring, including pectinases, ceilulases. Upases, and proteases. The best results were obtained with pectinases—degradation of pectin by pectinase enzymes facilitated the removal of the cuticle components. ' ' ' Aikaiine pectinase and acid pectinase are commonly used. Various parameters, such as enzyme concentration, temperature, pH, and chelating agent concentration for alkaline pectinase and acid pectinase treatment were determined in previous work. ' ' In general, alkaline scouring could be replaced by enzymatic scouring. Knitted fabrics made of enzymatic-scoured yarns, as well as knirted fabrics which had been enzymaticaily-scoured, had better quality parameters than those that were alkaline scoured.'''' 56 AATCC Review AUGUST 2007",

Today, technological advances have drastically increased the features that can be incorporated into the fabric of military outfits to give soldiers an even greater advantage.",

Various concentrations of skin-care microcapsules were applied on ladie's pantyhose made from a polyamide-elastane blend. Zeta potential of untreated and treated pantyhose was measured at variousof pH values in an electrolyte solution before and after 1 and 10 wash cycles. The effect of microencapsule tratment on the negative zeta potential at high pH correlated with the microcapsule concentration in the treatment bath. The pH dependence of zeta potential indicates microcapsules durability after the first wash cycle but suggests complete removal after 10 wash cycles.",

To determine the bonding mechanism, MDPA concentration was increased from 0% to 48%, while citric acid (9%) and sodium hypophosphite (4.5%) concentrations were unchanged. Citric acid is known to esterify cotton cellulose and react with MDPA, thus increasing MDPA bonding to cotton. The number of linkages was determined by wrinkle recovery angle and infrared measurements. Results showed the linear increase of the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and, consequently, decrease of char length values cased by the phosphorus concentration increase in the applied system. For FR results durable to 10 wash cycles, 36% MDPA, 9% citric acid and 4.5% sodium hypophosphite was used.",

It remains equally valid in 2020 and will continue to be the ethical code by which we should shop in the future. People in the textile and apparel industry are well aware of their responsibility to create a more sustainable supply chain, to reduce waste in production processes, and to recycle materials whenever possible. And much of the responsibility for these activities starts with the design team—groups of unsung heroes who have to juggle budgets, logistics, strategic plans, technology, aesthetics, functionality, and so much more. Designing goods for sustainability can mean many things—including: • designing high quality, durable products; • designing products that can be disassembled easily at their end-of-life, so that the materials and components can be easily recycled; • designing products which are made from organic, biodegradable, reclaimed or recycled materials and components; • designing products which generate a minimal amount of waste and pollution during their manufacture; • designing products which can be manufactured using machinery that can run on renewable energy, and consume a minimal amount of water; and • choosing manufacturing locations and distribution methods to minimize carbon emissions.",

According to The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, synthetic fabrics shed plastic particles equivalent to 50 billion plastic bottles every year. But synthetic fibers are not the only culprit. Washing clothes— regardless of the fiber type, is a water and energy guzzling affair. Unfortunately, many people believe their clothes only have one or two wear cycles before they need to be laundered. However, there are some environmentally cost-effective ways that might convince people that clothes do not have to be washed so often.",
