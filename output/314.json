    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds include, but are not limited, to diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. They are a challenge to wound care professionals and consume a great deal of healthcare resources around the globe. This review discusses the pathophysiology of complex chronic wounds and the means and modalities currently available to achieve healing in such patients. Recent Advances: Although often difficult to treat, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and specific attention toward managing these perturbations can often lead to successful healing. Critical Issues: Overcoming the factors that contribute to delayed healing are key components of a comprehensive approach to wound care and present the primary challenges to the treatment of chronic wounds. When wounds fail to achieve sufficient healing after 4 weeks of standard care, reassessment of underlying pathology and consideration of the need for advanced therapeutic agents should be undertaken. However, selection of an appropriate therapy is often not evidence based. Future Directions: Basic tenets of care need to be routinely followed, and a systematic evaluation of patients and their wounds will also facilitate appropriate care. Underlying pathologies, which result in the failure of these wounds to heal, differ among various types of chronic wounds. A better understanding of the differences between various types of chronic wounds at the molecular and cellular levels should improve our treatment approaches, leading to better healing rates, and facilitate the development of new more effective therapies. More evidence for the efficacy of current and future advanced wound therapies is required for their appropriate use.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Keratinocytes, a major cellular component of the epidermis, are responsible for restoring the epidermis after injury through a process termed epithelialization. This review will focus on the pivotal role of keratinocytes in epithelialization, including cellular processes and mechanisms of their regulation during re-epithelialization, and their cross talk with other cell types participating in wound healing. Recent Advances: Discoveries in epidermal stem cells, keratinocyte immune function, and the role of the epidermis as an independent neuroendocrine organ will be reviewed. Novel mechanisms of gene expression regulation important for re-epithelialization, including microRNAs and histone modifications, will also be discussed. Critical Issues: Epithelialization is an essential component of wound healing used as a defining parameter of a successful wound closure. A wound cannot be considered healed in the absence of re-epithelialization. The epithelialization process is impaired in all types of chronic wounds. Future Directions: A comprehensive understanding of the epithelialization process will ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to promote wound closure.",

    "abstract": "Significance: When a cutaneous injury occurs, the wound heals via a dynamic series of physiological events, including coagulation, granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The final stage can take many months, yet the new ECM forms a scar that never achieves the flexibility or strength of the original tissue. In certain circumstances, the normal scar is replaced by pathological fibrotic tissue, which results in hypertrophic or keloid scars. These scars cause significant morbidity through physical dysfunction and psychological stress. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: The cutaneous ECM comprises a complex assortment of proteins that was traditionally thought to simply provide structural integrity and scaffolding characteristics. However, recent findings show that the ECM has multiple functions, including, storage and delivery of growth factors and cytokines, tissue repair and various physiological functions. Abnormal ECM reconstruction during wound healing contributes to the formation of hypertrophic and keloid scars. Whereas adult wounds heal with scarring, the developing foetus has the ability to heal wounds in a scarless fashion by regenerating skin and restoring the normal ECM architecture, strength, and function. Recent studies show that the lack of inflammation in fetal wounds contributes to this perfect healing. Future Directions: Better understanding of the exact roles of ECM components in scarring will allow us to produce therapeutic agents to prevent hypertrophic and keloid scars. This review will focus on the components of the ECM and their role in both physiological and pathological (hypertrophic and keloid) cutaneous scar formation.",

    "abstract": "Significance: A 2018 retrospective analysis of Medicare beneficiaries identified that ∼8.2 million people had wounds with or without infections. Medicare cost estimates for acute and chronic wound treatments ranged from $28.1 billion to $96.8 billion. Highest expenses were for surgical wounds followed by diabetic foot ulcers, with a higher trend toward costs associated with outpatient wound care compared with inpatient. Increasing costs of health care, an aging population, recognition of difficult-to-treat infection threats such as biofilms, and the continued threat of diabetes and obesity worldwide make chronic wounds a substantial clinical, social, and economic challenge. Recent Advances: Chronic wounds are not a problem in an otherwise healthy population. Underlying conditions ranging from malnutrition, to stress, to metabolic syndrome, predispose patients to chronic, nonhealing wounds. From an economic point of view, the annual wound care products market is expected to reach $15–22 billion by 2024. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool (RePORT) now lists wounds as a category. Future Directions: A continued rise in the economic, clinical, and social impact of wounds warrants a more structured approach and proportionate investment in wound care, education, and related research.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from existing vessels, is an important aspect of the repair process. Restoration of blood flow to damaged tissues provides oxygen and nutrients required to support the growth and function of reparative cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent proangiogenic growth factors in the skin, and the amount of VEGF present in a wound can significantly impact healing. Recent Advances: The activity of VEGF was once considered to be specific for endothelial cells lining the inside of blood vessels, partly because VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression was believed to be restricted to endothelial cells. It is now known, however, that VEGFRs can be expressed by a variety of other cell types involved in wound repair. For example, keratinocytes and macrophages, which both carry out important functions during wound healing, express VEGFRs and are capable of responding directly to VEGF. Critical Issues: The mechanisms by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis are well established. Recent studies, however, indicate that VEGF can directly affect the activity of several nonendothelial cell types present in the skin. The implications of these extra-angiogenic effects of VEGF on wound repair are not yet known, but they suggest that this growth factor may play a more complex role during wound healing than previously believed. Future Directions: Despite the large number of studies focusing on VEGF and wound healing, it is clear that the current knowledge of how VEGF contributes to the repair of skin wounds is incomplete. Further research is needed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of VEGF activities during the wound healing process.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fibroblasts play a critical role in normal wound healing. Various extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens, fibrin, fibronectin, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and matricellular proteins, can be considered potent protagonists of fibroblast survival, migration, and metabolism. Recent Advances: Advances in tissue culture, tissue engineering, and ex vivo models have made the examination and precise measurements of ECM components in wound healing possible. Likewise, the development of specific transgenic animal models has created the opportunity to characterize the role of various ECM molecules in healing wounds. In addition, the recent characterization of new ECM molecules, including matricellular proteins, dermatopontin, and FACIT collagens (Fibril-Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices), further demonstrates our cursory knowledge of the ECM in coordinated wound healing. Critical Issues: The manipulation and augmentation of ECM components in the healing wound is emerging in patient care, as demonstrated by the use of acellular dermal matrices, tissue scaffolds, and wound dressings or topical products bearing ECM proteins such as collagen, hyaluronan (HA), or elastin. Once thought of as neutral structural proteins, these molecules are now known to directly influence many aspects of cellular wound healing. Future Directions: The role that ECM molecules, such as CCN2, osteopontin, and secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine, play in signaling homing of fibroblast progenitor cells to sites of injury invites future research as we continue investigating the heterotopic origin of certain populations of fibroblasts in a healing wound. Likewise, research into differently sized fragments of the same polymeric ECM molecule is warranted as we learn that fragments of molecules such as HA and tenascin-C can have opposing effects on dermal fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are present in both acute and chronic wounds. They play a pivotal role, with their inhibitors, in regulating extracellular matrix degradation and deposition that is essential for wound reepithelialization. The excess protease activity can lead to a chronic nonhealing wound. The timed expression and activation of MMPs in response to wounding are vital for successful wound healing. MMPs are grouped into eight families and display extensive homology within these families. This homology leads in part to the initial failure of MMP inhibitors in clinical trials and the development of alternative methods for modulating the MMP activity. MMP-knockout mouse models display altered wound healing responses, but these are often subtle phenotypic changes indicating the overlapping MMP substrate specificity and inter-MMP compensation. Recent Advances: Recent research has identified several new MMP modulators, including photodynamic therapy, protease-absorbing dressing, microRNA regulation, signaling molecules, and peptides. Critical Issues: Wound healing requires the controlled activity of MMPs at all stages of the wound healing process. The loss of MMP regulation is a characteristic of chronic wounds and contributes to the failure to heal. Future Directions: Further research into how MMPs are regulated should allow the development of novel treatments for wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds impact the quality of life (QoL) of nearly 2.5% of the total population in the United States and the management of wounds has a significant economic impact on health care. Given the aging population, the continued threat of diabetes and obesity worldwide, and the persistent problem of infection, it is expected that chronic wounds will continue to be a substantial clinical, social, and economic challenge. In 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic dramatically disrupted health care worldwide, including wound care. A chronic nonhealing wound (CNHW) is typically correlated with comorbidities such as diabetes, vascular deficits, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. These risk factors make persons with CNHW at high risk for severe, sometimes lethal outcomes if infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pathogen causing COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted several aspects of the wound care continuum, including compliance with wound care visits, prompting alternative approaches (use of telemedicine and creation of videos to help with wound dressing changes among others), and encouraging a do-it-yourself wound dressing protocol and use of homemade remedies/substitutions. Recent Advances: There is a developing interest in understanding how the social determinants of health impact the QoL and outcomes of wound care patients. Furthermore, addressing wound care in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine options in the continuum of care. Future Directions: The economic, clinical, and social impact of wounds continues to rise and requires appropriate investment and a structured approach to wound care, education, and related research.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Injury to the skin provides a unique challenge, as wound healing is a complex and intricate process. Acute wounds have the potential to move from the acute wound to chronic wounds, requiring the physician to have a thorough understanding of outside interventions to bring these wounds back into the healing cascade. Recent Advances: The development of new and effective interventions in wound care remains an area of intense research. Negative pressure wound therapy has undoubtedly changed wound care from this point forward and has proven beneficial for a variety of wounds. Hydroconductive dressings are another category that is emerging with studies underway. Other modalities such as hyperbaric oxygen, growth factors, biologic dressings, skin substitutes, and regenerative materials have also proven efficacious in advancing the wound-healing process through a variety of mechanisms. Critical Issues: There is an overwhelming amount of wound dressings available in the market. This implies the lack of full understanding of wound care and management. The point of using advanced dressings is to improve upon specific wound characteristics to bring it as close to “ideal” as possible. It is only after properly assessing the wound characteristics and obtaining knowledge about available products that the “ideal” dressing may be chosen. Future Directions: The future of wound healing at this point remains unknown. Few high-quality, randomized controlled trials evaluating wound dressings exist and do not clearly demonstrate superiority of many materials or categories. Comparative effectiveness research can be used as a tool to evaluate topical therapy for wound care moving into the future. Until further data emerge, education on the available products and logical clinical thought must prevail.",

    "abstract": "This review highlights the critical role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)1-3 within different phases of wound healing, in particular, late-stage wound healing. It is also very important to identify the TGF-β1-controlling factors involved in slowing down the healing process upon wound epithelialization.TGF-β1, as a growth factor, is a known proponent of dermal fibrosis. Several strategies to modulate or regulate TGF's actions have been thoroughly investigated in an effort to create successful therapies. This study reviews current discourse regarding the many roles of TGF-β1 in wound healing by modulating infiltrated immune cells and the extracellular matrix.It is well established that TGF-β1 functions as a wound-healing promoting factor, and thereby if in excess it may lead to overhealing outcomes, such as hypertrophic scarring and keloid. Thus, the regulation of TGF-β1 in the later stages of the healing process remains as critical issue of which to better understand.One hypothesis is that cell communication is the key to regulate later stages of wound healing. To elucidate the role of keratinocyte/fibroblast cross talk in controlling the later stages of wound healing we need to: (1) identify those keratinocyte-released factors which would function as wound-healing stop signals, (2) evaluate the functionality of these factors in controlling the outcome of the healing process, and (3) formulate topical vehicles for these antifibrogenic factors to improve or even prevent the development of hypertrophic scarring and keloids as a result of deep trauma, burn injuries, and any type of surgical incision.",

    "abstract": "Background: Macrophages (Mφs) participate in wound healing by coordinating inflammatory and angiogenic processes. Mφs respond to environmental cues by adopting either \"classically\" activated (M1) proinflammatory or \"alternatively\" activated (M2a, M2b, M2c, M2d) wound healing phenotypes. The Problem: Mφ polarization is essential for wound healing and aberrations in this process are linked to several pathologies. It is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying Mφ polarization. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: Mφs are categorized as proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory/wound healing (M2). M1 Mφs are observed in initial tissue damage responses, are induced by exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns or endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns, and exhibit increased phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, facilitating innate immunity and wound debridement. M2 Mφs predominate later in repair, express vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and interleukin 10 (IL-10), are activated by varied stimuli, assist in the resolution of inflammation, and promote tissue formation and remodeling. Recent work has characterized a novel \"M2d\" phenotype resulting from adenosine-dependent \"switching\" of M1 Mφs that exhibits a pattern of marker expression that is distinct from canonical IL-4/IL-13–dependent M2a Mφs. Recent studies have demonstrated important roles for specific transcriptional elements in M1 and M2a Mφ polarization, notably members of the interferon regulatory factor family interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF4, respectively. The role of these IRFs in M2d polarization and wound healing remains to be determined. Clinical Care Relevance: Knowledge of microenvironmental signals and molecular mechanisms that mediate Mφ polarization should permit their manipulation to regulate important physiological processes and resolve pathological conditions. Conclusion: Proper Mφ polarization is essential to effective wound healing, and distinct phenotypes, such as the angiogenic M2d Mφ, may be of critical importance to this process. The IRF5 transcription factor has been shown to play a key role in M1 Mφ activation and the Jumonji domain containing-3-IRF4 pathway has been implicated in M2 Mφ activation.",

In general, the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is effective and allows these cells to carry out their primary function of preventing wounds from becoming infected.It is now known that in addition to sterilizing the wound, the weapons used by neutrophils to kill potential pathogens can also cause significant tissue damage to the host. This additional damage can lead to delayed healing and excessive scar formation.Much of the host damage caused by neutrophils results from the activity of proteases secreted by these cells. The clinical significance of this problem is highlighted by numerous studies showing that high levels of neutrophil-derived proteases are associated with chronic, non-healing wounds.Studies are currently being performed to evaluate new ways of counteracting protease activity in chronic wounds. Additional studies will have to be carried out to determine whether neutralizing neutrophil proteases can improve the healing of chronic wounds without sacrificing the ability of neutrophils to eliminate pathogens and risking infection.",

    "abstract": "Although most researches into the changes in skin with age focus on the unwelcome aesthetic aspects of the aging skin, skin deterioration with age is more than a merely cosmetic problem. Although mortality from skin disease is primarily restricted to melanoma, dermatological disorders are ubiquitous in older people with a significant impact on quality of life. The structural and functional deterioration of the skin that occurs with age has numerous clinical presentations, ranging from benign but potentially excruciating disorders like pruritus to the more threatening carcinomas and melanomas.The degenerative changes that occur in the aging skin are increasingly understood at both the molecular and cellular level, facilitating a deeper understanding of the structural and functional deterioration that these changes produce.A loss of both function and structural stability in skin proceeds unavoidably as individuals age, which is the result of both intrinsic and extrinsic processes, which contribute simultaneously to a progressive loss of skin integrity. Intrinsic aging proceeds at a genetically determined pace, primarily caused by the buildup of damaging products of cellular metabolism as well as an increasing biological aging of the cells. Estrogen levels strongly influence skin integrity in women as well; falling levels in midlife, therefore, produce premature aging as compared with similarly aged men. Extrinsic insults from the environment add to the dermatological signs of aging.A deeper understanding of the physiological basis of skin aging will facilitate progress in the treatment of the unwelcome sequelae of aging skin, both cosmetic and pathogenic.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The regeneration of healthy and functional skin remains a huge challenge due to its multilayer structure and the presence of different cell types within the extracellular matrix in an organized way. Despite recent advances in wound care products, traditional therapies based on natural origin compounds, such as plant extracts, honey, and larvae, are interesting alternatives. These therapies offer new possibilities for the treatment of skin diseases, enhancing the access to the healthcare, and allowing overcoming some limitations associated to the modern products and therapies, such as the high costs, the long manufacturing times, and the increase in the bacterial resistance. This article gives a general overview about the recent advances in traditional therapies for skin wound healing, focusing on the therapeutic activity, action mechanisms, and clinical trials of the most commonly used natural compounds. New insights in the combination of traditional products with modern treatments and future challenges in the field are also highlighted. Recent Advances: Natural compounds have been used in skin wound care for many years due to their therapeutic activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cell-stimulating properties. The clinical efficacy of these compounds has been investigated through in vitro and in vivo trials using both animal models and humans. Besides the important progress regarding the development of novel extraction methods, purification procedures, quality control assessment, and treatment protocols, the exact mechanisms of action, side effects, and safety of these compounds need further research. Critical Issues: The repair of skin lesions is one of the most complex biological processes in humans, occurring throughout an orchestrated cascade of overlapping biochemical and cellular events. To stimulate the regeneration process and prevent the wound to fail the healing, traditional therapies and natural products have been used with promising results. Although these products are in general less expensive than the modern treatments, they can be sensitive to the geographic location and season, and exhibit batch-to-batch variation, which can lead to unexpected allergic reactions, side effects, and contradictory clinical results. Future Directions: The scientific evidence for the use of traditional therapies in wound healing indicates beneficial effects in the treatment of different lesions. However, specific challenges remain unsolved. To extend the efficacy and the usage of natural substances in wound care, multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to prove the safety of these products, investigate their side effects, and develop standard controlled trials. The development of good manufacturing practices and regulatory legislation also assume a pivotal role in order to improve the use of traditional therapies by the clinicians and to promote their integration into the national health system. Current trends move to the development of innovative wound care treatments, combining the use of traditional healing agents and modern products/practices, such as nanofibers containing silver nanoparticles, Aloe vera loaded into alginate hydrogels, propolis into dressing films, and hydrogel sheets containing honey.",

    "abstract": "Proteases and their inhibitors contribute to the balance between extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and deposition, creating an equilibrium that is essential for the timely and coordinated healing of cutaneous wounds. However, when this balance is disrupted, wounds are led into a state of chronicity characterized by abundant levels of proteases and decreased levels of protease inhibitors.Researchers have sought to investigate the roles of proteases within both acute and chronic wounds and how the manipulation of protease activity may aid healing. Indeed, numerous wound dressings have been developed that target such proteases in an attempt to promote wound healing.The normal tissue response to injury involves a complex interaction between cells and cellular mediators. In particular, the inflammatory response is augmented in chronic wounds which are characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and proteases. While controlling levels of inflammation and protease expression is a critical part of normal wound healing, elevated and prolonged expression of proteases produced during the inflammatory phase of healing can lead to excessive ECM degradation associated with impaired healing.It seems plausible that future research should aim to investigate the ways in which proteases may be targeted as an alternative therapeutic approach to wound management and to assess the benefits and draw-backs of utilizing wound fluids to assess wound progression in terms of proteolytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Successful treatment of wounds relies on precise control and continuous monitoring of the wound-healing process. Wet or moist treatment of wounds has been shown to promote re-epithelialization and result in reduced scar formation, as compared to treatment in a dry environment.By treating wounds in a controlled wet environment, delivery of antimicrobials, analgesics, other bioactive molecules such as growth factors, as well as cells and micrografts, is allowed. The addition of growth factors or transplantation of cells yields the possibility of creating a regenerative wound microenvironment that favors healing, as opposed to excessive scar formation.Although several manufacturers have conceived products implementing the concept of moist wound healing, there remains a lack of commercial translation of wet wound-healing principles into clinically available products. This can only be mitigated by further research on the topic.The strong evidence pointing to the favorable healing of wounds in a wet or moist environment compared to dry treatment will extend the clinical indications for this treatment. Further advances are required to elucidate by which means this microenvironment can be optimized to improve the healing outcome.",

    "abstract": "The incidence, cost, morbidity, and mortality associated with non-healing of chronic skin wounds are dramatic. With the increasing numbers of people with obesity, chronic medical conditions, and an increasing life expectancy, the healthcare cost of non-healing ulcers has recently been estimated at $25 billion annually in the United States. The role played by bacterial biofilm in chronic wounds has been emphasized in recent years, particularly in the context of the prolongation of the inflammatory phase of repair.Rapid high-throughput genomic approaches have revolutionized the ability to identify and quantify microbial organisms from wounds. Defining bacterial genomes and using genetic approaches to knock out specific bacterial functions, then studying bacterial survival on cutaneous wounds is a promising strategy for understanding which genes are essential for pathogenicity.When an animal sustains a cutaneous wound, understanding mechanisms involved in adaptations by bacteria and adaptations by the host in the struggle for survival is central to development of interventions that favor the host.Characterization of microbiomes of clinically well characterized chronic human wounds is now under way. The use of in vivo models of biofilm-infected cutaneous wounds will permit the study of the mechanisms needed for biofilm formation, persistence, and potential synergistic interactions among bacteria. A more complete understanding of bacterial survival mechanisms and how microbes influence host repair mechanisms are likely to provide targets for chronic wound therapy.",

It facilitates autolytic debridement, reduces pain, reduces scarring, activates collagen synthesis, facilitates and promotes keratinocyte migration over the wound surface, and supports the presence and function of nutrients, growth factors, and other soluble mediators in the wound microenvironment. Recent Advances: Wound dressings can be utilized to create, maintain, and control a moist environment for healing. Moist wound dressings can be divided into films, foams, hydrocolloids, hydrogels, and alginates. We are also including negative pressure wound therapy systems in the moist dressings. Critical Issues: An optimal wound dressing should provide a moist environment and have an optimal water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and absorptive capacity. It should also protect the wound against trauma and contamination and be easy to apply, painless to remove, and esthetically acceptable or even pleasing. Future Directions: Interventions, particularly dressing changes, by medical caregivers are labor intensive and expensive and there should be a continuous effort to reduce their number per week. Smart dressings with integrated microsensors and delivery capabilities that would allow wireless real-time monitoring and treatment of the wound would be very advantageous. This way the state of the wound as well as the wear time of the dressing could be assessed without dressing removal or visit to the wound care center. In addition, an ability to adjust the WVTRs to the exudate level of the wound (or having a large absorptive capacity without changing the WVTR) would be useful. This feature would guarantee an optimal level of hydration of the wound surface throughout the treatment.",

This review aims to highlight and provide readers with an overview of what is currently known about the role of pH and its effect on the ECM and biofilms within healing and nonhealing wounds. Recent Advances: The pH profiles of healthy skin, acute wounds, and chronic wounds differ significantly. Chronic wounds have an alkaline pH whereas healthy skin has a slightly acidic pH. Although there is evidence on the effect of pH on protease production and bacterial proliferation in wounds, there is little evidence to show its effect on ECM synthesis and degradation. Critical Issues: The implications for the complex nature of chronic wounds are that no single treatment is relevant for all wounds, but rather a combination of methodologies must be adopted. It is known that pH of a wound reduces throughout the stages of healing, suggesting that wound pH measurements could be beneficial to identify nonhealing wounds earlier and decide on the most appropriate course of treatment. Future Direction: Wound healing is a very complex process with multiple factors known to play a role. All aspects of the nonhealing wound (defective ECM, pH, microbial invasion, and excess proteases) need to be taken into account when investigating or clinically treating a chronic wound.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Poor wound healing remains a significant health issue for a large number of patients in the United States. The physiologic response to local wound hypoxia plays a critical role in determining the success of the normal healing process. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), as the master regulator of oxygen homeostasis, is an important determinant of healing outcomes. HIF-1 contributes to all stages of wound healing through its role in cell migration, cell survival under hypoxic conditions, cell division, growth factor release, and matrix synthesis throughout the healing process. Recent Advances: Positive regulators of HIF-1, such as prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitors, have been shown to be beneficial in enhancing diabetic ischemic wound closure and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of several human-ischemia-based conditions. Critical Issues: HIF-1 deficiency and subsequent failure to respond to hypoxic stimuli leads to chronic hypoxia, which has been shown to contribute to the formation of nonhealing ulcers. In contrast, overexpression of HIF-1 has been implicated in fibrotic disease through its role in increasing myofibroblast differentiation leading to excessive matrix production and deposition. Both positive and negative regulators of HIF-1 therefore provide important therapeutic targets that can be used to manipulate HIF-1 expression where an excess or deficiency in HIF-1 is known to correlate with pathogenesis. Future Directions: Targeting HIF-1 during wound healing has many important clinical implications for tissue repair. Counteracting the detrimental effects of excessive or deficient HIF-1 signaling by modulating HIF-1 expression may improve future management of poorly healing wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Microorganisms can exist both in the planktonic and biofilm state. Each phenotypic state has a role to play in delaying healing and causing infections of both acute and chronic wounds. However, the virulent biofilm state is the fundamental reason that chronic wounds do not heal in a timely manner. We hypothesize that because microorganisms attach to any surface, biofilms can be found in all chronic wounds. However, it is not the biofilm per se that represents the greatest obstacle to the healing of a chronic wound, but its virulence and pathogenicity. Recent Advances: Numerous studies with animals and humans have identified biofilms in wounds. In particular, these studies have highlighted how biofilms impede host fibroblast development, inflammatory responses, and the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. Despite this, the role biofilms play in affecting the healing of wounds is still vigorously debated. Critical Issues: Clinicians must understand the role that pathogenic biofilms play in impairing the healing of chronic wounds and in increasing the risk for wound infection, with its potentially catastrophic outcomes. The composition of the biofilm, its physiochemical properties, the climaxed indigenous microbiota and their virulence/pathogenicity, microbial numbers and the host's pathophysiology, and immunological fitness will govern the sustainability of a pathogenic biofilm in a wound and its resistance to interventions.

Light-based technology comprises a varied set of modalities of increasing relevance to wound care. While low-level laser (or light) therapy and photodynamic therapy both have wide applications in wound care, this review will concentrate on the use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.UVC (200-280 nm) is highly antimicrobial and can be directly applied to acute wound infections to kill pathogens without unacceptable damage to host tissue. UVC is already widely applied for sterilization of inanimate objects. UVB (280-315 nm) has been directly applied to the wounded tissue to stimulate wound healing, and has been widely used as extracorporeal UV radiation of blood to stimulate the immune system. UVA (315-400 nm) has distinct effects on cell signaling, but has not yet been widely applied to wound care.Penetration of UV light into tissue is limited and optical technology may be employed to extend this limit. UVC and UVB can damage DNA in host cells and this risk must be balanced against beneficial effects. Chronic exposure to UV can be carcinogenic and this must be considered in planning treatments.New high-technology UV sources, such as light-emitting diodes, lasers, and microwave-generated UV plasma are becoming available for biomedical applications. Further study of cellular signaling that occurs after UV exposure of tissue will allow the benefits in wound healing to be better defined.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fibrosis is the endpoint of chronic disease in multiple organs, including the skin, heart, lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys. Pathologic accumulation of fibrotic tissue results in a loss of structural integrity and function, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality. Understanding the pathways governing fibrosis and identifying therapeutic targets within those pathways is necessary to develop novel antifibrotic therapies for fibrotic disease. Recent Advances: Given the connection between inflammation and fibrogenesis, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been a focus of potential antifibrotic therapies because of its well-known role as an anti-inflammatory mediator. Despite the apparent dissimilarity of diseases associated with fibrotic progression, pathways involving IL-10 appear to be a conserved molecular theme. More recently, many groups have worked to develop novel delivery tools for recombinant IL-10, such as hydrogels, and cell-based therapies, such as ex vivo activated macrophages, to directly or indirectly modulate IL-10 signaling. Critical Issues: Some efforts in this area, however, have been stymied by IL-10's pleiotropic and sometimes conflicting effects. A deeper, contextual understanding of IL-10 signaling and its interaction with effector cells, particularly immune cells, will be critical to future studies in the field. Future Directions: IL-10 is clearly a gatekeeper of fibrotic/antifibrotic signaling. The development of novel therapeutics and cell-based therapies that capitalize on targets within the IL-10 signaling pathway could have far-reaching implications for patients suffering from the consequences of organ fibrosis.",

Cartilage then serves as a template for additional bone formation through the process of endochondral ossification.Endogenous MSCs that contribute to healing are primarily derived from the periosteum, endosteum, and marrow cavity, but also may be contributed from the overlying muscle or through systemic circulation, depending on the type of injury. A variety of growth factor signaling pathways, including BMP, Wnt, and Notch signaling, influence MSC proliferation and differentiation. These MSCs can be therapeutically manipulated to promote differentiation. Furthermore, MSCs can be harvested, cultivated, and delivered to promote bone healing.Pharmacologically manipulating the number and differentiation capacity of endogenous MSCs is one potential therapeutic approach to improve healing; however, ideal agents to influence signaling pathways need to be developed and additional therapeutics that activate endogenous MSCs are needed.

It explores aspects of dysregulation of individual innate immune elements known to compromise wound repair and promote nonhealing wounds. Understanding the key mechanisms whereby wound healing fails will provide seed concepts for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Recent Advances: Our understanding of the complex interactions of the innate immune system in wound healing has significantly improved, particularly in our understanding of the role of antimicrobials and peptides and the nature of the switch from inflammatory to reparative processes. This takes place against an emerging understanding of the relationship between human cells and commensal bacteria in the skin. Critical Issues: It is well established and accepted that early local inflammatory mediators in the wound bed function as an immunological vehicle to facilitate immune cell infiltration and microbial clearance upon injury to the skin barrier. Both impaired and excessive innate immune responses can promote nonhealing wounds. It appears that the switch from the inflammatory to the proliferative phase is tightly regulated and mediated, at least in part, by a change in macrophages. Defining the factors that initiate the switch in such macrophage phenotypes and functions is the subject of multiple investigations. Future Directions: The review highlights processes that may be useful targets for further investigation, particularly the switch from M1 to M2 macrophages that appears to be critical as dysregulation of this switch occurs during defective wound healing.",

Over 90% of chronic wounds contain bacteria and fungi living within a biofilm construct.Each aggregation of microbes creates a distinct biofilm with differing characteristics so that a clinical approach has to be tailored to the specifics of a given biofilm. Defining the characteristics of that biofilm and then designing a therapeutic option particular to that biofilm is currently being defined.Biofilm becomes resistant to therapeutic maneuvers at 48-96 h after formation. By repeatedly attacking it on a regular schedule, one forces biofilm to reattach and reform during which time it is susceptible to antibiotics and host defenses. Identifying the multiple bacteria and fungi that make up a specific biofilm using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows directed therapeutic maneuvers such as application of specific topical antibiotics and biocides to increase the effectiveness of the debridement.Most chronic wounds contain biofilm that perpetuate the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Combining debridement with using PCR to identify the bacteria and fungi within the biofilm allows for more targeted therapeutic maneuvers to eliminate a given biofilm.Therapeutic options in addition to debridement are currently being evaluated to address biofilm. Using PCR to direct adjunctive therapeutic maneuvers may increase the effectiveness of addressing biofilm in a chronic wound.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Myofibroblasts are responsible for wound closure that occurs in healed acute wounds. However, their actions can result in disfiguring scar contractures, compromised organ function, and a tumor promoting stroma. Understanding the mechanisms regulating their contractile machinery, gene expression, and lifespan is essential to develop new therapies to control their function. Recent Advances: Mechanical stress and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) regulate myofibroblast differentiation from mesenchymal progenitors. As these precursor cells differentiate, they assemble a contractile apparatus to generate the force used to contract wounds. The mechanisms by which mechanical stress promote expression of contractile genes through the TGF-β1 and serum response factor pathways and offer therapeutic targets to limit myofibroblast function are being elucidated. Critical Issues: Emerging evidence suggests that the integration of mechanical cues with intracellular signaling pathways is critical to myofibroblast function via its effects on gene expression, cellular contraction, and paracrine signaling with neighboring cells. In addition, while apoptosis is clearly one pathway that can limit myofibroblast lifespan, recent data suggest that pathogenic myofibroblasts can become senescent and adopt a more beneficial phenotype, or may revert to a quiescent state, thereby limiting their function. Future Directions: Given the important role that myofibroblasts play in pathologies as disparate as cutaneous scarring, organ fibrosis, and tumor progression, knowledge gained in the areas of intracellular signaling networks, mechanical signal transduction, extracellular matrix biology, and cell fate will support efforts to develop new therapies with a wide impact.",

TGFβ signaling is important for re-epithelialization, inflammation, angiogenesis, and granulation tissue formation during wound healing. This review will discuss the most important findings regarding the role of TGFβ in epidermal maintenance and its restoration after injury. Recent Advances: Latest findings on the role of TGFβ signaling in normal and impaired wound healing, including the role of TGFβ pathway in tissue regeneration observed in super-healer animal models, will be reviewed. Critical Issues: The TGFβ pathway is attenuated in nonhealing wounds. Observed suppression of TGFβ signaling in chronic ulcers may contribute to the loss of tissue homeostasis and the inability of keratinocytes to migrate and close a wound. Future Directions: A better understanding of TGFβ signaling may provide new insights not only in the normal epithelialization process, but also in tissue regeneration. Future studies focused on TGFβ-mediated crosstalk between multiple cell types involved in wound healing may lead to development of novel therapeutic advances for chronic wounds.",

Despite this a number of antibiofilm formulations and technologies incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) have demonstrated efficacy on in vitro biofilms. The aim of this article is to critically review EDTA, in particular tetrasodium EDTA (tEDTA), as a potential antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent, in its own right, for use in skin and wound care. EDTA's synergism with other antimicrobials and surfactants will also be discussed. Recent Advances: The use of EDTA as a potentiating and sensitizing agent is not a new concept. However, currently the application of EDTA, specifically tEDTA as a stand-alone antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent, and its synergistic combination with other antimicrobials to make a \"multi-pronged\" approach to biofilm control is being explored. Critical Issues: As pathogenic biofilms in the wound increase infection risk, tEDTA could be considered as a potential \"stand-alone\" antimicrobial/antibiofilm agent or in combination with other antimicrobials, for use in both the prevention and treatment of biofilms found within abiotic (the wound dressing) and biotic (wound bed) environments. The ability of EDTA to chelate and potentiate the cell walls of bacteria and destabilize biofilms by sequestering calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron makes it a suitable agent for use in the management of biofilms. Future Direction: tEDTA's excellent inherent antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity and proven synergistic and permeating ability results in a very beneficial agent, which could be used for the development of future antibiofilm technologies.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen is vital for healing wounds. It is intricately involved in numerous biological processes including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and protein synthesis, which are required for restoration of tissue function and integrity. Adequate wound tissue oxygenation can trigger healing responses and favorably influence the outcomes of other treatment modalities.Chronic ischemic wounds fail to heal appropriately secondary to extreme hypoxia that leads to cellular demise. Wound tissue hypoxia is typically greater at the center of the wound. Accordingly, oxygen requirements of the regenerating tissue will vary.As oxygen levels decrease within the wound, cell response mechanisms (hypoxia inducible factor [HIF]) trigger the transcription of genes that promote cell survival and angiogenesis. HIF stabilizers are currently being tested to determine wound healing potential. Clinically, topical oxygen therapy (TOT) has been proved as an effective therapeutic modality for chronic wounds. TOT is reputed to have several advantages over hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Namely, TOT has a lower risk of oxygen toxicity, it is less expensive and is relatively easy to apply to target areas.Wound tissue oxygen is necessary for appropriate wound healing; however, the relative complexity of the healing process requires a multifaceted approach for successful healing outcomes. A key component of this multifaceted approach should be specific oxygen dosing as a function of tissue hypoxia.New treatment approaches that exploit cell hypoxia sensing and response mechanisms and that enable the precise application of oxygen therapy to hypoxic areas of regenerating tissue are very promising.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Growth factors are very promising molecules for the treatment of skin wounds. However, their translation to clinical use has been seriously limited, facing issues related to safety and cost-effectiveness. These problems may derive from the fact that growth factors are used at vastly supra-physiological levels without optimized delivery systems. Recent Advances: The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a fundamental role in coordinating growth factor signaling. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which the ECM modulates growth factor activity is key for designing efficient growth factor-based therapies. Recently, several growth factor-binding domains have been discovered within various ECM proteins, and growth factor delivery systems integrating these ECM growth factor-binding domains showed promising results in animal models of skin wound healing. Moreover, a novel strategy consisting of engineering growth factors to target endogenous ECM could substantially enhance their efficacy, even when used at low doses. Critical Issues: Optimal delivery of growth factors often requires complex engineered biomaterial matrices, which can face regulatory issues for clinical translation. To simplify delivery systems and render strategies more applicable, growth factors can be engineered to optimally function with clinically approved biomaterials or with endogenous ECM present at the delivery site. Future Directions: Further development and clinical trials will reveal whether growth factor-based therapies can be used as main therapeutic approaches for skin wound healing. The future impact of these therapies will depend on our capacity to deliver growth factors more precisely, to improve efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Postnatal wounds heal with characteristic scar formation. In contrast, the mid-gestational fetus is capable of regenerative healing, which results in wound repair that is indistinguishable from uninjured skin. However, the underlying mechanisms of fetal regenerative phenotype are unknown. Recent Advances: The potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), plays an essential role in the ability of the fetus to heal regeneratively and has been shown to recapitulate scarless healing in postnatal tissue. IL-10's ability to facilitate regenerative healing is likely a result of pleiotropic effects, through regulation of the inflammatory response, as well as novel roles as a regulator of the extracellular matrix, fibroblast cellular function, and endothelial progenitor cells. Overexpression of IL-10 using a variety of methods has been demonstrated to recapitulate the fetal regenerative phenotype in post-natal tissue, in conjunction with promising results of Phase II clinical trials using recombinant IL-10. Critical Issues: Successful wound healing is a complex process that requires coordination of multiple growth factors, cell types, and extracellular cellular matrix components. IL-10 has been demonstrated to be critical in the fetus' intrinsic ability to heal without scars, and, further, can induce scarless healing in postnatal tissue. The mechanisms through which IL-10 facilitates this regeneration are likely the result of IL-10's pleiotropic effects. Efforts to develop IL-10 as an anti-scarring agent have demonstrated promising results. Future Directions: Further studies on the delivery, including dose, route, and timing, are required in order to successfully translate these promising findings from in vitro studies and animal models into clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Significance: Regulation of cell adhesions during tissue repair is fundamentally important for cell migration, proliferation, and protein production. All cells interact with extracellular matrix proteins with cell surface integrin receptors that convey signals from the environment into the nucleus, regulating gene expression and cell behavior. Integrins also interact with a variety of other proteins, such as growth factors, their receptors, and proteolytic enzymes. Re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation are crucially dependent on the temporospatial function of multiple integrins. This review explains how integrins function in wound repair. Recent Advances: Certain integrins can activate latent transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) that modulates wound inflammation and granulation tissue formation. Dysregulation of TGF-β1 function is associated with scarring and fibrotic disorders. Therefore, these integrins represent targets for therapeutic intervention in fibrosis. Critical Issues: Integrins have multifaceted functions and extensive crosstalk with other cell surface receptors and molecules. Moreover, in aberrant healing, integrins may assume different functions, further increasing the complexity of their functionality. Discovering and understanding the role that integrins play in wound healing provides an opportunity to identify the mechanisms for medical conditions, such as excessive scarring, chronic wounds, and even cancer. Future Directions: Integrin functions in acute and chronic wounds should be further addressed in models better mimicking human wounds. Application of any products in acute or chronic wounds will potentially alter integrin functions that need to be carefully considered in the design.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The skin is a complex and dynamic organ that performs several vital functions. The maturation process of the skin starts at birth with the adaption of the skin to the comparatively dry environment compared to the in utero milieu. This adaptive flexibility results in the unique properties of infant skin. To deliver appropriate care to infant skin, it is necessary to understand that it is evolving with unique characteristics. Recent Advances: The role of biophysical noninvasive techniques in the assessment of skin development underlines the importance of an objective evaluation of skin physiology parameters. Skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, and pH values are measurable with specific instruments that give us an accurate and reproducible assessment during infant skin maturation. The recording of these values, following standard measurement procedures, allows us to evaluate the integrity of the skin barrier and to monitor the functionality of the maturing skin over time. Critical Issues: During the barrier development, impaired skin function makes the skin vulnerable to chemical damage, microbial infections, and skin diseases, possibly compromising the general health of the infant. Preterm newborns, during the first weeks of life, have an even less developed skin barrier and, therefore, are even more at risk. Thus, it is extremely important to evaluate the risk of infection, skin breakdown, topical agent absorption, and the risk of thermoregulation failure. Future Directions: Detailed and objective evaluations of infant skin maturation are necessary to improve infant skin care. The results of these evaluations should be formed into general protocols that will allow doctors and caregivers to give more personalized care to full-term newborns, preterm newborns, and infants.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The re-epithelialization of wounded skin requires the rapid and coordinated migration of keratinocytes (KC) into the wound bed. Almost immediately after wounding, cells present at or attracted to the wound site begin to secrete a complex milieu of growth factors. These growth factors exert mitogenic and motogenic effects on KCs, inducing the rapid proliferation and migration of KCs at the wound edge. Recent Advances: New roles for growth factors in KC biology are currently being discovered and investigated. This review will highlight the growth factors, particularly transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7), FGF-10, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which have conclusively been shown to be the most motogenic for KCs. Critical Issues: The cellular and molecular heterogeneity of wounded tissue makes establishing direct relationships between specific growth factors and KC migration difficult in situ. The absence of this complexity in simplified in vitro experimental models of migration makes the clinical relevance of the results obtained from these in vitro studies ambiguous. Future Directions: Deciphering the relationship between growth factors and KC migration is critical for understanding the process of wound healing in normal and disease states. Insights into the basic science of the effects of growth factors on KC migration will hopefully lead to the development of new therapies to treat acute and chronic wounds.",

Older individuals are predisposed to wound infection, repeated trauma, and the development of chronic wounds. However, a complete understanding of how the attributes of aging skin affect the wound healing process has remained elusive. Recent Advances: A variety of studies have demonstrated that the dermal matrix becomes thinner, increasingly crosslinked, and fragmented with advanced age. These structural changes, as well as an increase in cell senescence, result in altered collagen fiber remodeling and increased stiffness. Studies combining mechanical testing with advanced imaging techniques are providing new insights into the relationships between these age-related changes. Emerging research into the mechanobiology of aging and the wound healing process indicate that the altered mechanical environment of aged skin may have a significant effect on age-related delays in healing. Critical Issues: The interpretation and synthesis of clinical studies is confounded by the effects of common comorbidities that also contribute to the development of chronic wounds. A lack of quantitative biomarkers of wound healing and age-related changes makes understanding structure–function relationships during the wound healing process challenging. Future Directions: Additional work is needed to establish quantitative and mechanistic relationships among age-related changes in the skin microstructure, mechanical function, and the cellular responses to wound healing.",

However, this methodology is limited by its sampling of only specific tissue at a single time point and provides no information about how exogenously transplanted MSCs home to the wound environment.Most systemically injected MSCs initially become entrapped within the lungs before migrating out to the liver and spleen in the normal state. When an injury is present, after the initial lung entrapment, MSCs migrate in response to inflammatory mediators and home to sites of wounding.As MSC-based wound therapies continue to advance toward clinical trials, the availability of noninvasive methods to track cells after injection into patients affords the opportunity to monitor stem cell behavior post-transplantation.MSCs have demonstrated great promise as an emerging therapeutic for wound management.

    "abstract": "Significance: Macrophages are invariably present and tightly regulate all phases of adult wound healing, including inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and matrix deposition with the unavoidable outcome of scar formation. In response to environmental cues, macrophages mount a \"classical\" pro-inflammatory M1 activation as opposed to the \"alternative\" M2 phenotype, with wound macrophages having long been viewed as M2 macrophages. Recent Advances: Recent studies rather point to large temporal and phenotypic variations of wound macrophages subsets. Therefore, a functional classification of macrophages according to wound-healing phases appears to better meet the in vivo complexity. In an ideal but simplistic scenario grossly reflecting normal wound healing, initial tissue injury induces inflammatory M1-like macrophages, which, upon engulfment of apoptotic neutrophils or in response to other inflammation dampening stimuli, switch toward anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages and further toward growth factor-producing pro-fibrotic M2a-like macrophages. Although not yet documented for skin wounds, a subset of metalloproteinase-producing fibrolytic M2c-like macrophages may contribute to fibrosis resolution. Recent work identified a diversity of novel macrophage phenotypes associated with normal and pathologic wound healing, most of them ranging out of the M1/M2 paradigm. Iron-overloaded M1-like macrophages represent such a novel phenotypic subset driving the non-healing state of chronic venous leg ulcers. Critical Issues: Despite growing evidence that macrophage dysfunctions are, at least in part, responsible for pathologic wound healing, including nonhealing wounds and excessive scar formation, these are hardly specifically addressed even by modern therapeutic strategies. Future Directions: If characterized in sufficient detail, distinct macrophage subsets and their impaired functions provide ideal targets for improving wound healing.",

Major processes in neovascularization include (i) growth-promoting or survival factors, (ii) proteolytic enzymes, (iii) activators of multiple differentiated and progenitor cell types, and (iv) permissible microenvironments. A central aim of wound healing research is to “convert” chronic, disease-impaired wounds into those that will heal. The problem: Reduced ability to re-establish a blood supply to the injury site can ultimately lead to wound chronicity. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: (1) Human fetal endothelial progenitor cells can stimulate wound revascularization and repair following injury, as demonstrated in a novel mouse model of diabetic ischemic healing. (2) Advances in bioengineering reveal exciting alternatives by which wound repair may be facilitated via the creation of vascularized microfluidic networks within organ constructs created ex vivo for wound implantation. (3) A “personalized” approach to regenerative medicine may be enabled by the identification of protein components present within individual wound beds, both chronic and acute. Clinical Care Relevance: Despite the development of numerous therapies, impaired angiogenesis and wound chronicity remain significant healthcare problems. As such, innovations in enhancing wound revascularization would lead to significant advances in wound healing therapeutics and patient care. Conclusion: Insights into endothelial progenitor cell biology together with developments in the field of tissue engineering and molecular diagnostics should not only further advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating wound repair but also offer innovative solutions to promote the healing of chronic and acute wounds in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Over the years, it has become clear that, in addition to performing their regular duties in immune defense, the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are important regulators of the complex series of events that lead to wound healing. Immune cells modulate wound healing by promoting cellular cross-talk; they secrete signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. In line with the major effort in wound healing research to find efficient therapeutic agents for the constantly increasing number of patients with chronic wounds, findings regarding the contributions of innate and adaptive immune responses to the re-epithelialization of damaged skin may bring novel therapeutics. Recent Advances: Increasing evidence suggests that induction of the adaptive immune response requires activation of innate immunity and that there is a dependent relationship between the two systems. Consequently, the bridge between the innate and the acquired immune systems has become an area of emerging exploration. It is clear that a better understanding of the epithelial cells (keratinocytes), immune cells, and mechanisms that contribute to an effective wound healing process is necessary so that new strategies for successful wounds treatment can be devised. Critical Issues: A greater understanding of the biology of skin innate and adaptive immune cells during wound epithelialization may have an impact on development of novel strategies for significant improvements in the quality of tissue repair. Future Directions: Future studies should clarify the importance of particular molecules and mechanisms utilized for development and functions of skin-resident γδT and Langerhans cells, as well as identify therapeutic targets for manipulation of these cells to combat epithelial diseases.",

The development of new therapies for enhancing wound healing has included the use of EGF. In addition, EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) have become a therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer. Thus, therapies targeting EGF/EGFR are useful for the treatment of both cutaneous wounds and cancer.Identification of EGFR as a regulator of normal and pathological cell function has allowed for the development of EGFRis for the treatment of cancer and topical administration of EGF to enhance wound healing.The use of EGFRi has emerged as an option for metastatic cancers. These drugs induce dermatological toxicity, a papulopustular rash that is pruritic and painful; chronic use may negatively impact wound healing. Currently, there is no standard therapy to alleviate the side effects caused by EGFRi administration except to reduce or eliminate EGFRi usage. Therefore, side effects from these drugs should be taken into consideration on patients prone to develop chronic wounds and with cutaneous injuries.There is a need for adjunctive treatment to eliminate dermatological toxicity from EGFRi use. The development of new downstream targets of EGFR may be a rational strategy to reduce potential cutaneous side effects and provide a better strategy for the treatment of cancer. Until then, the topical use of EGF could be used to ameliorate dermatological lesions caused by EGFRi.",

The standard of care in the clinic relies upon cultivation-dependent methods to identify microorganisms. These assays are biased toward microorganisms that thrive in isolation under laboratory conditions. Recent Advances: Significant advances in genomic technologies have enabled less-biased, culture-independent approaches to characterize microbial communities, or microbiomes. The aggregate sequencing and analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes has demonstrated that cultures under-represent true microbial diversity and load. Critical Issues: Despite recent advances that enable culture-independent analyses of microbiomes, those organisms that are important in impaired healing remain ambiguous. Inconsistent findings across various studies highlight the need to characterize microbiomes of chronic wounds with homogenous etiology to determine differences in microbiomes that may be driven by the wound environment and that may affect wound outcomes. Rigorous analyses of wound microbiomes in light of the three dimensions of bioburden (microbial diversity, microbial load, and pathogenic organisms), clinical metadata, and wound outcomes will be a significant step forward in our quest to understand the role of microorganisms in impaired healing. Future Directions: Longitudinal studies employing serial sampling are needed to appreciate the role of the dynamic microbial community in chronic wound healing. The value of clinical metadata needs to be examined as potential biomarkers of problematic microbiota and wound outcomes. Lastly, better characterization and understanding of wound microbiomes will open avenues for improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the nonhealing wound.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Natural, endogenous electric fields (EFs) and currents arise spontaneously after wounding of many tissues, especially epithelia, and are necessary for normal healing. This wound electrical activity is a long-lasting and regulated response. Enhancing or inhibiting this electrical activity increases or decreases wound healing, respectively. Cells that are responsible for wound closure such as corneal epithelial cells or skin keratinocytes migrate directionally in EFs of physiological magnitude. However, the mechanisms of how the wound electrical response is initiated and regulated remain unclear. Recent Advances: Wound EFs and currents appear to arise by ion channel up-regulation and redistribution, which are perhaps triggered by an intracellular calcium wave or cell depolarization. We discuss the possibility of stimulation of wound healing via pharmacological enhancement of the wound electric signal by stimulation of ion pumping. Critical Issues: Chronic wounds are a major problem in the elderly and diabetic patient. Any strategy to stimulate wound healing in these patients is desirable. Applying electrical stimulation directly is problematic, but pharmacological enhancement of the wound signal may be a promising strategy. Future Directions: Understanding the molecular regulation of wound electric signals may reveal some fundamental mechanisms in wound healing. Manipulating fluxes of ions and electric currents at wounds might offer new approaches to achieve better wound healing and to heal chronic wounds.",

An ongoing challenge for cell-based therapies is achieving effective and optimal targeted delivery and engraftment at the site of injury. Contributing to this challenge is our incomplete understanding of endogenous MSC homing to sites of injury. Recent Advances: Chemokines and their receptors are now recognized as important mediators of stem cell homing. To date, the most studied chemokine-chemokine receptor axis in MSC homing to wounds is CXCL12-CXCR4 but recent work suggests that CCL27-CCR10 and CCL21-CCR7 may also be involved. Critical Issues: Strategies to enhance chemokine-mediated MSC homing to wounds are using a variety of approaches to amplify the chemokine signal at the wound site and/or overexpress specific chemokine receptors on the surface of the MSC. Future Directions: Harnessing chemokine signaling may enhance the therapeutic effects of stem cell therapy by increasing the number of both exogenous and endogenous stem cells recruited to the site of injury. Alternatively, chemokine-based therapies directly targeting endogenous stem cells may circumvent the need for the time-consuming and costly isolation and expansion of autologous stem cells prior to therapeutic administration.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Angiogenesis plays a critical role in wound healing. A defect in the formation of a neovasculature induces ulcer formation. One of the challenges faced by the clinician when devising strategies to promote healing of chronic wounds is the initiation of angiogenesis and the formation of a stable vasculature to support tissue regeneration. Understanding the molecular factors regulating angiogenesis during wound healing will lead to better therapies for healing chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Classically, chronic wounds are treated with debridement to remove inhibitory molecules to reestablish angiogenesis and normal wound healing. The addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, becaplermin) has shown some promise as an adjunctive therapy, but better therapies are still needed. Current treatment strategies include investigating the outcome of augmenting cytokines locally to reduce the inflammatory response and promote angiogenesis. Critical Issues: The failure of wounds to form a new vasculature results in the inability of the wound to fully heal, and thus may develop into a chronic ulcer if left untreated. Inhibition of neovascularization commonly results from an overactive inflammatory response that includes an excessive chemokine response. Therefore, understanding how the chemokine response regulates neoangiogenesis will enhance our ability to develop new treatment strategies to improve neovascularization and wound healing. Future Directions: The ability to regulate the chemokine environment in chronic wounds may enhance the development of the neovasculature to reduce invasive treatments and enhance wound healing. Either inhibiting chemokines that promote a chronic inflammatory response or increasing the levels of proangiogenic chemokines may enhance angiogenesis in chronic wounds.",

A variety of metabolic and physical causes can lead to a diversity of chronic ulcer types, including diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs).A wide variety of technologies have been developed to treat chronic wounds, with varying levels of success. Depending upon the type and severity of the wound being treated, treatments may include systemic or local antibiotic therapy, application of fillers such as collagen sponges, use of negative wound pressure, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, application of select growth factors, advanced wound dressings, and more recently, the use of cell-based tissue-engineered products.Dermagraft® is a sterile, cryopreserved, human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute generated by the culture of neonatal dermal fibroblasts onto a bioabsorbable polyglactin mesh scaffold.

However, controversy exists with respect to the origin, identification, and contributions of the EPCs to neovascularization, necessitating further study. Recent Advances: Bone marrow (BM) or circulating cells expressing cd133/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 include those with endothelial progenitor capacity. Increasing evidence suggests that there are additional BM-derived (myeloid; mesenchymal cells) and non-BM-derived (peripheral and cord-blood; tissue-resident) cell populations which also give rise to endothelial cells (ECs) and contribute to re-endothelialization and growth factor release after ischemia and tissue injury. Currently, EPCs are being used as diagnostic markers for the assessment of cardiovascular and tumor risk/progression. Techniques aimed at enhancing ex vivo expansion and the therapeutic potential of these cells are being optimized. Critical Issues: Mobilization and EPC-mediated neovascularization are critically regulated. Stimulatory (growth factors, statins, and exercise) or inhibitory factors (obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular diseases) modulate EPC numbers and function. Recruitment and incorporation of EPCs require a coordinated sequence of signaling events, including adhesion, migration (by integrins), and chemoattraction. Finally, EPCs differentiate into ECs and/or secrete angiogenic growth factors. These cells are highly plastic, and depending on the microenvironment and presence of other cells, EPCs transdifferentiate and/or undergo cell fusion and become cells of a different lineage. Therefore, in vitro culture conditions should be optimized to mimic the in vivo milieu to fully characterize the biological function and contribution of EPCs to postnatal vasculogenesis. Future Directions: Advances in characterization of the EPC biology and enhancement of EPC functions are required. In addition, innovative tissue-engineered carrier matrices that permit embedding of EPCs and provide optimal conditions for EPC survival and endothelial outgrowth will further contribute to EPC-mediated therapeutic applications in wound healing and ischemia repair.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Laminins are complex extracellular macromolecules that are major players in the control of a variety of core cell processes, including regulating rates of cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Laminins, and related extracellular matrix components, have essential roles in tissue homeostasis; however, during wound healing, the same proteins are critical players in re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Understanding how these proteins influence cell behavior in these different conditions holds great potential in identifying new strategies to enhance normal wound closure or to treat chronic/nonhealing wounds. Recent Advances: Laminin-derived bioactive peptides and, more recently, laminin-peptide conjugated scaffolds, have been designed to improve tissue regeneration after injuries. These peptides have been shown to be effective in decreasing inflammation and granulation tissue, and in promoting re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and cell migration. Critical Issues: Although there is now a wealth of knowledge concerning laminin form and function, there are still areas of some controversy. These include the relative contribution of two laminin-based adhesive devices (focal contacts and hemidesmosomes) to the re-epithelialization process, the impact and implications of laminin proteolytic processing, and the importance of laminin polymer formation on cell behavior. In addition, the roles in wound healing of the laminin-related proteins, netrins, and LaNts are still to be fully defined. Future Directions: The future of laminin-based therapeutics potentially lies in the bioengineering of specific substrates to support laminin deposition for ex vivo expansion of autologous cells for graft formation and transplantation.

    "abstract": "Objective: Chronically ill patients heal recalcitrant ulcerative wounds more slowly. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) play an important role in tissue regeneration and exosomes secreted by hADSC contribute to their paracrine signaling. In addition to cytokines, lipids and growth factors, hADSC secrete mRNA, miRNA, and long noncoding (lnc) RNA into exosomes. In this study we examined the role of lncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), an abundant lncRNA in exosomes from conditioned media (CM), on cell migration and ischemic wound healing. Approach: CM and isolated exosomes from hADSC were applied to human dermal fibroblast (HDF) in scratch assays and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assays. CM was also applied to a rat model of ischemic wound healing and wound closure was followed. Results: CM stimulated cell migration of HDFs in vitro by 48%. CM stimulated the closure of ischemic wounds in a rat model 50% faster than unconditioned media. The depletion of MALAT1 in adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) CM significantly reduced cell migration. Since MALAT1 is secreted into exosomes, a purified population of exosomes was applied to HDF where they enhanced cell migration in a similar manner to FGF-2 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in ECIS wound healing assays. The uptake of exosomes by HDF was shown using dynasore, an inhibitor that blocks clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Depletion of MALAT1 in hADSC with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in exosomes without MALAT1. These exosomes had an effect similar to the unconditioned, control media in ECIS assays. Innovation: Exosomes contain lncRNA MALAT1 and other factors that have the potential to stimulate HDF cell migration and angiogenesis involved in wound healing without applying stem cells to wounds. Conclusion: Our results show the potential of using topically applied ADSC-derived exosomes containing MALAT1 for treating ischemic wounds. This allows for harnessing the power of stem cell paracrine signaling capabilities without applying the cells.",

The number of patients with nonhealing wounds keeps increasing worldwide due to an ever-aging population, increasing number of obese and diabetic patients, and cardiovascular disease.

Therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is attractive due to their differentiating potential, their immunomodulating properties, and their paracrine effects.

However, in spite of these advances, the percentage of complete wound closure in most clinical situations is around 50–60%. Moreover, there is a high rate of wound recurrence.

However, there are some potential limitations to successful MSC therapy. These limitations include the need to improve cell delivery methods, cell viability, heterogeneity in MSC preparations, and suboptimal wound bed preparation. Further large, controlled clinical trials are needed to establish the safety of MSCs before widespread clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Infections can significantly delay the healing process in chronic wounds, placing an enormous economic burden on health care resources. Identification of infection biomarkers and imaging modalities to observe and quantify them has seen progress over the years. Recent Advances: Traditionally, clinicians determine the presence of infection through visual observation of wounds and confirm their diagnosis through wound culture. Many laboratory markers, including C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, presepsin, and bacterial protease activity, have been quantified to assist diagnosis of infection. Moreover, imaging modalities like plain radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, spatial frequency domain imaging, thermography, autofluorescence imaging, and biosensors have emerged for real-time wound infection diagnosis and showed their unique advantages in deeper wound infection diagnosis. Critical Issues: While traditional diagnostic approaches provide valuable information, they are time-consuming and depend on clinicians' experiences. There is a need for noninvasive wound infection diagnostics that are highly specific, rapid, and accurate, and do not require extensive training. Future Directions: While innovative diagnostics utilizing various imaging instrumentation are being developed, new biomarkers have been investigated as potential indicators for wound infection. Products may be developed to either qualitatively or quantitatively measure these biomarkers. This review summarizes and compares all available diagnostics for wound infection, including those currently used in clinics and still under development. This review could serve as a valuable resource for clinicians treating wound infections as well as patients and wound care providers who would like to be informed of the recent developments.",

Is biofilm formation a cause of these complications, a step toward them, or a signal that unresolved factors injuring tissue or delaying healing are setting the stage for biofilm formation, infection, and healing delay? To qualify biofilms for use in informing clinical practice decisions, biofilm characteristics supporting those decisions need standardized definitions and valid evidence that they predict or diagnose healing or infection outcomes. Literature searches of relevant terms reviewed biofilm definitions and validation of their role in predicting and diagnosing delayed wound healing or infection. Future Directions: Further research is needed to provide a rapid accurate technique to identify and characterize biofilms in ways that optimize their validity in diagnosing or screening patient risk of infection or delayed healing and to inform clinical decisions.

Unfortunately, malnutrition is widespread in our geriatric patients even in nursing homes in developed countries. Attention to basic nutrition and providing appropriate supplements may assist in the healing of our chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Recent research has revealed the epidemiology of malnutrition in developed countries, the similarities to malnutrition in developing countries, and some of the physiologic and sociologic causes for this problem. More information is now available on the biochemical effects of nutrient deficiency and supplementation with macronutrients and micronutrients. In some cases, administration of isolated nutrients beyond recommended amounts for healthy individuals may have a pharmacologic effect to help wounds heal. Critical Issues: Much of the knowledge of the nutritional support of chronic wounds is based on information that has been obtained from trauma management. Due to the demographic differences of the patients and differences in the physiology of acute and chronic wounds, it is not logical to assume that all aspects of nutritional support are identical in these patient groups. Before providing specific nutritional supplements, appropriate assessments of patient general nutritional status and the reasons for malnutrition must be obtained or specific nutrient supplementation will not be utilized. Future Directions: Future research must concentrate on the biochemical and physiologic differences of the acute and chronic wounds and the interaction with specific supplements, such as antioxidants, vitamin A, and vitamin D.",

    "abstract": "Normal wound healing progresses through a series of overlapping phases, all of which are coordinated and regulated by a variety of molecules, including chemokines. Because these regulatory molecules play roles during the various stages of healing, alterations in their presence or function can lead to dysregulation of the wound-healing process, potentially leading to the development of chronic, nonhealing wounds.A discovery that chemokines participate in a variety of disease conditions has propelled the study of these proteins to a level that potentially could lead to new avenues to treat disease. Their small size, exposed termini, and the fact that their only modifications are two disulfide bonds make them excellent targets for manipulation. In addition, because they bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), they are highly amenable to pharmacological modulation.Chemokines are multifunctional, and in many situations, their functions are highly dependent on the microenvironment. Moreover, each specific chemokine can bind to several GPCRs to stimulate the function, and both can function as monomers, homodimers, heterodimers, and even oligomers. Activation of one receptor by any single chemokine can lead to desensitization of other chemokine receptors, or even other GPCRs in the same cell, with implications for how these proteins or their receptors could be used to manipulate function.Investment in better understanding of the functions of chemokines and their receptors in a local context can reveal new ways for therapeutic intervention. Understanding how different chemokines can activate the same receptor and vice versa could identify new possibilities for drug development based on their heterotypic interactions.",

To investigate cell properties, we used amniotic fluid to augment both adult and fetal fibroblast mitogenic activities, including DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Preincubation by both bFGF receptor blocker and anti-bFGF antibody significantly decreases proliferative activity in both adult and fetal skin fibroblasts.Adult wound healing, to some extent, demonstrates scar formation, leading to unfavorable clinical mismatch of tissue texture and color and causing stiffness. bFGF may improve the outcome of wound healing by normalizing the tissue texture and color to the adjacent intact skin and optimally enhancing wound healing.bFGF activates ERK and Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in both adult and fetal skin fibroblasts, which suggests that bFGF in amniotic fluid plays the most major role in cell proliferation. Application of bFGF from an early wounding stage may lead to better fibroblast proliferation and DNA synthesis through the process of ERK/Akt phosphorylation.",

Although deficiencies in certain nutrients have long been known to impair healing, supplementation of specific immune modulating nutrients has not consistently yielded improvements in wound healing. Still, the prospect of optimizing nutrition to assist the immune system in wound repair bears great significance in both medical and surgical fields, as the costs of wound care and repair cannot be ignored. Recent Advances: Recent studies have rekindled efforts to elucidate the roles of specific immunonutrients, and we now have a better understanding of the conditionally essential role of various nutrients such as arginine, which becomes essential in certain clinical situations such as for the trauma patient or patients at high risk for malnutrition. Immunonutrition in its current formulation usually includes supplementation with arginine, glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and trace minerals, and its use has often been associated with decreased infectious complications and sometimes with improvements in wound healing. Critical Issues: A key to understanding the role of immunonutrition in wound healing is recognizing the distinct contributions and importance of the various elements utilized.

Injury can affect the skin's structure and composition, thereby greatly influencing the biomechanics and directionality of the resulting scar tissue. Recent Advances: A combination of stress-relaxation and tensile failure testing identifies both the tissue's physiologically relevant viscoelastic behavior and resistance to rupture. When studied in mutually orthogonal directions in the plane of the tissue, these measures give insight into the directional properties of healthy tissue, and how they change with injury. By controlling the biomechanics of the wound environment, a new force-modulating dressing has demonstrated the ability to improve healing and reduce scar formation. Critical Issues: Skin and scar biomechanics are typically characterized by using tensile failure, which identifies the tissue's resistance to rupture but offers limited insight into its normal daily function. Characterizing physiologically relevant biomechanics of skin, and how they change with injury, is critical to understand the tissue's ability to resist elongation, bear load, and dissipate energy via viscous means. Future Directions: Compared with uninjured skin, scar tissue demonstrates similar high-load stiffness, greatly reduced resistance to failure, reduced low-load compliance, and altered material directionality. These findings, identified through combined stress relaxation and failure testing, suggest morphological changes with injury that are consistent with the viscoelastic and directional changes observed biomechanically. A more complete understanding of the directional, physiologically relevant skin biomechanics can guide the design and critical functional assessment of wound treatments, scaffolds, and tissue-engineered skin replacements.",

Epidermal barrier disorders affect millions of patients in the United States, causing loss of productivity and diminished quality of life for patients and their families, and represent a burden to the health-care system and society.

Defects in neutrophil recruitment lead to impaired wound healing. Recent Advances: Chemokines and chemokine receptors are known to regulate neutrophil recruitment. Recent research advances reveal more mechanistic details about the regulation of chemokines and chemokine receptors on neutrophil egress from bone marrow, transmigration into the wound site, spatial navigation toward the necrotic skin tissue, and apoptosis-induced clearance by efferocytosis. Critical Issues: Skin injury triggers local and systemic alterations in the expression of multiple chemotactic molecules and the magnitude of chemokine receptor-mediated signaling. The responses of a number of CXC and CX3C chemokines and their receptors closely associate with the temporal and spatial recruitment of neutrophils to wound sites during the inflammatory phase and promote the clearance of necrotic neutrophils during the transition into the proliferative phase.

Small animals (rodents) are extensively utilized to model human cutaneous wound healing, but they heal by wound contraction, a process that is limited in the human and confounds quantitative and qualitative evaluation of experimental wound repair.To alleviate wound contraction in loose-skinned species, practical solutions include choosing anatomical sites with firmly attached dermis and subcutis (e.g., rabbit ear) or performing mechanical fixation of the skin by using one of a number of devices or splints. In each case, the wound volume remains relatively constant, allowing the histomorphometric or biomolecular quantification of the cellular response under well-controlled, experimental conditions. In addition, the defined aperture of the splinted wound allows the placement of a variety of materials, including scaffolds, cells, and biologically active formulations into the wound site in an effort to potentiate the healing response and abrogate scarring. In contrast, production of larger experimental wounds or the deliberate distraction of wound margins can be used to model a hypertrophic response.Device design parameters should consider ease of application, durability, and lack of interference with the normal influx of local and circulating cells to the wound site.Improved methods of securing flexible splints would provide a more efficient experimental platform. These devices could also incorporate optical or electronic sensors that report both the mechanical and physiological status of the healing.",

Many claims are made while extolling the virtues of collagen-based biomaterials in promoting cell growth and modulating matrix metalloproteinases. This review will explore the rationale for using topical collagen or ECM as an interface for healing. Recent Advances: Rapid improvements in electrospinning and nanotechnology have resulted in the creation of third-generation biomaterials that mimic the native ECM, stimulate cellular and genetic responses in the target tissue, and provide a platform for controlled release of bioactive molecules and live cells. Although the major focus is currently on development of artificial tissues and organ regeneration, better understanding of the mechanisms that stimulate wound healing can be applied to specific deficits in the chronic wound. Critical Issues: When choosing between the various advanced wound-care products and dressings, the clinician is challenged to select the most appropriate material at the right time. Understanding how the ECM components promote tissue regeneration and modulate the wound microenvironment will facilitate those choices. Laboratory discoveries of biomolecular and cellular strategies that promote skin regeneration rather than repair should be demonstrated to translate to deficits in the chronic wound. Future Directions: Cost-effective production of materials that utilize non-mammalian sources of collagen or ECM components combined with synthetic scaffolding will provide an optimal structure for cellular ingrowth and modulation of the chronic wound microenvironment to facilitate healing. These bioengineered materials will be customizable to provide time-released delivery of bioactive molecules or drugs based on the degradation rate of the scaffold or specific signals from the wound.",

The inhibitory effect of ES on bacterial growth has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the useful effects of ES on wound healing. Bacterial burden has been associated with chronic wounds. The extensive use of antibiotics can lead to the spread of multiple drug resistant bacteria. Whether biophysical energies, such as ES, can be used as a treatment modality against pathogenic microorganisms remains an open question. Recent Advances: The research literature provides evidence for useful effects of ES in terms of inhibition of bacterial growth. The type of ES, its polarity, and the intensity of the current play a major role in establishment of antibacterial effects. Both direct current (DC) and high voltage pulse current are more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth than are other types of ES. The exact mechanism underlying the antibacterial effects of ES is not clear. Critical Issues: Available evidence indicates that microampere DC (μADC) is better than other ES types for inhibition of bacterial growth. The results of most studies also support the application of cathodal current for bacterial growth inhibition. The current intensity of ES would appear to be tolerable by humans if used clinically for treatment of infected wounds. Future Directions: The cathodal μADC appears to be more effective for inhibition of microorganism growth. Further research, especially in vivo, is necessary to clarify the inhibitory effects of ES on wound bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Traditional therapies, including the use of dietary components for wound healing and skin regeneration, are very common in Asian countries such as China and India. The increasing evidence of health-protective benefits of phytochemicals, components derived from plants is generating a lot of interest, warranting further scientific evaluation and mechanistic studies. Recent Advances: Phytochemicals are non-nutritive substances present in plants, and some of them have the potential to provide better tissue remodeling when applied on wounds and to also act as proangiogenic agents during wound healing. Critical Issues: In this review, we briefly discuss the current understanding, important molecular targets, and mechanism of action(s) of some of the phytochemicals such as curcumin, picroliv, and arnebin-1. We also broadly review the multiple pathways that these phytochemicals regulate to enhance wound repair and skin regeneration. Future Directions: Recent experimental data on the effects of phytochemicals on wound healing and skin regeneration establish the potential clinical utility of plant-based compounds. Additional research in order to better understand the exact mechanism and potential targets of phytochemicals in skin regeneration is needed. Human studies a2nd clinical trials are pivotal to fully understand the benefits of phytochemicals in wound healing and skin regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Cutaneous wound healing is a serious problem worldwide that affects patients with various wound types, resulting from burns, traumatic injuries, and diabetes. Despite the wide range of clinically available skin substitutes and the different therapeutic alternatives, delayed healing and scarring are often observed. Recent Advances: Stem cells have arisen as powerful tools to improve skin wound healing, due to features such as effective secretome, self-renewal, low immunogenicity, and differentiation capacity. They represent potentially readily available biological material that can particularly target distinct wound-healing phases. In this context, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote cell migration, angiogenesis, and a possible regenerative rather than fibrotic microenvironment at the wound site, mainly through paracrine signaling with the surrounding cells/tissues. Critical Issues: Despite the current insights, there are still major hurdles to be overcome to achieve effective therapeutic effects. Limited engraftment and survival at the wound site are still major concerns, and alternative approaches to maximize stem cell potential are a major demand. Future Directions: This review emphasizes two main strategies that have been explored in this context. These comprise the exploration of hypoxic conditions to modulate stem cell secretome, and the use of adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction as a source of multiple cells, including stem cells and factors requiring minimal manipulation. Nonetheless, the attainment of these approaches to target successfully skin regeneration will be only evident after a significant number of in vivo works in relevant pre-clinical models.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Delayed wound healing is one of the most challenging complications of several diseases, including diabetes. There is a vast interest in finding efficient treatments that promote scarless wound healing. The ability of the fetus to regenerate skin wounds after injury has generated much interest in the fetus as a model of regeneration. In this review, we evaluate the role and differential regulation of inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, and mechanical stress in determining wound phenotype after injury. Recent Advances: Comparisons between postnatal and fetal wounds have revealed many differences in the healing process. Fetal skin wound healing is characterized by a reduced inflammatory response, an ECM rich in type III collagen and high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA), and minimal mechanical stress. In contrast, adult wounds have a sustained inflammatory response, an ECM with increased type I collagen, and low-molecular-weight (LMW-HA) and are subject to significant mechanical load. Critical Issues: The differential regulation of these processes in the fetus compared with the adult plays a critical role in promoting regeneration in the fetus while resulting in scar formation in the adult. Future Directions: Understanding the significance of inflammation and biomechanical forces in wound healing may help in designing therapeutic strategies for the management of chronic nonhealing wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The binding of cytokines and growth factors to heparan sulfate (HS) chains on proteoglycans generates gradients that control development and regulate wound healing. Syndecan-1 (sdc1) is an integral membrane HS proteoglycan. Its structure allows it to bind with cytosolic, transmembrane, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It plays important roles in mediating key events during wound healing because it regulates a number of important processes, including cell adhesion, cell migration, endocytosis, exosome formation, and fibrosis. Recent Advances: Recent studies reveal that sdc1 regulates wound healing by altering integrin activation. Differences in integrin activation lead to cell-type-specific changes in the rate of cell migration and ECM assembly. Sdc1 also regulates endocytosis and the formation and release of exosomes. Critical Issues: Understanding how sdc1 facilitates wound healing and resolution will improve treatment options for elderly and diabetic patients with delayed wound healing. Studies showing that sdc1 function is altered in cancer are relevant to those interested in controlling fibrosis and scarring. Future Directions: The key to understanding the various functions ascribed to sdc1 is resolving how it interacts with its numerous binding partners. The role played by chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains on the ability of sdc1 to associate with its ligands needs further investigation. At wound sites heparanase can cleave the HS GAG chains of sdc1, alter its ability to bind cytokines, and induce shedding of the ectodomain. This review will discuss how the unique structure of sdc1 allows it to play key roles in cell signaling, ECM assembly, and wound healing.",

    "abstract": "The number of patients with nonhealing wounds has rapidly accelerated over the past 10 years in both the United States and worldwide. Some causative factors at the macro level include an aging population, epidemic numbers of obese and diabetic patients, and an increasing number of surgical procedures. At the micro level, chronic inflammation is a consistent finding.A number of treatment modalities are currently used to accelerate wound healing, including energy-based modalities, scaffoldings, the use of mechano-transduction, cytokines/growth factors, and cell-based therapies. The use of stem cell therapy has been hypothesized as a potentially useful adjunct for nonhealing wounds. Specifically, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to improve wound healing in several studies. Immune modulating properties of MSCs have made them attractive treatment options.Current limitations of stem cell therapy include the potentially large number of cells required for an effect, complex preparation and delivery methods, and poor cell retention in targeted tissues. Comparisons of published in-vitro and clinical trials are difficult due to cell preparation techniques, passage number, and the impact of the micro-environment on cell behavior.MSCs may be more useful if they are preactivated with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma. This article will review the current literature with regard to the use of stem cells for wound healing. In addition the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs will be discussed along with the potential benefits of stem cell preactivation.",

Only recently have studies begun to examine fungal colonization and interactions with the bacterial component of the microbiome, their relationship with the host, and influence on wound outcomes. Recent Advances: Studies using culture-independent sequencing methods reveal that fungi often go undetected in wounds. Candida spp. and Cladosporidium spp. are the most commonly identified fungi in wounds. The wound environment may promote multispecies biofilm formation between bacteria and fungi in wounds, with implications for pathogenicity, treatment, and outcomes. Critical Issues: Identifying microorganisms that are problematic for healing will require a comprehensive understanding of all members of the polymicrobial wound community, including fungi and bacteria. Improved reference databases and bioinformatics tools for studying fungal communities will stimulate further research into the fungal microbiome. Future Directions: Continued study of polymicrobial wound communities using culture-independent methods will further our understanding of the relationships between microbial bioburden, the host response, and impact on healing, complications, and patient outcomes. Future studies should encompass all types of microbiota, including fungi, and focus on potential multi-kingdom interactions that contribute to pathogenicity, biofilm formation, and poor outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Significance: We compare real-world data from the U.S. Wound Registry (USWR) with randomized controlled trials and publicly reported wound outcomes and develop criteria for honest reporting of wound outcomes, a requirement of the new Quality Payment Program (QPP). Recent Advances: Because no method has existed by which wounds could be stratified according to their likelihood of healing among real-world patients, practitioners have reported fantastically high healing rates. The USWR has developed several risk-stratified wound healing quality measures for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) as part of its Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR). This allows practitioners to report DFU and VLU healing rates in comparison to the likelihood of whether the wound would have healed. Critical Issues: Under the new QPP, practitioners must report at least one practice-relevant outcome measure, and it must be risk adjusted so that clinicians caring for the sickest patients do not appear to have worse outcomes than their peers. The Wound Healing Index is a validated risk-stratification method that can predict whether a DFU or VLU will heal, leveling the playing field for outcome reporting and removing the need to artificially inflate healing rates. Wound care practitioners can report the USWR DFU and VLU risk-stratified outcome measure to satisfy the quality reporting requirements of the QPP. Future Directions: Per the requirements of the QPP, the USWR will begin publicly reporting of risk-stratified healing rates once quality measure data have met the reporting standards of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Some basic rules for data censoring are proposed for public reporting of healing rates, and others are needed, which should be decided by consensus among the wound care community.",

    "abstract": "Scope and Significance: There are ∼185,000 amputations each year and nearly 2 million amputees currently living in the United States. Approximately 25% of these amputees will experience chronic pain issues secondary to localized neuroma pain and/or phantom limb pain. Problem: The significant discomfort caused by neuroma and phantom limb pain interferes with prosthesis wear, subjecting amputees to the additional physical and psychological morbidity associated with chronic immobility. Although numerous neuroma treatments are described, none of these methods are consistently effective in eliminating symptoms. Translational Relevance: Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a surgical technique involving the transfer of residual peripheral nerves to redundant target muscle motor nerves, restoring physiological continuity and encouraging organized nerve regeneration to decrease and potentially prevent the chaotic and misdirected nerve growth, which can contribute to pain experienced within the residual limb. Clinical Relevance: TMR represents one of the more promising treatments for neuroma pain. Prior research into \"secondary\" TMR performed in a delayed manner after amputation has shown great improvement in treating amputee pain issues because of peripheral nerve dysfunction. \"Primary\" TMR performed at the time of amputation suggests that it may prevent neuroma formation while avoiding the risks associated with a delayed procedure. In addition, TMR permits the target muscles to act as bioamplifiers to direct bioprosthetic control and function. Summary: TMR has the potential to treat pain from neuromas while enabling amputee patients to return to their activities of daily living and improve prosthetic use and tolerance. Recent research in the areas of secondary (i.e., delayed) and primary TMR aims to optimize efficacy and efficiency and demonstrates great potential for establishing a new standard of care for amputees.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are potentially fatal acute mucocutaneous vesiculobullous disorders. Evidence to date suggests that outcomes for patients with both TEN and SJS are largely dependent on stopping the causative agent, followed by supportive care and appropriate wound management in a specialized burns unit. These are life-threatening conditions characterized by widespread full-thickness cutaneous and mucosal necrosis. This article outlines the approach to holistic management of such patients, in a specialized unit, highlighting various practical aspects of wound care to prevent complications such as infection, mucosal and adhesions, and ocular scaring. Recent Advances: There is improved understanding of pain and morbidity with regard to the type and frequency of dressing changes. More modern dressings, such as nanocrystalline, are currently favored as they may be kept in situ for longer periods. The most recent evidence on systemic agents, such as corticosteroids and cyclosporine, and novel treatments, are also discussed. Critical Issues: Following cessation of the culprit trigger, management in a specialized burns unit is the most important management step. It is now understood that a multidisciplinary team is essential in the care of these patients. Following admission of such patients, dermatology, ear, nose, and throat surgery, ophthalmology, urology, colorectal surgery, and gynecology should all be consulted to prevent disease sequelae. Future Directions: Looking forward, research is aimed at achieving prospective data on the efficacy of systemic immunomodulating agents and dressing types. Tertiary centers with burns units should develop policies for such patients to ensure that the relevant teams are consulted promptly to avoid mucocutaneous complications.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Inflammation is an integral part of immune response and supports optimal wound healing in adults. Inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and mast cells produce important cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. These immune cells interact with keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (ECs), as well as the extracellular matrix within a complicated network that promotes and regulates wound healing. Aberrant and persistent inflammation may result in delayed wound healing, scar formation, or chronic wounds. Targeting the molecules involved in the inflammatory response may have great potential therapeutic value. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microbes or danger-associated molecular patterns from damaged cells. The discovery of TLRs sheds new light on the mechanism by which the inflammatory or innate immune response is initiated in wound healing. Convincing evidence now shows that multiple types of cells, including infiltrating or resident inflammatory cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and ECs, express specific types of TLRs. Experimental reduction of certain TLRs or treatment of wounds with TLR ligands has been shown to affect wound healing. A better understanding of the involvement of TLRs in the innate immune response during skin wound healing may suggest novel strategies to improve the quality of tissue repair. Future Directions: Despite the indisputable role of TLRs in regulating the immune response in acute wound healing, the functions of TLRs that are relevant to human wound healing and chronic wounds are poorly understood.",

Pathological scarring, including hypertrophic and keloid scars, can be particularly debilitating. Manipulation of the chemokine system may lead to effective therapies for problematic lesions. Recent Advances: Rapid advancement in the understanding of chemokines and their receptors has led to exciting developments in the world of therapeutics. Modulation of their function has led to clinically effective treatments for conditions as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus and inflammatory bowel disease. Potential methods of targeting chemokines include monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule antagonists, interference with glycosaminoglycan binding and the use of synthetic truncated chemokines. Early work has shown promising results on scar development and appearance when the chemokine system is manipulated. Critical Issues: Chemokines are implicated in all stages of wound healing leading to the development of a cutaneous scar. An understanding of entirely regenerative wound healing in the developing fetus and how the expression of chemokines and their receptors change during the transition to the adult phenotype is central to addressing pathological scarring in adults. Future Directions: As our understanding of chemokine/receptor interactions and scar formation evolves it has become apparent that effective therapies will need to mirror the complexities in these diverse biological processes. It is likely that sophisticated treatments that sequentially influence multiple ligand/receptor interactions throughout all stages of wound healing will be required to deliver viable treatment options.",

Point-of-care fluorescence imaging (FL) MolecuLight i:X can improve identification of wounds with high bacterial burden (>104 colony-forming unit [CFU]/g). FL detects bacteria, whether planktonic or in biofilm, but does not distinguish between the two. In this study, diagnostic accuracy of FL was compared to CSS during routine wound assessment. Postassessment, clinicians were surveyed to assess impact of FL on treatment plan. Approach: A prospective multicenter controlled study was conducted by 20 study clinicians from 14 outpatient advanced wound care centers across the United States. Wounds underwent assessment for CSS followed by FL. Biopsies were collected to confirm total bacterial load. Three hundred fifty patients completed the study (138 diabetic foot ulcers, 106 venous leg ulcers, 60 surgical sites, 22 pressure ulcers, and 24 others). Results: Around 287/350 wounds (82%) had bacterial loads >104 CFU/g, and CSS missed detection of 85% of these wounds. FL significantly increased detection of bacteria (>104 CFU/g) by fourfold, and this was consistent across wound types (p < 0.001). Specificity of CSS+FL remained comparably high to CSS (p = 1.0). FL information modified treatment plans (69% of wounds), influenced wound bed preparation (85%), and improved overall patient care (90%) as reported by study clinicians. Innovation: This novel noncontact, handheld FL device provides immediate, objective information on presence, location, and load of bacteria at point of care. Conclusion: Use of FL facilitates adherence to clinical guidelines recommending prompt detection and removal of bacterial burden to reduce wound infection and facilitate healing.",

Results: NET-specific markers were significantly higher in DFU patients than in diabetic patients without DFU or healthy controls and were found to correlate positively with DUSS or WIfI score. Elastase levels in ulcer tissue significantly increased in wounds with infections and delayed healing. Higher levels of NET release were observed after the stimulation of plasma or platelets from ulcer-related vessels than from nonulcer-related vessels of the DFU patients. Citrullinated histone 3 (citH3) was identified as a risk factor for wound healing impairment and amputation. The patients with the highest quartile of citH3 levels presented significantly lower healing rates and higher amputation rates than those with the lower three quartiles. Innovation: This study extended current knowledge of NETs on wound healing in DFU patients. Conclusion: NET-specific markers negatively correlated with wound healing in DFU patients, and citH3 is a potential marker.",

While artificial intelligence (AI) has found wide applications in health-related sciences and technology, AI-based systems remain to be developed clinically and computationally for high-quality wound care. To this end, we have carried out a systematic review of intelligent image-based data analysis and system developments for wound assessment. Specifically, we provide an extensive review of research methods on wound measurement (segmentation) and wound diagnosis (classification). We also reviewed recent work on wound assessment systems (including hardware, software, and mobile apps).

    "abstract": "Significance: Wound healing is a complex and dynamic series of events influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Problematic wounds, particularly chronic wounds and pathologic scars, remain clinically significant burdens. Modeling physiologic and aberrant wound repair processes using in vitro or in vivo models have contributed to Advances in Wound Care (AWC); however, the fidelity of each model used, particularly with respect to its species-specific limitations, must be taken into account for extrapolation to human patients. Twenty-five years of wound healing models published in Wound Repair and Regeneration (1993-2017) and AWC (2012-2017) were collected and analyzed to determine trends in species utilization and models used. Recent Advances: In 25 years, 1,521 original research articles utilizing one or more wound models were published (total of 1,665 models). Although 20 different species were used over the course of 25 years, 5 species were most commonly utilized: human, mouse, rat, pig, and rabbit. In vivo modeling was used most frequently, followed by in vitro, ex vivo, and in silico modeling of wound healing processes. Critical Issues: A comparison of articles from 1993 to 1997 and 2013 to 2017 periods showed notable differences in model and species usage. Experiments utilizing mouse and human models increased, while the usage of pig models remained constant, rabbit and rat models declined in the more recent time period examined compared to the time period two decades before. Future Directions: This analysis shows notable changes in types of models and species used over time which may be attributed to new knowledge, techniques, technology, and/or reagents. Explorations into mechanisms of limb regeneration and wound healing of noncutaneous tissues have also contributed to a shift in modeling over time. Changes within the journals (i.e., page expansion and increased rejection rates), research funding, and model expense may also influence the observed shifts.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds affect millions of patients worldwide, placing a huge burden on health care resources. Although significant progress has been made in the development of wound treatments, very few advances have been made in wound diagnosis. Recent Advances: Standard imaging methods like computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, terahertz imaging, and ultrasound imaging have been widely employed in wound diagnostics. A number of noninvasive optical imaging modalities like optical coherence tomography, near-infrared spectroscopy, laser Doppler imaging, spatial frequency domain imaging, digital camera imaging, and thermal and fluorescence imaging have emerged over the years. Critical Issues: While standard diagnostic wound imaging modalities provide valuable information, they cannot account for dynamic changes in the wound environment. In addition, they lack the capability to predict the healing outcome. Thus, there remains a pressing need for more efficient methods that can not only indicate the current state of the wound but also help determine whether the wound is on track to heal normally. Future Directions: Many imaging probes have been fabricated and shown to provide real-time assessment of tissue microenvironment and inflammatory responses in vivo. These probes have been demonstrated to noninvasively detect various changes in the wound environment, which include tissue pH, reactive oxygen species, fibrin deposition, matrix metalloproteinase production, and macrophage accumulation. This review summarizes the creation of these probes and their potential implications in wound monitoring.",

Ideal wound dressings should provide a moist environment for wounds and actively promote wound healing and skin recovery. The materials used as ideal wound dressings should possess specific properties, thus accelerating skin tissue regeneration process. Recent Advances: Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a natural polymer synthesized by some bacteria. As a kind of natural biopolymer, BC shows good biological activity, biodegradability, and biological adaptability. It has many unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, such as ultrafine nanofiber network, high crystallinity, high water absorption and retention capacity, and high tensile strength and elastic modulus. These excellent properties of BC have laid the foundation for its application as dressing in wound healing. Critical Issues: To optimize the biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of BC, different methods including microbial fermentation, physical modification, chemical modification, and compound modification have been adopted to modify BC to ensure a better application in wound healing. BC-based wound dressings have been applied in infected wounds, acute traumatic injuries, burns, and diabetic wounds, showing remarkable therapeutic effects on promoting wound healing. Furthermore, there have been some commercial BC-based dressings and they have been utilized in clinical practice.

Many wounds are treated by means of dressings. The materials used in a dressing, their microarchitecture, and how they are composed and constructed form the basis for the laboratory and clinical performances of any advanced dressing. Recent Advances: The established structure/function principle in material science is reviewed and analyzed in this article in the context of wound dressings. This principle states that the microstructure determines the physical, mechanical, and fluid transport and handling properties, all of which are critically important for, and relevant to the, adequate performances of wound dressings. Critical Issues: According to the above principle, once the clinical requirements for wound care and management are defined for a given wound type and etiology, it should be theoretically possible to translate clinically relevant characteristics of dressings into physical test designs resulting specific metrics of materials, mechanical, and fluid transport and handling properties, all of which should be determined to meet the clinical objectives and be measurable through standardized bench testing. Future Directions: This multidisciplinary review article, written by an International Wound Dressing Technology Expert Panel, discusses the translation of clinical wound care and management into effective, basic engineering standard testing requirements from wound dressings with respect to material types, microarchitecture, and properties, to achieve the desirable performance in supporting healing and improving the quality of life of patients.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is no longer considered to be just an inert supportive material but is a source of directive, spatial and temporal, contextual information to the cells via components such as the proteoglycans. There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of how these important molecules functionally interact with other matrix structures, cells and cellular mediators in normal skin and during wound healing. Recent Advances: New antibodies to glycosaminoglycan side chain components of skin proteoglycans have facilitated the elucidation of detailed localization patterns within skin. Other studies have revealed important proliferative activities of proteinase-generated fragments of proteoglycans and other ECM components (matricryptins). Knockout mice have further established the functional importance of skin proteoglycans in the assembly and homeostasis of the normal skin ECM. Critical Issues: Our comprehension of the molecular and structural complexity of skin as a complex, dynamic, constantly renewing, layered connective tissue is incomplete. The impact of changes in proteoglycans on skin pathology and the wound healing process is recognized as an important area of pathobiology and is an area of intense investigation. Future Directions: Advanced technology is allowing the development of new artificial skins.

Coordinating these processes to ensure rapid and thorough wound healing is necessary when developing therapeutics. This coordination, however, is disrupted in chronic nonhealing wounds, wherein the impaired blood supply and resulting ischemia compromise cellular functions and make it difficult to deliver the necessary signaling molecules.MSCs secrete a combination of growth factors and cytokines, which have been shown to promote wound repair. This combination of growth factors and cytokines successfully induces angiogenesis, reduces inflammation, and promotes fibroblast migration and collagen production.The growth factors and cytokines secreted by MSCs can be administered to wounds by either transplanting cells or, as a safer alternative, using the conditioned medium of MSCs, which contains these secreted bioactive molecules. For their success in reducing wound closure time, MSCs offer a promising option for treating chronic wounds. Still, possible undesirable effects of MSC-based therapeutics, such as keloid formation, need to be carefully studied.With its strong ability to secrete diverse growth factors and cytokines, MSC-based therapeutics, either with cell transplantation or the conditioned medium, offers a novel approach toward chronic nonhealing wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Mast cells are resident inflammatory cells present in high numbers in the skin. They are one of the first cell types to respond to damage and they do so by quickly releasing a variety of preformed mediators that are stored within mast cell granules. Mast cells are not only active early on, where they help induce inflammation, but they also stimulate the proliferation of several important cell types and influence the production and remodeling of collagen. Recent Advances: Recent studies have highlighted the importance of mast cells in determining the amount of scar tissue that forms as a result of the repair process. Mast cells are found in low numbers and in a less activated state in scarless wounds, whereas high numbers of activated mast cells are associated with scarring and fibrosis. Furthermore, animals that lack mast cells or have been treated with degranulation inhibitors or drugs that block the activity of mast cell proteases have been shown to heal with reduced scar tissue. Critical Issues: Despite evidence suggesting that mast cells regulate scar tissue development, the entire range of mast cell activities during wound repair and scar formation has not been completely characterized. In addition, the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting mast cells clinically have yet to be fully explored. Future Directions: More studies are needed to determine whether inhibiting mast cell activation and blocking the function of mast cell mediators are viable options to prevent or reduce the appearance of scars.",

    "abstract": "Open wound closure by wound contraction produces a healed defect made up mostly of dermis. Generating thicker collagen fibers condenses granulation tissue, which pulls surrounding skin into the defect.What is the mechanism for open wound contraction? Is it through the generation of contractile force using sustained myosin ATPase, thus causing cell contraction or by rapid myosin ATPase that condenses collagen fibrils into fibers?The mechanism for wound contraction is not often debated after the discovery of the myofibroblast. Myofibroblasts are the major cell phenotype in maturing granulation tissue. It is concluded, not quite accurately, that myofibroblasts are responsible for wound contraction. As wound contraction progresses, polarized light microscopy reveals birefringence patterns associated with ever-increasing thickening of collagen fibers. Collagen fibers thicken by eliminating water between fibrils. Wound contraction requires collagen synthesis and granulation tissue compaction. Both myofibroblasts and fibroblasts synthesize collagen, but fibroblasts, not myofibroblasts, compact collagen. Free-floating fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCL) contract by rapid myosin ATPase, thus resulting in thicker collagen fibers by elongated fibroblasts. The release of an attached FPCL, using sustained myosin ATPase, produces rapid lattice contraction, now populated with contracted myofibroblasts in the absence of thick collagen fibers.In vivo and in vitro studies show that rapid myosin ATPase is the motor for wound contraction. Myofibroblasts maintain steady mechano-tension through sustained myosin ATPase, which generates cell contraction forces that fail to produce thicker collagen fibers. The hypothesis is that cytoplasmic microfilaments pull collagen fibrils over the fibroblast's plasma membrane surface, bringing collagen fibrils in closer contact with one another. The self-assembly nature of collagen fixes collagen fibrils in regular arrays generating thicker collagen fibers.Wound contraction progresses through fibroblasts generating thicker collagen fibers, using tractional forces; rather than by myofibroblasts utilizing cell contraction forces.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The presence of a \"pathogenic\" or \"highly virulent\" biofilm is a fundamental risk factor that prevents a chronic wound from healing and increases the risk of the wound becoming clinically infected. There is presently no unequivocal gold standard method available for clinicians to confirm the presence of biofilms in a wound. Thus, to help support clinician practice, we devised an algorithm intended to demonstrate evidence of the presence of a biofilm in a wound to assist with wound management. Recent Advances: A variety of histological and microscopic methods applied to tissue biopsies are currently the most informative techniques available for demonstrating the presence of generic (not classified as pathogenic or commensal) biofilms and the effect they are having in promoting inflammation and downregulating cellular functions. Critical Issues: Even as we rely on microscopic techniques to visualize biofilms, they are entities which are patchy and dispersed rather than confluent, particularly on biotic surfaces. Consequently, detection of biofilms by microscopic techniques alone can lead to frequent false-negative results. Furthermore, visual identification using the naked eye of a pathogenic biofilm on a macroscopic level on the wound will not be possible, unlike with biofilms on abiotic surfaces. Future Direction: Lacking specific biomarkers to demonstrate microscopic, nonconfluent, virulent biofilms in wounds, the present focus on biofilm research should be placed on changing clinical practice. This is best done by utilizing an anti-biofilm toolbox approach, rather than speculating on unscientific approaches to identifying biofilms, with or without staining, in wounds with the naked eye. The approach to controlling biofilm should include initial wound cleansing, periodic debridement, followed by the application of appropriate antimicrobial wound dressings. This approach appears to be effective in removing pathogenic biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are key to regenerative wound healing. MSCs have spatial memory and respond to local environment. MSCs orchestrate wound repair by: (1) structural repair via cellular differentiation; (2) immune-modulation; (3) secretion of growth factors that drive neovascularization and re-epithelialization; and (4) mobilization of resident stem cells.Autologous bone-marrow-derived cells and MSCs demonstrate improved healing and tissue-integrity in animal models and clinical trials. However, the effects are variable and the mechanisms of MSC-mediated wound healing are not fully understood. The mammalian MSC niche and signaling sequences and factors affecting their homing, differentiation, viability, and safety need to be characterized to get full benefits of MSC cellular therapy.MSCs can be isolated from bone-marrow, and less-invasive tissues such as adipose, gingiva, muscle, and umbilical cord, with similar functional effects. However, isolation, culture conditions, and markers used to identify and trace the lineage of these MSCs have not been standardized, which is crucial to determine the extent to which MSCs act as multipotent stem cells or sources of secreted factors in wounds.In chronic nonhealing wounds, where efficacy of conventional therapies is unsatisfactory, autotransplantation of MSCs could accelerate wound healing, promote regeneration and restoration of tissue integrity, and reduce recurrence of wounds at characteristically predisposed sites.Regenerative medicine and novel wound therapies using autologous stem cells holds great promise for clinical management of difficult wounds. The ideal candidate stem cells can be used to repopulate the wound bed to mediate appropriate epidermal and dermal regeneration and promote efficient wound repair, while modulating the immune system to prevent infection.",

Controlling integrin-Fn interactions offers a promising approach to directing cell behavior, such as adhesion, migration, and differentiation, as well as coordinated tissue behaviors such as morphogenesis and wound healing. Recent Advances: Several different groups have developed recombinant fragments of Fn that can control epithelial to mesenchymal transition, sequester growth factors, and promote bone and wound healing. It is thought that these physiological responses are, in part, due to specific integrin engagement. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the integrin-binding domain of Fn is a mechanically sensitive switch that drives binding of one integrin heterodimer over another.

Preclinical studies are essential precursors in determining physiological mechanisms and elucidation of causal pathways.

Recent Advances: Optical devices, telemedicine, and high-frequency ultrasound are among the highlights in recent burn imaging advancements. We present another promising technology, multispectral imaging (MSI), which also has the potential to impact current medical practice in burn care, among a variety of other specialties. Critical Issues: At this time, it is still a matter of debate as to why there is no consensus on the use of technology to assist burn assessments in the United States. Fortunately, the availability of techniques does not appear to be a limitation. However, the selection of appropriate imaging technology to augment the provision of burn care can be difficult for clinicians to navigate. There are many technologies available, but a comprehensive review summarizing the tissue characteristics measured by each technology in light of aiding clinicians in selecting the proper device is missing. This would be especially valuable for the nonburn specialists who encounter burn injuries. Future Directions: The questions of when burn assessment devices are useful to the burn team, how the various imaging devices work, and where the various burn imaging technologies fit into the spectrum of burn care will continue to be addressed. Technologies that can image a large surface area quickly, such as thermography or laser speckle imaging, may be suitable for initial burn assessment and triage. In the setting of presurgical planning, ultrasound or optical microscopy techniques, including optical coherence tomography, may prove useful. MSI, which actually has origins in burn care, may ultimately meet a high number of requirements for burn assessment in routine clinical use.",

Most of the work on VEGF and wound healing has focused on its role in mediating angiogenesis and how this affects wound closure rates. Less is known about how VEGF affects other phases of wound healing, including scar formation. Recent Advances: Over the last 10 years, mounting evidence suggests that VEGF plays an important role in regulating scar tissue production. Multiple studies have linked high VEGF levels with scar formation in normal, hypertrophic, and keloid scars. In addition, there is experimental evidence that VEGF inhibition can reduce scar tissue deposition. Critical Issues: While there is evidence that VEGF can promote scar formation in the skin, there are several unanswered questions that remain. First, the mechanisms by which VEGF promotes scar formation have not been completely characterized. While both indirect and direct mechanisms could be involved, clear evidence for a specific mechanism is lacking. In addition, despite the availability of anti-VEGF drugs, the potential value in targeting VEGF to attenuate scar formation clinically is not yet known. Future Directions: While there are a significant number of studies examining the effects of VEGF on angiogenesis and wound closure, much less attention has been paid to the contribution of VEGF to scar tissue production. Additional studies are required to learn more about how VEGF regulates scar formation and whether VEGF inhibition could be used clinically to manage scars.",

    "abstract": "Significance: This critical review focuses on interactions between cells, fibronectin (FN), and growth factors (GF). Recent Advances: Initially, the extracellular matrix (ECM) was thought to serve simply as a reservoir for GFs that would be released as soluble ligands during proteolytic degradation of ECM. This view was rather quickly extended by the observation that ECM could concentrate GFs to the pericellular matrix for more efficient presentation to cell surface receptors. However, recent reports support much more complex interactions among GFs and ECM molecules, particularly FN, and the way these interactions can fine-tune cell responses to the microenvironment. Critical Issues: Wounds that are unable to synthesize and sustain a functional ECM cannot optimally benefit from endogenous or exogenous GFs. Therefore, GF treatments have recently focused on utilizing ECM molecules as delivery vehicles. Thus, ECM can influence GF stability and activity, and GFs can modulate the ECM activity. Hence, both individually and together, ECM and GFs modulate cells that in turn control the type and level of GFs and ECM in the pericellular environment that ultimately results in new tissue generation. Although many ECM components are important for optimal tissue regeneration and wound healing, FN stands out as absolutely critical not only for wound healing and tissue regeneration but also for embryogenesis and morphogenesis. Future Directions: Understanding ECM/GF interactions will greatly facilitate our understanding of normal wound repair and regeneration, the failure of wounds to heal, and how the latter can be salvaged with proper ECM/GF combinations.",

Furthermore, we review a breadth of literature to gain an insight into how and why topical silicone gels remain the favored treatment of medical experts in scar management. We also analyze an ever increasing number of alternative therapies claiming to provide enhanced scar reduction performance. Recent Advances: Topical silicone gel treatments seem to remain the first point of clinical recommendation in scar management. SGS has been used in scar therapy for over 30 years, during which its efficacy has been the subject of numerous clinical evaluations. Critical Issues: While the exact mechanisms by which SGS improves hypertrophic scars, keloid development and recovery are yet to be fully agreed upon, its ability to do so remains largely undisputed at present. However, there still is ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized. Future Direction: The clinical support of topical silicone gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the internationally recommended first-line form of scar management, and favored by consensus among healthcare professionals. However, there still remains the need for further clinical evidence and a better understanding of the mechanism behind the benefit of silicone gel for use in the prevention of abnormal scarring.",

When cutaneous injuries occur, skin homeostasis and integrity are damaged, leading to dire consequences such as acute, chronic, or infected wounds.

In this review, we will dissect the biological process of adult skin wound healing and emphasize the importance of epidermal stem cells during the wound healing. Critical Issues: We will comprehensively discuss the current clinical practices used on patients with cutaneous wounds, including both traditional skin grafting procedures and advanced grafting techniques with cultured skin stem cells. The majority of these leading techniques still retain some deficiencies during clinical use. Moreover, the regeneration of skin appendages after severe injuries remains a challenge in treatment.

These populations demonstrate great promise to positively influence neovascularization and wound repair.

Approach: U.S. Wound Registry data were examined retrospectively and assigned a clear outcome (healed, amputated, etc.). Significant variables were identified with bivariate analyses. A multivariable logistic regression model was created based on significant factors (p < 0.05) and tested on a hold-out sample of data. Out of 13,266 DFUs from the original dataset, 6,440 were eligible for analysis. The logistic regression model included 5,239 ulcers, of which 3,462 healed (66.1%). The 10% validation sample utilized 555 ulcers, of which 377 healed (67.9%). Results: Variables that significantly predicted healing were as follows: wound age (duration in days), wound size, number of concurrent wounds of any etiology, evidence of bioburden/infection, patient age, Wagner grade, being nonambulatory, renal dialysis, renal transplant, peripheral vascular disease, and patient hospitalization for any reason. Innovation: We present a validated stratification system, previously described as the Wound Healing Index (WHI), which predicts healing likelihood of patients with DFUs, incorporating patient- and wound-specific variables. Conclusion: The DFU WHI is a comprehensive and user-friendly validated predictive model for DFU healing. It can risk stratify patients enrolled in clinical research trials, stratify patient data for quality reporting and benchmarking activities, and identify patients most likely to require costly therapy to heal.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Multispecies microbial biofilms may contribute to wound chronicity by derailing the inherent reparative process of the host tissue. In the biofilm form, bacteria are encased within an extracellular polymeric substance and become recalcitrant to antimicrobials and host defenses. For biofilms of relevance to human health, there are two primary contributing factors: the microbial species involved and host response which, in turn, shapes microbial processes over time. This progressive interaction between microbial species and the host is an iterative process that helps evolve an acute-phase infection to a pathogenic chronic biofilm. Thus, long-term wound infection studies are needed to understand the longitudinal cascade of events that culminate into a pathogenic wound biofilm. Recent Advances: Our laboratory has recently published the first long-term (2 month) study of polymicrobial wound biofilm infection in a translationally valuable porcine wound model. Critical Issues: It is widely recognized that the porcine system represents the most translationally valuable approach to experimentally model human skin wounds. A meaningful experimental biofilm model must be in vivo, include mixed species of clinically relevant microbes, and be studied longitudinally long term. Cross-validation of such experimental findings with findings from biofilm-infected patient wounds is critically important. Future Directions: Additional value may be added to the experimental system described above by studying pigs with underlying health complications (e.g., metabolic syndrome), as is typically seen in patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Tissue grafts and flaps are used to reconstruct wounds from trauma, chronic disease, tumor extirpation, burns, and infection. Despite careful surgical planning and execution, reconstructive failure can occur due to poor wound beds, radiation, random flap necrosis, vascular insufficiency, or ischemia–reperfusion (IR). Traumatic avulsions and amputated composite tissues—compromised tissue—may fail from crush injury and excessively large sizes. While never intended, these complications result in tissue loss, additional surgery, accrued costs, and negative psychosocial patient effects. Recent Advances: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has demonstrated utility in the salvage of compromised grafts/flaps. It can increase the likelihood and effective size of composite graft survival, improve skin graft outcomes, and enhance flap survival. Mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects include increased oxygenation, improved fibroblast function, neovascularization, and amelioration of IR injury. Critical Issues: Common strategies for the compromised graft or flap include local wound care, surgical debridement, and repeated reconstruction. These modalities are associated with added costs, time, need for reoperation, morbidity, and psychosocial effects. Preservation of the amputated/avulsed tissues minimizes morbidity and maximizes the reconstructive outcome by salvaging the compromised tissue and obviating additional surgery. HBO is often overlooked as a potential tool that can limit these issues. Future Directions: Animal studies demonstrate a benefit of HBO in the treatment of compromised tissues. Clinical studies support these findings, but are limited to case reports and series. Further research is needed to provide multicenter prospective clinical studies and cost analyses comparing HBO to other adjunctive therapies in the treatment of compromised grafts/flaps.",

Current findings highlight the importance of stringent controls on protease expression and their topographic activities in cell proliferation, migration, and tissue homeostasis. Targeting elements in this cascading network may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for fibrotic diseases and chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Matrix-active proteases and their inhibitors orchestrate wound site tissue remodeling, cell migration, and proliferation. Indeed, the serine proteases urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue-type plasminogen activator (uPA/tPA) and their major phsyiological inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; serine protease inhibitor clade E member 1 [SERPINE1]), are upregulated in several cell types during injury repair. Coordinate expression of proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors in the wound bed provides a mechanism for fine control of focal proteolysis to facilitate matrix restructuring and cell motility in complex environments. Critical Issues: Cosmetic and tissue functional consequences of wound repair anomalies affect the quality of life of millions of patients in the United States alone. The development of novel therapeutics to manage individuals most affected by healing anomalies will likely derive from the identification of critical, translationally accessible, control elements in the wound site microenvironment. Future Directions: Activation of the PAI-1 gene early after wounding, its prominence in the repair transcriptome and varied functions suggest a key role in the global cutaneous injury response program. Targeting PAI-1 gene expression and/or PAI-1 function with molecular genetic constructs, neutralizing antibodies or small molecule inhibitors may provide a novel, therapeutically relevant approach, to manage the pathophysiology of wound healing disorders associated with deficient or excessive PAI-1 levels.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds are known to be a significant issue globally. Of concern in wounds are the numbers and types of residing microorganisms and the ability of the host's immune system to control their proliferation. Wound healing is impeded by colonizing microorganisms growing within the biofilm phenotypic state. In this state microorganisms are recalcitrant to routinely impeded by used antimicrobial interventions. Recent advances: Silver has been reported to demonstrate efficacy on planktonic microorganisms both within the in vitro and in vivo environments. However, when silver is incorporated into a wound dressing, its antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms within the in vivo environment remains contentious. Critical Issues: Unequivocal evidence of the efficacy of silver, and wound dressings containing silver, on biofilms in clinical situations is lacking. This is principally due to the deficiency of definite biofilm definitions, markers, and evidence in the chronic wound environment. Future Direction: Research studies demonstrating antimicrobial efficacy on in vitro biofilms can be used to generate data and information appropriate for extrapolation and applicability to the in vivo environment. It is very important that inventors of antimicrobial wound dressings ensure efficacy against both planktonic and sessile microorganisms, within the in vitro and in vivo environments.",

    "abstract": "Significance: A range of studies point to the efficacy of electrical stimulation (ES) in wound treatment, but the methodology of its application has not been determined to date. This article provides a critical review of the results of clinical trials published by researchers using high-voltage pulsed current (HVPC) to treat chronic wounds. In describing the methodology of the trials, the article gives special attention to electric stimulus parameters, the frequency of procedures and total treatment duration. Recent Advances: HVPC is a monophasic pulsed electric current that consists of double-peaked impulses (5-200 μs), at very high peak-current amplitude (2-2.5 A), and high voltage (up to 500 V), at a frequency of 1-125 pulses per second. HVPC can activate \"skin battery\" and cellular galvanotaxis, and improves blood flow and capillary density. Critical Issues: HVPC efficacy was evaluated in conservatively treated patients with diabetic foot, venous leg and pressure ulcers (PUs), and in some patients with surgically treated venous insufficiency. Future Directions: The efficacy of HVPC as one of several biophysical energies promoting venous leg ulcer (VLU) and PU healing has been confirmed. Additional studies are needed to investigate its effect on the healing of other types of soft tissue defects. Other areas that require more research include the identification of the therapeutic effect of HVPC on infected wounds, the determination of the efficacy of cathodal versus anodal stimulation, and the minimal daily/weekly duration of HVPC required to ensure optimal promotion of wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: During wound healing of the skin, keratinocytes should move over while still adhering to their underlying matrix. Thus, mechanistic insights into the wound-healing process require an understanding of the forms and functions of keratinocyte matrix adhesions, specifically focal contacts and hemidesmosomes, and their components. Recent Advances: Although the structure and composition of focal contacts and hemidesmosomes are relatively well defined, the functions of their components are only now being delineated using mouse genetic models and knockdown approaches in cell culture systems. Remarkably, both focal contact and hemidesmosomal proteins appear involved in determining the speed and directional migration of epidermal cells by modulating several signal transduction pathways. Critical Issues: Although many publications are centered on focal contacts, their existence in tissues such as the skin is controversial. Nonetheless, focal contact proteins are central to mechanisms that regulate skin cell motility. Conversely, hemidesmosomes have been identified in intact skin but whether hemidesmosomal components play a positive regulatory function in keratinocyte motility remains debated in the field. Future Directions: Defective wound healing is a developing problem in the aged, hospitalized and diabetic populations. Hence, deriving new insights into the molecular roles of matrix adhesion proteins in wound healing is a prerequisite to the development of novel therapeutics to enhance tissue repair and regeneration.",

Although different types of dressings exist, there is no consensus regarding optimal dressing type on donor site care to promote healing, reduce pain, and improve patients' comfort. Approach: This prospective, single-center clinical trial evaluated the performance of nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) wound dressing (FibDex® by UPM-Kymmene Corporation) for treatment of donor sites compared with a polylactide-based copolymer dressing. The study enrolled 24 patients requiring skin grafting with mean age of 49 ± 18. The primary outcome measure was wound healing time. Secondary outcomes, the epithelialization, subjective pain, the scar appearance assessed using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), and skin elasticity and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), were evaluated at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed between NFC and copolymer dressings regarding wound healing time, epithelialization, experience of pain, or TEWL. Significant differences were observed in the POSAS results for thickness and vascularity in the Observer score, in the favor of NFC over copolymer dressing. Moreover, skin elasticity was significantly improved with NFC dressing in terms of viscoelasticity and elastic modulus at 1 month postoperatively. Innovation: NFC dressing is a new, green sustainable product for wound treatment without animal or human-origin components. Conclusion: NFC dressing provides efficient wound healing at skin graft donor sites and is comparable or even preferable compared with the copolymer dressing.",

The healing time and scar area were noted. Results: There was a statistical decrease in the healing time in ASC, BSC, and skin graft groups (p<0.05). However, the scar was smaller in the PBS group (p<0.05). The α-SMA levels were statistically lower in ASC, BSC, and graft groups (p<0.05). The FGF levels were statistically higher in ASC and BSC groups (p<0.05). The differentiation of the injected MSCs to endothelial cells and keratinocytes was observed.

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds are a prevalent and costly problem in the United States. Improved treatments are needed to heal these wounds and prevent serious complications such as infection and amputation. Recent Advances: In wound healing, as in other areas of medicine, technologies that have the potential to regenerate as opposed to repair tissue are gaining ground. These include customizable nanofiber matrices incorporating novel materials; a variety of autologous and allogeneic cell types at various stages of differentiation (e.g., pluripotent, terminally differentiated); peptides; proteins; small molecules; RNA inhibitors; and gene therapies. Critical Issues: Wound healing is a logical target for regenerative medicine due to the accessibility and structure of skin, the regenerative nature of healing, the lack of good limb salvage treatments, and the current use of cell therapies. However, more extensive knowledge of pathophysiologic targets is needed to inform regenerative strategies, and new technologies must demonstrate value in terms of outcomes and related health economic measures to achieve successful market access and penetration. Future Directions: Due to similarities in cell pathways and developmental mechanisms, regenerative technologies developed in one therapeutic area may be applicable to others. Approaches that proceed from human genomic or other big data sources to models are becoming increasingly common and will likely suggest novel therapeutic avenues. To fully capitalize on the advances in regenerative medicine, studies must demonstrate the value of new therapies in identified patient populations, and sponsors must work with regulatory agencies to develop appropriate dossiers supporting timely approval.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a major and growing public health problem. They pose difficulties in clinical practice in both diagnosis and management. Bacterial interactions on the skin surface are important in the pathophysiology of DFU and may contribute to a delay in healing. Fully identifying bacteria present in these wounds is difficult with traditional culture methods. New molecular tools, however, have greatly contributed to our understanding of the role of the cutaneous microbiota in DFU. Recent Advances: Molecular technologies revealed new information concerning how bacteria are organized in DFU. This has led to the concept of \"functionally equivalent pathogroups,\" meaning that certain bacterial species which are usually nonpathogenic (or at least incapable of maintaining a chronic infection on their own) may coaggregate symbiotically in a pathogenic biofilm and act synergistically to cause a chronic infection. The distribution of pathogens in multispecies biofilms is nonrandom. The high bacterial diversity is probably related to the development of a microbial biofilm that is irreversibly attached to the wound matrix. Critical Issues: Using molecular techniques requires a financial outlay for high-cost equipment. They are still too time-consuming to perform and reporting is too delayed for them to be used in routine practice. Finally, they do not differentiate live from dead or pathogenic from nonpathogenic microorganisms. Future Directions: Molecular tools have better documented the composition and organization of the skin flora. Further advances are required to elucidate which among the many bacteria in the DFU flora are likely to be pathogens, rather than colonizers.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) emanate from burn-injured tissue and enter systemic circulation. Locally and systemically, they activate pattern-recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), to stimulate cytokine secretion, which in the severest burns typically results in extreme systemic cytokine levels, a dysfunctioning immune system, infection, impaired healing, and excessive scarring. This system-wide disruption of homeostasis can advance to life-threatening, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Knowledge of DAMP- and PAMP-TLR signaling may lead to treatments that ameliorate local and systemic inflammation and reduce scarring and other burn injury sequela. Recent Advances: Many PAMPs and DAMPs, the TLRs they activate, and their downstream signaling molecules have been shown to contribute to local and systemic inflammation and tissue damage following burn injury. Critical Issues: Whether TLR-pathway-targeting treatments applied at different times postburn injury might improve scarring remains an open question. The evaluation of this question requires the use of appropriate preclinical and clinical burn models carried out until after mature scar has formed. Future Directions: After TLR-pathway-targeting treatments are evaluated in porcine burn wound models and their safety is demonstrated, they can be tested in proof-of-concept clinical burn wound models.",

Approach: Prospective cohort study of diabetic patients with foot ulcers seen in multidisciplinary foot clinics across Adelaide or admitted to the Vascular Surgery Unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital between February 2017 and September 2018. A total of 131 patients were included in the study. Plasma serum levels of vitamins A, C, D, and E, copper, zinc, and ferritin were measured. Demographic and clinical data, including BMI, smoking status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and WIfI score, were obtained. Results: The most prevalent nutritional deficiency found was vitamin D affecting 55.7% of patients. Suboptimal levels of vitamin C affected 73% of patients, comprising marginal levels in 22.2% and deficient levels in 50.8%. Zinc deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, and low ferritin levels were present in 26.9%, 10.9%, and 5.9% of patients, respectively. There was no correlation between BMI, grip strength, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, or smoking status with micronutrient deficiency. Increased severity of diabetic foot disease was associated with lower vitamin C levels (p = 0.02). Innovation: This study has demonstrated that the deficiency of micronutrients, especially vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin A, is common in diabetic patients with foot ulcers. Conclusions: The prevalence of micronutrient deficiency is high in a diabetic population with foot ulcers/wounds. Special concerns regarding the high prevalence of vitamin C and zinc deficiency, given their roles in wound healing. Although further research needs to be performed to determine the clinical implications of our findings, micronutrient deficiency should be considered in diabetic patients with foot wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Burns are debilitating, life threatening, and difficult to assess and manage. Recent advances in assessment and management have occurred since a comprehensive review of the care of patients with severe burns was last published, which may influence research and clinical practice. Recent Advances: Recent advances have occurred in the understanding of burn pathophysiology, which has led to the identification of potential biomarkers of burn severity, such as protein C. There is new evidence about the potential superiority of natural colloids over crystalloids during fluid resuscitation, and new evidence about components of initial and perioperative management, including an improved understanding of pain following burns. Critical Issues: The limitations of the clinical examination highlight the need for imaging and biomarkers to assist in estimations of burn severity. Fluid resuscitation reduces mortality, although there is conjecture over the ideal method. The subsequent perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and the evidence for preventing and treating pain, infection, and fluid overload while maximizing wound healing potential is described. Future Directions: Promising developments are ongoing in imaging technology, histopathology, biomarkers, and wound healing adjuncts such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, topical negative pressure therapy, stem cell treatments, and skin substitutes. The greatest benefit from further research on management of patients with burns would most likely be derived from the elucidation of optimal fluid resuscitation protocols, pain management protocols, and surgical techniques from randomized controlled trials.",

Understanding the mechanisms of dysregulated innate immunity in fibrosis and SSc will provide opportunities for therapeutic interventions using novel agents and repurposed existing drugs. Recent Advances: New insights from genomic and genetic studies implicate components of innate immune signaling such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), downstream signaling intermediates, and endogenous inhibitors, in fibrosis in SSc. Recent studies distinguish innate immune signaling in tissue-resident myofibroblasts and bone marrow-derived immune cells and define their roles in the development and persistence of tissue fibrosis. Critical Issues: Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other PRR mechanisms occurs in resident nonimmune cells within injured tissue microenvironments. These cells respond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as tenascin-C that are recognized as danger signals, and elicit matrix production, cytokine secretion, and myofibroblast transformation and survival. When these responses persist due to constitutive TLR activation or impaired termination by endogenous inhibitors, they interfere with fibrosis resolution. The genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of these phenomena in the context of fibrosis are under current investigation. Future Directions: Precise delineation of the pathogenic DAMPs, their interaction with TLRs and other PRRs, the downstream signaling pathways and transcriptional events, and the fibroblast-specific regulation and function of endogenous inhibitors of innate immunity, will form the foundation for innovative targeted therapies to block fibrosis by reestablishing balanced innate immune signaling in fibroblasts.",

Impaired wound repair, such as chronic wounds and pathological scars, presents a major health and economic burden worldwide. To date, efficient targeted treatment for these wound disorders is still lacking, which is largely due to our limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these diseases. Research driven around discovering new therapies for these complications is, therefore, an urgent need. Recent Advances: The vast majority of the human genome is transcribed to RNAs that lack protein-coding capacity. Intensive research in the recent decade has revealed that these non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) function as important regulators of cellular physiology and pathology, which makes them promising therapeutic and diagnostic entities. Critical Issues: A class of short ncRNAs, microRNAs, has been found to be indispensable for all the phases of skin wound healing and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of wound complications. The role of long ncRNAs (lncRNA) in skin wound healing remains largely unexplored. Recent studies revealed the essential role of lncRNAs in epidermal differentiation and stress response, indicating their potential importance for skin wound healing, which warrants future research. Future Directions: An investigation of ncRNAs will add new layers of complexity to our understanding of normal skin wound healing as well as to the pathogenesis of wound disorders. Development of ncRNA-based biomarkers and treatments is an interesting and important avenue for future research on wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: While tissue injury and repair are known to involve adaptive immunity, the profile of lymphocytes involved and their contribution to dermal scarring remain unclear. We hypothesized that restoration of T cell deficiency attenuates dermal scarring. Approach: We assessed the temporal-spatial distribution of T lymphocytes and their subtypes during the physiological dermal wound repair process in mice. Also, we compared the scarring outcomes between wild-type (WT) and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, which are lymphocyte deficient. Complementary gain-of-function experiments were performed by adoptively transferring lymphocyte subsets to validate their contribution to tissue repair in wounded SCID mice. Results: CD4+ T lymphocytes were present within dermal wounds of WT mice beginning on day 1 and remained through day 30. Wounds of SCID mice exhibited accelerated closure, increased inflammation, limited neovascularization, and exacerbated scarring compared with WT mice. Conversely, transfer of either mixed B and T lymphocytes or CD4+ lymphocytes alone into SCID mice resulted in moderated healing with less inflammation, collagen deposition, and scarring than control SCID wounds. In contrast, transfer of other lymphocyte subsets, including helper T lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+CD25-), CD8+ T cells and B cells, or regulatory T lymphocytes (CD4+CD25+CD127low), did not reduce scar. Innovation: The finding that lymphocytes delay wound healing but reduce scar is novel and provides new insights into how dermal scarring is regulated. Conclusion: Our data support a suppressive role for CD4+ T cells against inflammation and collagen deposition, with protective effects in early-stage dermal wound healing. These data implicate adaptive immunity in the regulation of scarring phenotypes.",

Critical Issues: There is a lack of direct causation and evidence of the role that biofilms play in persistent wounds, which complicates research on new treatment options, since it is still unknown which factors dominate. For this reason, several different in vitro wound models that mimic the biofilm infections observed in chronic wounds and other chronic infections have been created. These different models are, among other purposes, used to test a variety of wound care products. However, chronic wounds are highly complex, and several different factors must be taken into consideration along with the infection, including physiochemical and human-supplemented factors. Furthermore, the limitations of using in vitro models, such as the lack of a responsive immune system should always be given due consideration. Future Directions: Present understandings of all the elements and interactions that take place within chronic wounds are incomplete. As our insight of in vivo chronic wounds continues to expand, so too must the in vitro models used to mimic these infections evolve and adapt to new knowledge.",

By identifying underlying mechanisms of wound repair-for instance, tissue mechanics' role in fibrosis or cell populations that modulate wound healing and scarring-novel molecular targets may be defined. This Advances in Wound Care Forum issue includes reviews of scientific literature and original research from the Hagey Laboratory for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine at Stanford and its alumni, including developing approaches for encouraging wound healing, minimizing fibrosis, and coaxing regeneration. Critical Issues: Wound healing problems reflect an enormous and rapidly expanding clinical burden. The issues of both under- and over-healing wound outcomes will continue to expand as their underlying causes (e.g., diabetes) grow. Targeted treatments are needed to enable wound repair with functional tissue restoration and decreased scarring. Future Directions: Basic scientists will continue to refine understanding of factors driving undesirable wound outcomes. These discoveries are beginning to be translated and, in the coming years, will hopefully form the foundation for antiscarring drugs and other wound therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Significance: In adult mammals, spontaneous repair of a cutaneous wound occurs slowly and leaves a scar with skin adnexa deficiencies. To accelerate cutaneous wound-healing rates and avoid scar formation, current studies have focused on regenerative therapies. Recent Advances: Emerging therapeutics for regenerative wound healing often focus on the use of growth factors and stem cells. However, these therapeutic approaches have limited routine clinical use due to high costs and technical requirements. Critical Issue: Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the signaling pathways for cutaneous wound healing and neogenic synthesis of the skin components is important for identification of novel targets for the development of regenerative wound-healing agents. Future Directions: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a well-known key player for enhancement of the overall healing process involving tissue regeneration via crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Strategies that activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via modulation of the pathway-controlling regulatory factors could provide effective therapeutic approaches for regenerative wound healing.",

Compromise of this barrier presents in the context of inflammatory skin conditions and in chronic wounds. Skin conditions arising from dysfunctional inflammatory pathways severely compromise the quality of life of patients and have a high economic impact on the U.S. health care system. The development of a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that can disrupt skin inflammation is imperative to successfully modulate this inflammation with therapies. Recent Advances: Many advances in the understanding of skin inflammation have occurred during the past decade, including the development of multiple new pharmaceuticals. Mechanical force application has been greatly advanced clinically. Bioscaffolds also promote healing, while reducing scarring. Critical Issues: Various skin inflammatory conditions provide a framework for analysis of our understanding of the phases of successful wound healing. The large burden of chronic wounds on our society continues to focus attention on the chronic inflammatory state induced in many of these skin conditions. Future Directions: Better preclinical models of disease states such as chronic wounds, coupled with enhanced diagnostic abilities of human skin, will allow a better understanding of the mechanism of action. This will lead to improved treatments with biologics and other modalities such as the strategic application of mechanical forces and scaffolds, which ultimately results in better outcomes for our patients.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Increasing development of experimental animal models has allowed for the study of scar formation. However, many pathophysiological unknowns remain in the longest stage of healing, the remodeling stage, which may continue for a year or more. The wound healing process results in different types of scarring classified as normal or pathological depending on failures at each stage. Failures can also occur during wound remodeling, but the molecular mechanisms driving the wound remodeling process have yet to be investigated. Recent Advances: While the current understanding of wound repair is based on investigations of acute healing, these experimental models have informed knowledge of key components of remodeling. This review examines the components that contribute to collagen organization and the final scar, including cell types, their regulation, and signaling pathways. Dysregulation in any one of these components causes pathologic healing. Critical Issues and Future Directions: As wounds continue to remodel months to years after reepithelialization, new models to better understand long-term remodeling will be critical for improving healing outcomes. Further investigation of the contributions of fibroblasts and cell signaling pathways involved during remodeling as well as their potential failures may inform new approaches in promoting regenerative healing beyond reepithelialization.",

Effective diagnosis, assessment, and management rely on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (“guidelines”). This study aims to describe and compare international guidelines on lymphedema diagnosis, assessment, and management. Recent Advances: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Systematic searches of electronic literature databases and the web were completed in December 2020 for lymphedema guidelines published in English since 2000. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)-II reporting checklist. Synthesis took a narrative approach to compare guideline recommendations and associated levels of evidence. Critical Issues: This systematic review of 1,564 articles and 159 web pages yielded 14 guidelines. All guidelines were from high-income countries. Ten focused exclusively on lymphedema, and four on cancer. Most (n = 13) guidelines recommended an integrated medical, psychological assessment, and physical examination, with a limb volume measurement of >10% in the affected limb compared, confirming a lymphedema diagnosis. Recommended management involved Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) followed by self-management using skincare, self-lymphatic drainage massage, exercise, and compression. Future Directions: The underlying etiology of lymphedema appeared to make little difference to guideline recommendations regarding care. High-quality guidelines are available to guide lymphedema care. However, their suitability for low-resource settings is unclear.",

Breaches in skin integrity are often encountered in the patient health care journey, owing to intrinsic health issues or to various procedures and medical devices used. The time has come to move clinical practice beyond mere awareness of medical adhesive-related skin injury and toward improved care and outcomes. Recent Advances: Methods developed in research settings allow quantitative assessments of skin damage based on the measurement of baseline skin properties. These properties become altered by stress and over time. Assessment methods typically used by the cosmetic industry to compare product performance could offer new possibilities to improve clinical practice by providing better information on the status of patient skin. This review summarizes available skin assessment methods as well as specific patient risks for skin damage. Critical Issues: Patients in health care settings may be at risk for skin damage owing to predisposing medical conditions, health status, medications taken, and procedures or devices used in their treatment. Skin injuries come as an additional burden to these medical circumstances and could be prevented. Technology should be leveraged to improve care, help maintain patient skin health, and better characterize functional wound closure. Future Directions: Skin testing methods developed to evaluate cosmetic products or assess damage caused by occupational exposure can provide detailed, quantitative information on the integrity of skin. Such methods have the potential to guide prevention and treatment efforts to improve the care of patients suffering from skin integrity issues while in the health care system.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed the use of topical oxygen therapy (TOT) as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Wagner 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers. Approach: Following a literature search of eligible studies from 2010 onward, four RCTs were included. Studies were analyzed for patient and wound characteristics, outcomes, risk of bias, and quality of the evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A random-effects meta-analysis for complete wound healing was carried out due to statistical heterogeneity of included studies. Results: Risk of bias judgment (RoB2 analysis) resulted in one low-risk trial and three trials with some risk. One study was determined to be the origin of the statistical heterogeneity. Pooled results showed statistical significance with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.37; p = 0.021). Sensitivity analysis, based on imputed values for missing outcomes, demonstrated that both the RR and 95% CIs changed little. The GRADE ratings for each domain were as follows: (a) risk of bias: moderate (3); (b) imprecision: moderate (2), high (1); (c) inconsistency: low (2), high (1); (d) indirectness: moderate (2), high (1); and (e) publication bias: moderate (1), high (2). Overall, the evidence was moderate. Innovation: Our study shows that TOT is a viable diabetic foot ulcer therapy. Conclusions: These data support the use of TOT for the treatment of chronic Wagner 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcers in the absence of infection and ischemia.",

Available pharmacologic treatments fail to achieve complete healing in many patients. Recent studies and investigational treatments have highlighted the potential of modulating wound pH in DFU. Recent Advances: Data from in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies highlight the role of pH in the pathophysiology of DFU, and topical administration of pH-lowering agents have shown promise as a therapeutic strategy for diabetic wounds. In this critical review, we describe the role of pH in DFU pathophysiology and present selected low-molecular-weight and hydrogel-based pH-modulating systems for wound healing and infection control in diabetic wounds. Critical Issues: The molecular mechanisms leading to pH alterations in diabetic wounds are complex and may differ between in vitro models, animal models of diabetes, and the human pathophysiology. Wound pH-lowering bandages for DFU therapy must be tested in established animal models of diabetic wound healing and patients with diabetes to establish a comprehensive benefit-risk profile. Future Directions: As our understanding of the role of pH in the pathophysiology of diabetic wounds is deepening, new treatments for this therapeutic target are being developed and will be tested in preclinical and clinical studies. These therapeutic systems will establish a target product profile for pH-lowering treatments such as an optimal pH profile for each wound healing stage. Thus, controlling wound bed pH could become a powerful tool to accelerate chronic diabetic wound healing.",

It has been routinely demonstrated that NPWT has superior wound healing outcomes compared to previous standard of care therapies. However, the technique involves some challenges related to each of the components that comprise the therapy. The purpose of this article is to highlight the challenges, introduce the recent advancements and discuss about the future directions in NPWT systems. Recent Advances: New techniques and materials have been developed to improve the currently used NPWT systems with promising results when utilized with appropriate indications. Many advancements have been introduced in modes of negative pressure delivery, pumps, interface dressings, adhesive dressings, and tubing technology. Critical Issues: An optimal NPWT system would avoid the common problems such as failure to deliver negative pressure due to loss of an airtight seal or tissue ingrowth into the interface dressing causing painful dressing changes and bleeding. Other challenges include infection control and patient pain and discomfort that may contribute to noncompliance. Future Directions: Many studies have been performed to evaluate the optimal combination of settings and components in various wounds; however, there is still no clear \"best\" answer for many specific patient-wound scenarios. Novel and emerging tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches could potentially be utilized in the future NPWT systems and thus, this review will discuss some novel ideas for future considerations.",

This review article aims to provide a concise overview of the pathophysiology and management of pathologic scarring for clinicians and scientists alike. Recent Advances: Contemporary research in the field has identified aberrations in TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways as key drivers of pathologic scar formation; indeed, this pathway is targeted by many treatment modalities and translational investigations currently underway. Although intralesional injection of corticosteroids has been the gold standard in the treatment of pathologic scarring, studies show greater treatment efficacy with the use of combination injections such as triamcinolone/5-fluorouracil (TAC-5FU) and triamcinolone/botulinum toxin (TAC-BTX). Adjunctive therapies including ablative fractional CO2/Er-YAG and non-ablative PDL lasers, microneedling, and carboxytherapy have shown encouraging results in small cohort studies. Translational investigations involving the use of nanogels, RNA interference, and small molecules targeting TGF-β /SMAD pathways are also currently underway and hold promise for the future. Critical Issues: The heterogeneous nature of hypertrophic scars (HTS) and keloids poses significant challenges in formulating standardized treatment and assessment protocols thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Future Directions: Rigorous clinical trials into the individual and synergistic effects of these therapies would be ideal before any definitive conclusions or evidence-based treatment recommendations can be made; due to the heterogeneity of the pathology and patient population, well-conducted cohort studies may be the next best option.",

Approach: Open-label, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04922463) on chronic VLUs at two home care organizations in the Netherlands. All three groups received SOC for 12 weeks or until healing. Additionally, treatment groups received direct-CAP once (1x direct-CAP) or twice (2x direct-CAP) a week, at specialized wound care facilities and the patients' residences. Primary outcome was percentage of wounds healed. Secondary outcomes included wound area reduction and adverse events. Results: 46 patients were randomly allocated to receive SOC only (n=15), SOC + direct-CAP once a week (n=17) or SOC + direct-CAP twice a week (n=14). A higher percentage of wounds healed within 12 weeks in the treatment groups: 53.3% (1x direct-CAP, p=0.16) and 61.5% (2x direct-CAP, p=0.08) vs 25.0% (control). The largest wound area reduction was obtained with 2x direct-CAP (95.2%, p=0.07), followed by 1x direct-CAP (63.9%, p=0.58), vs control (52.8%). Absolute wound area reduced significantly compared with baseline in both treatment groups (p≤0.001), not in control (p=0.11). No device-related serious adverse events occurred. Innovation: Direct-CAP applied once or twice a week could substantially improve wound healing of VLUs in primary care. Conclusion: Together with other clinical safety and efficacy data, these results support the integration of direct-CAP as a valuable therapy for complex wounds.",

    "abstract": "Background: Wound healing is a process made up of several phases, including hemostasis/inflammation, proliferation, and scar formation/remodeling. An array of growth factors is produced during each of these phases that helps direct the repair process. The Problem: Most of the information we have about the biological actions of growth factors are from studies examining a growth factor in isolation. However, growth factors are known to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and these associations influence cell behavior. Details about these interactions within the complex and continuously changing wound environment are not well understood and are likely to be very important during repair. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: Several types of growth factor/ECM interactions have been described that could impact wound healing. The ECM can interact directly with growth factors, offering protection from degradation and controlling bioactivity of the growth factor. Portions of the ECM can bind to growth factor receptors, and cell–ECM binding can influence growth factor receptor signaling. Growth factors can also control production and degradation of the ECM; therefore, the relationship between growth factors and ECM is bidirectional. Clinical Care Relevance: New information about the relationship between growth factors and ECM could be used to optimize growth factor-based therapies or lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for wound care. Conclusion: Growth factor–ECM interactions likely have a strong impact on the rate and quality of healing. A better understanding of the relationship between these classes of molecules and how it can be exploited to enhance healing is needed.",

    "abstract": "Healing chronic wounds is an ongoing challenge for clinicians and poses a serious public health burden. Electrical stimulation (ES), broadly defined as the application of electrical current via electrodes placed on the skin adjacent to or directly within the wound, has been proposed as a therapeutic modality over a century ago, and recent advances in understanding the biology of electrical phenomena in the skin have rekindled an interest in this modality.Despite evidence that has shown ES to be effective for wound healing, it has been slow to gain acceptance in the United States. Also, there has been no consensus in terms of standardization of parameters to devise a systematic protocol for implementation of this technology.The epidermis maintains a \"skin battery\" that generates an endogenous electric field and current flow when wounded. Experimental models have demonstrated that most of the cell types within the wound can sense an electric field in the range of that endogenously generated in the wound, and respond with a variety of biological and functional responses that can contribute to healing. Multiple animal wound models have demonstrated enhancement of a number of parameters of healing when ES is exogenously supplied.Clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of multiple forms of ES for improving healing in a wide variety of human chronic wounds. In 2002 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved reimbursement for use of ES in a clinical setting for certain chronic wounds.THERE REMAIN MANY VOIDS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE: clinical evidence is limited by deficiencies in the design of many of the trials, a multiplicity of ES application modes and waveforms used in trials prevent selection of an optimal modality, and lack of uniformity in reporting ES dosages leave us not much advanced from our clinical knowledge base a decade ago.",

Within a relatively short time frame, research has changed from studying individual genes and proteins to analyzing entire genomes and proteomes. Approach: In this article, we summarize the technologies and concepts that form the basis of this functional genomics approach. Results: Microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to investigate many different aspects of the cell, including DNA mutations, histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin structure, transcription, and translation on a genome-wide level. In addition, mass spectrometry technologies have undergone significant development and currently enable us to globally profile protein levels, protein–protein interactions, post-translational protein modifications, and metabolites. Innovation and Conclusion: The integration of information from the various processes that occur within a cell provides a more complete picture of how genes give rise to biological functions, and will ultimately help us to understand the biology of organisms, in both health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Re-establishment of a functional vascular network is a critical component of successful wound repair. One of the most potent pro-angiogenic agents is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which, from a basic science and pre-clinical perspective, seems ideal for the therapeutic stimulation of blood vessel growth in non-healing wounds.Current strategies to improve the dysfunctional angiogenesis that occurs in non-healing wounds are inadequate with regard to the nature and magnitude of the clinical problem. However, VEGF therapy has so far been unsuccessful in promoting healing in the clinic. More effective means of delivery to the wound, which take into account the biochemical and spatio-temporal aspects of angiogenesis, may be necessary to realize VEGF's therapeutic potential. Reviewed approaches for the regulation of wound angiogenesis include: targeting regulators of intracellular VEGF signaling, making use of collagen-binding VEGF fusion proteins for increased retention in the wound, and implantation of heterogeneous scaffold systems for spatial control of angiogenesis with simultaneous use of VEGF and its inhibitor.To maximize efficacy of therapeutic VEGF, it may be necessary to also target its intracellular inhibitory mechanisms. Immobilizing VEGF to the wound matrix may increase its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Gaining spatial control of angiogenesis opens up possibilities for advanced directed therapy. The reviewed studies present innovative approaches to in vivo directed modulation of angiogenesis utilizing VEGF biology which can, if taken further and validated in human subjects, have significant impact on clinical wound care in the future.",

    "abstract": "Problem: Infection is a major problem in the health and wellbeing of patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical facilities as well as the homecare patients and the general public. According to Scientia Advisors, wound care costs the healthcare system over $7 billion in 2009. After adding the cost associated with potential complications such as infections, extended physician care, and lengthy hospital stays, the annual wound care expenditures well exceeded over $20 billion.1 There are 20 million reported cases of diabetes per year and more every day. Because of the fact that leg ulcers are the number one health problem of men coupled with the rise in drug resistance of infections, the importance of providing the professional and the public with relatively simple and affordable wound care is of extreme importance. Often the wounds can become chronic wounds, which then result in long-term nursing expense in time and supplies or, worse yet, can result in expensive amputations ranging from $5000 to $40,000 per patient. Solution: There are many dressing options now available for treating wounds with components such as glycerin, honey, salt, and many other natural products, with some dressings being more appropriate than others. In 1988, a patented glycerin-based dressing was introduced to the market, called Elasto-Gel™.2 New Technology: Elasto-Gel™ is a glycerin-based gel sheet (65%) combined with a hydrophilic polymer that causes the sheet to absorb the exudate from the wound and simultaneously release the glycerin from the gel, which adds many benefits to the wound for excellent healing outcomes. The gel sheet is 1/8th of an inch thick with a four-way stretch backing. It has the ability to absorb 3–4 times its own weight of fluids. The dressing will not dry out or allow the exudate to dry out, thus keeping the dressing from becoming bonded to the wound or the surrounding tissue. It does not have adhesive properties and, therefore, will not cause damage to the wound bed or periwound area upon dressing removal. Because of the thickness, the product provides excellent cushion and padding support. It has been also proven to be bacteriostatic/fungistatic. (Bacteriostatic is the ability to restrain the development or reproduction of bacteria.3) Product Technology: Glycerin is a huamectant by definition and has been recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Humectants attract, bind, and hold moisture to the site of application. The actual concentration of glycerin in a wound dressing is indicative of the ability to absorb excess moisture. Exudate management is an important function of topical treatment. The ability to absorb drainage and prevent pooling of exudate in the wound or on the surrounding skin are attributes specific to high glycerin content. Perhaps, the most significant advantage of the glycerin-based hydrogel sheet is its impact on wound bioburden and pathogenic organisms.4 Glycerin is a simple three-carbon tri-alcohol and is a natural humectant. It is used as a carrier in many medicines and as plasticizer in gelatin gel capsules. Glycerin is a component of cosmetics, conditioners, soaps, foods, and other common products. It is a component of mono-, di-, and triglycerides naturally occurring in the body. These glycerides and glycerin are constantly reacted with each other by the natural enzymes and reversed with the natural metabolic processes already present in the body. Any glycerin that may be absorbed into the body fluid is rapidly diluted in these fluids and is no longer toxic but is metabolized as another component of the food chain. It is well known that glycerin in high concentration will exhibit dehydrating effect on many systems including living cells by the commonly known process of osmosis. (Osmosis: the flow or diffusion that takes place through a semipermable membrane, as of living cell, typically separating a solvent such as water, thus bringing about equilibrium conditions.5) It has been shown that glycerin at high concentration will be cytotoxic to all cells that have been tested if they are exposed long enough. These properties of glycerin have been recognized by the European Skin Bank, where they use 85% glycerin solutions to store cadaver skin at ∼42F, and can be used for potential wound coverings. The cadaver skin that has been prepared by this method has been available since 1994.6 The concern for safety resulted in a three-day international synmposium7 with emphasis on glycerin-preserved cadaver skin providing healthy environment for the preserved skin to be successfully accepted without rejection, having no complications of infection and providing excellent healing outcomes and minimal scaring. Additional research by Dr. David P. Mackie of the Red Cross Hospital, The Netherlands, reported that using 85% glycerin solutions had slow bactericidal effects and also showed virocidal activity on several types of viruses.8 Dr. Hoekstra has observed that within 2 hours after application of Elasto-Gel™, the inflammatory reaction is reduced.9 Vandeputte, Belgium, showed that wounds covered with Elasto-Gel™ had fewer myofibroblasts than those covered with hydrocolloid.10 It has been proposed that myofibroblasts in high concentrations contribute to the formation of hypertrophic and keloid scars. As noted earlier, there is less scar formation when glycerin-based gel sheets are used. The data sited here have shown that glycerin and glycerin-based products are effective antimicrobial agents with less side effects. Many verbal reports along with personal communications have indicated that applying glycerin-based gel sheets to stalled wounds, some 15–20-year-old chronic wounds, resulted in healing in 1–20 weeks (data/case studies on file). Indications for Use: Elasto-Gel™ has been approved for all types of wounds, that is, pressure ulcers, acute and chronic wounds, diabetic wounds, traumatic wounds, dermatology wounds, cancer tumors, and first- and second-degree burns, to name a few. Because of the product's features and benefits, it may be used on a variety of wounds. Because of its padding properties, it may be also used as a preventative product over bony prominence areas so that wounds do not occur. The glycerin properties act as a skin substitute and may also be used for scar reduction. Caution: Elasto-Gel™ is not approved for third-degree burns as no dressing has been approved by the FDA for this type of wound.",

    "abstract": "A review of therapeutic effects in preclinical and clinical studies suggests that concordance between large animal (pig=78%), small laboratory animal (53%) and in vitro (57%) results with those observed in humans is only partial. Pig models of wound healing provide major advantages over other animal models. Since the vast majority of wound-healing research is done in rodents and in vitro, the low concordance rate is a significant impediment to research that will have any clinical impact.To generate clinically relevant experimental data, hypothesis generation should begin, or at least involve human wound tissue samples. Such tissue could be used to test a predetermined hypothesis generated based on, say, murine data. Alternatively, such tissue could be analyzed using high-throughput cell biology techniques (e.g., genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics) to identify novel mechanisms involved in human wounds. Once the hypothesis has been formulated and confirmed using human samples, identification of these same mechanisms in animals represents a valid approach that could be used for more in-depth investigations and experimental manipulations not feasible with humans.This consensus statement issued by the Wound Healing Society symposium strongly encourages all wound researchers to involve human wound tissue validation studies to make their animal and cell biology studies more translationally and clinically significant.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Skin wounds cause great distress and are a huge economic burden, particularly with an increasingly aging population that heals poorly. There is an urgent need for better therapies that improve repair. Intracellular signaling pathways that regulate wound repair are activated by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines released at the wound. In addition, endogenous electric fields (EFs) are generated by epithelia in response to injury and are an important cue that coordinates cell behavior at wounds. Electrical stimulation (ES), therefore, holds the potential to be effective therapeutically in treating wounds. Recent Advances: ES of wounds is an old idea based on observations of the natural occurrence of EF at wound sites. However, it is now receiving increasing attention, because (1) the underpinning mechanisms are being clarified; (2) devices that measure skin wound currents are in place; and (3) medical devices that apply EF to poorly healing wounds are in clinical use with promising results. Critical Issues: Several signaling proteins transduce the EF influence to cells. However, a bigger picture of the EF-proteome is needed in order to understand this complex process and target it in a controlled manner. Future Directions: Dissecting the signaling pathways driving electrical wound healing will allow further identification of key molecular switches that control the cellular response to EFs. These findings herald the development of a new concept, the use of hydrogel electrodes impregnated with small molecules that target signaling pathways to explore the potential of dual electric-pharmacological therapies to repair wounds.",

A working group, consisting of 17 representatives from all professional societies involved in wound care, tackled five controversial issues in acute-wound care, as provided by any caregiver throughout the whole chain of care. Critical Issues: The guidelines contain 38 recommendations, based on best available evidence, additional expert considerations, and patient experiences. In summary, primarily closed wounds need no cleansing; acute open wounds are best cleansed with lukewarm (drinkable) water; apply the WHO pain ladder to choose analgesics against continuous wound pain; use lidocaine or prilocaine infiltration anesthesia for wound manipulations or closure; primarily closed wounds may not require coverage with a dressing; use simple dressings for open wounds; and give your patient clear instructions about how to handle the wound.

Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a wound healing therapy that utilizes a dressing system that continuously or intermittently applies a negative pressure to the wound surface. Recent Advances: VAC stimulates wound healing, but data on changes in the bacterial load and changes in the bacterial spectrum are scarce. Critical Issues: While VAC supposedly removes bacteria from the treated wounds and therefore reduces the risk of infection, this relationship has not yet been clinically proven. If VAC increases the bacterial load instead of decreasing it, then this may be a reason not to use VAC on certain types of wounds. Only seven small and heterogeneous studies reporting on the relationship between VAC usage and the bacterial load and type of bacteria in the treated wounds in clinical practice were found in the literature. Although there is some low quality evidence that VAC therapy does not change the bacterial load, no definite conclusions on changes in the bacterial load and type of bacteria during VAC can be drawn. Future Directions: Prospectively monitoring changes in the bacterial load and bacterial spectrum in patients that will receive VAC treatment on indication might be an effective way to find out whether it should indeed be used on specific wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Integrins are bidirectional signaling receptors for extracellular matrix that regulate both inside-out signaling that controls keratinocyte-mediated changes to the wound microenvironment and outside-in signaling that controls keratinocyte responses to microenvironmental changes. As such, integrins represent attractive therapeutic targets for treatment of chronic wounds or general promotion of wound healing. Advances in wound management are particularly important as the elderly and diabetic populations within the United States continue to grow. Recent Advances: Although integrins are best known for mediating cell adhesion and migration, integrins in wound epidermis also control cell survival, proliferation, matrix remodeling, and paracrine crosstalk to other cellular compartments of the wound. Importantly, the concept of targeting integrins in the clinic has been established for treatment of certain cancers and other diseases, laying the groundwork for similar exploitation of integrins as targets to treat chronic wounds. Critical Issues: Despite their attractiveness as therapeutic targets, integrins have complex roles in wound healing that are impacted by both their own expression and a highly dynamic wound microenvironment that determines ligand availability. Therefore, identifying relevant integrin ligands in the wound and understanding both distinct and overlapping functions that different integrins play in the epidermis will be critical to determine their precise roles in wound healing. Future Directions: Future research should focus on gaining a thorough understanding of the highly coordinated functions of different integrins in wound epidermis, and on determining which of these functions go awry in pathological wounds. This focus should facilitate development of integrin-targeting therapeutics for treating chronic wounds.",

Critical Issues: Abnormal scars not only lead to increased health-care costs but also cause significant psychological problems for survivors. A plethora of therapeutic strategies have been used to prevent or attenuate excessive scar formation; however, most therapeutic approaches remain clinically unsatisfactory.

Endothelial cells proliferate in response to tissue stretch and the mechanical properties of the environment direct capillary sprouting and growth. As the vascular network is a key factor in physiology and disease, control of the vascularity by means of mechanical forces could lead to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent Advances: Increased understanding of mechanobiology has stimulated translational research and allowed the development and optimization of clinical devices that exploit mechanical forces for the treatment of diseases, in particular in the field of wound healing. Stretching in distraction osteogenesis and tissue expansion induces neogenesis of well-vascularized tissues. In micro-deformational wound therapy, micro-mechanical distortions of the wound bed stimulate cell proliferation and angiogenesis by stretching resident cells to improve healing of difficult wounds. Relief from tension antagonizes proliferation and angiogenesis in primarily closed wounds allowing for better scar quality. Critical Issues: The integration of mechanobiology into traditional cell biology and pathophysiology in general is not yet complete and further research is needed to fill existing gaps, in particular in the complexity of in vivo conditions. Future Directions: Still largely unexplored approaches based on mechanical perturbation of the micro-/macro-environment can be devised to overcome the limits of current strategies in a broad spectrum of clinical conditions.",

In the vascular and pulmonary systems, respectively, loss of mechanical function is linked to hypertension, which in turn is a risk factor for heart and renal failure, stroke, and aortic aneurysms, and to an increased risk of mortality as a result of acute lung infections.Although cellular mechanisms were thought to play an important role in mediating tissue aging, the reason for the apparent sensitivity of elastic fibers to age-related degradation remained unclear. We have recently demonstrated that compared with type I collagen, a key component of the elastic fiber system, the cysteine-rich fibrillin microfibril is highly susceptible to direct UV exposure in a cell-free environment. We hypothesized therefore that, as a consequence of both their remarkable longevity and cysteine-rich composition, many elastic fiber-associated components will be susceptible to the accumulation of damage by both direct UV radiation and reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidation.Although elastic fiber remodeling is a common feature of aging dynamic tissues, the inaccessibility of most human tissues has hampered attempts to define the molecular causes.Although, currently, the localized repair of damaged elastic fibers may be effected by the topical application of retinoids and some cosmetic products, future studies may extend the application of systemic transforming growth factor β antagonists, which can prevent cardiovascular remodeling in murine Marfan syndrome, to aging humans. Acellular mechanisms may be key mediators of elastic fiber remodeling and hence age-related tissue stiffening.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Human amniotic membrane (hAM) has been used to treat wounds for more than 100 years. However, widespread use of fresh hAM has been limited due to its short shelf life and safety concerns. To overcome these concerns, different preservation methods have been introduced. The majority of these methods result in devitalized hAM (dev-hAM). Recently, we developed a cryopreservation method that retains all hAM components intact (int-hAM), including viable endogenous cells. To understand the advantages of retaining viable cells in preserved hAM, we compared the anti-inflammatory properties of int-hAM and dev-hAM. Approach: The tissue composition of int-hAM and dev-hAM was compared with fresh hAM through histology and cell viability analysis. We also evaluated the ability of int-hAM and dev-hAM to regulate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and IL-10 release when co-cultured with immune cells; to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on TNF-α stimulation; and to inhibit proteases. Results: Int-hAM maintained the structural and cellular integrity of fresh hAM. Int-hAM had >80% cell viability post-thaw and remained viable for at least a week in culture. Viable cells were not detected in dev-hAM. Compared with dev-hAM, int-hAM showed significantly greater downregulation of TNF-α and IL-1α, upregulation of PGE2 and IL-10, and stronger inhibition of collagenase. Innovation and Conclusion: A new cryopreservation method has been developed to retain all native components of hAM. For the first time, we show that viable endogenous cells significantly augment the anti-inflammatory activity of cryopreserved hAM.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study demonstrates that superior outcomes are possible when diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are managed with tri-layer porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS). Approach: Patients with DFU from 11 centers participated in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Qualified subjects were randomized (1:1) to either SIS or standard care (SC) selected at the discretion of the Investigator and followed for 12 weeks or complete ulcer closure. Results: Eighty-two subjects (41 in each group) were evaluable in the intent-to-treat analysis. Ulcers managed with SIS had a significantly greater proportion closed by 12 weeks than for the Control group (54% vs. 32%, p=0.021) and this proportion was numerically higher at all visits. Time to closure for ulcers achieving closure was 2 weeks earlier for the SIS group than for SC. Median reduction in ulcer area was significantly greater for SIS at each weekly visit (all p values<0.05). Review of reported adverse events found no safety concerns. Innovation: These data support the use of tri-layer SIS for the effective management of DFU. Conclusion: In this randomized controlled trial, SIS was found to be associated with more rapid improvement, and a higher likelihood of achieving complete ulcer closure than those ulcers treated with SC.",

These adult stem cells exert their therapeutic effects primarily by secreting soluble factors that regulate cellular responses to cutaneous injury.There is an urgent need for novel therapies for the treatment of wounds with delayed healing. Current treatment options for chronic nonhealing wounds and burns are limited and not always effective, despite significant advances in wound care including application of bioengineered skin equivalents and growth factors.The three target articles advance the field by addressing critical gaps in knowledge about MSC function and mechanism during wound healing. The first target article provides the first evidence that MSCs regulate macrophage phenotype in wounds. The second target article demonstrates that diabetes mellitus impairs the ability of MSCs to promote wound healing and this can be rescued by a novel lipid mediator deficit in diabetic wounds. The final target article reports that the surgical technique of tissue expansion is enhanced by MSCs.MSC therapy suppresses inflammation in wounds and may be more effective when used in conjunction with other therapeutics that modulate the diabetic wound environment. It also shows potential as an adjunctive therapy for surgical tissue expansion.MSCs represent promising emerging therapies for wounds with delayed healing such as chronic nonhealing wounds and burns.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fetal wounds heal with a regenerative phenotype that is indistinguishable from surrounding skin with restored skin integrity. Compared to this benchmark, all postnatal wound healing is impaired and characterized by scar formation. The biologic basis of the fetal regenerative phenotype can serve as a roadmap to recapitulating regenerative repair in adult wounds. Reduced leukocyte infiltration, likely mediated, in part, through changes in the chemokine milieu, is a fundamental feature of fetal wound healing. Recent Advances: The contributions of chemokines to wound healing are a topic of active investigation. Recent discoveries have opened the possibility of targeting chemokines therapeutically to treat disease processes and improve healing capability, including the possibility of achieving a scarless phenotype in postnatal wounds. Critical Issues: Successful wound healing is a complex process, in which there is a significant interplay between multiple cell types, signaling molecules, growth factors, and extracellular matrix. Chemokines play a crucial role in this interplay and have been shown to have different effects in various stages of the healing process. Understanding how these chemokines are locally produced and regulated during wound healing and how the chemokine milieu differs in fetal versus postnatal wounds may help us identify ways in which we can target chemokine pathways. Future Directions: Further studies on the role of chemokines and their role in the healing process will greatly advance the potential for using these molecules as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Both chronic wounds and excessive scar formation after cutaneous injury create a formidable clinical problem resulting in considerable morbidity and healthcare expenditure. The deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) components are critical processes in cutaneous healing. Understanding the role of the ECM in directing progenitor and reparative cell fate and activities during wound repair is required to improve wound-care strategies.In addition to providing structural integrity, the ECM is recognized to play critical roles in regulating progenitor and reparative cell behaviors such as migration, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The ECM dictates these activities through its binding of adhesion receptors as well as its ability to regulate growth factor bioavailability and signaling. More recently, a key role for mechanical control of cell fate through interaction with the ECM has emerged.Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of cutaneous wound repair, problematic wounds remain a significant healthcare challenge. Regenerative medical strategies that either target endogenous stem cells or utilize applications of exogenous stem cell populations have emerged as promising approaches to pathologic wounds. However, the identification of smart biomaterials and matrices may allow for further optimization of such therapies.An efficient and appropriate healing response in the skin postinjury is regulated by a fine balance of the quantity and quality of ECM proteins. A more complete understanding of ECM regulation of the cell fate and activities during cutaneous wound repair is vital for the development of novel treatment strategies for improvement of cutaneous healing.",

Wound care practices for neonatal and pediatric patients, including the choice of specific dressings or other wound care products, are currently based on a combination of provider experience and preference and a small number of published clinical guidelines based on expert opinion; rigorous evidence-based clinical guidelines for wound management in these populations is lacking. Recent Advances: Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of wound healing have contributed to an ever-increasing number of specialized wound care products, most of which are predominantly marketed to adult patients and that have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy in the neonatal and pediatric populations. This review aims to discuss the available data on the use of both more traditional wound care products and newer wound care technologies in these populations, including medical-grade honey, nanocrystalline silver, and soft silicone-based adhesive technology. Critical Issues: Evidence-based wound care practices and demonstration of the safety, efficacy, and appropriate utilization of available wound care dressings and products in the neonatal and pediatric populations should be established to address specific concerns regarding wound management in these populations. Future Directions: The creation and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of common wounds in the neonatal and pediatric populations is essential. In addition to an evaluation of currently marketed wound care dressings and products used in the adult population, newer wound care technologies should also be evaluated for use in neonates and children. In addition, further investigation of the specific pathophysiology of wound healing in neonates and children is indicated to promote the development of wound care dressings and products with specific applications in these populations.",

This was done to reveal whether bacterial biofilm is present in acute wounds. Approach: On the buttock of 26 healthy volunteers, 28 suction blisters were made and de-roofed. Four wounds were biopsied immediately after wounding, whereas the remaining 24 wounds were treated daily with sterile deionized water and covered with a moisture-retaining dressing. On day 4 post-wounding, swabs were obtained for culturing from the wounds and adjacent skin, and the wounds including adjacent skin were excised. Tissue sections were stained with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes, counterstained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Results: No bacterial aggregates were detected at day 0. At day 4, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the sole bacteria identified by CLSM/PNA-FISH and culturing. CoNS was isolated from 78% of the wound swabs and 48% of the skin swabs. Bacterial aggregates (5–150 μm) were detected by PNA-FISH/CLSM in the split stratum corneum and fibrin deposits at the wound edges and in the stratum corneum and the hair follicles of the adjacent skin. The bacterial aggregates were more common (p = 0.0084) and larger (p = 0.0083) at wound edges than in the adjacent skin. Innovation: Bacterial aggregates can establish in all wound types and may have clinical significance in acute wounds.

    "abstract": "Significance: In early gestation, fetal skin wounds undergo regeneration and healing without a scar. This phenomenon is intrinsic to early fetal skin but disappears during late gestation. Adult wounds undergo repair via a fibroproliferative response that leads to incomplete regeneration of the original tissue and a resultant scar. This outcome can have devastating effects for patients and is a significant financial burden to the healthcare system. Recent Advances: Studies have demonstrated the possible role of several stem cells in wound healing. In particular, epidermal stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated in wound repair and regeneration. Recently, stem cells with adult epidermal stem cell markers have been found in fetal skin dermis. These cells are thought to play a role in scarless fetal wound healing. Critical Issues: Despite numerous studies on scarless fetal wound healing, the exact mechanism is still largely unknown. Although inflammation is greatly reduced, the stem cell profile of regenerating fetal skin wounds remains unknown. Without a detailed understanding of stem cell differences between fetal and adult wounds, the ability to prevent or treat both normal and pathologic excessive scarring, in the form of keloids and hypertrophic scars, is limited. Future Directions: Further studies on differences between fetal and adult skin-specific stem cells may elucidate the mechanism of scarless wound healing in the early fetus. With this knowledge, the potential to reduce scarring in adult wounds may be achieved.",

    "abstract": "The skin interfollicular epidermis (IFE) is an organism's first line of defense against a harmful environment and physical damage. During homeostasis and wound repair, the IFE is rejuvenated constantly by IFE stem cells (SCs) that are capable of both proliferation and differentiation. However, the identity and behavior of IFE SCs remain controversial.Two opposing theories exist regarding homeostasis of the IFE. On the basis of morphological and proliferative characteristics, one posits that the IFE is composed of a discrete epidermal proliferative unit comprised of ∼10 transit-amplifying (TA) cells and a centrally located SC in the basal layer. The other suggests that homeostasis of the IFE is maintained by a single progenitor population in the basal layer. A recent study has challenged these two apparently distinct models and demonstrated that the basal layer of the IFE contains both SCs and TA cells, which make distinct contributions to tissue homeostasis and repair. Moreover, phosphorylation levels of the transcription factor p63, the master regulator of the proliferative potential of epidermal SCs, can be used to distinguish self-renewing SCs from TA cells with more limited proliferative potential.As technologies advance, IFE SCs can be identified at a single-cell level. Refinements of their identification and characterization are critical, not only for SC biology but also for the development of novel clinical applications.Understanding the signaling pathways that control self-renewal and differentiation of IFE SCs will aid in developing novel cell-based therapeutics targeting degenerative epidermal diseases and wound repair.",

Identifying the fundamental mechanisms responsible for normal and pathological connective tissue deposition is likely to yield novel insights into how to control fibrotic conditions.An increasing body of evidence suggests a link between mechanical tension and the development of scar tissue. Integrins are the cell surface receptors that mediate interactions between the cell and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent evidence has suggested that, in fibroblasts, the integrin β1-subunit plays an essential role in mechanosignaling and in dermal homeostasis, repair, and fibrosis. The mechanism underlying these activities of integrin β1 appears to involve its ability to (1) mediate activation of latent transforming growth factor beta-1 via ECM contraction and (2) modulate collagen production via a focal adhesion kinase/rac1/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)/reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. Moreover, the integrin β1-binding protein CCN2, a secreted matricellular protein located within the cellular microenvironment, is required for dermal fibrogenesis.Mechanical tension is a key feature underlying the development of scar tissue. The mechanosignaling sensor integrin β1 is an essential, central mediator of dermal fibrosis, wound healing, and homeostasis.Drugs targeting the molecular mechanism underlying integrin β1-mediated signaling may represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating fibroproliferative disorders. Clinical trials directly testing this hypothesis are warranted.",

The most reliable method to treat a radiation ulcer is wide excision of the affected tissue, followed by coverage with well-vascularized tissue. As usual, radiation-induced skin ulcers are due to therapeutic irradiation for residual cancer or lymph nodes; the locations of radiation ulcers are relatively limited, including the head, neck, chest wall, lumbar, groin, and sacral areas. Thus, suitable reconstructive methods vary according to functional and aesthetic conditions. I reviewed the practices and surgical results for radiation ulcers over the past 30 years, and present the recommended surgical methods for these hard-to-heal ulcers. Recent Advances: At a minimum, flaps are required to treat radiation ulcers. Surgeons can recommend earlier debridement, followed by immediate coverage with axial-pattern musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Free flaps are also a useful soft tissue coverage option. The choice of flap varies with the location and size of the wounds. Critical Issues: The most crucial procedure is the complete resection of the radiation-affected area, followed by coverage with well-vascularized tissue. Future Directions: Recent developments in perforator flap techniques, which are defined as flaps with a blood supply from isolated perforating vessels of a stem artery, have allowed the surgeons to successfully resurface these difficult wounds with reduced morbidity.",

Understanding how these stress responses influence the innate immune system and the skin microbiome remains elusive due to the complexity of the neuroimmune and stress response pathways. Both animal and human studies have provided critical information upon which to further elucidate the mechanisms by which mammalian stressors impair normal wound healing and/or promote chronic wound progression. Recent Advances: Development of high-throughput genomic and bioinformatic approaches has led to the discovery of both an epidermal and dermal microbiome with distinct characteristics. This technology is now being used to identify statistical correlations between specific microbiota profiles and clinical outcomes related to cutaneous wound healing and the response to pathogenic infection. Studies have also identified more prominent roles for typical skin commensal organisms in maintaining homeostasis and modulating inflammatory responses. Critical Issues: It is well-established that stress-induced factors, including catecholamines, acetylcholine, and glucocorticoids, increase the risk of impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infection. Despite the characterization of the cutaneous microbiome, little is known regarding the impact of these stress-induced molecules on the development and evolution of the cutaneous microbiome during wound healing. Future Directions: Further characterization of the mechanisms by which stress-induced molecules influence microbial proliferation and metabolism in wounds is necessary to identify altered microbial phenotypes that differentially influence host innate immune responses required for optimal healing. These mechanisms may yield beneficial as targets for manipulation of the microbiome to further benefit the host after cutaneous injury.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Bacterial biofilms are considered to be responsible for over 80% of persistent infections, including chronic lung infections, osteomyelitis, periodontitis, endocarditis, and chronic wounds. Over 60% of chronic wounds are colonized with bacteria that reside within a biofilm. The exaggerated proteolytic environment of chronic wounds, more specifically elevated matrix metalloproteinases, is thought to be one of the possible reasons as to why chronic wounds fail to heal. However, the role of bacterial proteases within chronic wounds is not fully understood. Recent Advances: Recent research has shown that bacterial proteases can enable colonization and facilitate bacterial immune evasion. The inhibition of bacterial proteases such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase B (LasB) has resulted in the disruption of the bacterial biofilm in vitro. P. aeruginosa is thought to be a key pathogen in chronic wound infection, and therefore, the disruption of these biofilms, potentially through the targeting of P. aeruginosa bacterial proteases, is an attractive therapeutic endeavor. Critical Issues: Disrupting biofilm formation through the inhibition of bacterial proteases may lead to the dissemination of bacteria from the biofilm, allowing planktonic cells to colonize new sites within the wound. Future Directions: Despite a plethora of evidence supporting the role of bacterial proteases as virulence factors in infection, there remains a distinct lack of research into the effect of bacterial proteases in chronic wounds. To assess the viability of targeting bacterial proteases, future research should aim to understand the role of these proteases in a variety of chronic wound subtypes.",

Engineered, vascularized tissues as well as angiogenic growth factor-releasing hydrogels could replace defective tissues. Further, treatments and testing of novel vascular therapeutics will benefit significantly from models that allow for the study of vascularized tissues under physiological relevant in vitro conditions. Recent Advances: Inspired by fibrin, the provisional matrix during wound healing, naturally derived and synthetic hydrogel scaffolds have been developed for vascular engineering. Today, engineers and biologists use commercially available hydrogels to pre-vascularize tissues, to control the delivery of angiogenic growth factors, and to establish vascular diseases models. Critical Issue: For clinical translation, pre-vascularized tissue constructs must be sufficiently large and stable to substitute function-relevant tissue defects and integrate with host vascular perfusion. Moreover, the continuous integration of knowhow from basic vascular biology with innovative, tailorable materials and advanced manufacturing technologies is key to achieving near-physiological tissue models and new treatments to control vascularization. Future Directions: For transplantation, engineered tissues must comprise hierarchically organized vascular trees of different caliber and function. The development of novel vascularization-promoting or -inhibiting therapeutics will benefit from physiologically relevant vessel models. In addition, tissue models representing treatment-relevant vascular tissue functions will increase the capacity to screen for therapeutic compounds and will significantly reduce the need for animals for their validation.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Keloid scarring is a disfiguring fibroproliferative disorder that can significantly impair the quality of life in affected individuals. The mechanisms that initiate keloid scarring are incompletely understood, and keloids remain one of the most challenging skin conditions to treat. Keloids are unique to humans; thus, the lack of adequate animal models has hindered research efforts aimed at prevention and effective therapeutic intervention. Recent Advances: In the absence of a suitable animal model, keloid researchers often rely on studying excised keloid scar tissue and keloid-derived cultured cells. Recently, in vivo models have been described that involve transplantation to mice of reconstructed skin containing keloid-derived fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes. These mouse-human hybrid animal models display some similarities with keloids and may enable investigation of novel therapies, although no model yet recapitulates all the features of human keloid scarring. Critical Issues: Differences in skin physiology and modes of healing contribute to challenges in modeling keloids in laboratory animals. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cells of the immune system contribute to keloid pathology. The need to use immunodeficient hosts for transplanted human keloid cells in recently described animal models precludes studying the role of the immune system in keloid scarring. Future Directions: Future animal models may take advantage of humanized mice with immune systems reconstituted using human immune cells. Such models, when combined with grafted tissues prepared using keloid-derived cells, might enable investigation of complex interactions between systemic and local factors that combine to promote keloid scar formation and may aid in the development of novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are essential for epidermal homeostasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of many skin diseases, including skin cancer and psoriasis. However, while the epigenetic regulation of epidermal homeostasis is now becoming active area of research, the epigenetic mechanisms controlling the wound healing response remain relatively untouched. Recent Advances: Substantial progress achieved within the last two decades in understanding epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression allowed defining several levels, including covalent DNA and histone modifications, ATP-dependent and higher-order chromatin chromatin remodeling, as well as noncoding RNA- and microRNA-dependent regulation. Research pertained over the last few years suggests that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms play a pivotal role in the regulation of skin regeneration and control an execution of reparative gene expression programs in both skin epithelium and mesenchyme. Critical Issues: Epigenetic regulators appear to be inherently involved in the processes of skin repair, and are able to dynamically regulate keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration, together with influencing dermal regeneration and neoangiogenesis. This is achieved through a series of complex regulatory mechanisms that are able to both stimulate and repress gene activation to transiently alter cellular phenotype and behavior, and interact with growth factor activity. Future Directions: Understanding the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation is a priority as it represents potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of both acute and chronic skin conditions. Future research is, therefore, imperative to help distinguish epigenetic modulating drugs that can be used to improve wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Revealing the basic mechanisms in the healing process and then regulating these processes for faster healing or to avoid negative outcomes such as infection or scarring are fundamental to wound research. The normal healing process is basically known, but to thoroughly understand the very complex aspects involved, it is necessary to characterize the course of events at a higher resolution with the latest molecular techniques and methodologies. Recent Advances: Various animal models are used in wound-healing research. Rodent and pig models are the ones most often used, probably because of pre-existing sophisticated research methodologies and as the proper care and ethical use of these species are highly developed and organized to serve science throughout the world. Critical Issues: Since several animal models are used, their anatomical and physiological differences varyingly affect the translation of results on healing mechanisms. Hence, to avoid species-specific misinformation, more ways to study wound healing directly in humans are needed. Future Directions: Fortunately, novel techniques have enabled high-end molecular-level research even from small samples of tissue. Since these methods require only a small amount of patient skin, they make it possible to study wound healing directly in humans.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fibrinogen-related proteins (FRePs) comprise an intriguing collection of extracellular molecules, each containing a conserved fibrinogen-like globe (FBG). This group includes the eponymous fibrinogen as well as the tenascin, angiopoietin, and ficolin families. Many of these proteins are upregulated during tissue repair and exhibit diverse roles during wound healing. Recent Advances: An increasing body of evidence highlights the specific expression of a number of FRePs following tissue injury and infection. Upon induction, each FReP uses its FBG domain to mediate quite distinct effects that contribute to different stages of tissue repair, such as driving coagulation, pathogen detection, inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Critical Issues: Despite a high degree of homology among FRePs, each contains unique sequences that enable their diversification of function. Comparative analysis of the structure and function of FRePs and precise mapping of regions that interact with a variety of ligands has started to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms by which these proteins play very different roles using their common domain. Future Directions: Fibrinogen has long been used in the clinic as a synthetic matrix serving as a scaffold or a delivery system to aid tissue repair. Novel therapeutic strategies are now emerging that harness the use of other FRePs to improve wound healing outcomes. As we learn more about the underlying mechanisms by which each FReP contributes to the repair response, specific blockade, or indeed potentiation, of their function offers real potential to enable regulation of distinct processes during pathological wound healing.",

Our objective was to compare three regimens and establish superiority in terms of objective and subjective outcomes. Approach: In this randomized parallel group study, 60 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups. Patients received intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) in Group TAC, 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in Group 5FU, and a combination in Group T + F every 3 weeks till 24 weeks or till the keloid resolved. Results: There was a reduction in all parameters at every successive assessment in all three groups. Improvement in terms of height, vascularity, and pliability was fastest with 5FU, TAC, and T + F group, respectively, which was statistically significant. Decrease in pigmentation was significantly faster with T+F. Reduction in pruritus, however, was significantly faster with 5FU than the other groups, but the difference in reduction of pain among the three groups was not significant. Telangiectasias and skin atrophy were seen most commonly in TAC group, while skin ulceration was a common problem in 5FU group. Conclusion: TAC, 5FU, and their combination are all effective in keloid scars. A combination of TAC +5FU seems to offer the balanced benefit of faster and more efficacious response with lesser adverse effects when compared to individual drugs.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of tannic acid (TA), a natural plant polyphenol astringent, on wound healing in vitro and in vivo, and to elucidate the underlying molecular signaling pathway in the wound healing. Approach: Cutaneous skin wounds were created in rats and then treated until closure with purified TA, serum or tissue samples were collected to test the concentration of factors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the expression in gene or protein was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. We explored the cell-/dose-specific responses of TA (0.1-0.4 μg/mL) on proliferation and gene and protein expression of fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells. Results: The wounds on rats treated by TA got healed faster than those in the untreated group. The histopathology study showed that TA accelerated re-epithelialization and increase in hair follicles could be detected. The levels of growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor in TA-treated groups were all increased, and the content of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 was decreased significantly when compared with that of the untreated group. The NIH 3T3 cells grow faster in 6 h at concentration of 0.1 μg/mL, and the expression of bFGF in gene and protein was increased significantly in the 0.1 μg/mL TA group. Further study revealed that the protein levels of bFGF, extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2, and P-Erk 1/2 in Erk 1/2 pathway were increased after TA treatment. Innovation: The role of TA in wound healing efficacy is unclear; this study, therefore, assesses the effects of TA on wound healing in different periods and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Conclusion: These results suggested that TA could accelerate wound healing through modulation of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors and activate Erk 1/2 pathway. In conclusion, TA may be a potential agent in promoting wound healing.",

While better wound care products and treatment modalities are known to improve healing rates, they are inconsistently used in real-world practice. Predicting healing rates of chronic wounds and comparing to actual rates could be used to detect and reward better quality of care. We developed a prediction model for chronic wound healing. Approach: We analyzed electronic medical records (EMRs) for 620,356 chronic wounds of various etiologies in 261,398 patients from 532 wound care clinics in the United States. Patient-level and wound-level parameters influencing wound healing were identified from prior research and clinician input. Logistic regression and classification tree models to predict the probability of wound healing within 12 weeks were developed using a random sample of 70% of the wounds and validated in the remaining data. Results: A total of 365,659 (58.9%) wounds were healed by week 12. The logistic and classification tree models predicted healing with an area under the curve of 0.712 and 0.717, respectively. Wound-level characteristics, such as location, area, depth, and etiology, were more powerful predictors than patient demographics and comorbidities. Innovation: The probability of wound healing can be predicted with reasonable accuracy in real-world data from EMRs. Conclusion: The resulting severity adjustment model can become the basis for applications like quality measure development, research into clinical practice and performance-based payment.",

An increased prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens spurred an initial resurgence in honey's clinical popularity, with it quickly finding a place in wound care and regenerative medicine. However, this renewed usage demanded a need for improved delivery and overall research of its bioactive properties. This review provides an overview of the antibacterial properties and clinical use of honey. Recent Advances: The past and present clinical use of honey is noted, focusing specifically on burns and ulcers, as these are the most common applications of the natural agent. While honey is often used without modification clinically, there are also commercially available products ranging from dressings to gels, which are discussed. Critical Issues: Despite these products growing in popularity, the need for improved delivery and a structure to support wound healing could improve the treatment method. Future Directions: Tissue engineering scaffolds can provide an alternative method of honey delivery with research focusing primarily on electrospun scaffolds, hydrogels, and cryogels. Current studies on these scaffolds are discussed with respect to their advantages and potential for future clinical work. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the properties of honey, its current use in wound healing, and the potential for future incorporation into tissue-engineered scaffolds to provide an innovative wound healing agent.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are susceptible to microbial invasion, and serious complications can result without the timely control of infection. Diagnosis of wound infection is primarily based on subjective clinical characteristics and patient-reported symptoms, and the treatment with antimicrobials has not consistently shown improvement in healing outcomes. This is a review of studies using bacterial cultures and/or new molecular-based methods associating microbial bioburden with healing outcomes in VLU patients, with the goal of guiding future studies to better determine significant patterns of microbial involvement in chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Studies reviewed here use cultivation-based identification of bacteria and next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to gain insight into microbial bioburden in VLUs. Further application of sophisticated DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses has the potential to revolutionize our ability to further discern, with high resolution, complex microbial communities in chronic wounds. Critical Issues: Few previous studies of microbial bioburden in VLUs have incorporated the knowledge of clinical treatments, which includes close monitoring of patients' symptoms and responses to therapy. Thus, wound care practitioners are currently without evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of wound infections. Future Directions: Clinically relevant breakthroughs are possible by combining advanced microbial detection techniques with improved study designs that reflect clinical practices. Well-designed longitudinal studies have great potential to lead to better evidence-based diagnosis of chronic wounds. A greater understanding of microbial bioburden in chronic wounds is likely to lead to better therapies that speed healing and prevent wound infection without risking the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic wound is a major problem that often needs amputation of the concerned organ in patients suffering from diabetes. In diabetes, the prolonged phase of inflammation obstructs the further phases of healing which, in turn, lead to improper healing of the wounds in diabetes. Pioglitazone (Pio) hydrochloride is an antidiabetic drug with reported anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to develop a Pio-nanostructured lipid carrier (Pio-NLC)-loaded collagen/chitosan (COL-CS) scaffold and evaluate its healing ability in diabetic wounds. The results of characterization of composite scaffolds reveal that cross-linked scaffolds possess optimum porosity, low matrix degradation, and sustained drug release compared with noncross-linked scaffolds. The in vitro studies reveal that the Pio-NLC-COL-CS scaffold was biocompatible and enhanced cell growth compared with control and NLC-COL-CS. Using the streptozotocin-induced diabetic wound model, significantly (p < 0.001) higher rates of wound contraction in Pio-NLC-COL-CS scaffold-treated group were observed in comparison with that in control and NLC-COL-CS-treated group. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicate a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of matrix metalloproteinases-9 levels in the Pio-NLC-COL-CS-treated group compared with those in control group. Use of nanostructured lipid carrier (Pio-NLC-COL-CS) scaffold can prove to be a promising strategy for local treatment for diabetic wounds.",

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNA recently discovered to be widely expressed and have important biological functions; however, their role in skin wound healing remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of circRNAs in DFU. Approach: CircRNA expression was profiled in normal wounds (NWs) and DFUs by microarray analysis, and hsa_circ_0084443 was identified as differentially expressed. The circularity and subcellular localization of hsa_circ_0084443 were characterized by northern blotting, real-time PCR, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cell migration, cell growth, and the transcriptome of human primary keratinocytes were analyzed after overexpression or RNA interference of hsa_circ_0084443. Results: hsa_circ_0084443 is downregulated in NWs compared with intact skin, and its level is higher in DFUs than NWs. We confirmed its circularity and presence in the cytoplasm of human epidermal keratinocytes. We showed that hsa_circ_0084443 reduced motility while enhancing the growth of keratinocytes. Furthermore, we identified a gene network with the potential to mediate the biological effect of hsa_circ_0084443. Innovation: CircRNAs have a functional role and a potential clinical significance in skin wound healing. Conclusions: We identified hsa_circ_0084443, a circRNA downregulated during NW healing, as a negative regulator of keratinocyte migration. Higher levels of hsa_circ_0084443 were detected in DFU samples, suggesting that it plays a role in pathology.

Initial reports of clinical effectiveness of a new ovine-based collagen extracellular matrix (CECM) dressing demonstrate benefits in chronic wound healing. Recent Advances: CECM dressings are processed differently than oxidized regenerated cellulose/collagen dressings. CECM dressings consist primarily of collagens I and III arranged as native fibers that retain the three-dimensional architecture present in tissue ECM. As such, ovine-based ECM dressings represent a new generation of collagen dressings capable of impacting a broad spectrum of MMP excess known to be present in chronic wounds. Critical Issues: While MMPs are essential in normal healing, elevated presence of MMPs has been linked to wound failure. Collagen has been shown to reduce levels of MMPs, acting as a sacrificial substrate for excessive proteases in a chronic wound. Preserving collagen dressings in a more native state enhances bioactivity in terms of the ability to affect the chronic wound environment. Clinical observation and assessment may not be sufficient to identify a wound with elevated protease activity that can break down ECM, affect wound fibroblasts, and impair growth factor response. Future Directions: Collagen dressings that target broad-spectrum excessive MMP levels and can be applied early in the course of care may positively impact healing rates in difficult wounds. Next-generation collagen dressings offer broader MMP reduction capacity while providing a provisional dermal matrix or ECM.",

Therefore, the purpose of this project was to formulate a hydrogel that contains very high concentrations of antibiotics and validate its use together with a platform wound device (PWD) for the immediate care of burns. Approach: The hydrogel properties were optimized by using a rheometer, differential scanning calorimetry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and were tested in an infected porcine burn model. Immediately, after burn creation, the burns were infected with different bacteria. Subsequently, the burns infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii were covered with the PWD and treated with a single dose of hydrogel containing 1000 × minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin, gentamicin, and minocycline, respectively. On day 7 or 45, the animals were euthanized, and the burns were harvested for histology and quantitative bacteriology. Results: 0.625% was the best alginate concentration for the hydrogel in terms of viscosity, stability, and drug release. The porcine studies demonstrated that vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and minocycline-treated tissues contained significantly less bacteria and reduced depth of tissue necrosis in comparison to controls. Innovation: The PWD represents a platform technology that begins at the point of the first treatment by protecting the wound and allowing administration of topical therapeutics. The device can be adapted to enclose any size burn over any contour of the body. Conclusion: Antibiotics can be delivered safely in very high concentrations in a hydrogel using the PWD, and burn infections can be treated successfully with this method.",

Thus, there is a need to develop a localized oxygenating treatment that is easy to use and inexpensive. Approach: In this study, we tested a previously developed hydrogel sheet wound dressing based on fluorinated methacrylamide chitosan (MACF) for enhanced oxygenation and compared it with a commercial sheet hydrogel dressing, AquaDerm™, and no treatment controls in a splinted transgenic diabetic mouse wound model. Results: AquaDerm exhibited poor wound closure response compared with the MACF oxygenating hydrogel sheet dressing (MACF+O2) and no treatment. Histological analysis revealed enhanced collagen synthesis and neovascularization upon MACF+O2 treatment as indicated by higher collagen content and number of blood vessels/capillaries compared with AquaDerm and no treatment. MACF+O2 also improved wound collagen fiber alignment, thus demonstrating improved skin tissue maturation. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based biodistribution analysis revealed that the degradation products of the MACF-based dressing did not accumulate in lung, liver, and kidney tissues of the treated animals after 14 days of treatment. Innovation: This study presents the first application of a unique oxygenating biomaterial (MACF) made into a moist hydrogel wound dressing for treating diabetic wounds.

Compared with controls, PRP was associated with a significantly increased ratio of complete ulcer healing (odds ratio [OR] = 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.91-7.45, I2 = 42.2%) and reduced areas of ulcers (standard mean difference = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.27-1.45, I2 = 0.0%). No differences were observed between patients allocated to PRP or controls, in terms of the outcomes of recurrence rate (OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 0.41-27.18, I2 = 66.3%) or amputation rate (OR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.15-1.28). The results of the trial sequence analyses revealed that the cumulative Z-curve crossed both the traditional boundary (p = 0.05) and trial sequential monitoring boundary. Future Directions: Our findings suggest that PRP may improve ulcer healing without significant adverse effects for patients with diabetic ulcers.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Optimal skin wound healing is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, particularly in response to an injury. The skin immune system is under regulation of mediators such as bioactive lipids and cytokines that can initiate an immune response with controlled inflammation, followed by efficient resolution. However, nutritional deficiency impacts wound healing by hindering fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and epithelialization, among other crucial functions. In this way, the correct nutritional support of bioactive lipids and of other essential nutrients plays an important role in the outcome of the wound healing process. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: Several studies have revealed the potential role of lipids as a treatment for the healing of skin wounds. Unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, oleic acid, and most of their bioactive products have shown an effective role as a topical treatment of chronic skin wounds. Their effect, when the treatment starts at day 0, has been observed mainly in the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process. Moreover, some of them were associated with different dressings and were tested for clinical purposes, including pluronic gel, nanocapsules, collagen films and matrices, and polymeric bandages. Therefore, future research is still needed to evaluate these dressing technologies in association with different bioactive fatty acids in a wound healing context. Future Directions: This review summarizes the main results of the available clinical trials and basic research studies and provides evidence-based conclusions. Together, current data encourage the use of bioactive fatty acids for an optimal wound healing resolution.",

Owing to the stratum corneum layer of the skin, traditional drug delivery methods are inefficient, and the effect of the administered therapeutic cues is limited. Recent Advances: The current advancement at the microlevel and nanolevel has revolutionized the drug delivery sector. Particularly, various types of microneedles (MNs) are becoming popular for drug delivery applications because of safety, patient compliance, and smart action. Critical Issues: Herein, we reviewed state-of-the-art MNs as a smart and sophisticated drug delivery approach. Following a brief introduction, the drug delivery mechanism of MNs is discussed. Different types of MNs, that is, solid, hollow, coated, dissolving, and hydrogel forming, are discussed with suitable examples. The latter half of the work is focused on the applied perspective and clinical translation of MNs. Furthermore, a detailed overview of clinical applications and future perspectives is also included in this review. Future Directions: Regardless of ongoing technological and clinical advancement, the focus should be diverted to enhance the efficacy and strength of MNs. Besides, the possible immune response or interference should also be avoided for successful clinical translation of MNs as an efficient drug delivery system.",

Owing to the high mechanical strength and tunable structural and physicochemical properties of human elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), they may be used as excellent materials for fabricating biocompatible scaffolds and other products for wound management. Recent Advances: Designing recombinant ELPs mimicking natural elastin to fabricate synthetic polymers suitable for human health care has generated significant interest. ELP-based cell-adhesive biopolymers have been used as an alternative for successful sutureless wound closure due to the physicochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix. Critical Issues: Different systems of ELPs are being developed in the form of scaffolds, films, hydrogels, photo-linkable sheets, and composites linked with various types of growth factors for wound healing application. However, optimizing the quality and safety attributes for specific application needs designing of recombinant ELPs with structural and functional modifications as needed for the intervention. Future Direction: Chronic wounds are difficult to treat as the wound repair process is interrupted by conditions such as excessive inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix formation, and persistent infections. Conventional therapies such as skin substitutes or autologous skin grafts, in many cases, are unable to reestablish tissue homeostasis and proper healing. The development of innovative materials could induce a better regenerative healing response. In this study, we are reviewing different types of elastin-based materials for wound care application and their future prospects in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Hypertrophic scarring is a challenging issue for patients and clinicians. The prevalence of hypertrophic scarring can be up to 70% after burns, and patients suffer from pain, itching, and loss of joint mobility. To date, the exact mechanisms underlying hypertrophic scar formation are unclear, and clinical options remain limited. Recent Advances: Several studies have demonstrated that pathological scars are a type of hyperactive vascular response to wounding. Scar regression has been found to be accompanied by microvessel occlusion, which causes severe hypoxia, malnutrition, and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting the essential roles of microvessels in scar regression. Therefore, interventions that target the vasculature, such as intense pulsed light, pulsed dye lasers, vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, and Endostar, represent potential treatments. In addition, the mass of scar-associated collagen is usually not considered by current treatments. However, collagen-targeted therapies such as fractional CO2 laser and collagenase have shown promising outcomes in scar treatment. Critical Issues: Traditional modalities used in current clinical practice only partially target scar-associated microvessels or collagen. As a result, the effectiveness of current treatments is limited and is too often accompanied by undesirable side effects. The formation of scars in the early stage is mainly affected by microvessels, whereas the scars in later stages are mostly composed of residual collagen. Traditional therapies do not utilize specific targets for scars at different stages. Therefore, more precise treatment strategies are needed. Future Directions: Scars should be classified as either \"vascular-dominant\" or \"collagen-dominant\" before selecting a treatment. In this way, strategies that are vascular-targeted, collagen-targeted, or a combination thereof could be recommended to treat scars at different stages.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare debilitating autoinflammatory ulcerative skin disease. No gold standard has been established for the treatment of PG. The role of surgical interventions and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was discussed controversially until recently as these procedures might pose a trigger to further aggravate the condition. Recent Advances: Recent advances confirm the paradigm change that a surgical approach of PG with split thickness skin grafting (STSG) secured by NPWT is a safe and valuable treatment if performed under adequate immunosuppression. We elaborate this on the hand of a broad literature search retrieving 101 relevant articles describing 138 patients complemented with our personal experience on 23 patients, including 2 patients treated with a porcine xenodressing. Critical Issues: A wide range of surgical approaches have been reported, including xenografts. Treatment was finally successful in 86%, including the xenotransplant cases. Ten percent improved and failures were mainly reported without immunosuppression. Despite halting the inflammatory process, NPWT alone, without skin grafting, does not much accelerate healing time. The best surgical approach appears to be STSG fixed with NPWT as this leads to higher skin graft take. There remains the problem of the chronic nature of PG and the recurrence after tapering of immunosuppression or trauma; therefore, a sustained immunosuppressive treatment is suggested. Future Directions: While surgical treatment is supported by the published data, the exact immunosuppression is still evolving. Due to deeper insights into pathogenesis and growing clinical reports, a broader utilization of biologic treatments and a shift from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha to interleukin (IL)-12/23 or IL-23 antibodies alone are predictable, as IL-12/23 antibodies show good clinical responses with fewer side effects. The positive results with porcine xenodressings might be due to immunological effects of the xenomaterial; they appear promising, but are preliminary and should be confirmed in a larger patient collective.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Chronic wounds have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States and can have an emotional, physical, and financial toll on patients. By leveraging data within the electronic health record (EHR), machine learning models offer the opportunity to facilitate earlier identification of wounds at risk of not healing or healing after an abnormally long time, which may improve treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Machine learning models in this study were built to predict chronic wound healing time. Approach: Machine learning models were developed using EHR data to predict patients at risk of having wounds not heal within 4, 8, and 12 weeks from the start of treatment. The models were trained on three data sets of 1,220,576 wounds, including 187 covariates describing patient demographics, comorbidities, and wound characteristics. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the accuracy of the models. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to analyze variable importance in predictions and enhance clinical interpretations. Results: The 4-, 8-, and 12-week gradient-boosted decision tree models achieved AUC's of 0.854, 0.855, and 0.853, respectively. Days in treatment, wound depth and location, and wound area were the most influential predictors of wounds at risk of not healing. Innovation: Machine learning models can accurately predict chronic wound healing time using EHR data. SHAP values can give insight into how patient-specific variables influenced predictions. Conclusion: Accurate models identifying patients with chronic wounds at risk of non or slow healing are feasible and can be incorporated into routine wound care.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Dermal fibroblasts are the major cell type in the skin's dermal layer. These cells originate from distinct locations of the embryo and reside in unique niches in the dermis. Different dermal fibroblasts exhibit distinct roles in skin development, homeostasis, and wound healing. Therefore, these cells are becoming attractive candidates for cell-based therapies in wound healing. Recent Advances: Human skin dermis comprises multiple fibroblast subtypes, including papillary, reticular, and hair follicle-associated fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts after wounding. Recent studies reveal that these cells play distinct roles in wound healing and contribute to diverse healing outcomes, including nonhealing chronic wound or excessive scar formation, such as hypertrophic scars (HTS) and keloids, with papillary fibroblasts having antiscarring and reticular fibroblast scar-forming properties. Critical Issues: The identities and functions of dermal fibroblast subpopulations in many respects remain unknown. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of dermal fibroblast heterogeneity, including their defined cell markers and dermal niches, dynamic changes, and contributions to skin wound healing, with the emphasis on scarless healing, healing with excessive scars (HTS and keloids), chronic wounds, and the potential application of this heterogeneity for developing cell-based therapies that allow wounds to heal faster with less scarring. Future Directions: Heterogeneous dermal fibroblast populations and their functions are poorly characterized. Refining and advancing our understanding of dermal fibroblast heterogeneity and their participation in skin homeostasis and wound healing may create potential therapeutic applications for nonhealing chronic wounds or wounds that heal with excessive scarring.",

Wounds and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common complications of IDU that disproportionately affect people who inject drugs (PWID) and are a major source of morbidity and mortality for this population. Critical Issues: Injections in a nonsterile environment and reusing or sharing needles facilitates bacterial inoculation, with subsequent risk of serious complications such as sepsis, gangrene, amputation, and death. PWID are susceptible to infections with a wide spectrum of organisms beyond common culprits of SSTI, including Clostridium and Bacillus spp., as well as Candida. Recent Advances: Syringe services programs (SSPs) are cost-effective and successful in reducing harms associated with IDU. SSPs provide new equipment to PWID and aid in discarding used equipment. SSPs aim to reduce the risks of unhygienic injecting practices, which are associated with transmission of infections and blood-borne pathogens. Future Directions: Concurrently run SSPs and wound care clinics are uniquely positioned to facilitate care to PWID. Providing new, sterile equipment as well as early wound care intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality as well as health care expenditures by reducing the number of SSTI and injection-related wounds that require hospital admission. Establishment of wound care clinics as part of an SSP represents an untapped potential to reduce harm.",

However, the mechanisms through which miRNAs regulate wound healing under normal and diabetic conditions are poorly understood. We aimed to determine the effects of miR-146a on the pathogenesis of wound healing in normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Approach: Wild-type (WT) and miR-146a knockout (KO) mice were induced to develop diabetes with STZ. Next, skin and corneal wounds were produced and measured. Percent wound closure and histology were evaluated. Inflammation at wound sites was analyzed using flow cytometry, reverse-transcription PCR, and western blot. Results: Healing of wounded skin was significantly delayed in miR-146a KO compared with WT mice. However, corneal epithelial wound healing did not differ significantly in the mice with normal blood glucose, whereas corneal and skin wound healing was significantly delayed in KO mice with diabetes. Neutrophil infiltration increased in skin wounds of KO compared with normal mice. The potential mechanisms were associated with dysregulated interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1), TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling induced by miR-146a KO. Innovation: Skin wound healing was delayed in miR-146a KO mice and enhanced inflammatory responses were mediated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusions: Deficiency in miR-146a delayed skin wound healing by enhancing inflammatory responses in normal and diabetic mice. Therefore, miR-146a may be a potential target for modulation to accelerate skin wound healing.",

An improved understanding of wound healing and basic skin grafting techniques enable the development of new solutions. Critical Issues: Clinical randomized controlled trials in wound research are time consuming, expensive, and difficult to perform. This has given rise to many techniques that are not well proven. Recent strict regulations concerning all forms of cell therapy have further hindered the development of promising new ideas. Future Directions: Cell therapies to enhance epithelialization and promote wound healing are already available but far from everyday practice. Very strict regulations have halted many promising projects. An alternative approach to circumvent some of these regulatory hurdles is the grafting of uncultured, autologous cells or very small pieces of skin, which also offer very large expansion of the graft. The development and adoption of new bilayered skin substitutes are expected to be the most significant development in the near future, although they face similar regulatory challenges as cell therapies.",

This translational gap raises concerns about the efficacy of current wound healing models and the need for improved research development. Recent Advances: To improve commonly used animal models of chronic wounds, researchers have made several animal model modifications to better mimic and understand the microbiota and immune-mediated wound healing processes that occur in humans. Critical Issues: Existing models do not fully account for the differences in skin architecture, healing processes, and immune system responses in wound healing between animal models and humans. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the limitations of a chosen model when designing experiments. As such, findings must be interpreted cautiously and validated in human contexts. Future Directions: Given the complexity of human wound healing, the use of several different animal models tailored to specific biological questions is necessary. Recent advancement in humanized mouse models and microbiota consideration offer a promising approach to study the human immune-mediated response in chronic wound healing.",

DFD contributes to increased morbidity (reduced quality of life and lower limb amputation), a high rate of recurrence, and increased mortality. Patients with renal disease are at the highest risk of diabetes-related foot disease (renal foot). Recent Advances: Research has been undertaken in the last decade to understand the underlying causes leading to DFD in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanisms, pathophysiology, biochemical, and immunological changes that occur in renal foot are being investigated and have given some insights into renal foot disease. Critical Issues: Patients with renal foot have multiple comorbidities, both systemic and local, that are peculiar to renal disease. Identification and treatment of existing comorbidities of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, immune dysfunction, vascular calcification, and limited life span are crucial to optimize outcomes in renal foot. Attention needs to be paid to nutrition deficiencies that can also adversely affect foot outcomes. Anticipated challenges in the management of infected DFU and endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease need to be studied. Compromised bone health in CKD complicates the management of Charcot foot in DFD. A better understanding of preulcer interventions that could be performed in patients with renal disease is lacking. Future Directions: Research focus on renal foot is required for delineating treatments that can be instituted to prevent DFD and disease progression in CKD. Intervention studies specifically targeting comorbidities in renal foot, such as peripheral vascular disease and cardiovascular disease, are required. Educating physicians and surgeons about the heightened risk of adverse consequences in renal foot is paramount. Multidisciplinary teams and one-stop foot/renal clinics shall ensure comprehensive care to improve outcomes in patients with renal foot.",

In contrast, very little is known about biofilm virulence factors that enhance the establishment and long-term survival of biofilms in tissues.There is a need to identify the genes that encode biofilm virulence factors and understand how these factors function to enable bacteria to successfully establish chronic biofilm infections in tissues.A methodology was developed to screen 6,912 Pseudomonas aeruginosa loss-of-function mutants in a murine model of airway infection to determine which genes were crucial for establishing chronic lung infections in mice. Genetic analysis of 16 bacterial mutants isolated using this methodology identified 15 separate biofilm virulence factor genes whose loss-of-function increased biofilm survival. Sequence analysis of clinical Isolates obtained from seven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic infections that were collected over 16.3 years identified loss-of-function mutants for 7 of these 15 genes.Identifying biofilm virulence factor genes further defines the molecular mechanisms of establishing chronic biofilm infection and should lead to more effective and specific treatments to prevent biofilm formation and/or improve clearance of chronic biofilms in patients.Biofilm virulence factor genes were identified in P. aeruginosa using an animal model of chronic lung infection for mutant screening and from infected CF patient isolates. In many cases they were inactivated planktonic virulence factor genes. These results further demonstrate the opposing patterns of gene expression between acute planktonic bacterial infections and chronic biofilm infections.",

Therapeutic local manipulation of MC population and reactivity may help improve and even prevent impaired repair processes for which there is no cure.Chymase, a MC-restricted protease, is pre-stored in MC cytoplasmic granules with other mediators. The development of a highly specific inhibitor targeting chymase established its pivotal effect on fibrosis pathogenesis in a mouse model of silica-induced fibrosis. This novel finding evokes the potential therapeutic relevance of chymase inhibition to prevent aberrant wound healing.MC are increased in number in a variety of fibrotic diseases, compared to normal scars. Chymase has become a rising target prompting the development of chymase-specific inhibitors to be used as prophylactic or therapeutic agents. Another emerging strategy may consist in evaluating the efficacy of mast cell stabilizing drugs such as cromolyn in abnormal wound healing-drugs which are already approved for human use in other MC-driven disorders.Limited treatment success of dysregulated wound healing underscores the need for novel targets be considered such as MC and/or MC-derived mediators and the necessity to design new therapeutic strategies for wounds that remain difficult to treat.",

    "abstract": "Significance: During gestation, fetal skin progresses from a single layer derived from ectoderm to a complex, multi-layer tissue with the stratum corneum (SC) as the outermost layer. Innate immunity is a conferred complex process involving a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, structural proteins, and specific antigen-presenting cells. The SC is a part of the innate immune system as an impermeable physical barrier containing anti-microbial lipids and host defense proteins. Postnatally, the epidermis continually replenishes itself, provides a protective barrier, and repairs injuries. Recent Advances: Vernix caseosa protects the fetus during gestation and facilitates development of the SC in the aqueous uterine environment. The anti-infective, hydrating, acidification, and wound-healing properties post birth provide insights for the development of strategies that facilitate SC maturation and repair in the premature infant. Critical Issues: Reduction of infant mortality is a global health priority. Premature infants have an incompetent skin barrier putting them at risk for irritant exposure, skin compromise and life-threatening infections. Effective interventions to accelerate skin barrier maturation are compelling. Future Directions: Investigations to determine the ontogeny of barrier maturation, that is, SC structure, composition, cohesiveness, permeability, susceptibility to injury, and microflora, as a function of gestational age are essential. Clinicians need to know when the premature skin barrier becomes fully competent and comparable to healthy newborn skin. This will guide the development of innovative strategies for optimizing skin barrier development.",

Approach: We subjected various material substrates to biomechanical testing to investigate their ability to modulate skin behavior. Combinations of elastomeric materials, adhesives, and strain applicators were evaluated to develop topical stress-shielding devices. Noninvasive imaging modalities were utilized to characterize anatomic site-specific differences in skin biomechanical properties in humans. The devices were tested in a validated large animal model of hypertrophic scarring. Phase I within-patient controlled clinical trials were conducted to confirm their safety and efficacy in scar reduction in patients undergoing abdominoplasty surgery. Results: Among the tested materials and device applicators, a polymer device was developed that effectively off-loaded high tension wounds and blocked pro-fibrotic pathways and excess scar formation in red Duroc swine. In humans, different anatomic sites exhibit unique biomechanical properties that may correlate with the propensity to form scars. In the clinical trial, utilization of this device significantly reduced incisional scar formation and improved scar appearance for up to 12 months compared with control incisions that underwent routine postoperative care. Innovation: This is the first device that is able to precisely control the mechanical environment of incisional wounds and has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials to significantly reduce scar formation after surgery. Conclusion: Mechanomodulatory strategies to control the incisional wound environment can significantly reduce pathologic scarring and fibrosis after surgery.",

    "abstract": "The process of wound healing includes the regulated destruction of proteins via enzymes called proteinases. However, when the proteolytic process becomes excessive, pro-healing factors are destroyed and the wound healing process stalls. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are one key class of proteinases that have been observed to be elevated in many cases of failed wound healing.Two key advances have been made in recent years. First is that, until recently, MMPs were only implicated in impaired healing of chronic wounds. Measurements of MMPs in wound fluids and serum from individuals with acute traumatic wounds have revealed that elevated MMPs are predictive of both impaired healing and of dehiscence of surgically closed wounds. The second advance is in the development of at least three clinically viable methods for measuring MMPs at the point of care.At present there is no objective method of determining proteinase levels within a wound. Since elevated MMPs have now been shown to be predictive of dehiscence in surgically closed acute wounds, a new clinical utility for measuring MMPs has been established. With the advent of several new technologies to measure MMPs, the translation of this valuable molecular knowledge into improved therapeutic regimens is nearly complete.The clinical utility of measuring MMPs continues to expand and be further validated with each new investigation. The tools that will enable clinicians to leverage this valuable information are nearing maturity and integration into the clinic.",

Oral eating problems, weight loss, low body weight, undernutrition, and malnutrition are associated with an increased risk for pressure ulcers. Moreover, inadequate nutrient intake and low body weight are associated with slow and nonhealing wounds. However, the biologic significance of deterioration in nutrition status and consistent methodologies to quantify malnutrition and diminished micronutrient stores as predictors of skin breakdown remains controversial. Recent Advances: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) Consensus Statement: Characteristics Recommended for the Identification and Documentation of Adult Malnutrition provide a standardized and measureable set of criterion for all health professionals to use to identify malnutrition. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality identified malnutrition as one of the common geriatric syndromes associated with increased risk for institutionalization and mortality that may be impacted by primary and secondary preventions.

Initial testing of scaffold biocompatibility was performed in vitro through ADSC culture, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for assessment of ADSC attachment, morphology, and new extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The wound healing effects of ADSC-seeded scaffolds were then evaluated in a murine dermal excisional wound model.

In the wound-healing study, ADSC-treated groups demonstrated significantly enhanced wound closure and epithelial thickness compared to controls. Innovation: This is the first report on the use of tropoelastin-based biomaterials as delivery vehicles for therapeutic ADSCs. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that tropoelastin-based ADSC delivery vehicles significantly accelerate wound healing compared to controls that represent the current clinical standard of care. Furthermore, the unique mechanical and biochemical characteristics of tropoelastin may favor its use over other biological or synthetic scaffolds for the treatment of certain pathologies due to its unique intrinsic mechanical properties.",

However, recent scientific evidence has shown that biofilms delay wound healing and increase a wound propensity to infection. It is therefore essential that hydrogels incorporating antimicrobials demonstrate efficacy on biofilms. Consequently, it is the aim of this article to review the efficacy of hydrogels, incorporating antimicrobials, on wounds with specific reference to their efficacy on biofilms. Recent Advances: Technologies being developed for the management of wounds are rapidly expanding. In particularly next-generation hydrogels, incorporating copolymers, have been reported to enable the smart release of antimicrobials. This has led to the development of a more tailored patient-specific antimicrobial hydrogel therapy. Critical Issues: Evidence relating to the efficacy of hydrogels, incorporating antimicrobials, on biofilms within both the in vitro and in vivo environments is lacking. Future Direction: Studies that investigate the efficacy of antimicrobial hydrogel wound dressings on both in vivo and in vitro biofilms are important. However, there is a significant need for better and more reproducible in vivo biofilm models. Until this is possible, data generated from appropriate and representative in vitro models will help to assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating antimicrobial and antibiofilm hydrogel technology for the extrapolation of efficacy data relevant to biofilms present in the in vivo environment.",

Both fresh human amniotic membrane (hAM) containing viable cells and devitalized hAM have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis in chronic wounds. However, the importance of retaining viable endogenous cells on the angiogenic activity of hAM remains unknown. To understand their role, we compared the angiogenic potential of intact cryopreserved hAM containing viable cells (int-hAM) with devitalized cryopreserved hAM (dev-hAM). Approach: The effects of conditioned medium (CM) derived from int-hAM and dev-hAM on endothelial cell migration and tube formation were compared. Int-hAM and dev-hAM CM and tissues were tested for key angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) after 7 days in culture. The role of VEGF in int-hAM-mediated tube formation was analyzed through inhibition of its activity by anti-VEGF antibody. Results: CM from int-hAM showed greater endothelial cell recruitment and tube formation compared with dev-hAM. Significantly higher levels of VEGF were detected in int-hAM CM after 1 week compared with dev-hAM CM. Int-hAM tissue also had significantly greater expression of VEGF and bFGF relative to dev-hAM. A similar trend was observed for PDGF-BB. Neutralization of VEGF in int-hAM CM significantly inhibited tube formation compared with int-hAM CM alone. Innovation and Conclusion: Preservation of all native hAM components, including viable endogenous cells, enhances the angiogenic effect of cryopreserved hAM. This effect is mediated through higher levels of angiogenic factors, especially VEGF, produced by int-hAM.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain a challenge for physicians to treat. High mortality rates for DFU patients have pointed to the low effectiveness of standard care and lack of quality wound care products. The composition (collagen-rich tissue matrix and endogenous growth factors and cells) and functional properties (anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and angiogenic) of placental membranes are uniquely suited to address the needs of chronic wounds. This led to the commercialization of placental membranes, which are now widely available to physicians as a new advanced wound treatment option. Recent Advances: Progress in tissue processing and preservation methods has facilitated the development of placental products for wounds. Currently, a variety of commercial placental products are available to physicians for the treatment of chronic DFUs and other wounds. This review summarizes the key factors that negatively impact DFU healing (including social factors, such as smoking, vascular deficiencies, hyperglycemia, and other metabolic abnormalities), describes the structure and biology of placental membranes, and overviews commercially available placental products for wounds and data from the most recent DFU clinical trials utilizing commercial placental membranes. Critical Issues: Although the effects of diabetes on wound healing are complex and not fully understood, some of the key factors and pathways that interfere with healing have been identified. However, a multidisciplinary approach for the assessment of patients with chronic DFUs and guidelines for selection of appropriate treatment modalities remain to be implemented. Future Directions: The biological properties of placental membranes show benefits for the treatment of chronic DFUs, but scientific and clinical data for commercially available placental products are limited. Therefore, we need (1) more randomized, controlled clinical trials for commercial placental products; (2) studies that help to understand the timing of placental products' application and criteria for patient selection; and (3) studies comparing the functional properties of different commercially available placental products.",

We tested the effectiveness of keratin-based hydrogels (termed \"keratose\") loaded with ciprofloxacin to inhibit infection and support healing when topically administered to porcine excision wounds infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Approach: Using a porcine excisional wound model, 10 mm full-thickness wounds were inoculated with 106 colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa and treated on days 1 and 3 postinoculation with ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels. Bacteria enumeration and wound healing were assessed on days 3, 7, and 11 postinjury. Results: Ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels reduced the amount of P. aeruginosa in the wound bed by 99.9% compared with untreated wounds on days 3, 7, and 11 postinjury. Ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels displayed decreased wound contraction and reepithelialization at day 7 postinjury. By day 11, wounds treated with ciprofloxacin-keratose hydrogels contained collagen-rich granulation tissue and myofibroblasts. Wounds treated with ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels exhibited a transient increase in macrophages in the wound bed at day 7 postinjury that subsided by day 11. Innovation: Current therapies for wound infection include systemic antibiotics, which could lead to antibiotic resistance, and topical antimicrobial treatments, which require multiple applications and can delay healing. Here, we show that ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels inhibit cutaneous wound infection without interfering with key aspects of the healing process including granulation tissue deposition and remodeling. Conclusions: Ciprofloxacin-loaded keratose hydrogels have the potential to serve as a point-of-injury antibiotic therapy that prevents infection and supports healing following cutaneous injury.",

Therefore, available clinical therapies are thus far limited in their efficacy in preventing and treating both chronic wounds and scars. Current gene-based therapeutics is largely based on our understanding of the protein-coding genome and proteins involved in known wound healing pathways. Recent Advances: Noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs have recently been found to be significant modulators of gene expression in diverse cellular pathways. Research has now implicated noncoding RNAs in nearly every stage of the wound healing process, suggesting that they may serve as clinical therapeutic targets. Noncoding RNAs are critical regulators in processes such as angiogenesis and cutaneous cell migration and proliferation, including classically described biological pathways previously attributed to mostly protein constituents. Critical Issues: The complexity and diversity of the interactions of noncoding RNAs with their targets and other binding partners require thorough characterization and understanding of their functions before they may be altered to modulate human wound healing pathways. Future Directions: Research in the area of noncoding RNAs continues to rapidly expand our understanding of their potential roles in physiological and pathological wound healing. Coupled with improving technologies to enhance or suppress target noncoding RNA in vivo, these advances hold great promise in the development of new therapies for wound healing.",

The cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) promotes tissue repair, but its excessive action can lead to over exuberant scarring and fibrotic disease. However, owing to the multifunctional nature of TGF-β, broad targeting of the canonical Smad-TGF-β signaling pathway in vivo is likely to have unintended, deleterious consequences.(1) The myofibroblast is the essential cell type that mediates tissue repair and fibrosis. (2) TGF-β is an essential contributor to myofibroblast differentiation and activity.

    "abstract": "The skin is our largest organ, with the primary role of protection against assaults from the outside world. It also suffers frequent damage, from minor scrapes to, more rarely, complete destruction such as in third-degree burns. It is therefore, by its nature, an organ that would benefit tremendously from being able to regenerate itself.This review highlights the axolotl, a less well-known model organism capable of scarless wound healing and regeneration. Axolotls are salamanders with unsurpassed healing and regenerative capacities. Understanding how these animals can regenerate their tissues could help identify the pathways that need to be activated or inhibited in humans to improve wound healing.Presently, there are no therapies leading to skin regeneration or scarless wound healing. Various animal models have thus been developed for use in research, such as mice and pigs, to help us understand how wound healing could be improved or stimulated. However, these more common models cannot regenerate and, consequently, cannot direct us toward a solution to regenerate damaged tissues. Axolotls, on the other hand, can regenerate perfectly and therefore may offer avenues to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.Identifying signaling pathways regulating tissue regeneration in vertebrate models is important. The use of animals such as axolotls, which hold the secret of full regeneration, will likely play a significant role in helping us achieve scarless wound healing for humans.",

In this study, dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) allografts (EpiFix®; MiMedx Group) were evaluated for their ability to regulate diabetic stem cells in vitro. Approach: Human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from normal, type I diabetic, and type II diabetic donors were treated with soluble extracts of dHACM and evaluated for proliferation after 3 days by DNA assay, chemotactic migration after 1 day by transwell assay, cytokine secretion after 3 days by multiplex ELISA, and gene expression after 5 days by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Although diabetic ADSCs demonstrated decreased responses compared to normal ADSCs, dHACM treatment stimulated diabetic ADSCs to proliferate after 3 days and enhanced migration over 24 h, similar to normal ADSCs. dHACM-treated diabetic ADSCs modulated secretion of soluble signals, including regulators of inflammation, angiogenesis, and healing. All ADSCs evaluated also responded to dHACM treatment with altered expression of immunomodulatory genes, including interleukins (IL)-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1RA. Innovation: This is the first reported case demonstrating that diabetic ADSCs respond to novel amniotic membrane therapies, specifically treatment with dHACM. Conclusion: dHACM stimulated diabetic ADSCs to migrate, proliferate, and alter cytokine expression suggesting that, despite their diabetic origin, ADSCs may respond to dHACM to accelerate diabetic wound healing.",

A robust and quantitative model of regenerative healing has been described in Murphy Roths Large (MRL) mice in which through-and-through ear hole wounds in the ear pinna leads to scarless healing and replacement of all tissue through blastema formation and including cartilage. Since these mice are naturally autoimmune and display many aspects of an enhanced inflammatory response, we chose to examine the inflammatory status during regenerative ear hole closure and observed that inflammation has a clear positive effect on regenerative healing. Approach: The inflammatory gene expression patterns (Illumina microarrays) of early healing ear tissue from regenerative MRL and nonregenerative C57BL/6 (B6) strains are presented along with a survey of innate inflammatory cells found in this tissue type pre and postinjury. The role of inflammation on healing is tested using a COX-2 inhibitor. Innovation and Conclusion: We conclude that (1) enhanced inflammation is consistent with, and probably necessary, for a full regenerative response and (2) the inflammatory gene expression and cell distribution patterns suggest a novel mast cell population with markers found in both immature and mature mast cells that may be a key component of regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Open fractures are fractures in which the bone has violated the skin and soft tissue. Because of their severity, open fractures are associated with complications that can result in increased lengths of hospital stays, multiple operative interventions, and even amputation. One of the factors thought to influence the extent of these complications is exposure and contamination of the open fracture with environmental microorganisms, potentially those that are pathogenic in nature. Recent Advances: Current open fracture care aims to prevent infection by wound classification, prophylactic antibiotic administration, debridement and irrigation, and stable fracture fixation. Critical Issues: Despite these established treatment paradigms, infections and infection-related complications remain a significant clinical burden. To address this, improvements need to be made in our ability to detect bacterial infections, effectively remove wound contamination, eradicate infections, and treat and prevent biofilm formation associated with fracture fixation hardware. Future Directions: Current research is addressing these critical issues. While culture methods are of limited value, culture-independent molecular techniques are being developed to provide informative detection of bacterial contamination and infection. Other advanced contamination- and infection-detecting techniques are also being investigated. New hardware-coating methods are being developed to minimize the risk of biofilm formation in wounds, and immune stimulation techniques are being developed to prevent open fracture infections.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Hyaluronic acid (HA, or hyaluronan) is a ubiquitous naturally occurring polysaccharide that plays a role in virtually all tissues in vertebrate organisms. HA-based hydrogels have wound-healing properties, support cell delivery, and can deliver drugs locally. Recent Advances: A few HA hydrogels can be customized for composition, physical form, and biomechanical properties. No clinically approved HA hydrogel allows for in vivo crosslinking on administration, has a tunable gelation time to meet wound-healing needs, or enables drug delivery. Recently, a thiolated carboxymethyl HA (CMHA-S) was developed to produce crosslinked hydrogels, sponges, and thin films. CMHA-S can be crosslinked with a thiol-reactive crosslinker or by oxidative disulfide bond formation to form hydrogels. By controlled crosslinking, the shape and form of this material can be manipulated. These hydrogels can be subsequently lyophilized to form sponges or air-dried to form thin films. CMHA-S films, liquids, and gels have been shown to be effective in vivo for treating various injuries and wounds in the eye in veterinary use, and are in clinical development for human use. Critical Issues: Better clinical therapies are needed to treat ophthalmic injuries. Corneal wounds can be treated using this HA-based crosslinked hydrogel. CMHA-S biomaterials can help heal ocular surface defects, can be formed into a film to deliver drugs for local ocular drug delivery, and could deliver autologous limbal stem cells to treat extreme ocular surface damage associated with limbal stem cell deficiencies. Future Directions: This CMHA-S hydrogel increases the options that could be available for improved ocular wound care, healing, and regenerative medicine.",

Recent Advances: Only a few studies with a high level of evidence have been conducted to evaluate treatment of SCLUs. However, several studies have been conducted with a high level of evidence to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in venous leg ulcers, and SCLUs could benefit from these treatments, especially when a venous incompetence or an edema is associated. Pathophysiology of SCLUs includes a vasculopathy related to chronic hemolysis and an endothelial dysfunction, which could be therapeutic approaches to SCLU treatment. Critical Issues: Therapeutic approaches to SCLUs can target SCD on the one hand and skin healing and associated aggravating factors on the other. A review of the literature found only case series and six randomized controlled trials; some offered encouraging results, but most had serious biases. Clinical trials specifically targeting SCLUs are difficult to realize because of the small number of affected patients, in comparison with patients with leg ulcers from other causes. Future Direction: Treating SCLUs remains a challenge. Data in the literature are currently insufficient to offer clear treatment guidelines because of several biases in controlled studies. New studies are under way to assess the efficacy of topical treatments and describe the microbiome of SCLUs. Prevention of SCLU recurrence should be assessed in future clinical trials because the high risk of recurrence is an unsolved critical issue.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Cutaneous wound regeneration is vital to keep skin functions and for large wounds, to maintain human survival. In a deep burn, the ability of the skin to heal is compromised due to the damage of vasculature and resident cells, hindering a coordinated response in the regeneration process. Temporal skin substitutes used as first cover can play a major role in skin regeneration as they allow a rapid wound covering that, in turn, can significantly reduce infection risk, rate of secondary corrective surgeries, and indirectly hospitalization time and costs. Recent Advances: Skin was one of the first tissues to be bioengineered providing thus a skin equivalent; however, what is the current status subsequent to 40 years of tissue engineering? We review the classic paradigms of biological skin substitutes used as first cover and evaluate recent discoveries and clinical approaches adapted for burn injuries cover, with an emphasis on innovative cell-based approaches. Critical Issues: Cell-based first covers offer promising perspectives as they can have an active function in wound healing, such as faster healing minimizing scar formation and prepared wound bed for subsequent grafting. However, cell-based therapies encounter some limitations due to regulatory hurdles, as they are considered as \"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products,\" which imposes the same industry-destined good manufacturing practices as for pharmaceutical products and biological drug development. Future Directions: Further improvements in clinical outcome can be expected principally with the use of cell-based therapies; however, hospital exemptions are necessary to assure accessibility to the patient and safety without hindering advances in therapies.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurological disorder that resulted from destroyed long axis of spinal cord, affecting thousands of people every year. With the occurrence of SCI, the lesions can form cystic cavities and produce glial scar, myelin inhibitor, and inflammation that negatively impact repair of spinal cord. Therefore, SCI remains a difficult problem to overcome with present therapeutics. This review of cell therapeutics in SCI provides a systematic review of combinatory therapeutics of SCI and helps the realization of regeneration of spinal cord in the future. Recent Advances: With major breakthroughs in neurobiology in recent years, present therapeutic strategies for SCI mainly aim at nerve regeneration or neuroprotection. For nerve regeneration, the application approaches are tissue engineering and cell transplantation, while drug therapeutics is applied for neuroprotection. Cell therapeutics is a new approach that treats SCI by cell transplantation. Cell therapeutics possesses advantages of neuroprotection, immune regulation, axonal regeneration, neuron relay formation, and remyelination. Critical Issues: Neurons cannot regenerate at the site of injury. Therefore, it is essential to find a repair strategy for remyelination, axon regeneration, and functional recovery. Cell therapeutics is emerging as the most promising approach for treating SCI. Future Directions: The future application of SCI therapy in clinical practice may require a combination of multiple strategies. A comprehensive treatment of injury of spinal cord is the focus of the present research. With the combination of different cell therapy strategies, future experiments will achieve more dramatic success in spinal cord repair.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Burn injuries remain a large financial burden on the healthcare system. According to CDC statistics (2010), nonfatal and hospitalized burns in the U.S. cost $1.8 billion for an annual incidence of ∼486,000 cases. To date, no technique proves to be the ideal therapy of deep partial-thickness burns. In this study, we review a trial usage of ACell (ACell, Inc.) wound matrix on deep partial-thickness burns. Approach: Burn patients were admitted through the Vanderbilt Emergency Department. Three were consented to receive ACell therapy. Each patient suffered extremity burns, to which ACell MatriStem matrix was applied. Time to epithelialization and healing was monitored up to 1 month postintervention. Results: ACell MatriStem matrix use in deep partial-thickness burns enabled healing by 29 days on average without requiring autografts. The average total body surface area (TBSA) of injury was 7.2% with average TBSA treated with ACell equal to 2.5%. All burn sites underwent re-epithelialization after 5.6 days on average (range 4-7 days). Average length of stay after ACell placement totaled 2 days. All patients fully healed without the need for subsequent grafting or contracture development. No postoperative complications were noted. Innovation: To the extent of our knowledge, this is one of the first reported series to utilize ACell MatriStem product in deep partial-thickness extremity burns. Conclusion: Despite numerous products currently available for burn reconstruction, no one product embodies all the characteristics of an ideal graft. ACell biological extracellular matrix scaffolding appears promising, allowing for healing without use of an autograft.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), β-glucans, a naturally occurring heterogeneous group of polysaccharides, were investigated for their ability to accelerate wound healing in the form of high water-retaining hydrogel dressing. Approach: Full-thickness wounds on the dorsal side of mice created using a 5-mm biopsy punch were treated with β-glucan-based hydrogel for 2 weeks. Standardized photographs of the wound site were taken at regular time intervals to calculate the percentage of wound closure. Tissues isolated from the wound area were subjected to histological examination and immunoblot analysis. Results: β-Glucan-based hydrogel significantly accelerated the duration of wound healing and enhanced the development of skin appendages in the regenerated skin tissue. Increased expression of transforming growth factor-β3 in the skin tissue isolated from the healed wound site indicated that skin regeneration rather than skin repair occurred, thereby minimizing cutaneous scarring. The expression level of cytokeratin 10 and cytokeratin 14 in the isolated skin tissue revealed that the wounds treated with hydrogel showed proper differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes in the epidermal layer. Innovation: Immunomodulating β-glucan (responsible for fighting infections at the wound site, and enhancing the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts) in the form of a three-dimensional hydrogel membrane that retains a high water content (responsible for cooling and soothing effect around the wound site, thereby reducing pain) was prepared and analyzed for its effects on the cutaneous wound healing mechanism. Conclusion: β-Glucan-based hydrogels are promising as wet wound dressings in the health care industry.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fibrosis and scar formation pose a substantial physiological and psychological burden on patients and a significant public health burden on the economy, estimated to be up to $12 billion a year. Fibrosis research is heavily reliant on in vivo models, but variations in animal models and differences between animal and human fibrosis necessitates careful selection of animal models to study fibrosis. There is also an increased need for improved animal models that recapitulate human pathophysiology. Recent Advances: Several murine and porcine models, including xenograft, drug-induced fibrosis, and mechanical load-induced fibrosis, for different types of fibrotic disease have been described in the literature. Recent findings have underscored the importance of mechanical forces in the pathophysiology of scarring. Critical Issues: Differences in skin, properties of subcutaneous tissue, and modes of fibrotic healing in animal models and humans provide challenges toward investigating fibrosis with in vivo models. While porcine models are typically better suited to study cutaneous fibrosis, murine models are preferred because of the ease of handling and availability of transgenic strains. Future Directions: There is a critical need to develop novel murine models that recapitulate the mechanical cues influencing fibrosis in humans, significantly increasing the translational value of fibrosis research. We advocate a translational pipeline that begins in mouse models with modified biomechanical environments for foundational molecular and cellular research before validation in porcine models that closely mimic the human condition.",

One of the compounds (named PDGF2) was subjected for further research after cytotoxicity and proliferation assays on human skin cells. Further investigation included evaluation of: migration and chemotaxis of skin cells, immunological and allergic safety, the transcriptional analyses of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and dermal fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF2, and the use of dorsal skin wound injury model to evaluate the effect of wound healing in mice. Approach: Colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase and tetrazolium assays were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the effect on proliferation. PDGF2 effect on migration and chemotaxis was also checked. Immunological safety and allergic potential were evaluated with a lymphocyte activation and basophil activation test. Transcriptional profiles of ASCs and primary fibroblasts were assessed after stimulation with PDGF2. Eight-week-old BALB/c female mice were used for dorsal skin wound injury model. Results: PDGF2 showed low cytotoxicity, pro-proliferative effects on human skin cells, high immunological safety, and accelerated wound healing in mouse model. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of ASCs and fibroblasts revealed the activation of processes involved in wound healing and indicated its safety. Innovation: A novel peptide derived from PDGF-BB was proved to be safe drug candidate in wound healing. We also present a multifaceted in vitro model for the initial screening of new compounds that may be potentially useful in wound healing stimulation.

    "abstract": "Objective: Pediatric burns are a major source of injury and in the absence of adequate care can lead to lifelong functional loss and disfigurement. While split thickness skin autografts are the current standard of care for deep partial and full-thickness burns, this approach is associated with considerable morbidity. For this reason, alternative skin substitutes such as allografts have gained interest. Approach: In the present study, we present a case series of 30 children with various types of burns treated with dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane (dHACM). Results: We show that treatment with dHACM is associated with an excellent rate of healing comparable to split thickness skin grafts with less rate of hypertrophic scar and contracture. Innovation: Treatment with dHACM is particularly attractive as it consists of many tissue regenerative factors, such as growth factors and immune modulators, thus it will reduce the risk of scaring. Conclusion: While dHACM is associated with an increased upfront cost, treating patients with small to moderate-sized burns with dHACM in their regional centers works to decrease downstream costs such as management of prolonged pain from donor-site morbidity, revisional surgeries from scar and contractures of split thickness grafts, and avoiding the cost of transfer to higher level centers of care. Our findings challenge the current standard of care, suggesting that dHACM provides an alternative to the current use of split thickness skin grafting and is a safe, feasible, and potentially superior substitute for the management of small to moderate total body surface area partial and full-thickness pediatric burns.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Nonhealing wounds have been the subject of decades of basic and clinical research. Despite new knowledge about the biology of impaired wound healing, little progress has been made in treating chronic wounds, leaving patients with few therapeutic options. Diabetic ulcers are a particularly common form of nonhealing wound. Recent Advances: Recently, investigation of therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs), including plasmid DNA, small interfering RNA, microRNA mimics, anti-microRNA oligonucleotides, messenger RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides, has created a new treatment strategy for chronic wounds. TNAs can modulate the wound toward a prohealing environment by targeting gene pathways associated with inflammation, proteases, cell motility, angiogenesis, epithelialization, and oxidative stress. A variety of delivery systems have been investigated for TNAs, including dendrimers, lipid nanoparticles (NPs), polymeric micelles, polyplexes, metal NPs, and hydrogels. This review summarizes recent developments in TNA delivery for therapeutic targets associated with chronic wounds, with an emphasis on diabetic ulcers. Critical Issues: Translational potential of TNAs remains a key challenge; we highlight some drug delivery approaches for TNAs that may hold promise. We also describe current commercial efforts to locally deliver nucleic acids to modulate the wound environment. Future Directions: Localized nucleic acid delivery holds promise for the treatment of nonhealing chronic wounds. Future efforts to improve targeting of these nucleic acid therapies in the wound with both spatial and temporal control through drug delivery systems will be crucial to successful clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) causes high amputation rates owing to its aberrant wound healing. Traditional dressings cannot effectively contribute to DFU healing. Functional hydrogels have been proposed as a promising novel dressing to treat DFU in future, but the evidence for various hydrogels to heal DFU is still ambiguous. Recent Advances: In accordance with PRISMA and CONSORT guidelines, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of functional hydrogels. Four electronic databases and one website were used for data searching. Twenty-four animal studies and six clinical trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 399 diabetic murine models and 278 patients with DFU. Critical Issues: Functional hydrogels accelerated the healing progress for DFU and relieved symptoms in patients. According to their characteristics, the functional hydrogels were divided into antioxidant hydrogel (AOH), antibacterial hydrogel (ABH), multifunctional hydrogel (MFH), proangiogenic hydrogel, and hydrogel promoting proliferation (PPH). By network meta-analysis, AOH and MFH were considered the premium options for treating wounds of diabetic patients at whole stage. Future Direction: Functional hydrogels effectively accelerate healing rates in wounds of diabetic animals. Hydrogels of AOH and MFH might become the ideal candidates for clinical trials on DFU treatment, based on the meta-analyses from the reported work. Early treatment with AOH followed a week later with ABH, which might become an advanced strategy for DFU in future. This information is very important for researchers or/and physicians in taking consideration for alternate application of hydrogel dressings. Scope and Significance: The treatment of DFU imposes a huge burden on medical workers. If DFU is not treated properly, patients will have to suffer from amputation and from spiritual agony. Although various topical dressings have been designated for DFU, the healing ability of those dressings is still unknown well. In this review and meta-analysis, we quantitatively evaluated the reported outcomes of functional hydrogels, pure scaffolds, and controls in 2-week interval. Healing ability of various kinds of functional hydrogels was also assessed in different stages of wound, aiming to screen promising candidates for DFU treatment. This information is valuable in designing smart dressings for researchers or/and physicians in future. Translational Relevance: Considering many external factors like formation of bacterial film and internal factors like hyperglycemia, the progress during DFU healing could involve many biochemical aspects. Persistent inflammation, oxidation stress, and impaired angiogenesis lead to prolonged wound healing and even lethal outcomes. Thus, improvement of topical conditions and inhibition of adverse factors will lead to the alleviated morbidity and even mortality. Clinical Relevance: DFU brings about great burden on patients and medical staffs because of high morbidity and poor prognosis. Improper and powerless treatment might induce high rates of amputation and mortality. Functional hydrogels, mimicking extracellular matrices, would provide the tissue with suitable media and functions to promote DFU healing. The application of various types of hydrogels could be a promising solution to heal DFU and reduce adverse events and costs.",

Conclusion:The research to date is supportive of the use of natural products in wound care.Patients need to be cautioned of potential side effects.Collaborative research between allopathic medicine and medical systems that frequently employ phytochemicals and naturally derived substances, such as Ayurveda and naturopathy, will provide a better understanding of how to integrate natural products into wound care.",

The concept occupies an increasingly prominent place at the center of healthcare reform, and is connected to all aspects of healthcare, including discovery, research, delivery, outcome, and payment. Patient preference research has focused on shared decisions, decisional aids, and clinical practice guideline development, with limited study in acute and chronic wound care populations. The wound care community has focused primarily on patient focused symptoms and quality of life measurement. With increasing recognition of wound care as a medical specialty and as a public health concern that consumes extensive resources, attention to the preferences of end-users with wounds is necessary. This article will provide an overview of related patient-centered concepts and begin to establish a framework for consideration of patient preference in wound care.",

The purpose of this section is to compile the available animal research regarding the effectiveness of ES on the injury potential, healing rate, cellular and molecular proliferation, mechanical properties, and survival rate of skin flaps. Recent Advances: Regardless of the type of ES current and polarity used, most of the animal experimental evidence suggests that application of ES can facilitate wound healing. However, treatment time should be sufficiently long to attain good mechanical strength of regenerated tissue, because tensile strength is not consistent with augmented collagen deposition. ES improves the survival rate and skin blood flow of animal flaps, but clinical studies are needed to substantiate the findings from these animal experiments. Critical Issues: Impaired or delayed healing is a major clinical problem that can lead to wound chronicity. ES with various strategies has been used to facilitate the healing process, but many aspects remain controversial. Despite much research, no consensus exists regarding the detailed effects of ES on wound healing. Nevertheless, ES has been approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicine Services for reimbursement of the treatment of some chronic ulcers. Future Directions: Exogenous ES may promote the directional migration of cells and signaling molecules via electrotaxis; however, its underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. Future studies that further elucidate the mechanisms regulating electrotaxis will be necessary to optimize the use of ES in different wound states.",

However, adipocytes also have the potential to dedifferentiate in culture to cells with stem cell-like properties that may improve their behavior and functionality for certain applications. Approach: ADSCs are adult mesenchymal stem cells that are cultured from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue. However, adipocytes are capable of dedifferentiating into cells with stem cell properties. In this case study, we compare ADSC and dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells from the same patient and fat depot for mesenchymal cell markers, embryonic stem cell markers, ability to differentiate to adipocytes and osteoblasts, senescence and telomerase levels, and ability of conditioned media (CM) to stimulate migration of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Innovation and Conclusions: ADSCs and DFAT cells displayed identical levels of CD90, CD44, CD105, and were CD34- and CD45-negative. They also expressed similar levels of Oct4, BMI1, KLF4, and SALL4. DFAT cells, however, showed higher efficiency in adipogenic and osteogenic capacity. Telomerase levels of DFAT cells were double those of ADSCs, and senescence declined in DFAT cells. CM from both cell types altered the migration of fibroblasts. Despite reports of ADSCs from a number of human depots, there have been no comparisons of the ability of dedifferentiated DFAT cells from the same donor and depot to differentiate or modulate migration of HDFs. Since ADSCs were from an obese diabetic donor, reprogramming of DFAT cells may help improve a patient's cells for regenerative medicine applications.",

When the skin, bone, oral mucous membrane, guts, or salivary glands are damaged by ionizing radiation, the management and treatment are very lengthy and difficult. Critical Issues: In severe and irreversible injuries, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. Several surgical procedures, such as debridement, skin grafting, and local and free-vascularized flaps, are widely used. Recent Advances: In specific cases of major morbidity or in high-risk patients, a newly developed therapy using a patient's own stem cells is safe and effective. Adipose tissue, normally a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells, which are similar to those from the bone marrow, can be harvested, since the procedure is easy, and abundant tissue can be obtained with minimal invasiveness. Future Directions: Based on the molecular basis of radiation injuries, several prospective treatments are under development. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms focus on an individual's sensitivity to radiation in radiogenomics, and the pathology of radiation fibrosis or the effect of radiation on wound healing is being studied and will lead to new insight into the treatment of radiation injuries. Protectors and mitigators are being actively investigated in terms of the timing of administration or dose.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The treatment of chronic wounds results in an enormous drain on healthcare resources in terms of workload, costs, frustration, and impaired quality of life, and it presents a clinical challenge for physicians worldwide. Effective local treatment of a chronic wound has an important role, particularly in patients who are-because of their poor general condition, diminished life expectancy, or unacceptable operative risk-outside of surgical treatment. Recent Advances: Since 2002, our multidisciplinary research group has investigated the properties of Norway spruce (Picea abies) resin in wound healing and its therapeutic applications in wound care. Resin is a complex mixture of resin acids (e.g., abietic, neoabietic, dehydroabietic, pimaric, isopimaric, levopimaric, sandrakopimaric, and palustric acids) and lignans (e.g., pino-, larici-, matairesinol, and p-hydroxycinnamic acid) having substantial antimicrobial, wound-healing, and skin regeneration enhancing properties. Critical Issues: The cornerstone in successful wound care is an efficient causal treatment of the underlying co-morbidities, for example, diabetes, malnutrition, vascular- or certain systemic diseases. However, definitive diagnosis and specific therapy of a chronic wound is often difficult, because the etiology is practically always multi-factorial, and in the chronic phase, confounding factors such as infections invariably impede wound healing. Future Directions: To study the exact molecular mechanism of actions by which resin promotes cellular regeneration and epithelialization during the wound-healing process. To investigate potential antimicrobial properties of resin against the most ominous multidrug-resistant beta-lactamase (including carbapenemases and metallo-β-lactamases) producing bacteria, and to individualize those pharmacologically active compounds which are responsible for the antimicrobial activity of resin.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is building that the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) is an important molecule in regenerative healing of skin and heart. Excess scarring from skin wound healing is a continuing clinical problem. Humans generally lack the ability to regenerate tissue following injury, and some degree of fibrotic repair occurs. In the skin, this results in unsightly scars with inferior mechanical properties. In the heart, scarring causes disruption in the contractility of cardiac muscle and increases the risk of deadly arrhythmia. Therapies that tip the balance of wound healing away from scar tissue and toward regeneration would thus represent a significant medical advance.A cell-permeant peptide, αCT1 (alpha connexin carboxyl-terminal peptide), based on the carboxyl-terminus of connexin43, has been shown to elicit changes in gap junction organization and intracellular communication. In the skin, αCT1 applied at acute time points results in decreased inflammatory response, reduced area of scar progenitor tissue, and restoration of more normal dermal structure and mechanical strength. αCT1 application to infarcted hearts improved cardiac contractility, reduced the propensity for arrhythmia, and increased conduction velocity through the injured heart.Application of therapies like αCT1 could reduce cutaneous scarring and improve mechanical properties of healed skin and the contractile function and electrical stability of the heart following injury or surgery.αCT1 is a potential therapy for cutaneous wounds that could lead to reduced scarring and improvements in the mechanical properties of healed skin. For injured myocardial tissues, this Cx43 mimetic peptide may also provide a therapeutic approach for targeting pathological fibrosis and reducing the likelihood of sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias.",

The regenerative capacity of materials can be enhanced through delivery of factors that promote tissue formation. Gene delivery is a versatile strategy to obtain sustained production of tissue inductive factors. Biomaterial scaffolds capable of gene delivery have been shown to induce transgene expression and tissue growth.The widespread application of biomaterial scaffold systems requires identifying the design principles for the material and vectors that modulate transgene expression temporally and spatially. These technologies and others will ultimately enable spatial and temporal control over expression to recreate the cellular organization and gene expression required for formation of complex tissues.The design parameters for the biomaterials and vectors that modulate the extent and duration of transgene expression and the distribution of transgene-expressing cells within and around the injury are emerging. The cellular interactions with the biomaterial, such as adhesion or migration rate, can influence expression. Furthermore, modulating the interaction between the vector and biomaterial can control vector release while minimizing the exposure to harsh processing conditions.Biomaterial scaffolds that deliver genes encoding for regenerative factors may provide a platform for regenerating complex tissues such as skin, blood vessels, and nerves. Biomaterials capable of localized gene delivery can synergistically target multiple cell processes and will have application to the regeneration of many tissues, with great promise for clinical therapies.",

    "abstract": "The healing of injuries, such as those caused by ischemia (myocardial infarction, stroke), trauma, surgery, and inflammation, tends to happen through undesirable and harmful scarring. Current options in reducing scar formation are largely limited to local intervention in accessible tissues.We have designed a systemically administered, injury-targeted decorin for scar prevention. The delivery of decorin to injured tissues is achieved by fusing recombinant decorin to a 9-amino acid peptide, CARSKNKDC (CAR), which specifically recognizes the vessels in injured tissues and extravasates into the tissue, delivering decorin with it.Decorin is known to prevent tissue fibrosis and promote tissue regeneration. This activity of decorin is based on inhibition of TGF-β and some other regulatory activities. In addition to serving as a delivery vehicle, the CAR component endowed decorin with much stronger neutralizing activity against TGF-β1 in vitro than is obtained with nontargeted decorin. The CAR-decorin fusion protein promoted wound healing in a mouse skin wound model and suppressed scar formation at doses at which nontargeted decorin was inactive. These results show that selective targeting enhances specificity and potency of an antiscarring compound.Targeted decorin provides a new, systemic option for the treatment of scarring and fibrotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant overexpression of proinflammatory molecules is believed to be a key mediator in the formation of chronic skin wounds, and the inhibition of these signals may be an effective therapeutic strategy to promote healing. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can provide gene-specific silencing and may present a safe and effective route for knockdown of inflammatory or other target proteins in chronic skin wounds.siRNA suffers from delivery barriers in vivo such as susceptibility to degradation, membrane impermeability, and transient activity. Therefore, a delivery strategy that stabilizes siRNA, provides intracellular (cytoplasmic) delivery, and produces temporally sustained activity is needed. The novel approach described combines pH-responsive, siRNA-loaded nanoparticles into a biodegradable polyurethane (PUR) scaffold and presents a promising platform for effective, local silencing of deleterious genes in nonhealing skin wounds.The siRNA delivery barriers have been overcome using a nanoparticulate carrier that protects siRNA and responds to pH gradients in the endo-lysosomal pathway to mediate cytosolic delivery. Nanoparticle incorporation into a biodegradable PUR scaffold provides a means for controlling the delivery kinetics of siRNA-loaded carriers. Furthermore, the PUR is injectable, making it feasible for clinical use, and provides a porous tissue template for cell in-growth during tissue regeneration and remodeling. This local siRNA delivery platform can be tuned to optimize release kinetics for specific pathologies.siRNA may provide a new class of biologic drugs that will outperform growth factor approaches, which have shown only moderate clinical success.

Progress in tissue preservation has led to commercialization of hAM. The majority of hAM products are devitalized with various degrees of matrix alteration. Data show the importance of hAM matrix preservation, but little is known about the advantages of retaining viable endogenous cells. In this study, we compared the antioxidant and chemoattractive properties of viable intact cryopreserved hAM (int-hAM) and devitalized cryopreserved hAM (dev-hAM) to determine the benefits of cell preservation. Approach: We evaluated the ability of int-hAM and dev-hAM to protect fibroblasts from oxidant-induced cell damage, to suppress oxidants, and to recruit fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro. Results: Both the int-hAM-derived conditioned medium (CM) and the int-hAM tissue rescued significantly more fibroblasts from oxidant-induced damage than dev-hAM (844% and 93% more, respectively). The int-hAM CM showed a 202% greater antioxidant capacity than dev-hAM. The int-hAM CM enhanced the recruitment of fibroblasts and normal and diseased keratinocytes to a greater extent than dev-hAM (1,555%, 315%, and 151% greater, respectively). Innovation and Conclusion: Int-hAM, in which all native components are preserved, including endogenous viable cells, demonstrated a significantly greater antioxidant and fibroblast and keratinocyte chemoattractive potential compared to dev-hAM, in which viable cells are destroyed. The release of soluble factors that protect fibroblasts from oxidative injury by hAM containing viable cells is a mechanism of hAM antioxidant activity, which is a novel finding of this study.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The treatment and care of patients with skin wounds are a major healthcare expenditure. Burn wounds, iatrogenic surgical wounds, venous stasis dermatitis ulcers, diabetic lower limb ulcers, pressure ulcers, and skin wounds from peripheral neuropathies are largely treated with only supportive care. Despite a great deal of research into using growth factors as therapeutic agents, to date, the field has been disappointing. The only biologic agent that is Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved for promoting skin wound healing is recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), but its modest efficacy and expense limit its use clinically. Recent Advances: Acute hypoxia induced by the clotting of dermal blood vessels during the wounding of skin is a major stress factor that leads to the re-programming of basal keratinocytes to initiate re-epithelialization. The laterally migrating keratinocytes secrete extracellular heat shock protein 90 alpha. Heat shock protein 90 alpha (hsp90α) engages low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) cellular receptors and works as an autocrine factor to stimulate keratinocyte migration (re-epithelialization) and as a paracrine factor to stimulate the migration of dermal fibroblasts (fibroplasia) and microvascular endothelial cells (neo-vascularization). Hypoxia-triggered extracellular heat shock protein 90 alpha acts as the master regulator of initial skin wound healing. Critical Issues: It is not yet known how the engagement of hsp90α with the LRP-1 receptor leads to increased motility of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, or microvascular endothelial cells. Understanding the sequence of how an acute skin wound via hypoxic stress leads to cellular events that ultimately induce accelerated wound closure provides numerous targets for new wound-healing therapeutic agents. Future Directions: Developing data for an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA for a Phase I study using hsp90α in human skin wounds. Identifying the cellular signaling mechanisms by which hsp90α enhances skin cell migration, leading to accelerated wound closure.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Nervous system injuries, both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system are a major cause for pain, loss-of-function, and impairment of daily life. As nervous system injuries commonly heal slowly or incompletely, new therapeutic approaches may be required. Recent Advances: The observation that cultured neurons are able to respond to exogenous electric fields (EFs) by sprouting more neurites and directing growth along the field, along with the presence of endogenous EFs in the developing vertebrate nervous system have led to the suggestion of the use of EFs in a regenerative therapeutic setting. This review discusses the effects of EFs on nervous cells, and their use in the treatment of nervous injuries in the eye, limb nerves, and the spinal cord. Exogenous EFs have been shown to be neuroprotective in various injury models of the eye, including traumatic injury, congenital degenerative retinopathy, and glaucoma. In the PNS, EFs are able to stimulate regrowth and functional recovery in damaged limb nerves. In the spinal cord, axonal regeneration and improved quality of life may be achieved using EF stimulation. Critical Issues: The optimal paradigm for electrical stimulation has not been determined, and the mechanisms behind the effect of EF are still largely unknown. Future Directions: Although the therapeutic use of EFs in the nervous system is still in its infancy, it is a promising therapeutic avenue for otherwise hard to treat injuries. The cellular/molecular mechanisms of such regulation need to be fully investigated, and the efficiency of applied EFs during wound healing needs to be optimized in a systematic approach in both animal models and future clinical trials.",

This study details the physiological consequences of targeted PAI-1 functional inhibition on cutaneous injury repair. Approach: Dorsal skin wounds from FVB/NJ mice, created with a 4 mm biopsy punch, were treated topically with the small-molecule PAI-1 antagonist tiplaxtinin (or vehicle control) for 5 days and then analyzed for markers of wound repair. Results: Compared to controls, tiplaxtinin-treated wounds displayed dramatic decreases in wound closure and re-epithelialization. PAI-1 immunoreactivity was evident at the migratory front in all injury sites indicating these effects were due to PAI-1 functional blockade and not PAI-1 expression changes. Stimulated HaCaT keratinocyte migration in response to recombinant PAI-1 in vitro was similarly attenuated by tiplaxtinin. While tiplaxtinin had no effect on keratinocyte proliferation, cell cycle progression, or apoptosis, it effectively reduced collagen deposition, the number of Ki-67+ fibroblasts, and incidence of differentiated myofibroblasts (i.e., smooth muscle α-actin immunoreactive cells), but not fibroblast apoptosis. Innovation: The role for PAI-1 in hemostasis and fibrinolysis is established; involvement of PAI-1 in cutaneous wound healing, however, remains unclear. This study tests the effect of a small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitor in a murine model of skin wound repair. Conclusion: Loss of PAI-1 activity significantly impaired wound closure. Re-epithelialization and fibroblast recruitment/differentiation were both reduced in tiplaxtinin-treated mice. Therapies directed at manipulation of PAI-1 expression and/or activity may have applicability as a treatment option for chronic wounds and scarring disorders.",

Emerging clinical data on histo-pathological and macroscopic images of evolving wounds, as well as noninvasive measures of blood flow, suggested the need for tissue-realistic, agent-based, and hybrid mechanistic computational simulations of inflammation and wound healing.We developed a computational modeling system, Simple Platform for Agent-based Representation of Knowledge, to facilitate the construction of tissue-realistic models.A hybrid equation-agent-based model (ABM) of pressure ulcer formation in both spinal cord-injured and -uninjured patients was used to identify control points that reduce stress caused by tissue ischemia/reperfusion. An ABM of arterial restenosis revealed new dynamics of cell migration during neointimal hyperplasia that match histological features, but contradict the currently prevailing mechanistic hypothesis. ABMs of vocal fold inflammation were used to predict inflammatory trajectories in individuals, possibly allowing for personalized treatment.The intertwined inflammatory and wound healing responses can be modeled computationally to make predictions in individuals, simulate therapies, and gain mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The use of noncultured autologous stromal vascular fraction or clinical grade adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) is a promising strategy to promote wound healing and tissue repair. Nevertheless, issues regarding the optimal mode of administration remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of local injection and topical spray delivery of ADRCs in a porcine model of thermal burns. Approach: Full-thickness thermal burns were created on the dorsum of 10 Gottingen minipigs. Two days following injury, wounds underwent fascial excision and were randomized to receive control vehicle or freshly isolated autologous ADRCs delivered by either multiple injections into or surrounding the wound bed, or by spray onto the wound surface (0.25 × 106 viable cells/cm2). Healing was evaluated by planimetry, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry at day 7, 12, 16, 21, and 28 posttreatment. Results:In vitro analysis demonstrated that there was no substantial loss of cell number or viability attributable to the spray procedure. Planimetric assessment revealed that delivery of ADRCs by either local injection or topical spray increased wound reepithelialization relative to control at day 14. No significant difference in wound reepithelialization was observed between both delivery approaches. In addition, on day 7 posttreatment, blood vessel density was greater in wounds receiving local or topical spray ADRCs than in the wounds treated with vehicle control. Histopathologic analysis suggests that ADRC treatment may modulate the inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration at day 7 and 12 posttreatment, irrespective of the route of administration. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that local injection and spray delivery of ADRCs modulate inflammation and improve wound angiogenesis and epithelialization. Importantly, both delivery routes exhibited similar effects on wound healing. Given the greater ease-of-use associated with topical spray delivery, these data support the use of a spray system for autologous ADRC delivery.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Eicosanoids are biologically active lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid that are important in injury and inflammatory responses. Cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 mediate the production of prostanoids, whereas 5-lipoxygenase mediates the production of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. These lipid mediators have traditionally been known to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of injury and inflammation. However, they also interact with various cells that are resident to the wound bed, including modulation of keratinocyte activity. Recent Advances: Recent work has identified multiple prostanoid and leukotriene receptors on keratinocytes, indicating that eicosanoids directly interact with them. Recent work also shows that keratinocytes are capable of producing prostanoids and leukotrienes. Critical Issues: Much of the critical work has been performed in cell culture and mouse in vivo models. This has greatly expanded our understanding of the eicosanoid interactions with keratinocytes and wound healing in general. However, few of these in vivo models have been able to critically evaluate keratinocyte migration and re-epithelialization. Future Directions: As research continues in this exciting field, the cellular pathways stimulated by the eicosanoids will become better defined. Future research with excisional wound models in mice and pigs and ex vivo human skin models will better isolate the contribution of eicosanoid-mediated effects on keratinocyte migration and re-epithelialization.",

Therefore, information obtained from in vivo studies should be assessed critically. Additional studies, in particular those that seek to elucidate the mechanisms by which novel therapies reduce contraction, are needed to gain sufficient confidence to move into clinical testing.The use of knockout mouse models in particular has generated significant advances in knowledge of the mechanisms behind myofibroblast conversion and other factors involved in generating tension across the wound.

There is a strong clinical need for an improved wound dressing that can balance wound moisture, promote cell migration and proliferation, and degrade at an appropriate rate to minimize the need for dressing changes. Approach: To this end, we have developed a bioactive, hydrogel microsphere wound dressing that incorporates a collagen-mimetic protein, Scl2GFPGER, to promote active wound healing. A redesigned Scl2GFPGER, engineered collagen (eColGFPGER), was created to reduce steric hindrance of integrin-binding motifs and increase overall stability of the triple helical backbone, thereby resulting in increased cell adhesion to substrates. Results: This study demonstrates the successful modification of the Scl2GFPGER protein to eColGFPGER, which displayed enhanced stability and integrin interactions. Fabrication of hydrogel microspheres provided a matrix with adaptive moisture technology, and degradation rates have potential for use in human wounds. Innovation: This collagen-mimetic wound dressing was designed to permit controlled modulation of cellular interactions and degradation rate without impact on other physical properties. Its fabrication into uniform hydrogel microspheres provides a bioactive dressing that can readily conform to irregular wounds. Conclusion: Overall, this new eColGFPGER shows strong promise in the generation of bioactive hydrogels for wound healing as well as a variety of tissue scaffolds.",

Beyond the acute surgical and rehabilitative efforts that focus primarily on wound care and restoring mobility, traumatic LL and LS are associated with several debilitating longer term secondary health conditions (e.g., low back pain [LBP], osteoarthritis [OA], and cardiovascular disease [CVD]) that can adversely impact physical function and quality of life. Recent Advances: Despite recent advancements in prosthetic and orthotic devices, altered movement and mechanical loading patterns have been identified among persons with LL and salvage, which are purported risk factors for the development of longer term secondary musculoskeletal conditions and may limit functional outcomes and/or concomitantly impact cardiovascular health. Critical Issues: The increased prevalence of and risk for LBP, OA, and CVD among the relatively young cohort of SMs with LL and LS significantly impact physiological and psychological well-being, particularly over the next several decades of their lives. Future Directions: Longitudinal studies are needed to characterize the onset, progression, and recurrence of health conditions secondary to LL and salvage. While not a focus of the current review, detailed characterization of physiological biomarkers throughout the rehabilitation process may provide additional insight into the current understanding of disease processes of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.",

The aim of this study was to compare the role of CO2 laser, triamcinolone (TAC), and verapamil in the treatment of keloid. Approach: A randomized parallel-group study was conducted in which 60 patients were randomly allocated to three groups from May 2017 to April 2018. First group received fractional CO2 laser therapy, second group received triamcinolone, and third group received intralesional verapamil. Outcomes were evaluated using Vancouver scar scale score at 3 weekly intervals for 6 months. Results: There was a reduction in scar height, vascularity, and pliability in all the three groups. However, pigmentation was not completely resolved by any of the three modalities. The response was fastest in case of triamcinolone followed by verapamil and laser, which was statistically significant. There was reduction in pain and pruritus in all the three groups and lesser injection site pain with verapamil. There was some amount of charring with CO2 laser. Innovation: Our study provides evidence that TAC has the fastest response in treating keloids when compared to other modalities. Scar pigmentation is the parameter that is not completely resolved by TAC, verapamil, or CO2 laser. Conclusion: The study revealed that fractional CO2 laser and verapamil are as efficient as triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) for treating keloids, except it takes longer for laser and verapamil to act compared to TAC. Verapamil can be used as an alternative treatment modality that is cost-effective with minimal adverse effects.",

Recent Advances: This review highlights the role of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor in angiogenesis and wound healing and looks at how angiogenic inhibitors promote wound-healing complications. Critical Issues: With an increased use of anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of various cancers and ocular diseases, there is an increased need for clinicians to define the risks and to optimize the usage of these drugs to reduce the incidence of cutaneous side effects and wound-healing complications. In addition, awareness is needed when treating patients on anti-angiogenic drugs so as not to exacerbate potential wound-healing complications when performing surgical procedures. Future Directions: Clinicians and surgeons will need to develop management guidelines to optimize patient care to reduce the risk of morbidity. When performing a surgical procedure, the impact of adverse effects from the use of anti-angiogenic drugs should be considered to ensure the welfare of the patient. In addition, the development of more specific inhibitors is necessary to reduce target effects to reduce the occurrence of adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Delayed wound healing in lymphedema is assumed to be caused by two reasons, pathophysiological and immunological effects of lymphedema. The aim of this review is to establish how impaired lymphatics alter wound healing pathophysiologically and immunologically, and to propose treatment modalities that can promote wound healing in lymphedema. Lymphaticovenular anastomoses (lymphovenous anastomoses [LVAs]) were performed on patients who had recurrent cellulitis several times with lymphorrhea and developed severe ulcers that were refractory to skin grafts, flaps, and conservative therapy. The lymphorrhea and the ulcer had healed by 4 weeks. Moreover, the lymphedema improved without compression therapy. Lymphedema is characterized pathophysiologically by localized peripheral edema that compresses the microvasculature and lymphatic vasculature and impairs tissue remodeling. Another suspected mechanism is an imbalance in the differentiation of participating immune cells. Profound suppression of T helper (Th)1 cells is likely to increase the risk of infection, and excessive differentiation of Th2 cells, including M2 macrophage polarization, may promote fibrosis, which disrupts the carefully orchestrated wound healing process. Although negative-pressure wound therapy is useful for the treatment of delayed wound healing in lymphedema, LVAs may be necessary to treat the fundamental problem of lymphedema. LVAs are considered to create a bypass to the lymph nodes through which dendritic cells (DCs) can transmit antigen information to T cells. LVAs are considered to neutralize chronic inflammation by allowing more DCs to return into the circulation, thereby improving wound healing.",

Approach: Using electrospinning we were able to prepare wound dressings with antimicrobial action thanks to their large surface per volume ratio, which allows their loading with therapeutic amounts of active principles. By nuclear magnetic resonance we demonstrated that the antimicrobial compounds are donors of hydrogen bonds to the ester functional group in PCL, which acts as acceptor and that intermolecular interaction is responsible for the high drug loading achieved. Results: Those mats loaded with CAR and THY without the use of solubilizing agents were able to completely eradicate both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli S17 strain) bacteria at doses inferior to the ones needed when using the free nonsupported compounds. A superior antimicrobial action was observed for THY and CAR against Gram-negative bacteria than against Gram-positive bacteria, despite the higher hydrophilicity of the outer layer of Gram-negative bacteria. Innovation: We demonstrate that a direct contact between the bacteria and the dressing is required to elicit antimicrobial action. We also evaluated drug loadings by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance validating a new analytical approach. Finally we were able to visualize the pathogenic bacteria on the dressings by confocal microscopy. Conclusion: The interaction between the PCL-based mat and the pathogenic bacteria is a key issue to achieve complete pathogen eradication. Under no-contact conditions, released CAR or THY from the electrospun mats did not exert any antimicrobial action at the doses tested.",

To comprehensively address this growing clinical issue, physicians should also be aware of how conditions of the human social environment may affect wound healing. Here we provide a review of the emerging field of social genomics and its potential impact on the wound healing. Recent Advances: Multiple studies using human and animal models have correlated social influences and their contributing effects to acute and chronic stress with delays in wound healing. Furthermore, observations between nongenetic factors such as nutrition, socioeconomic, and educational status have also shown to have a direct or indirect impact on clinical outcomes of wound healing. Critical Issues: Nutrition, financial burden, socioeconomic and education status, and acute and chronic stress are variables that have either direct (epigenetic) or indirect impact on wound healing and patients' quality of life. Wound care is costly and remains a challenge placing economic burden on patients. Furthermore, poor clinical outcomes and complications including loss of mobility and disability may lead to job loss, further contributing to socioeconomic related stress. Thus, the economic burden and inadequate wound healing are intertwined, making each other worse. Future Directions: Although some evidence regarding the specific changes in genetic pathways imparted by conditions of the social environment exists, further studies are warranted to identify potential mechanisms, interventions, and prevention approaches.",

Malnutrition can lead to longer hospital stays, altered immune function, and impaired skin integrity and wound healing. Malnutrition has been found to be a significant factor influencing pressure injury (PI) risk and wound healing. While PI prevention requires multidimensional complex care using a variety of evidence-based strategies, hospitalized patients benefit from interventions that focus on improving oral nutrition to reduce PI risk and enhance wound healing. Unfortunately, malnutrition is often under-recognized and inadequately managed in hospitalized patients and this can lead to higher rates of complications such as PI. Recent Advances: Recent studies suggest that nutritional care has a major impact in PI prevention and management. Strategies, including early identification and management of malnutrition and provision of specially-formulated oral nutritional interventions to at-risk patients, optimization of electronic health record systems to allow for enhanced administration, monitoring, and evaluation of nutritional therapies, and implementation of protocol-based computerized decision support systems, have been reported to improve outcomes. Critical Issues: Unfortunately, there are gaps in the implementation of nutritional care in hospitals. Timely identification and management of malnutrition is needed to advance quality care for hospitalized patients and reduce malnutrition and associated PI.

When the skin is wounded, epidermal stem cells in the hair follicle activate and start migrating into the wound site, differentiating into epidermal cells. and contributing to the reepithelialization of the wound. The hair follicles represent the deepest epidermal elements in the skin, which are extremely beneficial in partial-thickness burns and abrasions where the skin can regenerate from the hair follicles. Recent Advances: Advanced animal models have demonstrated that the contribution of epidermal stem cells in the hair follicle bulge and isthmus regions is important for wound healing. In addition, several clinical studies have shown successful harvesting and transplantation of hair follicles as a treatment modality to accelerate wound healing. Critical Issues: Deep and large wounds require hospitalization and, without exception, surgical treatment. Harvesting and direct transplantation of hair follicles could provide a great source of autologous epidermal stem cells for wound healing. The procedure can be done in an outpatient setting, quickly and without creating a large donor site wound. Future Directions: Transplantation of hair follicles in a combination with novel biomaterials could provide advantageous treatment possibilities for both chronic wounds and burns. There is a substantial amount of molecular signaling data available on the role of hair follicles during wound repair, but almost all the data are derived from rodent models, and thus, more information from large animals and most importantly from humans would be beneficial and help to advance this promising treatment further.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds are one of the major burdens of the U.S. health care system with an annual cost of $31.7 billion and affecting an estimated 2.4-4.5 million people. Several underlying molecular and cellular pathophysiological mechanisms, including poor vascularization, excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by proteases, decreased growth factor activity, and bacterial infection can lead to chronic wounds. More effective wound therapies need to address one or more of these mechanisms to significantly advance wound care. Recent Advances: Self-assembled nanomaterials may provide new therapeutic options for chronic wound healing applications as those materials generally exhibit excellent biocompatibility and can bear multiple functionalities, such as ECM-mimicking properties, drug delivery capabilities, and tunable mechanics. Furthermore, self-assembled nanomaterials can be produced at low cost, and owing to their ability to self-organize, generate complex multifunctional structures that can be tailored to the varying sizes and shapes of chronic wounds. Self-assembled nanomaterials have been engineered to serve as wound dressings, growth factor delivery systems, and antimicrobials. Critical Issues: As there are many different types of self-assembled nanomaterials, which in turn have different mechanisms of self-assembly and physiochemical properties, one type of self-assembled nanomaterials may not be sufficient to address all underlying mechanisms of chronic wounds. However, self-assembled nanomaterials can be easily tailored, and developing multifunctional self-assembled nanomaterials that can address various targets in chronic wounds will be needed. Future Directions: Future studies should investigate combinations of various self-assembled nanomaterials to take full advantage of their multifunctional properties.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Skin fibrosis places an enormous burden on patients and society, but disagreement exists over methods to quantify severity of skin scarring. A suction cutometer measures skin elasticity in vivo, but it has not been widely adopted because of inconsistency in data produced. We investigated variability of several dimensionless parameters generated by the cutometer to improve their precision and accuracy. Approach: Twenty adult human subjects underwent suction cutometer measurement of normal skin (NS) and fibrotic scars (FS). Using Mode 1, each subject underwent five trials with each trial containing four curves. R0/2/5/6/7 and Q1/2/3 data were collected. Analyses were performed on these calculated parameters. Results: R0/2/5/6/7 and Q1/2 parameters from curves 1 to 4 demonstrated significant differences, whereas these same parameters were not significantly different when only using curves 2-4. Individual analysis of all parameters between curve 1 and every subsequent curve was statistically significant for R0, R2, R5, R6, R7, Q1, and Q2. No differences were appreciated for parameter Q3. Comparison between NS and FS were significantly different for parameters R5, Q1, and Q3. Innovation: Our study is the first demonstration of accurate comparison between NS and FS using the dimensionless parameters of a suction cutometer. Conclusions: Measured parameters from the first curve of each trial were significantly different from subsequent curves for both NS and FS. Precision and reproducibility of data from dimensionless parameters can therefore be improved by removing the first curve. R5, Q1, and Q3 parameters differentiated NS as more elastic than FS.",

Understanding indications and applications for laser therapy is essential for physicians to improve patient outcomes. Recent Advances: Since the 1980s, the medical use of lasers has continuously evolved with improvements in technology. Novel lasers and fractionated technologies are currently being studied in the hopes to improve treatment efficacy, while reducing complications. Recent advancements include acne treatment with novel picosecond lasers, new hypertrophic scar therapies with simultaneous laser and intense pulsed light use, and novel systems such as lasers with intralesional optical fiber delivery devices. In addition, optimizing the timing of laser therapy and its use in multimodal treatments continue to advance the field of photothermolysis. Critical Issues: Selecting the correct laser for a given indication is the fundamental decision when choosing a laser balancing effective treatment with minimal complications. This article covers the principles of laser therapy, the preferred lasers used for the treatment of scarring and vascular anomalies, and discusses the current evidence behind these laser choices. Future Directions: To optimize laser therapy, larger randomized control trials and split scar studies are needed.

Approach: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 116 patients who received scar treatment in our hospital, of which 58 patients received fractional CO2 laser treatment, and 58 patients received injection treatment. The outcome measures comprised the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The observation intervals occur at specific times. Evaluated at 6 months of follow-up, the outcome was blinded, on-site evaluation using the dermatological appearance scale (DAS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Patients in the fractional carbon-dioxide laser (CO2FL) group rated better than those in the injection group in the POSAS, VSS, DAS, and VAS scores (p < 0.05). The therapeutic efficacy and patients' satisfaction of the research group were superior to those in the control group. Innovation: Scars following surgical procedures can be treated in a variety of methods, but there is no consensus on the best method. CO2FL has exhibited safety and is more effective than traditional injection treatments for surgical scars. It is a worthwhile approach to consider in clinical treatment. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that CO2FL achieves more significant long-term results in surgical scars, including improved scar appearance, safety, and patient satisfaction.",

Dermal sheath cells (DSCs), residing surrounding hair follicles, play a critical role in tissue repair, yet their regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study used single-cell proteomics with the AcanCreER;R26LSL-tdTomato-DTR mouse model to explore DSC function across different healing stages. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and temporal clustering (Mfuzz) were employed to reveal dynamic functional shifts. GSEA identified enriched gene sets related to interferon-gamma response, inflammatory response, ultraviolet response, myogenesis, and xenobiotic metabolism. Temporal clustering revealed eight distinct clusters: clusters associated with the early contracting and proliferative phases were linked to metabolic activation and oxidative stress, while clusters from the later remodeling phase emphasized extracellular matrix remodeling and structural reorganization. The dynamic expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes and keratins supported DSCs' dual epithelial and mesenchymal traits. Additionally, keratins, collagens, integrins, and actin proteins emerged as promising markers or signature molecules for DSCs. This study reveals DSCs' dual traits during wound repair, providing a basis for therapies to enhance healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Colorectal cancer is currently ranked third in terms of the global cancer incidence. Enterostomy, a common surgical procedure for colorectal cancer treatment, creates a temporary or permanent stoma in the abdominal wall for waste excretion. Cancer itself and the associated treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, increase the likelihood of various types of peristomal skin damage. Recent Advances: Recent research has focused on developing more targeted treatment approaches for peristomal moisture-associated skin damage (P-MASD). In addition, studies are investigating the potential of novel wound care products and therapies to enhance healing and reduce the risk of complications. There is also growing interest in understanding the different types except P-MASD during chemoradiotherapy. Different types match the varied treatments. Thus, we aimed to comprehensively review the most prevalent types of peristomal skin damage during chemoradiotherapy and their associated risk factors. Critical Issues: The five prevalent types of peristomal skin damage that occur during chemoradiotherapy are peristomal radiodermatitis, P-MASD, peristomal acneiform rash, peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum, and peristomal abscess/infection/fistula. The risk factors vary depending on the type; however, they include the radiation dose, ileostomy surgery, chemoradiotherapy-associated diarrhea, use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, inflammatory bowel disease, and unclear factors. Future Directions: This review guides the clinical identification of peristomal skin damage during chemoradiotherapy, laying a solid foundation for developing effective strategies to prevent this condition.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this open-label, interventional, prospective clinical study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal wound matrix (MWM) in moving chronic, nonhealing wounds that had failed prior therapies onto a healing trajectory. The overall response rate was the proportion of subjects who had greater than 40% reduction in size after 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives included the percentage area reduction (PAR) after 4 and 12 weeks, incidence of ulcer closing, and changes in quality of life. Approach: An open-label, interventional, prospective cohort, real-world evidence study was conducted following the STROBE criteria. Criteria included chronic nonhealing wounds of multiple etiologies in subjects with extensive comorbidities. Results were compared with data from the U.S. Wound Registry. Results: A total of 111 subjects entered the screening phase and 64 were treated. Fifty-three wounds were eligible for the dataset that included 18 diabetic foot ulcers, 19 venous leg ulcers, 2 pressure injuries, 1 surgical, 1 lower extremity wound, and 12 unclassified etiologies. The objective response rate was 42%. The 4-week PAR was 34%. The 12-week PAR was 66%. Eighteen wounds closed by week 12. Innovation: MWM is a formulation technology developed to address the major obstacles that prevent healing. Results were evaluated in a patient population with extensive comorbidities that had failed prior treatments and would be generally excluded from controlled trials. Conclusion: The results from this study support the contention that MWM achieves substantial clinical improvement in a complex patient population not enrolled in clinical trials and demonstrates an advancement in wound management.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The skin serves as the primary defense against external stimuli, making it vulnerable to damage. Injuries can cause a dysregulated environment, resulting in chronic inflammation and inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, which delays recovery. Innovative approaches, such as three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, can foster a controlled healing environment by promoting synergy between the skin microbiome and cells. Recent Advances: Traditional approaches to wound healing have focused on fostering an environment conducive to the interplay between cells, extracellular proteins, and growth factors. 3D bioprinting, a manufacturing technology with applications in tissue engineering, deposits biomaterial-based bioink containing living cells to fabricate custom-designed tissue scaffolds in a layer-by-layer fashion. This process controls the architecture and composition of a construct, producing multilayered and complex structures such as skin. Critical Issues: The selection of biomaterials for scaffolds has been a challenge when 3D skin tissue engineering. While prioritizing mechanical properties, current biomaterials often lack the ability to interact with environmental stimuli such as pH, temperature, or oxygen levels. Employing smart biomaterials that integrate bioactive molecules and adapt to external conditions could overcome these limitations. This innovation would enable scaffolds to create a sustainable wound-healing environment, fostering microbiome balance, reducing inflammation, and facilitating cellular recovery and tissue restoration, addressing critical gaps in existing wound care solutions. Future Directions: Novel bioink formulations for skin injury recovery are focused on improving long-term cell viability, proliferation, vascularization, and immune integration. Efficient recovery of the skin microbiome using bioactive molecules has the potential to create microenriched environments that support the recovery of the skin microbiome and restore immune regulation. This promising direction for future research aims to improve patient outcomes in wound care.",

Patients undergoing CT repair frequently experience healing failures, compromised function, and chronic degenerative diseases. The identification of biomarkers to guide improved clinical outcomes after CT injuries remains an emerging but promising field. [Figure: see text] [Figure: see text] Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, were searched up to August 2024. Eligibility criteria: To achieve the research objective, randomized control trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies on biomarkers associated with CT repair and healing outcomes were selected. The present analysis was confined to clinical and preclinical models, excluding imaging studies. The entire process of this systematic review adhered strictly to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses protocol checklist. Results: A total of 1,815 studies on biomarkers of CT repair were initially identified, with 75 studies meeting eligibility criteria and 55 passing quality assessments. For biomarkers associated with CT healing outcomes, 281 studies were considered, with 30 studies meeting eligibility criteria and 24 passing quality assessments. Twenty-one overlapping studies investigated the effects of biomarkers on both CT repair and healing outcomes. Specific biomarkers identified, and ranked from highest to lowest quality, include complement factor D, eukaryotic elongation factor-2, procollagen type I N-terminal propetide, procollagen type III N-terminal propetide, lactate, pyruvate, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), cysteine-rich protein-1, plastin-3, periostin, protein S100-A11, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9), hepatocyte growth factor, interferon-γ, interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10), MMP-1, MMP-3, tumor necrosis factor-α, fibroblast growth factor-2, IL-1α, chondroitin-6-sulfate, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain-4, transforming growth factor-beta 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, C-C chemokine receptor 7, C-C chemokine ligand 19, IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-12p40, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and TIMP-1. Conclusions: All of the 37 identified potential biomarkers demonstrated regulatory effects on CT repair and mediated healing outcomes. Notably, the identified biomarkers from human studies can potentially play an essential role in the development of targeted treatment protocols to counteract compromised healing and can also serve as predictors for detecting CT healing processes and long-term outcomes.",

Approach: This is a cross-sectional study on PU globally from 1990 to 2021. This analysis assessed incidence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of PU by age, sex, and location, focusing on the relationship between PU burden and microbial infections, AMR, and climate factors. Results: Incidence and DALYs of PU increased from 1990 to 2021, while the corresponding age-standardized rate (ASR) declined or remained steady. ASR of incidence was highest in high sociodemographic index (SDI) areas and lowest in those with low SDI, while ASR of DALYs showed the opposite pattern. PU burden positively correlated with microbial infections and AMR in skin and subcutaneous infections (p < 0.05), and its increase was also associated with high temperature and humidity. Regardless of age, males bear a greater disease burden. However, with aging, females gradually surpass males in disease burden. Innovation: This study offers decision-makers insights into PU burden, contributing factors, and forecasts, supporting informed policies to mitigate its impact. Conclusion: PU poses a rising global challenge with persistent disease burden, especially in low-SDI and low-income regions. Microbial infections, AMR, and climate factors are associated with increased burden. Targeted policies and enhanced epidemiological understanding are crucial for effective prevention and control.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Nonhealing or chronic wounds represent a significant and growing global health concern, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, health care systems, and economies worldwide. Although the standard-of-care treatment involves the application of wound dressings, most dressing materials are not specifically designed to address the pathological processes underlying chronic wounds. This review highlights recent advances in biomaterial design tailored to chronic wound healing. Recent Advances: Chronic wounds are characterized by persistent inflammation, impaired granulation tissue formation, and delayed re-epithelialization. Newly developed designer materials aim to manage reactive oxygen species and extracellular matrix degradation to suppress inflammation while promoting vascularization, cell proliferation, and epithelial migration to accelerate tissue repair. Critical Issues: Designing optimal materials for chronic wounds remains challenging due to the diverse etiology and a multitude of pathological mechanisms underlying chronic wound healing. While designer materials can target specific aberrations, designing a materials approach that restores all aberrant wound-healing processes remains the Holy Grail. Addressing these issues requires a deep understanding of how cells interact with the materials and the complex etiology of chronic wounds. Future Directions: New material approaches that target wound mechanics and senescence to improve chronic wound closure are under development. Layered materials combining the best properties of the approaches discussed in this review will pave the way for designer materials optimized for chronic wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Oral mucosal wound healing is not completely understood, and effective therapies are lacking. This study explores the potential of an adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) exosome sheet in enhancing intraoral wound healing in rats. Approach: An ADSC exosome sheet derived from Tisseel and rat adipose tissue (ADSC-exo) was applied to 16 rats with 6 mm full-thickness mucosal hard palate wounds. Eight wounds received ADSC-exo with a superficial occlusive dressing (ADSC-exo group), and eight received only an occlusive dressing (control group). Wound closure was monitored on days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10, with dressings changed every 2 days. On day 10, rats were sacrificed, and wounds (n = 8 per group) were collected for immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro, four ADSC-exosome concentrations (0, 4.5 × 1011, 9 × 1011, and 18 × 1011 exosomes/mL; n = 4 per group) were applied to rat oral mucosal fibroblasts to assess migration speed. Results: ADSC-exo accelerated wound closure (18% ± 5% vs. 35% ± 9% of initial wound area; p = 0.002) and fibroblast migration (for 18 × 1011 exosomes/mL at 24 h: 29.7% ± 3% vs. 62.2% ± 4% of initial gap area; p < 0.0001) compared with the control. ADSC-exo promoted reepithelialization (87% ± 14% vs. 21% ± 6%; p < 0.0001), proliferation (34 ± 12 vs. 18 ± 7 Ki67+/high-power field [HPF]; p = 0.004), and neovascularization (28 ± 9 vs. 11 ± 5 CD31+/HPF; p = 0.0002) while reducing inflammation (4 ± 1 vs. 13 ± 9 CD68+/HPF; p < 0.0001) and increasing M2 macrophages (9.2 ± 2 vs. 4.2 ± 3 CD163+/HPF; p = 0.0008). ADSC-exo increased Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) (1.3 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.2; p = 0.006), Smad3 (0.9 ± 0.02 vs. 0.7 ± 0.1; p = 0.006), and collagen I (1.5 ± 0.9 vs. 0.5 ± 0.3; p = 0.005) while downregulating caspase-3 (0.7 ± 0.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.2; p = 0.003) and Bax (0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1; p < 0.0001). Innovation: This is the first study to demonstrate the pro-wound healing effects of an ADSC exosome sheet on intraoral wounds. This paves the way for future research and clinical applications of ADSC exosomes in mucosal wound healing. Conclusions: Application of an ADSC-exo to rat mucosal wounds significantly improved wound healing. Mechanistically, these effects may be linked to upregulated activity of the TGF-β/Smad pathway.",

Approach: A multidisciplinary diabetic foot care center (MDDFCC) was opened at our institution in August 2018. Outcomes of DFU treatment, including re-admission, amputation, and mortality rates, were compared before and after opening the MDDFCC. Results: Patients seen after the MDDFCC was opened had a lower risk of 1-year re-admission (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.697, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.387-0.988), 1-year major amputation (HR = 0.447, 95% CI: 0.091-0.984), and 1-year disease-specific mortality (HR = 0.277, 95% CI: 0.105-0.730). PEDIS score (HR = 2.343, 95% CI: 1.264-2.971), history of dialysis (HR = 1.858, 95% CI: 1.258-4.053), and consultation with a physiatrist (HR = 0.368, 95% CI: 0.172-0.788), orthopedist (HR = 0.105, 95% CI: 0.042-0.261), or social worker (HR = 0.370, 95% CI: 0.082-0.871) were associated with 1-year major amputation. One-year major amputation (HR = 2.636, 95% CI: 1.586-4.570), age (HR = 1.094, 95% CI: 1.051-1.140), and C-reactive protein level (HR = 1.052, 95% CI: 1.008-1.098) were associated with 1-year disease-specific mortality. Innovation: Plastic surgeons received patients at the MDDFCC, with active participation by all contributing members. This arrangement brought advantages, including more aggressive and timely surgical intervention, a more timely and higher rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and equally robust integrated medical care by all other members. Conclusion: The MDDFCC approach may be a potential organizational structure with for treating DFUs, resulting in significant improvements in outcomes of DFU including a lower re-admission, amputation, and mortality.",

Defining the significance, phenotype, clinical classification, and treatment guidelines has been historically lacking of evidence and based on paradigms that do not represent the scientific or clinical reality.Chronic wound bioburden is typically abundant, polymicrobial, and extremely diverse. These microbes naturally adopt biofilm phenotypes, which are quite often viable but not culturable, thereby going undetected. The failures of culture-based detection have led to abandonment of routine bioburden evaluation and aggressive treatment or, worse, to assume bioburden is not a significant barrier. Predictably, treatment regimens to address biofilm phenotypes lagged behind our diagnostic tools and understanding.Microbial DNA-based diagnostic tools and treatment regimens have emerged, which provide and leverage objective information, resulting in a dramatic impact on outcomes.Modern medicine demands decisions based on objective evidence. The diagnostic and treatment protocols reviewed herein empower clinicians to practice modern medicine with regard to bioburden, with DNA level certainty.Bioburden is a significant barrier to healing for all chronic wounds. Molecular diagnostics provide the first objective means of assessing wound bioburden. The accuracy and comprehensive data from such diagnostic methodologies provide clinicians with the ability to employ patient-specific treatment options, targeted to each patient's microbial wound census. Based on current outcomes data, the most effective therapeutic options are topical (TPL) antibiofilm agents (ABF) combined with TPL antibiotics (ABX). In specific patients, systemic ABX and selective biocides are also appropriate, but not exclusive of ABF combined with TPL ABX.",

    "abstract": "Background: Keloids are benign, fibroproliferative lesions that represent abnormal healing resulting in excessive fibrosis. They are composed of mainly type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. Some of the symptoms include pruritus, tenderness, and pain. Often, they are very difficult to treat and prevent from recurrence. In contrast to hypertrophic scars, keloids extend beyond the margin of the wound. The Problem: There is very limited evidence on the best wound management for minimizing scarring. Multiple available therapeutic modalities have been used for the treatment of keloids; however, high-recurrence rates continue to be reported. Unsuccessful treatment of keloids leads to psychological impact on the patients and increased economic burden. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: Currently, there are biological and antineoplastic agents that can potentially treat and prevent excessive scar formation. Some of them have been used as \"off label\" therapies, and others are still in the experimental phase such as interferon alpha (IFN-α), imiquimod, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1). The use of IFN-α2b showed 18% recurrence rate when applied to postsurgical excised keloids. Imiquimod 5% can lower recurrence rate on postshaved keloids to 37.5% at 6-month and to 0% at a 12-month follow-up period. TGF-β1 oligonucleotides have shown effective and long-lasting inhibition of TGF-β-mediated scarring in vitro as well as in animal models. Daily injections of neutralizing antibodies against TGF-β1 and -β2 have shown successful reductions in scarring. Conclusion: Latest discoveries in the use of novel agents suggest therapeutic alternatives for the prevention of recurrences of hypertrophic scars and postexcision keloid lesions.",

Debate remains over the appropriate timing of enteral nutrition and the benefit of supplemental trace elements, antioxidants, and immunonutrition for critically ill burn patients. Pharmacotherapy to blunt the metabolic response to burn injury plays a critical role in effective nutritional support. Recent Advances: Further evidence is demonstrating long-term benefits from pharmacologic immunomodulation given the prolonged metabolic response to injury that may last for over a year following the initial insult. Critical Issues: The majority of evidence regarding early enteral feeding comes from mixed populations and smaller studies. However, on balance, available evidence favors early feeding. Data regarding immunonutrition does not support the routine use of these products. Limited data regarding use of antioxidants and trace elements support their use. Future Directions: Further evaluation of anti-inflammatory mediators of the immune response, such as statins, will likely play a role in the future. Further data are needed on the dosing and route of micronutrients as well as the utility of immunonutrition. Finally, little is known about nutrition in the obese burn patient making this an important area for investigation.",

However, chronic wounds are characterized by abnormally high levels of proteases, in particular, the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and neutrophil elastase. In 2010, an international consensus panel identified elevated MMPs and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) as strong candidates for biomarkers for nonhealing wounds. A cooperative group of wound healing centers (SerenaGroup, Inc., Cambridge, MA and Systagenix, Inc., Gargrave, England) collaborated to conduct a series of laboratory and clinical trials to develop the first point-of-care diagnostic in wound healing. The first challenge was that detecting an elevated protease activity required an accurate specimen collection technique. The Levine technique utilized in the collection of bacteria for culture, using a cotton swab, failed to gather consistent levels of proteases. Extensive experimentation with collection methods and swab types finally led to the optimal procedure, The Serena Technique©. Laboratory measurements for MMPs and HNE confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the procedure. This article describes a novel method for collecting wound proteases (The Serena Technique©).",

    "abstract": "Stress-induced disruption of hormonal balance in animals and humans has a detrimental effect on wound healing.After the injury, keratinocytes migrate over the wound bed to repair a wound. However, their nonmigratory phenotype plays a role in pathogenesis of chronic wounds. Despite many therapeutic approaches, there is a dearth of treatments targeting the molecular mechanisms mediated by stress that prevent epithelization.Recent studies show that epidermal keratinocytes synthesize stress hormones. During acute wound healing, cortisol synthesis in the epidermis is tightly controlled. Further, a key intermediate molecule in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), can bind glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and activate GR. Additionally, keratinocytes express beta-2-adrenergic-receptor (β2AR), a receptor for the stress hormone epinephrine. Importantly, migratory rates of keratinocytes are reduced by cortisol, FPP, epinephrine, and other β2AR agonists, thus indicating their role in the inhibition of epithelization. Topical inhibition of local glucocorticoid and FPP synthesis, as well as treatment with β2AR antagonists promotes wound epithelization.Modulation of local stress hormone production may represent an important therapeutic target for wound healing disorders. Topical administration of inhibitors of cortisol synthesis, statins, β2AR antagonists, and systemic beta-blockers can decrease cortisol synthesis, FPP, and epinephrine levels, respectively, thus restoring keratinocyte migration capacity. These treatment modalities could represent a novel therapeutic approach for wound healing disorders.Attenuation of the local stress-induced hormonal imbalance in epidermis may advance therapeutic modalities, thereby leading to enhanced epithelization and improved wound healing.",

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the initial assessment and management of traumatic and burn wounds in children. Special attention is given to wound cleansing, debridement techniques, and considerations for pain management and psychosocial support for children and families. Recent Advances: Basic and translational research over the last 5-7 years has advanced our knowledge related to the optimal care of acute pediatric traumatic and burn wounds. Data concerning methods, volume, solution and timing for irrigation of acute traumatic wounds, timing and methods of wound debridement, including hydrosurgery and plasma knife coblation, and wound dressings are presented. Additionally, data concerning the long-term psychosocial outcomes following acute injury are presented. Critical Issues: The care of pediatric trauma and burn-related wounds requires prompt assessment, pain control, cleansing, debridement, application of appropriate dressings, and close follow-up. Ideally, a knowledgeable multidisciplinary team cares for these patients. A limitation in the care of these patients is the relative paucity of data specific to the care of acute traumatic wounds in the pediatric population. Future Directions: Research is ongoing in the arenas of new debridement techniques and instruments, and in wound dressing technology. Dedicated research on these topics in the pediatric population will serve to strengthen and advance the care of pediatric patients with acute traumatic and burn wounds.",

However, PRP is also rich in bioactive lipids whose contribution to healing has not been characterized and warrants investigation due to the protease-rich environment of chronic wounds. Approach: The lipid fraction of PRP was tested with respect to proliferation and migration of primary adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa)±exposure to chronic wound fluid (CWF). This fraction was also characterized via LC-MS/MS for bioactive lipids. A synthetic formulation of the bioactive lipid composition was developed and tested for the ability to overcome proliferative growth arrest induced by CWF. Results: The data demonstrate the ability of the lipid fraction of PRP to significantly enhance the migration and proliferation of HDFa, and to overcome the proliferative growth arrest induced by CWF. Furthermore, the synthetic lipid formulation generated following characterization of the PRP lipidome demonstrated a similar ability to overcome proliferative arrest of HDFa in the presence of CWF. Innovation: For the first time, we demonstrate the relevance of the lipid fraction of PRP toward the biology of wound healing. These studies open the possibility of altering the lipid profile of PRP via diet or exogenous pathway manipulation to obtain a better healing outcome. Conclusion: The lipid fraction of PRP is under investigated and yet relevant component in wound healing. The current study demonstrates the relevance of this fraction in wound healing by PRP.",

The dynamicity and function of the MT cytoskeleton are determined in large part by its regulatory proteins, including the recently discovered MT severing enzyme Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2). Downregulation of FL2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in a more than twofold increase in cell migration rate in vitro as well as translates into improved wound-healing outcomes in in vivo mouse models. Here we utilized a commercially available surfactant polymer dressing (SPD) as a vehicle to deliver FL2 siRNA. To this end we incorporated collagen microparticles containing FL2 siRNA into SPD (SPD-FL2-siRNA) for direct application to the injury site. Topical application of SPD-FL2 siRNA to murine models of full-thickness excision wounds and full-thickness burn wounds resulted in significant improvements in the rate and quality of wound healing, as measured clinically and histologically, compared with controls. Wound healing occurred more rapidly and with high fidelity, resulting in properly organized collagen substructure. Taken together, these findings indicate that the incorporation of FL2 siRNA into existing treatment options is a promising avenue to improve wound outcomes.",

Approach: The effect of HBOT on diabetic foot ulcers, Wagner grades 3 and 4, was evaluated using a retrospective observational real-world data set. The study reported on the overall healing rate, (74.2%) at the population level, for >2 million wounds. Results: When a subgroup of patients of only foot ulcers with a Wagner grade 3 or 4 were considered, the healing rate was only 56.04%. The use of HBOT, without filtering for the number of treatments received, improved the healing rate to 60.01% overall. Healing rates for this same subgroup, however, were improved to 75.24% for patients who completed the prescribed number of hyperbaric treatments. Innovation: This observational study discusses the importance of reporting at the population level, specific wound etiology level, a risk-stratified level, and to then overlay the effect of treatment adherence on those outcomes to provide clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of when to prescribe an advanced modality such as hyperbaric oxygen.

Recent Advances: Until recently, gentian violet and methylene blue (GV/MB) antibacterial dressings have been commercially available only in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam; polyurethane (PU) foam bonded with GV and MB with thin film backing is now commercially available. GV/MB PU foam does not require hydration or a necessary secondary dressing. GV/MB PVA and PU foam dressings were recently granted FDA clearance as antibacterial dressings, as opposed to bacteriostatic dressings as previously classified. Within the class of antibacterial dressings, GV/MB foam dressings are of lower cost alternative to silver- or iodine-based antibacterial dressings with no risk of absorption of any of the foam components into the tissues. Critical Issues: Control of wound bioburden levels by antibacterial agents and absorption of excess exudate are crucial in preventing infections that drastically increase the price of wound care. Use of GV/MB dressings may improve wound healing outcomes and decrease overall costs through super absorption, promotion of autolytic debridement, bioburden reduction, ease of use, and decreased dressing change frequency. Future Directions: Evolution in resistant bacterial strains will drive continual changes in advanced wound care products. Demand will increase for economically priced, versatile wound care dressings that assist in debridement, maintain a moist wound environment, absorb and trap bacterial debris, and decrease dressing change frequency.",

Approach: Bedside caregivers repositioned patients to the best of their abilities, using pillows and positioning aids without the visual feedback from a continuous bedside pressure mapping (CBPM) system. Once positioned, caregivers were shown the image from the CBPM system and allowed to make further adjustments to the patient position. Data from the CBPM device, in the form of visual screenshots and peak pressure values, were obtained after each repositioning phase. Caregivers provided feedback on repositioning with and without the CBPM system. Results: Screenshots displayed lower pressures when the visual feedback from the CBPM systems was utilized by caregivers. Lower peak pressure measurements were also evident when caregivers utilized the image from the CBPM systems. Overall, caregivers felt the system enabled more effective patient positioning and increased the quality of care they provided their patients. Innovation: This is the first bedside pressure mapping device to be continuously used in a clinical setting to provide caregivers and patients visual, instant feedback of pressure, thereby enhancing repositioning and offloading practices.

However, many organs are made up of differentiated cells with only a limited capacity to divide. It is not well understood how cells are replaced in the absence of cell division. Recent Advances: Recent studies in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster have proven that wound-induced polyploidy (WIP) is an essential mechanism to replace tissue mass and restore tissue integrity in the absence of cell division. In this repair mechanism, preexisting differentiated cells increase their DNA content and cell size by becoming polyploid. Critical Issues: Cells within mammalian organs such as the liver, heart, and cornea have also been observed to increase their DNA ploidy in response to injury, suggesting that WIP may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to compensate for cell loss. Future Directions: The Hippo signal transduction pathway is required for differentiated cells to initiate WIP in Drosophila. Continued studies in Drosophila will help to identify other signaling pathways required for WIP as well as the conserved mechanisms that polyploid cells may play during wound repair in all organisms.",

The toll-like receptor (TLR) system is a critical node in the tissue response to both exogenous (pathogen-associated) and endogenous (damage-associated) molecular pattern factors (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively). The development of novel TLR ligand-, pathway-, and/or target gene-specific therapeutics may have clinical utility in the management of the exuberant inflammatory/fibrotic tissue response to injury without compromising the host defense to pathogens. Recent Advances: DAMP ligands, released upon wounding, and microbial-derived PAMPs interact with several TLRs, and their various coreceptor partners, engaging downstream pathways that include Src family kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor, integrins and the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation enhances cellular responses to the potent profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) by attenuating the expression of receptors that inhibit TGF-β1 signaling. Critical Issues: Common as well as unique pathways may be activated by PAMP and DAMP ligands that bind to the repertoire of TLRs on various cell types. Dissecting mechanisms underlying ligand-dependent engagement of this complex, highly interactive, network will provide for adaptation of new and focused therapies directed to the regulation of pathologically significant profibrotic genes. Inherent in this diversity are therapeutic opportunities to modulate the pathophysiologic consequences of persistent TLR signaling. The recently identified involvement of receptor and nonreceptor kinase pathways in TLR signaling may present novel opportunities for pharmacologic intervention. Future Directions: Clarifying the identity and function of DAMP-activated TLR complexes or ligand-binding partners, as well as their engaged downstream effectors and target genes, are key factors in the eventual design of pathway-specific treatment modalities. Such approaches may be tailored to address the spectrum of TLR-initiated pathologies (including localized and persistent inflammation, maladaptive repair/fibrosis) and, perhaps, even titrated to achieve patient-unique beneficial clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Impaired wound healing in diabetic (DB) patients is a significant health problem; however, the roles that cytokines and innate immune cells contribute to this impaired healing are not completely understood. Approach: A mouse model was used to compare the innate immune response during DB and normal wound healing. Two 5-mm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsal skin of BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J (DB) and C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice. Innate immune cell markers and cytokine mRNA levels were measured in wound biopsies during the first week of healing. Results: Innate immune cell influx (typified by the Gr-1 neutrophil marker and the Ym1 macrophage marker) was delayed in the DB wounds. Expression of the M2 macrophage-related genes, Ym1 and arginase 1, was significantly reduced in the DB wounds. PCR array analysis demonstrated altered cytokine expression in DB wounds. Most prominently, both interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-20 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the DB wounds. Innovation: This is the first study to identify increased levels of IL-17 and IL-20 in DB wounds. These cytokines are also elevated in the inflammatory skin disorder, psoriasis; thus, they may be potential therapeutic targets to aid in DB wound healing. Conclusion: The entire cytokine profile of DB wounds over the course of healing is not completely understood. This study suggests that the IL-17 and IL-20 families of cytokines should be further analyzed in the context of DB wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Diabetes affects more than 29 million individuals in the United States, resulting in healthcare costs approaching $245 billion. Approximately 15% of these individuals will develop a chronic, non-healing foot ulcer (diabetic foot ulcer [DFU]) that, if untreated, may lead to amputation. The current treatments for DFU are expensive, have significant side-effects, and often result in non-compliance. A new topical treatment is described that accelerates cutaneous wound repair and is disease modifying by targeting underlying aberrant diabetic pathways. Approach: The efficacy of naltrexone (NTX), an opioid receptor antagonist, and Regranex® was compared in preclinical studies using type 1 diabetic rats. Dorsal cutaneous wounds were treated topically with 0.03% NTX, Regranex, or moisturizing cream alone. Wound closure, DNA synthesis, and cytokine production were monitored. Results: Wound closure rates with topical NTX in type 1 diabetic rats were comparable to Regranex. Topical NTX accelerated DNA synthesis, as measured by BrdU incorporation, increased mast cells, and enhanced expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a marker for angiogenesis. Regranex had little effect on DNA synthesis, mast cells, and VEGF expression relative to vehicle-treated wounds, and it only temporarily increased PDGF expression. Fibroblast growth factor expression was not altered by either treatment. Innovation: Topical application of 0.03% NTX cream accelerates diabetic wound closure. Conclusion: Blockade of the opioid growth factor (OGF)-OGF receptor (OGFr) axis utilizing 0.03% NTX cream is comparable to standard care in preclinical studies, and it provides a safe, inexpensive, and effective alternative for treatment of diabetic wounds.",

The physical and mechanical properties of the hydrogels were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry, and the swelling, water retention, and compressive properties were assessed. Results: The hydrogels obtained from the combination of fibroin and PVA presented a compositional gradient along the hydrogel thickness and structure. The upper layer of the hydrogel consisted of a fibroin-based hydrogel blended with PVA, whereas the lower layer contained only fibroin. The mechanical properties regarding compression of the fibroin/PVA hydrogel were significantly better than those of the pure fibroin hydrogel, for hydrogels with and without sericin. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the hydrogels with sericin were significantly better than those without sericin. The water contents of all samples were >90%.

    "abstract": "Significance: Biofilms in vivo are small densely packed aggregations of microbes that are highly resistant to host immune responses and treatment. They attach to each other and to nearby surfaces. Biofilms are difficult to study and identify in a clinical setting as their quantification necessitates the use of advanced microscopy techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy. Nonetheless, it is likely that biofilms contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic skin wounds. Reducing, removing, or preventing biofilms is thus a logical approach to help clinicians heal chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Wound care products have demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy in destroying biofilms in in vitro and preclinical models, as well as in some clinical studies. Critical Issues: Controlled studies exploring the beneficial role of biofilm eradication and its relationship to healing in patients with chronic wounds are limited. This review aims to discuss the mode of action and clinical significance of currently available antibiofilm products, including surfactants, dressings, and others, with a focus on levels of evidence for efficacy in disrupting biofilms and ability to improve wound healing outcomes. Future Directions: Few available products have good evidence to support antibiofilm activity and wound healing benefits. Novel therapeutic strategies are on the horizon. More high-quality clinical studies are needed. The development of noninvasive techniques to quantify biofilms will facilitate increased ease of research about biofilms in wounds and how to combat them.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Inflammation is a critical aspect of injury repair. Nonresolving inflammation, however, is perpetuated by the local generation of extracellular matrix-derived damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), such as the extra domain A (EDA) isoform of fibronectin and hyaluronic acid (HA) that promote the eventual acquisition of a fibrotic response. DAMPs contribute to the inflammatory environment by engaging Toll-like, integrin, and CD44 receptors while stimulating transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling to activate a fibroinflammatory genomic program leading to the development of chronic disease. Recent Advances: Signaling through TLR4, CD44, and the TGF-β pathways impact the amplitude and duration of the innate immune response to endogenous DAMPs synthesized in the context of tissue injury. New evidence indicates that crosstalk among these three networks regulates phase transitions as well as the repertoire of expressed genes in the wound healing program determining, thereby, repair outcomes. Clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pathway integration is necessary for the development of novel therapeutics to address the spectrum of fibroproliferative diseases that result from maladaptive tissue repair. Critical Issues: There is an increasing appreciation for the role of DAMPs as causative factors in human fibroinflammatory disease regardless of organ site. Defining the involved intermediates essential for the development of targeted therapies is a daunting effort, however, since various classes of DAMPs activate different direct and indirect signaling pathways. Cooperation between two matrix-derived DAMPs, HA, and the EDA isoform of fibronectin, is discussed in this review as is their synergy with the TGF-β network. This information may identify nodes of signal intersection amenable to therapeutic intervention. Future Directions: Clarifying mechanisms underlying the DAMP/growth factor signaling nexus may provide opportunities to engineer the fibroinflammatory response to injury and, thereby, wound healing outcomes. The identification of shared and unique DAMP/growth factor-activated pathways is critical to the design of optimized tissue repair therapies while preserving the host response to bacterial pathogens.",

Approach: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and VIP databases were electronically searched to identify eligible studies updated to February 2020 to collect randomized controlled trials regarding the efficacy of telemedicine for patients with chronic wounds. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and StataSE. Results: Fourteen studies involving 1,926 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with usual care, telemedicine intervention significantly improved wound healing rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.44, confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.16–1.80, p = 0.001) and reduced adverse events (RR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.34–0.80, p = 0.003). No significant differences were found between patients allocated to the telemedicine group or usual care group, in terms of the outcomes of healing time, change in wound size, or mortality. Innovations: Telemedicine is an effective approach to promote chronic wound healing and reduce adverse events. Conclusion: The meta-analysis demonstrates that telemedicine may improve the healing rate and reduce adverse events for patients with chronic wounds. Because of the limited quality and quantity of the included studies, rigorous studies with adequate sample sizes are required to conclude with more confidence.",

Recent studies have provided mounting evidence that external mechanical forces stimulate intracellular signaling pathways to drive fibrotic processes. Innovation: While most studies have focused on studying mechanotransduction in fibroblasts, recent data suggest that mechanical stimulation may also shape the behavior of immune cells, referred to as \"mechano-immunomodulation.\" However, the effect of mechanical strain on myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation remains poorly understood and has never been investigated at the single-cell level. Approach: In this study, we utilized a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture system that permits the precise manipulation of mechanical strain applied to cells. We cultured myeloid cells and used single-cell RNA-sequencing to interrogate the effects of strain on myeloid differentiation and transcriptional programming. Results: Our data indicate that myeloid cells are indeed mechanoresponsive, with mechanical stress influencing myeloid differentiation. Mechanical strain also upregulated a cascade of inflammatory chemokines, most notably from the Ccl family. Conclusion: Further understanding of how mechanical stress affects myeloid cells in conjunction with other cell types in the complicated, multicellular milieu of wound healing may lead to novel insights and therapies for the treatment of fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Significance: An understanding of the physiology of wound healing and scarring is necessary to minimize surgical scar formation. By reducing tension across the healing wound, eliminating excess inflammation and infection, and encouraging perfusion to healing areas, surgeons can support healing and minimize scarring. Recent Advances: Preoperatively, newer techniques focused on incision placement to minimize tension, skin sterilization to minimize infection and inflammation, and control of comorbid factors to promote a healing process with minimal scarring are constantly evolving. Intraoperatively, measures like layered closure, undermining, and tissue expansion can be taken to relieve tension across the healing wound. Appropriate suture technique and selection should be considered, and finally, there are new surgical technologies available to reduce tension across the closure. Postoperatively, the healing process can be supported as proliferation and remodeling take place within the wound. A balance of moisture control, tension reduction, and infection prevention can be achieved with dressings, ointments, and silicone. Vitamins and corticosteroids can also affect the scarring process by modulating the cellular factors involved in healing. Critical Issues: Healing with no or minimal scarring is the ultimate goal of wound healing research. Understanding how mechanical tension, inflammation and infection, and perfusion and hypoxia impact profibrotic pathways allows for the development of therapies that can modulate cytokine response and the wound extracellular microenvironment to reduce fibrosis and scarring. Future Directions: New tension-off loading topical treatments, laser, and dermabrasion devices are under development, and small molecule therapeutics have demonstrated scarless wound healing in animal models, providing a promising new direction for future research aimed to minimize surgical scarring.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The cutaneous repair process naturally results in different types of scarring that are classified as normal or pathological. Affected individuals are often affected from an esthetic, physical (functional), and psychosocial perspective. The distinct nature of scarring in humans, particularly the formation of pathological scars, makes the study of skin scarring a challenge for researchers in this area. Several established experimental models exist for studying scar formation. However, the increasing development and validation of newly emerging models have made it possible to carry out studies focused on different variables that influence this unique process. Recent Advances: Experimental models such as in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models have obtained different degrees of success in the reproduction of the scar formation in its native milieu and true environment. These models also differ in their ability to elucidate the molecular, cellular, and structural mechanisms involved in scarring, as well as for testing new agents and approaches for therapies. The models reviewed here, including cells derived from human skin and in vivo animal models, have contributed to the advancement of skin scarring research. Critical Issues and Future Directions: The absence of experimental models that faithfully reproduce the typical characteristics of the different types of human skin scars makes the improvement of validated models and the establishment of new ones a critical unmet need. The fields of wound healing research combined with tissue engineering have offered newer alternatives for experimental studies with the potential to provide clinically useful knowledge about scar formation.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Radiation therapy is commonplace for cancer treatment but often results in fibrosis and atrophy of surrounding soft tissue. Decellularized adipose matrices (DAMs) have been reported to improve these soft tissue defects through the promotion of adipogenesis. These matrices are decellularized by a combination of physical, chemical, and enzymatic methods to minimize their immunologic effects while promoting their regenerative effects. In this study, we aimed at exploring the regenerative ability of a DAM (renuva®; MTF biologics, Edison, NJ) in radiation-induced soft tissue injury. Approach: Fresh human lipoaspirate or DAM was injected into the irradiated scalp of CD-1 nude mice, and volume retention was monitored radiographically over 8 weeks. Explanted grafts were histologically assessed, and overlying skin was examined histologically and biomechanically. Irradiated human skin was also evaluated from patients after fat grafting or DAM injection. However, integrating data between murine and human skin in all cohorts is limited given the genetic variability between the two species. Results: Volume retention was found to be greater with fat grafts, though DAM retention was, nonetheless, appreciated at irradiated sites. Improvement in both mouse and human irradiated skin overlying fat and DAM grafts was observed in terms of biomechanical stiffness, dermal thickness, collagen density, collagen fiber networks, and skin vascularity. Innovation: This is the first demonstration of the use of DAMs for augmenting the regenerative potential of irradiated mouse and human skin. Conclusions: These findings support the use of DAMs to address soft tissue atrophy after radiation therapy. Morphological characteristics of the irradiated skin can also be improved with DAM grafting.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of animal models, which adequately replicate the pathophysiology of chronic wounds, has been challenging. In this study, we utilized an oxidative stress (OS) murine model, which was previously developed by our group, to study the effect of a human amniotic membrane (AM) on chronic wound healing. Approach: Forty-five diabetic (genetically obese leptin receptor-deficient mice [db/db]) mice were separated into three groups. Thirty mice received an OS regimen and a 1 - × 1 cm2 full-thickness excisional dorsal wound. The wounds were either covered with AM and occlusive dressing (db/dbOS-AM) or occlusive dressing only (db/dbOS). Fifteen mice did not receive the OS regimen, and were covered with AM and occlusive dressing (db/db-AM). The wounds were photographed, and tissue was harvested at various time points. Results: Vascular density was higher in the AM-treated groups (db/dbOS-AM: 34 ± 12; db/db-AM: 37 ± 14; vs. db/dbOS: 19 ± 9 cluster of differentiation 31 [CD31+]/high power field [HPF] photograph; p = 0.04 and p = 0.003). Vessel maturity was lowest in the db/dbOS group (21% ± 4%; vs. db/dbOS-AM: 38% ± 10%, p = 0.004; db/db-AM: 40% ± 11%, p = 0.0005). Leukocyte infiltration was higher in the AM groups (db/dbOS-AM: 15 ± 4; db/db-AM: 16 ± 4 vs. db/dbOS: 8 ± 3 lymphocyte common antigen [CD45+]/HPF; p = 0.005 and p = 0.06). AM upregulated various proangiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and downregulated genes involved in chronicity, such as osteopontin, as visualized through proteome analysis and western blotting. Cell death was lower in the AM groups (db/dbOS-AM: 28 ± 10, db/db-AM: 7 ± 5 vs. db/dbOS: 17% ± 9% Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling [TUNEL+]; p = 0.03 and p < 0.0001). Innovation: This study offers new insight on the mechanisms of action of human AM in chronic wound healing. Conclusion: AM treatment promoted healing in mice with complex chronic wounds. The AM stimulated angiogenesis through upregulation of proangiogenic factors, improving the wound milieu by increasing leukocyte and growth factor delivery and decreasing cell death.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn wound excision to manage bacterial load, 60% of the mortality from burns is attributed to bacterial biofilm infection. A low electric field (∼1 V) generated by the novel FDA-cleared wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) was previously shown to significantly prevent and disrupt burn biofilm infection in preclinical studies. Based on this observation, the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of the WED dressing powered by a silver-zinc electrocouple in the prevention and disruption of biofilm infection. Approach: A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the WED compared with standard-of-care (SoC) dressing to treat biofilms. Burn wounds were randomized to receive either SoC or WED. Biopsies were collected on days 0 and 7 for histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of biofilm, and for quantitative bacteriological analyses. Results: In total, 38 subjects were enrolled in the study. In 52% of the WED-treated wounds, little to no biofilm could be detected by SEM. WED significantly lowered or prevented increase of biofilm in all wounds compared with the pair-matched SoC-treated wounds. Innovation: WED is a simple, easy, and rapid method to protect the wound while also inhibiting infection. It is activated by a moist environment and the electrical field induces transient and micromolar amounts of superoxide anion radicals that will prevent bacterial growth. Conclusion: WED decreased biofilm infection better compared with SoC. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04079998.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory disease characterized by painful ulcerations. It is often associated with other systemic inflammatory diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune arthritis. The Problem: PG does not have characteristic serologic or histologic features. Therefore, other potential causes such as malignancy, vasculitis, infection, and coagulation disorders should be ruled out. In addition, patients often have aggressive disease that is refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, but there is only a paucity of clinical data to help direct therapy. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: There are several lines of evidence to support an immunologic etiology of PG. Although the pathogenesis is still not well understood, it is clear that PG is associated with the upregulation of several cytokines including interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma, among many others. TNF and IL-1β are of particular interest, because some biologic medications that target these cytokines have been effective in treating PG. Clinical Care Relevance: Multiple drugs are available to help control PG. Biologics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and conventional immunosuppressive drugs have been reported to be effective. Multidrug therapies should be considered for refractory cases. Conclusion: PG is a complex inflammatory disease with multiple involved pathways. Anti-TNF agents and IVIG represent a significant advancement in treatment options. Since some biologic therapies are relatively new, their unknown long-term side effects should be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Prior to 2009, research regarding the role of CXC receptor 3 (CXCR3) in cutaneous biology was primarily in the context of inflammatory reactions. Foundational research performed at that time demonstrated that, in addition to recruited inflammatory cells, cellular components of the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, also express CXCR3 and are capable of expressing CXCR3 ligands, specifically CXC ligand 10 (CXCL10) and CXCL11. Surprisingly, in vitro experimentation demonstrated differential effects on the different cell types, suggesting that the CXCR3 signaling pathway may serve as a coordinator of wound remodeling. In support of this, a CXCR3 null mouse line and a mouse line abrogating CXCL11 expression in the epidermis demonstrated delayed wound closure and disordered dermal wound healing.These findings demonstrate the role of CXCR3 signaling in the latter stages of wounding healing and opened a new avenue of investigation into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of coordinating the events of cutaneous tissue regeneration.More recent investigation highlights the role of CXCR3 signaling in the dramatic vascular pruning events after the proliferative stage of wound healing and its importance in guiding remodeling of dermal collagen during cicatrix formation.CXCR3 signaling plays a strong role in coordinating the actions of several cell types during cutaneous wound healing. The disruption of this signaling pathway results in delayed return to homeostasis and dystrophic scarring.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal wound repair results from disorders in granulation tissue remodeling, and can lead to hypertrophic scarring and fibrosis. Excessive scarring can compromise tissue function and decrease tissue resistance to additional injuries. The development of potential therapies to minimize scarring is, thus, necessary to address an important clinical problem.It has been clearly established that multiple cytokines and growth factors participate in the regulation of cutaneous wound healing. More recently, it has become apparent that these factors do not necessarily activate isolated signaling pathways. Rather, in some cases, there is cross-modulation of several cellular pathways involved in this process. Two of the key pathways that modulate each other during wound healing are activated by transforming growth factor-β and by extracellular matrix proteins acting through integrins.The pathogenesis of excessive scarring upon wound healing is not fully understood, as a result of the complexity of this process. However, the fact that many pathways combine to produce fibrosis provides multiple potential therapeutic targets. Some of them have been identified, such as focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase. Currently, a major challenge is to develop pharmacological inhibitors of these proteins with therapeutic value to promote efficient wound repair.The ability to better understand how different pathways crosstalk during wound repair and to identify and pharmacologically modulate key factors that contribute to the regulation of multiple wound-healing pathways could potentially provide effective therapeutic targets to decrease or prevent excessive scar formation and/or development of fibrosis.",

In recent years, we have developed a means to topically silence genes at the post-transcriptional level to locally alter wounds and improve the healing process.Many types of chronic wounds have been associated with alterations in the expression of genes that mediate healing. Targeting the expression of these genes in a way that can improve healing while limiting systemic side effects has been very challenging.Our laboratory's recent work has focused on the use of topically applied small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to inhibit messenger RNA expression of certain mediators involved in healing in two different types of cutaneous injury-radiation-induced cutaneous injury and the diabetic excisional wound. By successfully inhibiting specific gene mediators with topical siRNA, we reversed downstream signaling pathways, which led to expedited wound healing in diabetic wounds and restoration to a more normal phenotype in radiation-induced skin injuries.The signaling pathways and gene mediators that we targeted and inhibited in murine models are present in humans. Applying parallel treatment strategies in humans may provide novel means of treating these burdensome and costly conditions.Our novel method for local gene silencing is effective in treating various types of cutaneous murine wounds. Topical gene silencing with siRNA obviates the side effects of systemic medication and has the potential to be effective in healing or preventing a wide array of cutaneous human conditions.",

Each claims to provide effective antimicrobial activity due to the presence of silver in the dressing. However, assuming effectiveness on the basis of an antimicrobial alone ignores the importance of the carrier dressing and its overall role in wound healing.Choice of a silver-containing wound dressing should include consideration of the impact that dressing technology has on the effectiveness of antimicrobial activity as well as its influence on other factors essential for wound healing.AQUACEL® Ag dressing combines patented Hydrofiber® Technology with ionic silver, a proven broad-spectrum antimicrobial. Recent in vitro testing suggests that dressing technology may impact the antimicrobial effectiveness of silver-containing dressings as well as other factors relevant to wound healing. Specifically, a comparative in vitro study demonstrated how the ability of a dressing to micro-contour to the wound bed is critical to antimicrobial effectiveness. Compared with other silver dressings tested, AQUACEL Ag dressing minimized voids and spaces where bacteria can thrive, allowing the silver within the dressing to be in contact with the wound. AQUACEL Ag dressing was observed to kill more bacteria and control the spread of pathogens.AQUACEL Ag dressing is indicated for the management of a variety of at risk/infected chronic and acute wounds.Not all silver dressings are created equal. Selection of an antimicrobial dressing should take into account in vitro data regarding antimicrobial efficacy of a dressing in addition to its ability to promote wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Dermal and mucosal healing are mechanistically similar. However, scarring and closure rates are dramatically improved in mucosal healing, possibly due to differences in apoptosis. Apoptosis, nature's preprogrammed form of cell death, occurs via two major pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, which intersect at caspase3 (Casp3) cleavage and activation. The purpose of this experiment was to identify the predominant pathways of apoptosis in mucosal and dermal wound healing. Approach: Wounds (1 mm biopsy punch) were made in the dorsal skin (n=3) or tongue (n=3) of female Balb/C mice aged 6 weeks. Wounds were harvested at 6 h, 24 h, day 3 (D3), D5, D7, and D10. RNA was isolated and analyzed using real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Expression levels for genes in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were compared in dermal and mucosal wounds. Results: Compared to mucosal healing, dermal wounds exhibited significantly higher expression of Casp3 (at D5; p<0.05), Casp7 (at D5; p<0.05), Trp53 (at 24 h and D5; p<0.05), Tnfrsf1b (at 24 h; p<0.05), FasR (at 24 h, D5, and D7; p<0.05), and Casp8 (at 24 h; p<0.05) and significantly lower gene expression of Tradd (at 24 h; p<0.05). Innovation: Our observations indicate differential execution of apoptosis in oral wound healing compared to skin. Conclusion: Expression patterns of key regulators of apoptosis in wound healing indicate that apoptosis occurs predominantly through the intrinsic pathway in the healing mucosa, but predominantly through the extrinsic pathway in the healing skin. The identification of differences in the apoptotic pathways in skin and mucosal wounds may allow the development of therapeutics to improve skin healing.",

There are two types of DNA damage; by a high dose (causing acute or deterministic effects) and by a low dose (related to chronic or stochastic effects), both of which induce different health effects. Among radiation effects, acute cutaneous radiation syndrome results from cell killing as a consequence of high-dose exposure. Recent advances: Recent advances in radiation biology and oncology have demonstrated that bystander effects, which are emerged in cells that have never been exposed, but neighboring irradiated cells, are also involved in radiation effects. Bystander effects are now recognized as an indispensable component of tissue response related to deleterious effects of IR. Critical issues: Evidence has indicated that nonapoptotic premature senescence is commonly observed in various tissues and organs. Senesced cells were found to secrete various proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, most of which are equivalent to those identified as bystander factors. Secreted factors could trigger cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, inflammatory response, etc., which provide a tissue microenvironment assisting tissue repair and remodeling. Future directions: Understandings of the mechanisms and physiological relevance of radiation-induced bystander effects are quite essential for the beneficial control of wound healing and care. Further studies should extend our knowledge of the mechanisms of bystander effects and mode of cell death in response to IR.",

Translational bioinformatics is well positioned to contribute to the many challenges inherent in bridging this gap between our current reactive methods of healthcare delivery and the intent of precision medicine, particularly in the areas of drug development, which forms the focus of this review.A variety of powerful informatics methods for organizing and leveraging the vast wealth of available molecular measurements available for a broad range of disease contexts have recently emerged. These include methods for data driven disease classification, drug repositioning, identification of disease biomarkers, and the creation of disease network models, each with significant impacts on drug development approaches.An important bottleneck in the application of bioinformatics methods in translational research is the lack of investigators who are versed in both biomedical domains and informatics. Efforts to nurture both sets of competencies within individuals and to increase interfield visibility will help to accelerate the adoption and increased application of bioinformatics in translational research.It is possible to construct predictive, multiscale network models of disease by integrating genotype, gene expression, clinical traits, and other multiscale measures using causal network inference methods. This can enable the identification of the \"key drivers\" of pathology, which may represent novel therapeutic targets or biomarker candidates that play a more direct role in the etiology of disease.",

Since several nutrients play a physiological role in wound healing, supplementation of these nutrients may improve wound healing. Recent Advances: Oral nutritional supplements and enteral formulas providing arginine, glutamine, and micronutrients such as ascorbic acid and zinc should improve the healing of pressure ulcers (PU) and the healing of surgical, traumatic, and burned wounds. Is their efficacy proved from clinical intervention trials? Critical Issues: Formulas that are rich in energy, protein, arginine, vitamin C, and zinc can improve PU healing, whereas their efficacy for PU prevention is less clear. High-dose supplementation of vitamin C, zinc, and pantothenic acid may improve the healing of surgical wounds in healthy subjects. Arginine lowers the risk of fistulas in patients undergoing elective surgery due to gastrointestinal cancer. However, formulations also enriched with n-3-fatty acids and ribonucleic acids lower the risk of several wound complications, thus being more effective than isolated arginine. Glutamine and antioxidant micronutrients (vitamin C and E, zinc, selenium, and copper) can improve the healing of surgical, traumatic, and burned wounds. Future Directions: Considerable evidence suggests that formulations, indicated especially for critically ill patients, support the healing of PU and the healing of surgical and burned wounds. However, their optimal composition with regard to the dose of individual components has to be determined in future studies. Further well-designed trials should investigate the impact of certain nutrients for the prevention of PU and for the healing of surgical wounds in healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members are critical regulators of tissue repair and depending on their distinct pattern of receptor specificity can also promote inflammation and scarring. This study utilized a receptor-selective VEGF to examine the role of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 in scar tissue (ST) formation. Approach: Cutaneous skin wounds were created in mice using a 4 mm biopsy punch and then treated until closure with purified VEGF-E derived from orf virus stain NZ-2. Tissue samples were harvested to measure gene expression using quantitative PCR and to observe ST formation through histological examination and changes in cell populations by immunofluorescence. Results: VEGFR-2-activation with VEGF-E increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and reduced macrophage infiltration and myofibroblast differentiation in wounded skin compared with controls. VEGF-E treatment also increased microvascular density and improved pericyte coverage of blood vessels in the healing wounds. The ST that formed following treatment with VEGF-E was reduced in size and showed improved collagen structure. Innovation: The role of VEGFR-2 activation in wound epithelialization and angiogenesis is well established; but its contribution to ST formation is unclear. This study tests the effect of a selective VEGFR-2 activation on ST formation following cutaneous wounding in a murine model. Conclusion: VEGFR-2 stimulation can enhance the quality of skin repair, at least, in part, through the induction of IL-10 expression and dampening of wound inflammation and fibrosis. Therapies that selectively activate VEGFR-2 may therefore be beneficial to treat impaired healing or to prevent excess scarring.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The outcome of Fournier's gangrene (FG) may be affected by comorbidities, demographics, and choice of treatment modality. We sought to evaluate our institution's management protocol of FG measured by mortality rate (MR) and length of hospital stay (LHS) in a retrospective cohort study. Approach: A database of 20 FG cases at our institution throughout the 2009-2016 study period was assembled by a retrospective review of medical records. A Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index Score (FGSIS) was calculated for each case. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using logistic regression. Results: The most common presentation of FG at our institution was a hyperglycemic diabetic male in his fifth decade of life with a second risk factor such as recent surgery or active malignancy. The average FGSIS was 9 overall and 14 for the mortalities. An increased FGSIS was predictive of having an increased MR or hospital stay above the median (>25 days) (p = 0.0194). The average LHS was 32 days overall, 22 days for patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and 40 days for patients treated with tangential hydrosurgery. Overall MR was 15%. Innovation: This is the second known study to characterize usage of tangential hydrosurgery in the management of FG. Conclusion: Treatment outcomes at our institution are comparable to those reported in recent literature, a significant decline from the historical MR of 50-60%.",

Common observations across a vast array of human and animal models of fibroproliferative conditions suggest neuroinflammatory mechanisms are important upstream fibrogenic events. Recent Advances: As detailed in this review, mast cell hyperplasia is a common observation in fibrotic tissue. Recent investigations in human and preclinical models of hypertrophic wound healing and post-traumatic joint fibrosis provides evidence that fibrogenesis is governed by a maladaptive neuropeptide-mast cell-myofibroblast signaling pathway. Critical Issues: The blockade and manipulation of these factors is providing promising evidence that if timed correctly, the fibrogenic process can be appropriately regulated. Clinically, abnormal fibrogenic healing responses are not ubiquitous to all patients and the identification of those at-risk remains an area of priority. Future Directions: Ultimately, an integrated appreciation of the common pathobiology shared by many fibrogenic connective tissue conditions may provide a scientific framework to facilitate the development of novel antifibrotic prevention and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The repair of wounds usually terminates with a scar. The healing from a severe tissue loss can create a new clinical problem, excessive scarring. Approaches to prevent excessive scarring will optimize the repair process. Controlling gap-junction communications between cells and/or the transport of the proteins that form gap junctions offers new approaches for controlling this problem.Gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) requires hemichannels, connexon structures, embedded in the plasma membrane of coupled cells. The connexon is composed of six proteins from the connexin (Cx) family. The docking of connexons between the neighboring cells forms a gated channel, where small molecules can pass directly between the cytoplasm of cells. In wound repair, GJIC between fibroblasts in granulation tissue advances wound repair. Also, the GJIC between mast cells and fibroblasts during the remodeling phase of repair may explain how mast cells promote excessive scarring. In addition, Cx can affect transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) intracellular signaling through its shared binding site on microtubules within fibroblasts.Can excessive scarring be controlled through limiting the local amassing of mast cells or preventing their interactions with wound fibroblasts through GJIC?The prevention of the accumulation of mast cells in granulation tissue or interfering with their communications via GJIC with fibroblasts offers new approaches for preventing excess scarring. The association of Cx with microtubules altering TGF-β signaling presents a new target for improving the quality of repair as well as the deposition of unnecessary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "After human epidermis wounding, transepithelial potential (TEP) present in nonlesional epidermis decreases and induces an endogenous direct current epithelial electric field (EEF) that could be implicated in the wound re-epithelialization. Some studies suggest that exogenous electric stimulation of wounds can stimulate healing, although the mechanisms remain to be determined.Little is known concerning the exact action of the EEF during healing. The mechanism responsible for TEP and EEF is unknown due to the lack of an in vitro model to study this phenomenon.We carried out studies by using a wound created in a human tissue-engineered skin and determined that TEP undergoes ascending and decreasing phases during the epithelium formation. The in vitro TEP measurements over time in the wound were corroborated with histological changes and with in vivo TEP variations during porcine skin wound healing. The expression of a crucial element implicated in Na+ transport, Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, was also evaluated at the same time points during the re-epithelialization process. The ascending and decreasing TEP values were correlated with changes in the expression of these pumps. The distribution of Na+/K+ ATPase pumps also varied according to epidermal differentiation. Further, inhibition of the pump activity induced a significant decrease of the TEP and of the re-epithelization rate.A better comprehension of the role of EEF could have important future medical applications regarding the treatment of chronic wound healing.This study brings a new perspective to understand the formation and restoration of TEP during the cutaneous wound healing process.",

Group A: topical anesthetic EMLA with film occlusion. Group B: topical anesthesia with Ecocain. The author proceeded to surgical debridement after local anesthesia. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were administered to assess the amount of pain felt during the debridement and during the following 6 h. Results: The analysis of the VAS revealed no major significant differences statistically. The analysis of the questionnaires showed patients treated with Ecocain took more analgesic drugs. Analysis of the timing and quality of procedure showed that Ecocain reduced the timing of debridement and dressing change, improving the outpatient management and patient compliance. Innovations: For rapid debridement, the most appropriate is to use Ecocain. Conclusion: Methods of local anesthesia are multiple and must be identified according to the needs of the patient and the surgeon trying to get the best anesthesia with minimal use of time and resources.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Wounds sustained in a combat trauma often result in a composite tissue loss. Combat injuries, due to high energy transfer to tissues, lead to trauma at multiple anatomical sites. An early wound cover is associated with lower rate of infections and a faster wound healing. The concept of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of combat-related wounds has evolved from the civilian trauma and the wounds from nontraumatic etiologies. Recent Advances: Encouraged by the results of NPWT in noncombat-related wounds, the military surgeons during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom used this novel method in a large percentage of combat wounds, with gratifying results. The mechanism of NPWT in wound healing is multifactorial and often complex reconstructive procedure can be avoided in a combat trauma setting. Critical Issues: Wounds sustained in military trauma are heavily contaminated with dirt, patient clothing, and frequently associated with extensive soft tissue loss and osseous destruction. Delay in evacuation during an ongoing conflict carries the risk of systemic infection. Early debridement is indicated followed by delayed closure of wounds. NPWT helps to provide temporary wound cover during the interim period of debridement and wound closure. Future Directions: Future area of research in combat wounds is related to abdominal trauma with loss of abdominal wall. The concept of negative pressure incisional management system in patients with a high risk of wound breakdown following surgery is under review, and may be of relevance in combat wounds.",

Therefore, exploration of the possible benefits of TCM on wound healing is necessary.Development of TCM is based on the concept of Yin (negative phenomenon of nature) and Yang (positive phenomenon of nature). These opposing and complementary natural phenomena of the universe restore the normal physiological functions, consequently curing diseases and restoring health of a patient.Due to lack of evidence-based research, TCM treatments are not widely accepted in the western world.

The goal of this study was to understand the impact of topical oxygen therapy (TOT) on patient outcomes, including amputation and healing rates. Approach: This retrospective chart review included records collected between January 1, 2007, and July 18, 2016, from male and female patients ranging in age from 4 years to 105 years. All wounds were at least 1 cm2 and were treated with at least one separate modality before treatment with TOT and then treated with TOT for a minimum of 2 weeks in compliance with the FDA-approved indications. All records were from wounds that were no longer being treated with TOT. Results: In this study, TOT was associated with an overall rate of 59.4% for a reduction in chronic wound size, while 41.6% of wounds had no healing. The overall amputation rate was 2.4% for wounds in this study. Innovation: To our knowledge, this retrospective chart review represents one of the largest data sets (4,127 total wounds) collected over one of the longest time periods (9.5 years) to evaluate patient outcomes following TOT.

Approach: A CLI patient with a nonhealing foot ulcer underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging of the feet before and after balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery. SPECT/CT imaging was used to evaluate serial changes in angiosome perfusion, which was compared to quantitative changes in peripheral vascular anatomy and hemodynamics, as assessed by standard clinical tools that included digital subtraction angiography (DSA), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and toe-brachial index (TBI). Results: Following revascularization, upstream quantitative improvements in stenosis of the SFA (pre: 35.4% to post: 11.9%) and popliteal artery (pre: 59.1% to post: 21.7%) shown by DSA were associated with downstream angiosome-dependent improvements in SPECT microvascular foot perfusion that ranged from 2% to 16%. ABI measurement was not possible due to extensive arterial calcification, while TBI values decreased from 0.26 to 0.16 following revascularization. Innovation: This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing noninvasive volumetric changes in angiosome foot perfusion in response to lower extremity revascularization in a patient with CLI by utilizing radiotracer-based imaging. Conclusion: SPECT/CT imaging allows for quantification of serial perfusion changes within angiosomes containing nonhealing ulcers and provides physiological assessment that is complementary to conventional anatomical (DSA) and hemodynamic (ABI/TBI) measures in the evaluation of lower extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate if patterned electroceutical dressing (PED) is safe for human chronic wounds treatment as reported by wound care providers. Approach: This work reports a pilot feasibility study with the primary objective to determine physically observable effects of PED application on host tissue response from a safety evaluation point of view. For this pilot study, patients receiving a lower extremity amputation with at least one open wound on the part to be amputated were enrolled. Patients were identified through the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) based on inclusion and exclusion criteria through prescreening through the Comprehensive Wound Center's (CWC) Limb Preservation Program and wound physicians and/or providers at OSUWMC. Wounds were treated with the PED before amputation surgery. Results: The intent of the study was to identify if PED was safe for clinical application based on visual observations of adverse or lack of adverse events on skin and wound tissue. The pilot testing performed on a small cohort (N = 8) of patients showed that with engineered voltage regulation of current flow to the open wound, the PED can be used with little to no visually observable adverse effects on chronic human skin wounds. Innovation: The PED was developed as a second-generation tunable electroceutical wound care dressing, which could potentially be used to treat wounds with deeper infections compared with current state of the art that treats wounds with treatment zone limited to the surface near topical application. Conclusion: Technology advances in design and fabrication of electroceutical dressings were leveraged to develop a tunable laboratory prototype that could be used as a disposable low-cost electroceutical wound care dressing on chronic wounds. Design revisions of PED-1 (1 kΩ ballast resistor) circumvented previously observed adverse effects on the skin in the vicinity of an open wound. PED-10 (including a 10 kΩ ballast resistor) was well tolerated in the small cohort of patients (N = 8) on whom it was tested, and the observations reported here warrant a larger study to determine the clinical impact on human wound healing and infection control.",

Over their lifetime, diabetic patients have a 25% incidence of foot ulcers (DFUs), which contribute to increased risk of morbidity, including osteomyelitis and amputations, and increased burden to the healthcare system. Recent Advances: The only active product approved for the treatment of diabetic ulcers, Regranex®, is not widely used due to minimal proven efficacy and recent warnings added to the Instructions for Use. A novel topical agent that accelerates healing and increases the proportion of fully healed DFUs, DSC127 [aclerastide; active ingredient, NorLeu3-angiotensin (1-7) (NorLeu3-A(1-7))], is recruiting patients in Phase III clinical trials (NCT01830348 and NCT01849965). NorLeu3-A(1-7) is an analog of the naturally occurring peptide, angiotensin 1-7. The mechanisms of action include induction of progenitor proliferation, accelerated vascularization, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization. Critical Issues: Current modalities for the treatment of DFUs include strict offloading, bandaging, debridement and, on a limited basis, application of Regranex. Novel potent therapies are needed to combat this significant burden to the diabetic patient and the healthcare system. Future Direction: Preclinical and clinical research shows that DSC127 is highly effective in the closure of diabetic wounds and is superior to Regranex in animal studies. Clinical development of DSC127 as a topical agent for the healing of DFU is underway. Further investigation into the mechanisms by which this product accelerates healing is warranted.",

Approach: At the Ohio State University Comprehensive Wound Center, chronic wound patients (n=30) undergoing NPWT were randomized into two arms following consent as approved by the institutional review board. The control arm received standard of care NPWT, where the dressing change was performed thrice a week. The test arm received the same care except that the WED was added as an interface layer and dressing change was limited to twice a week. Results: A reduced cost of care was achieved using the WED in conjunction with NPWT. Despite fewer dressing changes in wounds dressed with the WED, closure outcomes were comparable with no overt signs of any wound complication, including infection. The cost of NPWT care during the week was significantly lower (from $2918 to $2346) in the WED-treated group compared with patients in the control arm. Innovation: This work introduces a novel technology platform involving a WED, which may be used in conjunction with NPWT. If used as such, NPWT is effective in decreasing the frequency of dressing change and lowering the cost of care. Conclusion: This work points toward the benefit of using the WED combined with NPWT.

Severe ocular injuries and infections occur in varied settings including the home, workplace, and battlefields. In this review, we discuss the potential of developing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as therapeutics for the treatment of corneal wounds and infections for which the current treatment options are inadequate. Recent Advances: Standard-of-care employs the use of fluorescein dye for the diagnosis of ocular defects and is followed by the use of antibiotics and/or steroids to treat the infection and reduce inflammation. Recent advances for treating corneal wounds include the development of amniotic membrane therapies, wound chambers, and drug-loaded hydrogels. In this review, we will discuss an innovative approach using AMPs with the dual effect of promoting corneal wound healing and clearing infections. Critical Issues: An important aspect of treating ocular injuries is that treatments need to be effective and administered expeditiously. This is especially important for injuries that occur during combat and in individuals who demonstrate delayed wound healing. To overcome gaps in current treatment modalities, bioactive peptides based on naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial proteins are being investigated as new therapeutics.

Critical Issues: This critical review of DFU topical healing RCTs summarizes issues identified in their design and conduct, highlighting ways to improve study quality so researchers can increase the likelihood of RCT success in propelling effective topical DFU healing agents toward clinical use. Key issues include (1) inadequate sample size, (2) risk of bias, (3) irrelevant or unreported inclusion criteria, (4) substandard outcome measures, (5) unmatched group characteristics that predict nonhealing at baseline, (6) unequal or uncontrolled concurrent interventions or standard of care, (7) heterogeneous subject or DFU samples (8) unblinded allocation, treatment, or outcome measures, or (9) inadequate follow-up for clinical relevance. These can add bias or unexplained variability to RCT outcomes, limiting clinical or statistical significance and accuracy of results. Future Directions: This critical review summarizes ways to overcome these deficiencies to optimize DFU clinical trial design and conduct. It provides a blueprint for future excellence in RCTs testing safety and efficacy of topical DFU healing agents and smoothing the path to their clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Scope and Significance: Reconstruction of traumatic injuries requiring tissue transfer begins with aggressive resuscitation and stabilization. Systematic advances in acute casualty care at the point of injury have improved survival and allowed for increasingly complex treatment before definitive reconstruction at tertiary medical facilities outside the combat zone. As a result, the complexity of the limb salvage algorithm has increased over 14 years of combat activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Problem: Severe poly-extremity trauma in combat casualties has led to a large number of extremity salvage cases. Advanced reconstructive techniques coupled with regenerative medicine applications have played a critical role in the restoration, recovery, and rehabilitation of functional limb salvage. Translational Relevance: The past 14 years of war trauma have increased our understanding of tissue transfer for extremity reconstruction in the treatment of combat casualties. Injury patterns, flap choice, and reconstruction timing are critical variables to consider for optimal outcomes. Clinical Relevance: Subacute reconstruction with specifically chosen flap tissue and donor site location based on individual injuries result in successful tissue transfer, even in critically injured patients. These considerations can be combined with regenerative therapies to optimize massive wound coverage and limb salvage form and function in previously active patients. Summary: Traditional soft tissue reconstruction is integral in the treatment of war extremity trauma. Pedicle and free flaps are a critically important part of the reconstructive ladder for salvaging extreme extremity injuries that are seen as a result of the current practice of war.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The skin undergoes an inevitable degeneration as an individual ages. As intrinsic and extrinsic factors degrade the structural integrity of the skin, it experiences a critical loss of function and homeostatic stability. Thus, aged skin becomes increasingly susceptible to injury and displays a prolonged healing process. Recent Advances: Several studies have found significant differences during wound healing between younger and older individuals. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) signaling pathway has recently been identified as a major player in wound healing. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are pleiotropic key regulators of oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1α is essential to neovascularization through its regulation of cytokines, such as SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor 1-alpha) and has been shown to upregulate the expression of genes important for a hypoxic response. Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) and factor inhibiting HIF effectively block HIF-1α signaling in normoxia through hydroxylation, preventing the signaling cascade from activating, leading to impaired tissue survival. Critical Issues: Aged wounds are a major clinical burden, resisting modern treatment and costing millions in health care each year. At the molecular level, aging has been shown to interfere with PHD regulation, which in turn prevents HIF-1α from activating gene expression, ultimately leading to impaired healing. Other studies have identified loss of function in cells during aging, impeding processes such as angiogenesis. Future Directions: An improved understanding of the regulation of molecular mediators, such as HIF-1α and PHD, will allow for manipulation of the various factors underlying delayed wound healing in the aged. The findings highlighted in this may facilitate the development of potential therapeutic approaches involved in the alteration of cellular dynamics and aging.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Wound healing is a complex process that involves the interaction between different cell types and bioactive factors. Impaired wound healing is characterized by a loss in synchronization of these interactions, resulting in nonhealing chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are a socioeconomic burden, one of the most prominent clinical manifestations of diabetes, however, they lack satisfactory treatment options. The objective of this study was to develop polymeric composites that deliver ions having wound healing properties and evaluate its performance using a pressure ulcer model in diabetic mice. Approach: To develop a polymeric composite wound dressing containing ion-releasing nanoparticles for chronic wound healing. This composite was chemically and physically characterized and evaluated using a pressure ulcer wound model in diabetic (db/db) mice to explore their potential as novel wound dressing. Results: This dressing exhibits a controlled ion release and a good in vitro bioactivity. The polymeric composite dressing treatment stimulates angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, granulation tissue formation, and accelerates wound closure of ischemic wounds created in diabetic mice. In addition, the performance of the newly designed composite is remarkably better than a commercially available dressing frequently used for the treatment of low-exuding chronic wounds. Innovation: The developed nanoplatforms are cell- and growth factor free and control the host microenvironment resulting in enhanced wound healing. These nanoplatforms are available by cost-effective synthesis with a defined composition, offering an additional advantage in potential clinical application. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, these polymeric composites offer an optimum approach for chronic wound healing without adding cells or external biological factors.",

Approach: A retrospective review was performed on 25 patients who underwent major limb amputation or amputation revision and had iNPWT placed intraoperatively upon incision closure. Results: Twenty-one patients underwent lower extremity amputation and four underwent upper extremity amputation. Seventeen were primary amputations and eight were amputation revisions. No patients developed dehiscence, seroma, or hematoma. One patient developed a surgical site infection (4%) that was treated with oral antibiotics. The average time to eligibility for prosthetic fitting for lower extremity amputations was 6.3 weeks. Innovation: Amputee patients have increased wound healing demands that can impact prosthetic wear and ambulation status. Stump incisions are located at the distal end of their extremities and often are in areas that have had prior surgical procedures performed. Thus, blood supply to the incision site may not be optimal. iNPWT is an effective incision management technique to promote healing and decrease postoperative complications in this patient population, which can lead to increased mortality. Conclusion: iNPWT is an effective technique of minimizing wound complications in the amputee and should be considered in this high-risk patient population.",

Approach: PUMP1 was a wearable electronic device attached to the patient gown with no skin contact. PUMP2 was a set of four identical electronic devices placed under the patient's bed wheels. A video camera recorded events in the patient room while measurements from the PUMP devices were correlated with true patient repositioning activity. The performance of these PUMP devices developed by our research team were evaluated and compared by both clinicians and engineers. Results: Ten mobility-restricted patients were enrolled into the study. Repositioning movement was recorded by both PUMP devices for 10 ± 2 h and corroborated with video capture. One hundred thirty-seven movements in total were detected by both PUMP1 and PUMP2 over 105 h of capture. Two false positives were detected by the sensors and 11 movements were missed by the sensors. PUMP1 and PUMP2 never conflicted in data collection. Innovation: The presented study evaluated two different sensors' abilities to capture accurate patient repositioning to eventually prevent PU formation. Importantly, detection of patient motion was completed without contact to patient skin. Conclusion: The clinical study demonstrated successful capture of patient repositioning movement by both PUMP1 and PUMP2 devices with 85% reliability, 2 false positives, and 11 missed movements. In future studies, the PUMP devices will be combined with a SMS-based mobile phone alert system to improve caregiver repositioning behavior.",

PICO™, a no canister single-use system, offers a lightweight, portable alternative to tNPWT, with improved clinical performance. The aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of action of single-use NPWT (sNPWT) versus tNPWT. Approach: sNPWT and tNPWT were applied to an in vivo porcine excisional wound model, following product use guidelines. Macroscopic, histological, and biochemical analyses were performed at defined healing time points to assess multiple aspects of the healing response. Results: Wounds treated with single-use negative pressure displayed greater wound closure and increased reepithelialization versus those treated with traditional negative pressure. The resulting granulation tissue was more advanced with fewer neutrophils, reduced inflammatory markers, more mature collagen, and no wound filler-associated foreign body reactions. Of note, single-use negative pressure therapy failed to induce wound edge epithelial hyperproliferation, while traditional negative pressure therapy compromised periwound skin, which remained inflamed with high transepidermal water loss; features not observed following single-use treatment. Innovation: Single-use negative pressure was identified to improve multiple aspects of healing versus traditional negative pressure treatment. Conclusion: This study provides important new insight into the differing mode of action of single-use versus traditional negative pressure and may go some way to explaining the improved clinical outcomes observed with single-use negative pressure therapy.",

The relationship between obesity and lymphedema has important implications for public health. Recent Advances: Extreme obesity can cause lower extremity lymphedema, termed \"obesity-induced lymphedema (OIL).\" OIL is a form of secondary lymphedema that may occur once an individual's body mass index (BMI) exceeds 40. The risk of lymphatic dysfunction increases with elevated BMI and is almost universal once BMI exceeds 60. Patients with OIL also may develop areas of massive localized lymphedema (MLL). Critical Issues: Individuals with OIL are in an unfavorable cycle of weight gain and lymphatic injury. As BMI increases lymphedema worsens, ambulation becomes more difficult, and BMI further rises. The fundamental treatment for OIL is weight loss. Resection of areas of MLL and lower extremity volume reduction are performed when the BMI is lowered to <40 to reduce complications and recurrence. Future Directions: The mechanisms by which obesity causes lymphedema are still being elucidated. Although lymphatic function can improve following weight loss, it is unclear whether lymphedema may be completely reversed.",

Significance: This review shows considerable amount of research work carried out with fish-based biomaterials and collagen for treating burn wounds.

    "abstract": "Objective: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are devastating complications of diabetes, responsible for a high number of amputations worldwide. Due to its impact on chronic inflammation, psychological distress may negatively impact the healing process. Thus, this study evaluated the influence of psychological distress on physiological indicators of healing prognosis and the potential of stress-reducing therapies for DFU healing. Approach: Patients with chronic DFU were recruited and assessed at enrollment and 2 months later. According to psychological scores at enrollment, participants were allocated into groups without (group 1) or with (group 3) psychological distress. Participants who reported clinical distress were then randomly allocated into a control (no stress-reducing intervention—group 4) or experimental (with stress-reducing interventions—group 5) group. Subsequently, indicators of healing prognosis were measured. Results: Groups 1 and 3 presented no differences in the Perfusion, Extent, Depth, Infection and Sensation score, glycated hemoglobin, or inflammatory and angiogenic markers. However, the immune cell ratio was increased by more than twofold in group 3, compared with group 1. Importantly, the expression of circulating microRNAs was significantly increased in group 3 (miR-21-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-221-3p [p < 0.05]), compared with group 1. Two months later, group 5 displayed a significant improvement in the Perceived Stress Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores (p < 0.01), and the immune cell ratio was decreased by more than 2.5-fold. Innovation: This study helped to identify which variables and psychological interventions are more successful in promoting DFU healing. Conclusion: Psychological distress influenced clinical and physiological parameters, leading to compromised DFU healing and consequently underlining the potential of adjuvant stress-reducing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The purposes of this observational prospective study were to (1) characterize the wound-related factors (wound area, the presence of biofilm, and total bacteria), wound-related symptoms (fatigue, pain, exudate, itching, and edema or swelling), and systemic inflammation (level of serum C-reactive protein [CRP]), and (2) explore associations between wound-related factors, wound-related symptoms, and systemic inflammation in older individuals with chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLUs) over 8 weeks of wound treatment. Approach: A total of 117 participants who received standardized care (weekly sharp debridement) for chronic venous ulcer were enrolled. We collected clinical data every 2 weeks during the 8 weeks of the study period or until the wound was healed (if healed before 8 weeks). Associations among variables were estimated using a Bayesian approach applied to general linear mixed models. Results: Based on Bayes factor (BF) value, there was extremely strong evidence for the association of biofilm with mean total bacteria (BF >1,000). There was moderate evidence of a direct association between biofilm presence and levels of CRP (BF 4.3) and moderate evidence of direct associations between biofilm and wound-related symptoms, pain and exudate (BF 5.12, 8.49, respectively). Innovation: Wound-related symptoms and the level of systemic CRP were associated with biofilm among patients who were receiving weekly sharp debridement. Symptom severity associated with CVLUs requires assessment and management of wound-related factors and levels of inflammation in addition to symptom assessment. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine associations among biofilm, as wound-related factors, systemic inflammation, wound-related symptoms, and wound healing in clinical settings. Symptom severity, level of systemic CRP, and wound-related factors should be considered as well as assessment of biofilm in CVLU in older individuals with CVLU.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Volumetric muscle loss (VML) results in the loss of large amounts of tissue that inhibits muscle regeneration. Existing therapies, such as autologous muscle transfer and physical therapy, are incapable of returning full function and force production to injured muscle. Recent Advances: Skeletal muscle tissue constructs may provide an alternative to existing therapies currently used to treat VML. Unlike autologous muscle transplants, muscle constructs can be cultured in vitro and are not reliant on intact muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle constructs can be generated from small muscle biopsies and could be used to generate skeletal muscle tissue constructs to replace injured tissues. Critical issues: To serve as effective therapies, muscle constructs must be capable of generating contractile forces that can assist the function of host skeletal muscle. The contractile force of native muscle arises in part as a consequence of the highly aligned, bundled architecture of myofibers. Attempts to induce similar alignment include: applications of tension/strain across hydrogels, inducing aligned architectures within scaffolds, casting tissues in straited molds, and 3D printing. While all these methods have demonstrated efficacy towards inducing myofiber alignment, the extent of myofiber alignment, tissue formation, and force production varies. This manuscript critically reviews the advantages and limitations of these methods, and specifically discusses their ability to impart mechanical and architectural cues to induce alignment within constructs. Future Directions: As tissue synthesizing techniques continue to improve, muscle constructs must include more cell types than simply myoblasts, such as the addition of neuronal and endothelial cells. Higher level tissue organization is critical to the success of these constructs. Many of these technologies have yet to be implanted into host tissue to understand engraftment and how they can contribute to traumatic injury, and as such continued collaboration between surgeons and tissue engineers is necessary to ultimately result in clinical translation.",

As a first step, a consensus on the treatment of chronic wounds was developed and published in 2022.(1) The current publication on acute wounds represents the second step in this process. Acute wounds may result from any number of conditions, including burns, military and combat operations, and trauma to specific areas of the body. The management of acute wounds requires timely and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides the clinician with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis and therapeutic management of acute wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings. Recent Advances: Recent advances in the management of acute wounds have centered on stabilization and treatment in the military and combat environment, Specifically advancements in hemostasis, resuscitation, and the mitigation of infection risk through timely initiation of antibiotics and avoidance of high pressure irrigation in contaminated soft tissue injury. . Critical Issues: Critical issues include infection control, pain management and the unique considerations for the management of acute wounds in pediatric patients. Future Directions: Future directions include new approaches to preventing the progression and conversion of burns through the use of the microcapillary gel, a topical gel embedded with the anti-inflammatory drug infliximab.(38) Additionally, the use of three-dimensional bioprinting and photo-modulation for skin reconstruction following burns is a promising area for continued discovery.",

Fibrocytes are unique in their expression of both myeloid and connective tissue products, which include a distinct cytokine and surface marker expression profile. Recent studies suggest their clinical utility as predictive biomarkers and as targets for therapeutic intervention.Fibrocytes are involved in physiological and beneficial processes such as wound repair. Their involvement in detrimental processes such as aberrant collagen deposition in different fibrosing diseases reveals the sensitive balance in which these bone marrow progenitors have to be maintained.The enumeration of circulating fibrocytes and correlation with clinical severity of different fibrosing disorders is one of the most promising advantages in recent fibrocyte research. Besides their potential as a biomarker, fibrocytes may be therapeutically targeted by serum amyloid P, which inhibits their differentiation. In addition, recent murine studies supported the immunomodulatory potential of fibrocytes and demonstrated that these cells are controlled by CD4+ T cells.The potential prognostic utility of quantifying circulating fibrocytes in patients suffering from fibrotic diseases is one of the most promising aspects in possible clinical applications. In addition, controlling the number and differentiation of fibrocytes by therapeutic regulation of known differentiation by specific T-cell immunosuppression may open new avenues for the treatment of fibrosing diseases.Further detailed understanding of fibrocyte biology and their regulation in different disorders is desirable to advance new therapies for the treatment of chronic fibrosing disorders such as interstitial lung disease and to promote wound repair.",

Members of the chemokine family seem to be attractive and amenable to stimulate the healing process in chronic wounds. Targeting specific chemokines and/or their receptors has the potential to modify chronic inflammation to acute inflammation, which will hasten the healing process. Recent Advances: Over the years, expression levels of various chemokines and their receptors have been identified as key players in the inflammatory phase of wound healing. In addition, they contribute to regulating other phases of wound healing making them key targets for novel therapies. Understanding the signaling pathways of these chemokines will provide valuable clues for modulating their function to enhance the wound healing process. Critical Issues: Inflammation, an important first-stage process in wound healing, is dysregulated in chronic wounds; emerging studies show that chemokines play a crucial role in regulating inflammation. The knowledge gained so far is still limited in understanding the enormous complexity of the chemokine network during inflammation not just in chronic wounds but also in acute (normal) wounds. A much better understanding of the individual chemokines will pave the way for better targets and therapies to improve the healing efficiency of chronic wounds. Future Directions: Effective understanding of the interaction of chemokines and their receptors during chronic wound healing would facilitate the design of novel therapeutic drugs. Development of chemokine-based drugs targeting specific inflammatory cells will be invaluable in the treatment of chronic wounds, in which inflammation plays a major role.",

The development of SSIs involves a complex interplay between the cellular and molecular mechanisms of wound healing and contaminating bacteria, and here, we utilize an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate the role of bacterial virulence potential in the pathogenesis of SSI. Approach: The Muscle Wound ABM (MWABM) incorporates muscle cells, neutrophils, macrophages, myoblasts, abstracted blood vessels, and avirulent/virulent bacteria to simulate the pathogenesis of SSIs. Simulated bacteria with virulence potential can mutate to possess resistance to reactive oxygen species and increased invasiveness. Simulated experiments (t=7 days) involved parameter sweeps of initial wound size to identify transition zones between healed and nonhealed wounds/SSIs, and to evaluate the effect of avirulent/virulent bacteria. Results: The MWABM reproduced the dynamics of normal successful healing, including a transition zone in initial wound size beyond which healing was significantly impaired. Parameter sweeps with avirulent bacteria demonstrated that smaller wound sizes were associated with healing failure. This effect was even more pronounced with the addition of virulence potential to the contaminating bacteria. Innovation: The MWABM integrates the myriad factors involved in the healing of a normal wound and the pathogenesis of SSIs. This type of model can serve as a useful framework into which more detailed mechanistic knowledge can be embedded. Conclusion: Future work will involve more comprehensive representation of host factors, and especially the ability of those host factors to activate virulence potential in the microbes involved.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic wounds are a major burden to patients and to healthcare systems worldwide. These wounds are difficult to heal and treatment is often lengthy and expensive. This has led to research efforts focussed on the wound environment attempting to understand the underlying pathological mechanisms of impaired wound healing. While some of this research has translated to advancements in wound therapies and implementation of new treatment options, chronic wounds remain a significant challenge to treat. Thus, identification of effective, low-cost, advanced wound therapies that enhance healing rates of these problematic wounds is still essential. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), a molybdoflavin enzyme, is emerging as an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various pathologies, including diabetes and chronic wounds. XOR has recently been shown to be upregulated in chronic wounds, stimulating the overproduction of ROS during dysfunctional wound healing. XOR-induced ROS can amplify and potentiate inflammation in the wound environment further delaying wound closure. Future Directions: The detrimental role of XOR in impaired healing indicates it may be a therapeutic target. Targeted inhibition of XOR has been shown to reduce the expression and activity of this enzyme in diabetic wound models. In turn, this resulted in a significant decrease in ROS levels in the wound environment and improved wound healing. Therefore, repurposing existing XOR inhibitors that are approved for human use may be able to restore homeostasis at the wound site and enable damaged tissue to return to normal healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Pressure ulcers (PUs) in newborns and children are remarkably different from those in adults, both in their possible causal factors and in the etiology and biomechanical pathways for tissue damage. Recent Advances: Pediatric muscle and fat tissue structures are overall softer than those of adults, making newborns and young children more susceptible to deformation-inflicted injuries at their weight-bearing soft tissues. Critical Issues: The unique medical environment of neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, which is overloaded with medical devices, wiring, tubing, electrodes, and so on, is, in fact, an extrinsic risk factor for device-related PUs, since accidently misplaced tubes, wires, or electrodes can become trapped between the skin and the mattress, causing large sustained soft tissue deformations around them. Future Directions: Mattresses that are being used in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units must be able to respond to frequent movements and changing positions and also be able to effectively adapt and conform around such misplaced tubing or wires, which might contact the body and deform soft tissues. We used computer simulations of a tube caught under a preterm neonate's arm in a supine position to illustrate what adaptability of the support surface means in such cases. Our present simulations indicate that an air-cell-based technology provides considerably better protection against PUs in such cases, as the air-cells are able to locally buckle and conform around objects that are stiffer than the pediatric tissues (e.g., wires, tubes, electrodes), which minimizes exposure to tissue deformations.",

Ensuring a proper socket fit can have significant effects on the health of residual limb soft tissues and overall function and acceptance of the prosthetic limb. Previous work found that elevated vacuum pressure data can detect movement between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket; however, the correlation between the two was specific to each user. The overall objective of this work is to determine the relationship between elevated vacuum pressure deviations and prosthetic socket fit. Approach: A tension compression machine was used to apply repeated controlled forces onto a residual limb model with sockets of different internal volume. Results: The vacuum pressure-displacement relationship was dependent on socket fit. The vacuum pressure data were sensitive enough to detect differences of 1.5% global volume and can likely detect differences even smaller. Limb motion was reduced as surface area of contact between the limb model and socket was maximized. Innovation: The results suggest that elevated vacuum pressure data provide information to quantify socket fit. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the use of elevated vacuum pressure data may provide a method for prosthetists to quantify and monitor socket fit. Future studies should investigate the relationship between socket fit, limb motion, and limb health to define optimal socket fit parameters.",

Despite the high frequency of serious slow-healing wounds, there is still no adequate therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate a new highly diluted acetylcholine (Ach) formulation obtained through a sequential kinetic activation (SKA) method applied to a wound healing in vivo model to verify the hypothesis that a low dose of Ach could be a more physiological stimulus for healing, by stimulating muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and their related intracellular pathways. Approach: Two different concentrations (10 fg/mL and 1 pg/mL) and two formulations (either kinetically or nonkinetically activated) of Ach were used to verify the wound healing process. Area closure, histological aspect, and nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), Nestin, and von Willebrand's factor have been assessed by Western blot or ELISA and compared to 147 ng/mL Ach, used as positive control. Moreover, the systemic effect through plasmatic radical oxygen species (ROS) production and Ach concentration has been evaluated. Results: Ach SKA 1 pg/mL revealed a significant capacity to restore the integrity of tissue compared to other formulation and this effect was more evident after a single administration. Innovation: Topical application on skin of Ach SKA 1 pg/mL accelerates wound closure stimulating non-neuronal cholinergic system. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance in an in vivo model of highly diluted SKA Ach during wound healing, suggesting a potential use in skin disease.",

Approach: The research was facilitated with AB5075, a previously characterized, extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate. The model requires cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) that persists beyond 7 days. Multiple, 12-mm-diameter full-thickness wounds were created in the skin overlying the cervical and thoracic dorsum. Wound beds were inoculated with 5.0 × 104 colony-forming units (CFU) and covered with dressing. Results:A. baumannii was observed in the wound bed and on the dressing in what appeared to be biofilm. When bacterial burdens were measured, proliferation to at least 106 CFU/g (log106) wound tissue was observed. Infection was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) staining. To validate as a treatment model, polymyxin B was applied topically to a subset of infected wounds every 2 days. Then, the treated and untreated wounds were compared using multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques to include gross pathology, CFU burden, histopathology, PNA-FISH, and SEM.

Conclusion: The porcine model allows for an additional preclinical assessment of antibacterial candidates that show promise against A. baumannii in rodent models, further evaluating safety and efficacy, and serve as a large animal in preclinical assessment for the treatment of SSTI.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The Drosophila larval imaginal discs, which form the adult fly during metamorphosis, are an established model system for the study of epithelial tissue damage. The disc proper is a simple columnar epithelium, but it contains complex patterning and cell-fate specification, and is genetically tractable. These features enable unbiased genetic screens to identify genes involved in all aspects of the wound response, from sensing damage to wound closure, initiation of regeneration, and re-establishment of proper cell fates. Identification of the genes that facilitate epithelial wound closure and regeneration will enable development of more sophisticated wound treatments for clinical use. Recent Advances: Imaginal disc epithelia can be damaged in many different ways, including fragmentation, induction of cell death, and irradiation. Recent work has demonstrated that the tissue's response to damage varies depending on how the wound was induced. Here, we summarize the different responses activated in these epithelial tissues after the different types of damage. Critical Issues: These studies highlight that not all wounds elicit the same response from the surrounding tissue. A complete understanding of the various wound-healing mechanisms in Drosophila will be a first step in understanding how to manage damaged human tissues and optimize healing in different clinical contexts. Future Directions: Further work is necessary to understand the similarities and differences among an epithelial tissue's responses to different insults. Ongoing studies will identify the genes and pathways employed by injured imaginal discs. Thus, work in this genetically tractable system complements work in more conventional wound-healing models.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite the development of numerous wound treatment alternatives, 25% to 50% of leg ulcers and >30% of foot ulcers are not fully healed after 6 months of treatment. Autologous skin grafting is a time-tested therapy for these wounds; however, the creation of a new wound in the donor area yields a considerable limitation to this procedure. Innovation: Fractional autologous full-thickness skin grafting (FFTSG) is a technique wherein multiple small full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) are harvested with possibly minor donor-site comorbidities. The first device used to harvest FFTSG (ART™ system, Medline, Northfield, IL) is a device capable of harvesting >300 small FTSGs and transferring them to a target wound. Objective: To better evaluate patients' clinical experience, we sought to evaluate pain at the donor site associated with this procedure. Approach: Pain was assessed with numeric visual analog pain scales at days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Nine subjects underwent this procedure with only six of them reporting any level of pain on day 1, and none disclosing pain after day 2. Conclusion: In this study, we evidenced that this device manages to harvest FTSGs with minimal associated pain. Future research will need to evaluate other aspects of the procedure as well as long-term outcomes at the donor and recipient areas.",

The use of incisional negative-pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) is known to reduce wound infections for several surgical indications. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the potential of a new portable negative-pressure therapy device on perineal wound healing in patients undergoing APR. Approach: A new single-use incisional negative-pressure therapy device was applied in 10 patients. A negative pressure of -80 mmHg was continued for 7 days postsurgery. Incidence of wound complications and time to wound healing were compared with a historical control group of 10 patients undergoing APR in 2014, treated with conventional wound care. Results: Patient characteristics were comparable in both groups. Mean 1.6 dressings were used per patient. A wound complication was diagnosed in seven patients versus six in the control group. Wound infections were diagnosed median 11.5 days after surgery, compared with 10.5 days in the control group. Duration of wound healing was shorter in the study group (median 8.5 weeks vs. 13 weeks). Innovation: This is the first study to report on the use of this iNPWT device for patients who underwent APR for rectal cancer. Conclusion: In this study, iNPWT did not reduce wound complications. Wound infections occurred slightly later and seemed to have a less severe clinical course. After treatment with iNPWT, the duration of wound healing was shorter.",

Previously, we demonstrated good fibroblast adherence and growth on a newly developed scaffold, Tegaderm™-Nanofiber (TG-NF), made from poly ɛ-caprolactone (PCL)/gelatin nanofibers electrospun onto Tegaderm (TG). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety of TG-NF dressings in partial-thickness wound in a pig healing model. Approach: To evaluate the rate of reepithelialization, control TG, human dermal fibroblast-seeded TG-NF(+) and -unseeded TG-NF(-) were randomly dressed onto 80 partial-thickness burns created on four female and four male pigs. Wound inspections and dressings were done after burns on day 7, 14, 21, and 28. On day 28, full-thickness biopsies were taken for histopathological evaluation by Masson-Trichrome staining for collagen and hematoxylin-eosin staining for cell counting. Results: No infection and severe inflammation were recorded. Wounds treated with TG-NF(+) reepithelialized significantly faster than TG-NF(-) and control. Wound site inflammatory responses to study groups were similar as total cell counts on granulation tissues show no significant differences. Most of the wounds completely reepithelialized by day 28, except for two wounds in control and TG-NF(-). A higher collagen coverage was also recorded in the granulation tissues treated with TG-NF(+). Innovation and Conclusion: With better reepithelialization achieved by TG-NF(+) and similar rates of wound closure by TG-NF(-) and control, and the absence of elevated inflammatory responses to TG-NF constructs, TG-NF constructs are safe and demonstrated good healing potentials that are comparable to Tegaderm.",

Approach: A murine model for chronic UVB exposure was used to examine changes in epidermal barrier function, skin biomechanics, and miRNA expression as a result of UVB. Results: UVB irradiation caused skin to be weaker, less elastic, stiffer, and less pliable. Notably, these changes were not reversed after a 5-week period of recovery. Following UVB exposure, dermal collagen fibrils were significantly smaller in diameter and expression of the miR-34 family was significantly increased. Innovation: To our knowledge, this is the first study to concurrently examine alterations in skin function, miRNA expression, and tissue biomechanics in response to chronic UVB exposure. Conclusion: The data suggest that UVB alters miR-34 family expression in skin, in addition to dysregulating collagen structure with subsequent reductions in strength and elasticity. miRNAs may play a pivotal role in regulating extracellular matrix deposition and skin biomechanics following chronic UVB exposure, and thus may be a possible target for therapeutic development. However, additional studies are needed to directly probe the link between UVB exposure, miRNA production, and skin biomechanics.",

These wounds can present elevated protease levels, leading to rapid degradation of native and exogenously added growth factors. This work focused on developing a protease-resistant growth factor formulation for treatment of chronic wounds presented with high protease activity. Approach: This study developed protease-resistant growth factor formulations comprising elastin-like peptides (ELPs) fused with a known protease inhibitor peptide or growth factor. The ELP component of the fusion proteins allows assembly of heterogeneous nanoparticles (NPs) putting the inhibitor in close proximity to the growth factor to be protected. Results: We show successful preservation of growth factor activity in high human neutrophil elastase (HNE) environment and in human chronic wound fluid derived from patients. We further show that these NPs result in enhanced collagen remodeling and resolution of inflammation in a full thickness wound supplemented with HNE in genetically diabetic mice. Innovation: Development of heterogeneous NPs that put the protease inhibitor in close proximity of the growth factor. Moreover, the modular nature of the NPs allows for protection of multiple growth factors by the same inhibitor without changing the amino acid sequence of the growth factor. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the developed NPs hold tremendous promise in chronic wound healing therapy and may further help the translation of growth factor therapies to clinic. The customizable template for the NP design allows for multifaceted use across several fields in research and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The initial wound measurement and regular monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) is critical to assess treatment response. There is no standardized, universally accepted, quick, reliable, and quantitative assessment method to characterize DFU. To address this need, a novel topographic imaging system has been developed. Our study aims at assessing the reliability and practicality of the WoundVue® camera technology in the assessment of DFU. Approach: The WoundVue system is a prototype device. It consists of two infrared cameras and an infrared projector, and it is able to produce a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the wound structure. Fifty-seven diabetic foot wounds from patients seen in a multidisciplinary foot clinic were photographed from two different angles and distances by using the WoundVue camera. Wound area, volume, and maximum depth were measured for assessment of reliability. Thirty-one of these wounds also had area calculated by using the established Visitrak™ system, and a correlation between the area obtained by using both systems was assessed. Results: WoundVue images analysis showed excellent agreement for area (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.995), volume (ICC: 0.988), and maximum depth (ICC: 0.984). Good agreement was found for area measurement by using the WoundVue camera and Visitrak system (ICC: 0.842). The average percentage differences between measures obtained by using the WoundVue from different angles for assessment of different sizes and shapes of wounds were 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3–5.4), 12.9% (95% CI: 9.6–35.7), and 6.2% (95% CI: 2.3–14.7) for area, maximum depth, and volume, respectively. Innovation: This is the first human trial evaluating this novel 3D wound measurement device. Conclusion: The WoundVue system is capable of recreating a 3D model of DFU and produces consistent data. Digital images are ideal for monitoring wounds over time, and the WoundVue camera has the potential to be a valuable adjunct in diabetic foot wound care.",

Approach: Between January 2003 and October 2017, a total of 1,657 diabetic patients were admitted to the diabetic wound center of Korea University Guro Hospital, for the management of foot ulcers. Among the admitted patients, 117 diabetic patients with hindfoot ulcers were included in this study. One hundred and four patients (89%) healed without major amputation, while 13 patients (11%) healed with major amputation. Data related to 88 potential risk factors, including demographics, ulcer condition, vascularity, bioburden, neurology, and serology, were collected from patients in these two groups for comparison. Results: Among the 88 potential risk factors, 15 showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. In univariate analysis of 88 potential risk factors, nine showed statistically significant differences. In stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, three of the nine risk factors remained statistically significant. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for pulmonary disorders, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) levels were 38.525, 1.047, and 0.976, respectively. Innovation: Compared with forefoot and midfoot ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers involving the hindfoot are at increased risk of major amputation because infection may spread proximal to the ankle. However, large-scale cohort studies that specifically discuss the outcomes and characteristics of diabetic hindfoot ulcers are not widely available. Conclusion: Risk factors for major amputation in patients hospitalized with diabetic hindfoot ulcers include pulmonary disorders, high levels of ESR, and decreased TIBC levels.",

    "abstract": "Psychoneuroendocrinology studies provided first insight into social determinants of wound healing. Social stressors impede wound healing. In 2005, we first reported that the transcriptome of wound-site neutrophil is highly responsive to psychological stress in young men. Bioinformatics processing of transcriptome-wide data from neutrophils provided first insight into social transduction pathways relevant to wound healing. In 2010, Idaghdour et al. presented striking evidence demonstrating that genetic factors are responsible for only 5% of the variation in genomic expression. In contrast, the living environment of the individual, urban or rural, was responsible for as much as 50% of such variation. Genetic and environmental factors acted in a largely additive manner. This observation may be credited as the foundation stone of human social genomics. The environment of a patient, including social factors, influences gene expression relevant to wound healing. The nonhealing wound itself and its worsening outcome, including pain, are likely to cause stress. Conversely, positive social interactions may circumvent barriers to wound healing. Thus, interventions directed at the social environment of a wound care patient are likely to help manage wound chronicity. The genomic and related Big Data technology platforms have vastly improved during the past 5 years during which these technologies have also become widely accessible and affordable. Thus, this is the right time to revisit the choice of technologies for the study of social genomics of wound healing. Against the backdrop of our current understanding of the mechanisms of wound healing, such precision approach is likely to transform wound care and its outcomes making it patient-centered and, therefore, more effective.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic ulcerative dermatosis that poses a high burden of morbidity due to underdiagnosis, resistance to therapy, and limited therapeutic options. Optimization of wound care strategies and multimodal anti-inflammatory approaches are necessary to mitigate multiple converging pathways of inflammation leading to delayed healing, which is further complicated by additional factors such as pathergy. Recent Advances: PG treatment typically involves reducing inflammation, controlling pain, promoting wound healing, and treating the underlying etiology. Recent advances have been made with regard to targeted therapies for PG with topical, intralesional, and systemic medications. Wound management includes gentle cleansing without sharp debridement, limited topical antibacterial use, and maintenance of a moist environment to promote epithelial migration. Critical Issues: Wound dressings and compression therapy, in particular, introduce a wide variety of therapeutic options. Dressings should aim to target the specific PG wound type, depending on the depth and exudative nature of the wound, as well as local secondary factors. Superficial wounds, eschar, exudative wounds, granulating wounds, and colonized wounds are managed with variable approaches to the same underlying principles of pathergy avoidance, moisture balance, and reduction of immunogenic inflammatory stimuli. The importance of compression therapy to decrease edema and overgranulation fits within this treatment paradigm. Future Directions: As each of these treatment modalities offers a complex mixture of advantages and limitations, development of a systematic treatment algorithm in the future can help direct a more tailored path toward wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The physical and psychological sequalae of burn injuries account for 10 million disability-adjusted life years lost annually. Hypertrophic scarring (HSc) after burn injury results in reduced mobility, contracture, pain, itching, and aesthetic changes for burn survivors. Despite the prevalence of scarring and the number of scar therapies available, none are highly effective at preventing HSc after burn injury. Recent Advances: Recent studies modulating the mechanical environment surrounding incisional and excisional wounds have shown off-loading of tension to be a powerful strategy to prevent scar formation. Preclinical studies applying force perpendicular to the surface of the skin or using a combination of pressure both circumferentially and perpendicularly have shown substantial reductions in scar thickness and contraction after burn injury. Critical Issues: Though pressure therapy is highly effective in preclinical studies, outcomes in clinical studies have been variable and may be a result of differing therapy protocols and garment material fatigue. A recent adult clinical study reported a significant reduction in pressure after 1 month of use and significant reduction between 1 and 2 months of use, resulting in below therapeutic doses of pressure applied after only 1 month of use. Future Directions: To enhance efficacy of pressure garments, new low-fatigue materials must be developed for use in standard garments or garments must be redesigned to allow for adjustment to compensate for the loss of pressure with time. Additionally, measurements of applied pressure should be performed routinely during clinic visits to ensure that therapeutic doses of pressure are being delivered.",

This review will serve as a guide to the clinician for treatment selection and as an efficient tool for the scientist to achieve a comprehensive overview of the scientific literature to guide their future experiments aimed at pathologic scar prevention. Recent Advances: Current studies in the literature suggest carbon dioxide (CO2) laser and E-light (bipolar radiofrequency, intense pulsed light, and cooling) are two of the most effective treatment modalities for HTS, while surgical excision+CO2 laser+triamcinolone injection was one of the most successful treatments for keloids. In animal models, drug impregnated electrospun nanofiber dressings offer encouraging results for HTS prevention, while Kelulut honey showed promising results for keloid prevention. Critical Issues: Treatment outcome reproducibility is hindered by small cohorts of patients, inadequate-follow up, and variability in assessment tools. Prevention studies show multiple ways of achieving the same result, yet fall short of complete prevention. Furthermore, some studies that have purported full prevention have not been validated. Future Directions: To establish a standard of care, large clinical trials of the most successful modalities in small cohorts are needed.

    "abstract": "Significance: Secondary lymphedema is a debilitating disease caused by lymphatic dysfunction characterized by chronic swelling, dysregulated inflammation, disfigurement, and compromised wound healing. Since there is no effective cure, animal model systems that support basic science research into the mechanisms of secondary lymphedema are critical to advancing the field. Recent Advances: Over the last decade, lymphatic research has led to the improvement of existing animal lymphedema models and the establishment of new models. Although an ideal model does not exist, it is important to consider the strengths and limitations of currently available options. In a systematic review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we present recent developments in the field of animal lymphedema models and provide a concise comparison of ease, cost, reliability, and clinical translatability. Critical Issues: The incidence of secondary lymphedema is increasing, and there is no gold standard of treatment or cure for secondary lymphedema. Future Directions: As we iterate and create animal models that more closely characterize human lymphedema, we can achieve a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology and potentially develop effective therapeutics for patients.",

Many previous studies based on direct current contact stimulation may cause chemical burns or blisters, thereby increasing patients suffering. The aim of this study was to develop a safer and more convenient pulse capacitive coupling electrical field (PCCEF) stimulation to accelerate wound healing. Approach: A PCCEF-generating platform was self-designed to facilitate wound healing. The promoting effects and appropriate pulse width were explored by applying PCCEFs (54 mV/mm, 60 Hz) of different pulse widths to various cells involved in wound healing and mouse models for 2 h daily. Results: PCCEFs of ≥10 μs pulse width showed marked promotion of the migration and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT cells, enhanced the M2-type polarization and YPA/TAZ expression of macrophages, and facilitated the wound healing of mouse models. Comprehensive histological results suggested that PCCEF of 100 μs pulse width exerted the most positive effects. Innovation: A safe and effective PCCEF was developed to promote wound healing, which prevented prolonged stimulation and averted direct contact. Conclusion: PCCEF accelerated wound healing, especially at the optimal 100 μs pulse width, and was expected to be translated to clinical application, helping alleviate patient suffering, while reducing side effects.",

In recent years, loading these drugs onto nanodevices like nanoparticles, nanofibers, etc. as a drug delivery system has gained momentum due to its desirable properties and advantages. The purpose of this review is to examine the existing research on the potential and novel use of nanofiber-assisted delivery of NSAIDs. Recent Advances: Electrospun nanofibers have recently garnered considerable attention from researchers in a variety of sectors. They have proved to be promising vehicles for drug delivery systems because of their exceptional and favorable features like prolonged drug release, controllable porosity, and high surface area. In this article, various polymers and even combinations of polymers loaded with single or multiple drugs were analyzed to achieve the desired drug release rates (burst, sustained, and biphasic) from the electrospun nanofibers. Critical Issues: The administration of these medications can induce major adverse effects, causing patients discomfort. Thus, encapsulating these drugs within electrospun nanofibers helps to reduce the severity of side effects while also providing additional benefits such as targeted and controlled drug release, reduced toxicity, and long-lasting effects of the drug with lower amounts of administration. Future Directions: This review covers previous research on the delivery of NSAIDs using electrospun nanofibers as the matrix. Also, this study intends to aid in the development of enhanced drug delivery systems for the treatment of inflammation and related issues.",

Approach: We employed the diabetic neuroischemic rabbit model of impaired wound healing. Diabetes was induced in the rabbits with alloxan, and neuroischemia was induced by ligating the central neurovascular bundle of each ear. Four 6-mm full-thickness wounds were creating on each ear. A layer-by-layer (LbL) technique was employed to conformally coat the wound dressings with a chemically modified antisense RNA (antimiR) against miR-210 and an sshRNA targeting PHD2. Results: Wound healing was improved by the antimiR-210 but not the PHD2-sshRNA. Specific knockdown of miR-210 in tissue as measured by RT-qPCR was approximately 8 Ct greater than nonspecific controls, and this apparent level of knockdown (>99%) suggests that delivery to the tissue is highly efficient at the administered dose. Innovation: Use of novel therapeutic RNAs and the LbL system to deliver them to the diabetic wound. Conclusion: Healing of ischemic/neuropathic wounds in diabetic rabbits was accelerated upon inhibition of miR-210 by LbL delivery to the wound bed of a chemically modified antisense RNA targeting this microRNA.",

There is the potential for dressing tissue ingrowth if left in place for greater than the recommended 2–3 days. An easy to use, novel peel and place dressing has been designed for extended wear with the wound management advantages of ROCF while alleviating the challenges of tissue ingrowth. Approach: Paraspinal, full-thickness or deep muscle excisional wounds were created in 11 and 2 swine, respectively, dressings applied with continuous negative pressure at −125 mmHg, and dressings changed weekly. Full-thickness excisional wounds were treated for 13 days and deep muscle wounds for 35 days. Wound dimensions were assessed. Granulation tissue thickness and re-epithelialization were measured via digital morphometry. Tissue quality, fibrinous material prevalence, and dressing removal peel force were analyzed. Results: The peel and place dressing substantially reduces dressing tissue ingrowth, is easy to remove with markedly low dressing peel force and promotes more granulation tissue at day 13 than ROCF with an interface layer. The extended-wear peel and place dressing, when applied to deep muscle wounds with weekly dressing changes, was applied for a total of 35 days. Successful wound closure was evident without any negative impact on wound healing. Innovation: This study assessed the wound management capabilities of an extended-wear peel and place NPWT dressing used until wound closure. Conclusion: The peel and place dressing is a suitable extended-wear NPWT dressing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Since the introduction of the first commercial negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) system nearly three decades ago, several key technological innovations have led to wide adoption of the therapy. This is a review of the history and innovation of commercial NPWT systems for adjunctive management of open wounds. Recent Advances: Technical modifications have broadened NPWT options to include innovative dressing interfaces, tubing configurations, power sources, capability of topical wound solution instillation or irrigation, canister versus canister-free configurations, smart technology, and disposable versus larger reusable therapy units. While these options complicate product selection, they have greatly expanded the potential to manage a wide variety of wounds in patients who previously may not have been candidates for NPWT. Critical Issues: Basic yet mandatory requirements of NPWT include delivering an accurate level of negative pressure to the wound bed, maintaining a seal, removing wound surface exudate through the dressing interface, and patient adherence to prescribed therapy. Meeting these requirements is challenging in the face of variable wound types, wound locations, exudate levels and exudate viscosity. While there are a growing number of marketed NPWT systems, each may have different characteristics and performance. Evaluating the functionality of each system and relevant accessories is complicated, especially as additional manufacturers enter the market. Understanding key innovations and specific challenges they are intended to solve may aid healthcare providers in selecting appropriate NPWT technologies for patients. Future Directions: Evolving technology including artificial intelligence will likely play a major role in re-defining NPWT safety, simplicity, and reliability.",

Electrical stimulation (ES) is a well-documented treatment used to assist the healing of chronic wounds. Due to the importance of VEGF in the healing process, and the need to know the mechanisms of action of ES involved in the process, this report aimed to determine by a literature review whether the VEGF release occurs following ES in human subjects. Recent Advances: The findings of this literature review suggest that ES releases VEGF, and this effect may be responsible for promoting angiogenesis after ES. Critical Issues: Despite the findings of this literature review on the release of VEGF by ES on wound healing are promising, a large number of studies are needed to confirm such effects. Future Directions: Further studies should be conducted to identify the best parameters and treatment schedule of ES to be used for the VEGF release.",

    "abstract": "The wound healing process is well-understood on the cellular and tissue level; however, its complex molecular mechanisms are not yet uncovered in their entirety. Viewing wounds as perturbed molecular networks provides the tools for analyzing and optimizing the healing process. It helps to answer specific questions that lead to better understanding of the complexity of the process. What are the molecular pathways involved in wound healing? How do these pathways interact with each other during the different stages of wound healing? Is it possible to grasp the entire mechanism of regulatory interactions in the healing of a wound?Networks are structures composed of nodes connected by links. A network describing the state of a cell taking part in the healing process may contain nodes representing genes, proteins, microRNAs, metabolites, and drug molecules. The links connecting nodes represent interactions such as binding, regulation, co-expression, chemical reaction, and others. Both nodes and links can be weighted by numbers related to molecular concentration and the intensity of intermolecular interactions. Proceeding from data and from molecular profiling experiments, different types of networks are built to characterize the stages of the healing process. Network nodes having a higher degree of connectivity and centrality usually play more important roles for the functioning of the system they describe.We describe here the algorithms and software packages for building, manipulating and analyzing networks proceeding from information available from a literature or database search or directly extracted from experimental gene expression, metabolic, and proteomic data. Network analysis identifies genes/proteins most differentiated during the healing process, and their organization in functional pathways or modules, and their distribution into gene ontology categories of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular localization. We provide an example of how network analysis can be used to reach better understanding of regulation of key wound healing mediators and microRNAs that regulate them.Univariate statistical tests widely used in clinical studies are not enough to improve understanding and optimize the processes of wound healing. Network methods of analysis of patients \"omics\" data, such as transcriptoms, proteomes, and others can provide a better insight into the healing processes and help in development of better treatment practices. We review several articles that are examples of this emergent approach to the study of wound healing.Network analysis has the potential to considerably contribute to the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of wound healing and to the discovery of means to control and optimize that process.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this overview is to introduce bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS)–based proteomics approaches and strategies, widely used in other biomedical research fields, to the wound-healing research community. Approaches: Two major proteomics workflows are discussed: gel-based and gel-free chromatographic separation to reduce the complexity of the sample at protein and peptide level, respectively, prior to nano–liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Other strategies to discover less abundant proteins present in the sample, are also briefly discussed along with label-free and label-incorporated methods for protein quantification. Overall, the experimental workflows are designed and continually improved to increase the number of proteins identifiable and quantifiable. Discussion: Recent advances and improvements in all areas of proteomics workflow from sample preparation, to acquisition of massive amounts of data, to bioinformatics analysis have made this technology an indispensable tool for in-depth large-scale characterization of complex proteomes. This technology has been successfully applied in studies focusing on biomarker discovery, differential protein expression, protein–protein interactions, and post-translational modifications in complex biological samples such as cerebrospinal fluid, serum and plasma, and urine from patients. The publications from these studies have reported greater number of identified proteins, novel biomarker candidates, and post-translational modifications previously unknown. Conclusions: The qualitative and quantitative protein analysis of the protein population of wound tissues or fluids at different stages is important in wound healing research. Given the complexities and analytical challenges of these samples, MS-based proteomic workflows further improved with recent advances offer a powerful and attractive technology for this purpose.",

Such wounds are difficult to cleanse and tend to be extremely painful. Wound patients need a drug-free dressing that handles exudates, decreases the need for traumatic cleansing during dressing changes, and addresses wound pain, inflammation, and swelling.Multifunctional PolyMem® dressings (the generic name is polymeric membrane dressings) contain ingredients that work synergistically to continuously cleanse wounds and bring about rapid healing. Nonadherent PolyMem provides atraumatic dressing changes. PolyMem also decreases persistent wound pain. PolyMem Silver provides effective antimicrobial action without destructive silver toxicity.PolyMem Wic® Silver® Rope is a new strong, but exceedingly supple, dressing comprised of PolyMem Wic Silver reinforced with embedded surgical mesh. Insertion and removal is so simple that patients often change their dressings themselves. The unique features of PolyMem combine to make the nonadherent dressings not only extremely comfortable, but also anti-inflammatory, thus addressing both persistent and procedural wound pain.PolyMem Wic Silver Rope is especially appropriate for deep wounds with narrow openings, such as tunnels, fistulas, and cysts, but it can be used in any acute or chronic wound, even in the presence of infection.PolyMem dressings enhance autolytic debridement, which often results in production of large quantities of pale yellow enzyme- and nutrient-rich wound fluid during the first treatment week. Extra-absorbent PolyMem Max secondary dressings can contain excess fluid.",

    "abstract": "Problem: Lower extremity ulcers (venous, diabetic) are often unresponsive to standard treatment. Various systemic and local cellular, vascular, and anatomical factors can result in nonhealing wounds that are refractory to normal healing processes and standard care. Solution: Several published wound care guidelines strongly suggest that if an ulcer does not respond to standard good wound care within 4 weeks, then advanced wound therapies should be considered. These advanced therapies include wound bed preparation agents (negative wound pressure therapy, hyperbaric oxygen), recombinant growth factors, or bioengineered cell therapies. New Technology: The Cascade® system produces platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM), a novel autologous sterile biologic, produced at the bedside from a small volume (18 mL) of the patient's own blood by using Vacutainer® separation technology optimized for fibrin and platelet isolation. Prepared as an easy to apply, suturable membrane, without the use of exogenous thrombin, PRFM consists of a dense cross-linked fibrin lattice containing intact, viable platelets with their full complement of platelet-derived growth factors. Indications for Use: From the FDA 510(k) clearance: The Cascade system \"is designed to be used for the safe and rapid preparation of autologous platelet-rich plasma from a small sample of blood at the patient point of care.\" PRFM has been used to successfully treat severe venous leg ulcer (VLU), neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), mixed arterial and Charcot-deformity associated foot ulcers. Cautions: When treating venous or DFUs, the Cascade system should be used together with standard wound care practice (therapeutic compression for VLU and weight off-loading, debridement, and infection control for DFU) in patients with an adequate blood supply to the lower limb.",

    "abstract": "There has been an explosion of basic science results in the field of wound care over the past 20 years. Initially, wound dressings were the only therapeutic option available to the wound practitioner. With advanced basic science knowledge, technical innovation, and the recent participation of pharmaceutical companies, the wound clinician now has an arsenal of dressings, biological tissue replacements, gene therapy, and cell-based treatment options. What has not, however, kept pace with these changes is the education and practical training for those treating nonhealing wounds. The pace of innovation in wound diagnostic tools has also lagged, creating even more pressure on the clinician to use experience, skill, and training to properly diagnose the root cause for the nonhealing wound. As wound healing is not considered a medical specialty, there is no formal training process for physicians, and subsequently, allied health practitioners are often the only ones available to provide care for these complex patients. Wound care training, however, is also not part of any formal curriculum for these healthcare providers as well, creating confusion for patients, payors, regulators, researchers, and product manufacturers.In all other fields of medicine there is a formal process in place for physicians to train, certify, and credential. Medicine is constantly evolving and there have been several new fields of specialty care created over the past two decades that can serve as examples for the wound care field to follow. Without academic-based, clinical residency/fellowship training in wound healing ultimately leading to formal certification, the field will be unable to achieve an appropriate status in the medical establishment. Achieving this goal will impact product innovation, payment, and the sustainability of the field.The enhanced understanding of normal and dysregulated wound healing processes, which have been uncovered by basic scientists, has translated to the bedside through the creation of multiple advanced biological solutions for patients with nonhealing wounds.These advanced wound care therapeutics will require physician involvement in a way not previously seen in wound care. It will no longer be possible to practice wound care \"part time\" in the near future. The amount of new information and massive base of core knowledge required will mandate a full-time commitment. The increase in patients with this condition because of an aging population, increased numbers of diabetic patients, and the ever growing epidemic of obesity will mandate that all clinicians providing wound care will need to increase their skill sets through formal training. In addition, underserved patient populations are disproportionately affected and their outcomes are comparatively worse, further complicating the problem at a healthcare structural and policy level.The American College of Wound Healing and Tissue Repair was founded in Illinois as a nonprofit organization whose express function is to organize university-based medical school programs around a common curriculum for physicians who want to specialize in wound healing. Currently, two wound care fellows have graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago and other programs are under development. The ultimate process will be achieved when certification is accredited by an organization such as the American Board of Medical Specialties. This article outlines the current process in place to achieve this goal within 10 years.",

    "abstract": "Mircosurgical free tissue transfer is a powerful tool in the arsenal of reconstructive surgeons, oftentimes as the final option in limb salvage before amputation. Patients presenting for limb salvage frequently carry with them multiple co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Surgeons are oftentimes hesitant to attempt free tissue tranfer in these medically complex individuals due to beliefs that the patient would not tolerate prolonged anesthesia, the surgery is doomed to fail, or the patient would be better off with an amputation. Because amputees actually demonstrate higher mortality rates, the decision to not to proceed with limb salvage should be made with great care.By reviewing the success rates with free tissue transfer for limb salvage in high-risk patients, the target articles have shown that this option is indeed viable even in this patient population. Specifically, reasonable success rates are presented for limb salvage using free tissue transfer in patients with end-stage renal disease, a single-vessel leg and critical limb ischemia.The articles reviewed demonstrate that free tissue transfer for limb salvage in properly selected patients with end-stage renal disease or severe peripheral vascular disease is worth attempting. Before surgery, these patients must undergo a complete cardiac work-up regardless of previous cardiac history.When necessary, free tissue transfer should be pursued by the reconstructive surgeon even in high-risk medically complex patients.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Delayed and nonhealing wounds pose a health, economic, and social problem worldwide. For decades, the conventional wisdom pointed to growth factors as the driving force of wound healing and granted them a center stage for therapeutic development. To date, few have obtained US FDA approvals or shown clinical effectiveness and safety. Critical Issue: Wound closure is the initial and most critical step during wound healing. Closing chronic wounds to shut down continued infection is the primary and likely the only achievable goal at the clinic in the foreseeable future. The critical question here is to identify the factor(s) in wounded tissues that drives the initial wound closure. Recent Advances: We made an unexpected discovery of the secreted form of heat shock protein-90alpha (Hsp90α) for promoting skin cell motility, reepithelialization, and wound closure. Secreted Hsp90α possesses unique properties to remain functional under the hostile wound environment that compromises conventional growth factors' effectiveness. Through the common lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 cell surface receptor and activation of the Akt signaling pathway, topical application of human recombinant Hsp90α protein greatly accelerates excision, burn, and diabetic skin wound closure in rodent and porcine models. Future Directions: In almost all cells, the 2-3% of their total proteins (∼7,000 per cell) are Hsp90 (α and β), a long unraveled puzzle. Our new finding of Hsp90 secretion in wounded tissues suggests that the stockpile of Hsp90α by all cells is to rapidly supply the need for extracellular Hsp90α to repair damaged tissues. We propose that keratinocytes at the wound edge secrete Hsp90α that leads the reepithelialization process to close the wound.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Wound repair is a complex biological process that integrates multiple physiologic pathways to restore skin homeostasis after a wide array of gross and anatomical insults. As such, a scientific examination of the wound typically requires broad sampling of numerous factors and is commonly achieved through DNA microarray analysis. Critical Issues: In the last several years, it has become increasingly evident that the granularity afforded by such traditional population-based assays may be insufficient to capture the complex relationships in heterogeneous processes such as those associated with wound healing and stem cell biology. Recent Advances: Several emerging technologies have recently become available that permit high-throughput single-cell gene expression analysis in a manner which provides novel insights into the relationships of complex tissue. The most prominent among these employs microfluidic-based devices to achieve a high-resolution analysis of tissue samples. Future Directions: The intrinsically heterogeneous nature of injured tissue, in conjunction with its temporal dynamics, makes wound repair and tissue regeneration an attractive target for high-throughput single-cell analysis. Given the staggering costs associated with chronic and non-healing wounds, the development of predictive and diagnostic tools using this technology would likely be attractive to healthcare providers.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Debridement to remove necrotic and/or infected tissue and promote active healing remains a cornerstone of contemporary chronic wound management. While there has been a recent shift toward less invasive polymer-based debriding devices, their efficacy requires rigorous evaluation. Approach: This study was designed to directly compare monofilament debriding devices to traditional gauze using a wounded porcine skin biofilm model with standardized application parameters. Biofilm removal was determined using a surface viability assay, bacterial counts, histological assessment, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Quantitative analysis revealed that monofilament debriding devices outperformed the standard gauze, resulting in up to 100-fold greater reduction in bacterial counts. Interestingly, histological and morphological analyses suggested that debridement not only removed bacteria, but also differentially disrupted the bacterially-derived extracellular polymeric substance. Finally, SEM of post-debridement monofilaments showed structural changes in attached bacteria, implying a negative impact on viability. Innovation: This is the first study to combine controlled and defined debridement application with a biologically relevant ex vivo biofilm model to directly compare monofilament debriding devices. Conclusion: These data support the use of monofilament debriding devices for the removal of established wound biofilms and suggest variable efficacy towards biofilms composed of different species of bacteria.",

Herein, we compare the ability of a single topical application of SDF1-ELP to that of SDF1 in healing 1 × 1 cm excisional wounds in diabetic mice. Approach: Human Leukemia-60 cells were used to demonstrate the chemotactic potential of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 in vitro. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were used to demonstrate the angiogenic potential of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 in vitro. The bioactivity of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 after incubation in ex-vivo diabetic wound fluid was compared. The in-vivo effectiveness of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 was compared in diabetic mice wound model by monitoring for the number of CD31+ cells in harvested wound tissues. Results: SDF1-ELP promotes the migration of cells and induces vascularization similar to SDF1 in vitro. SDF1-ELP is more stable in wound fluids compared to SDF1. In vivo, SDF1-ELP induced a higher number of vascular endothelial cells (CD31+ cells) compared to SDF1 and other controls, suggesting increased vascularization. Innovation: While growth factors have been shown to improve wound healing, this strategy is largely ineffective in chronic wounds. In this work, we show that SDF1-ELP is a promising agent for the treatment of chronic skin wounds. Conclusion: The superior in vivo performance and stability of SDF1-ELP makes it a promising agent for the treatment of chronic skin wounds.",

Propensity score matching followed by multivariable analyses was used to adjust for selection bias and assess treatment effects comparing CCO-treated versus honey-treated PUs. Key outcomes included 100% granulation and epithelialization at 1 year. Results: Five hundred seventeen CCO-treated PUs (446 patients) were matched to corresponding honey-treated PUs (341 patients). The majority of PUs were stage III (CCO 56%, honey 55%). CCO users had significantly fewer total visits (9.1 vs. 12.6; p < 0.001), fewer total selective sharp debridements (2.7 vs. 4.4; p < 0.001), and fewer PUs receiving negative pressure wound therapy (29% vs. 38%; p = 0.002) compared with honey. Innovation: CCO-treated PUs were 38% more likely to achieve 100% granulation compared to honey-treated PUs at 1 year, p = 0.018. Mean days to 100% granulation were significantly lower for CCO-treated PUs (255 vs. 282 days, p < 0.001).

Monocytes/macrophages play a key role in sustained inflammation associated with impaired healing and local administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ agonists may modulate macrophage, improving healing. In this study, we investigated the effects of GQ-11, a partial/dual PPARα/γ agonist, on macrophage function and wound healing in diabetes. Approach: Wounds were surgically induced at the dorsum of C57BL/6J and BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J (db/db) mice and treated with hydrogel (vehicle), pioglitazone or GQ-11, for 7 or 10 days, respectively. After treatment, wounds were analyzed histologically and by quantitative PCR (qPCR). In addition, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were cultured from C57BL/6J mice and treated with vehicle, pioglitazone, or GQ-11, after challenge with lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4 to be analyzed by qPCR and flow cytometry. Results: GQ-11 treatment upregulated anti-inflammatory/pro-healing factors and downregulated pro-inflammatory factors both in wounds of db/db mice and in BMDM. Innovation: Wounds of db/db mice treated with GQ-11 exhibited faster wound closure and re-epithelization, increased collagen deposition, and less Mac-3 staining compared with vehicle, providing a new approach to treatment of diabetic wound healing to prevent complications. Conclusion: GQ-11 improves wound healing in db/db mice, regulating the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and wound growth factors, leading to increased re-epithelization and collagen deposition.",

Approach: A prospective cross-sectional study of 132 pairs of chronic wound care recipients and their informal caregivers was included. The characteristics of patients and their informal caregivers as well as caregiver burden assessment by the caregiver burden inventory (CBI) were measured. Single factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were carried out to explore the independent determinants of caregiver burden on caring for patients with chronic wound. Results: Most of the caregivers were female with mean age of 54.57 ± 13.35 years, and 58.3% of the caregivers were adult children. The mean CBI score was 34.21 ± 9.69 at a medium level. The following variables increased the CBI scores of caregivers: long caring time per day for patients, powerlessness status of patients, insufficient self-efficacy, and social support of caregivers, the model was able to explain 67.5% of variance in caregiver burden (F = 47.167, p = 0.000, R2 = 0.675, adjusted R2 = 0.660).

    "abstract": "Objective: Wound healing is a complex process involving the dynamic interplay of various types of cells and bioactive factors. Impaired wound healing is characterized by a loss in synchronization of the process, resulting in non-healing chronic wounds. Human amniotic membrane (AM) has been shown to be effective in the management of chronic wounds. Recently, a viable lyopreserved AM (VLAM) has been developed. The VLAM retains the structural, molecular, and functional properties of fresh AM with the advantage of a long shelf life for living tissue at ambient temperatures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of VLAM on the impaired wound microenvironment and wound closure in db/db mice. Approach: VLAM or saline gel (control) was applied weekly to 7-mm excisional wounds in diabetic (db/db) mice. Wound appearance and size were assessed weekly. Inflammation and redox state in wounds were tested by cytokine gene and protein expression, and by catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, respectively. Wound tissue granulation and neovascularization were assessed histologically. Results: Diabetic wounds treated with VLAM closed faster than control wounds. On an average, VLAM-treated wounds closed 4 days faster than the control wounds, with a significantly faster rate of closure at days 7 and 14 as compared with control wounds. The faster closure correlated with a decrease in the expression of proinflammatory factors and oxidative stress, and an increase in angiogenesis and dermal thickness. Innovation: Effects of VLAM on a chronic wound microenvironment and underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated for the first time. Conclusion: VLAM accelerates wound closure in db/db mice by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress and supporting wound tissue granulation, neovascularization, and re-epithelialization.",

Approach: U.S. Wound Registry data were examined retrospectively and assigned an outcome. Bivariate analysis identified significant variables (p < 0.05) that were used to create a multivariable logistic regression model. Ulcers with data for wound area at the first visit before debridement were included in regression analysis, which was based on a 90% development sample. The model was validated on a hold-out 10% data sample. Results: The original dataset included 26,713 VLUs, of which 11,773 ulcers were eligible for preliminary analysis and 10,942 ulcers were eligible for regression analysis. The 90% development model included 9,898 ulcers, of which 7,498 healed (75.8%). The 10% validation sample included 1,044 ulcers, of which 809 healed (77.5%). The following variables significantly predicted healing: number of concurrent wounds of any etiology, wound size, wound age (in days), evidence of bioburden/infection, being nonambulatory, and hospitalization for any reason. Innovation: The VLU Wound Healing Index (WHI) is a comprehensive, validated risk stratification model for predicting VLU healing that incorporates patient- and wound-specific variables. Conclusions: The WHI can identify which VLUs most likely require adjunctive therapies to heal, prioritize referral to venous experts, risk-stratify ulcers to create more generalizable clinical trials and understand the impact of clinical interventions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services accepts this method for reporting VLU outcome under the Quality Payment Program.",

More than 25 million people in the United States have T2D and are vulnerable to epithelial-related complications. Current therapies are limited in their efficacy. New treatments for full-thickness cutaneous wounds that focus on underlying diabetic pathways are needed. Approach: Topical application of the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) dissolved in cream reverses delayed wound closure in type 1 diabetic rat by the acceleration of reepithelialization and enhancement of angiogenesis and remodeling. NTX blocks the opioid growth factor (OGF)-OGF receptor (OGFr) axis and upregulates DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. To investigate whether NTX is an effective therapy for T2D wound closure, genetically obese mice (db/db) and normal C57Bl/6J mice received full-thickness cutaneous wounds. Wounds (5 mm in diameter) were treated topically three times daily with 10-5 M NTX or sterile saline dissolved in cream and photographed every 2 days. Results: Wounds in db/db mice treated with saline were 11-92% larger than those in normal mice throughout the 2-week observation. Topical NTX therapy in T2D mice reduced the residual wound size by 13-30% between days 8 and 14 relative to diabetic mice receiving saline. Reepithelialization and DNA synthesis, as analyzed by epithelial thickness and BrdU labeling indexes, respectively, were accelerated in NTX-treated wounds. Innovation and Conclusion: These data suggest that the OGF-OGFr axis plays a role in epithelial-related complications of T2D and that blockade of this pathway by NTX may be an effective treatment for wound repair.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) wound measurements enable the evaluation of wound healing from the wound bed, which may be a more sensitive measure than traditional two-dimensional (2D) area measurements at the level of the skin surface. Few studies have investigated 3D measurements for monitoring wound healing over time. The aim of this study was to compare the changes in 3D area measurements with traditional (2D) area measurements of diabetic foot ulcers during 8 weeks. Approach: In a prospective cohort study, we monitored the wound healing of 150 diabetic foot ulcers using the 3D-wound assessment monitor camera (3D area) and the digital imaging method (2D area) at baseline, weeks 2, 4, and 8. The following statistical approaches were used to compare the changes in 2D area and 3D area measurements: linear regression analysis, paired Wilcoxon rank test, Bonett-Price 95% confidence interval, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: The overall changes in 3D area were significantly larger compared with 2D area as assessed by Wilcoxon test (p < 0.0001) and Bonett-Price 95% confidence interval of 0.009-0.163. In addition, comparison of 2D area and 3D area measurements showed that the majority of the wounds had larger decrease in 3D area compared with 2D area over time. Innovation: 3D area appears to provide a more sensitive method to monitor wound healing. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential benefit of a novel 3D camera for monitoring wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers, which was found particularly useful in monitoring wound healing in large wounds. However, in small wounds (<5 cm2), the 2D area and 3D area measurements perform equally well in monitoring the wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Despite the development of a number of treatment modalities, scarring remains common postburn injury. To reduce burn scarring, pressure garment therapy has been widely utilized but is complicated by low patient adherence. To improve adherence, reduced hours of daily garment wear has been proposed. Approach: To examine the efficacy of pressure garment therapy at reduced durations of daily wear, a porcine burn-excise-autograft model was utilized. Grafted burns were treated with pressure garments (20 mmHg) for 8, 16, or 24 h of daily wear with untreated burns serving as controls. Scar area, thickness, biomechanical properties, and tissue structure were assessed over time. Results: All treatment groups reduced scar thickness and contraction versus controls and improved scar pliability and elasticity. Pressure garments worn 24 h per day significantly reduced contraction versus the 8- and 16-h groups and prevented alignment of collagen within the dermis. Innovation: Though pressure garment therapy is prescribed for use 23 h per day, the need for almost continuous use has not been previously examined. Adjustable, low-fatigue pressure garments were developed for this porcine study to examine the role of daily duration of wear without confounding factors such as garment fatigue and patient adherence. Conclusion: For maximum efficacy, pressure garments should be worn 23 to 24 h per day; however, garments worn as little as 8 h per day significantly improve scar outcomes versus no treatment.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Prolonged inflammation and impaired angiogenesis are the two principal factors that prevent successful wound healing, which is exacerbated in people with diabetes. There is a significant need for new wound healing treatments that target both these factors simultaneously. This review discusses the emerging evidence that high-density lipoproteins (HDL) have pleiotropic wound healing benefits. Recent Advances: Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic effects of HDL. In endothelial cells, HDL mediate these effects through interaction with the scavenger receptor SR-BI, which activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, causing a decrease in inflammatory protein production and an increase in proangiogenic growth factors. In macrophages, HDL inhibit inflammation through suppression of the nuclear factor kappa B activation pathway. This review details the molecular disturbances that cause impaired wound healing in diabetes with a particular focus on inflammation and angiogenesis and the pathways in which HDL provide benefit. Critical Issues: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) impose a major public health challenge worldwide. It is estimated that 20% patients with DFUs require amputation, which is accompanied by a significant social and economic burden. To date, there are no therapeutic agents with pleiotropic effects that actively improve wound healing, highlighting a therapeutic void for this complex disease.",

Morbidity includes decreased self-esteem, infections, and reduced function of the area. Recent Advances: Several mutations can cause lymphedema, and new variants continue to be elucidated. A critical determinant that predicts the natural history and morbidity of lymphedema is the patient's body mass index (BMI). Individuals who maintain an active lifestyle with a normal BMI generally have less severe disease compared to subjects who are obese. Because other causes of lower extremity enlargement can be confused with lymphedema, definitive diagnosis requires lymphoscintigraphy. Critical Issues: Most patients with primary lymphedema are satisfactorily managed with compression regimens, exercise, and maintenance of a normal body weight. Suction-assisted lipectomy is our preferred operative intervention for symptomatic patients who have failed conservative therapy. Suction-assisted lipectomy effectively removes excess subcutaneous fibro-adipose tissue and can improve underlying lymphatic function. Future Directions: Many patients with primary lymphedema do not have an identifiable mutation and thus novel variants will be identified. The mechanisms by which mutations cause lymphedema continue to be studied. In the future, drug therapy for the disease may be developed.",

These scars result in discomfort, impaired mobility, disruption of normal function and cosmesis, and significant psychological distress. Currently, there are no satisfactory methods to treat or prevent HTS, as the cellular and molecular mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. This review summarizes the biology of proteins in the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM), which are involved in wound healing and hypertrophic scarring. Recent Advances: New basic research continues toward understanding the diversity of cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal wound healing and hypertrophic scarring. Broadening the understanding of these mechanisms creates insight into novel methods for preventing and treating HTS. Critical Issues: Although there is an abundance of research conducted on collagen in the ECM and its relationship to HTS, there is a significant gap in understanding the role of proteoglycans and their specific isoforms in dermal fibrosis. Future Directions: Exploring the biological roles of ECM proteins and their unique isoforms in HTS, mature scars, and normal skin will further the understanding of abnormal wound healing and create a more robust understanding of what constitutes dermal fibrosis. Research into the biological roles of ECM protein isoforms and their regulation during wound healing warrants a more extensive investigation to identify their distinct biological functions in cellular processes and outcomes.",

Hyperforin and Hypericin are important phytochemical constituents found in H. perforatum, which have been highlighted for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties in recent times. Therefore, we have attempted to explore the wound-healing activity of oil obtained from H. perforatum.Results:H. perforatum oil emulsion has been demonstrated to have significant wound-healing potential as compared with mupirocin ointment and petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Animals treated with H. perforatum showed a 97% (18.9 mm2/day) reduction in wound area as compared with animals treated with mupirocin (68%) (12.8 mm2/day) and animals treated with Vaseline (69%) (13.7 mm2/day).

    "abstract": "Objective: Sickle cell ulcers (SCUs) are a devastating comorbidity affecting patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). SCUs form over the medial or lateral malleoli of the lower extremity, are slow to heal, and prone to recidivism. Some SCUs may never heal, leading to chronic pain and foot deformities. There is no specific and effective therapy for SCUs. Systemic deferoxamine (DFO) has been demonstrated to prevent some of the sequelae of SCD by chelating iron. In this study, we tested the ability of DFO delivered via a transdermal delivery system (DFO-TDDS) to accelerate healing in a murine model of SCU. Approach: Excisional wounds were created in a transgenic murine model of SCD expressing >99% human sickle hemoglobin, and healing rates were compared with wounds in wild-type mice. Next, excisional wounds in SCD mice were treated with DFO-TDDS, DFO injection, or left untreated. Wound closure rates, histology, and iron in the healed wounds were analyzed. Results: Wounds in SCD mice healed significantly slower than wild-type mice (***p < 0.001). DFO-TDDS-treated wounds demonstrated significantly accelerated time to closure, reduced size, and improved wound remodeling compared with untreated wounds (***p < 0.001) and DFO injection treatment (*p < 0.05). DFO released from the TDDS into wounds resulted in chelation of excessive dermal-free iron. Innovation: DFO-TDDS is a novel therapeutic that is effective in healing wounds in sickle cell mice. Conclusion: DFO-TDDS significantly accelerates healing of murine SCUs by chelation of excessive free iron and is currently manufactured in an FDA-compliant facility to be translated for treating human SCUs.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Wound management recommendations usually group dressings by base substrate material or reimbursement codes, even when functional differences are vast (e.g., honey-containing alginates, super-absorbent hydrogels). Polymeric membrane dressings (PMDs) diverge dramatically from conventional foam dressings in functional attributes, indications, and patient results, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the evidence for categorizing dressings based upon functional differences. Approach: A search of ALL published literature describing the use of PMDs, with no date or language limits, was conducted. Documents simply listing a PMD brand name (e.g., PolyMem) as one of many \"foam\" dressings were eliminated. The subset of evidence evaluating PMDs for tissue damage resulting from pressure (pressure ulcers, pressure injuries, henceforth: PUs) was summarized. Results: Studies of PMDs, primarily from independent clinician-researchers, have accumulated into a significant evidence base over the past 30 years. PMDs actively cleanse and debride wounds, balance moisture, relieve pain, and limit inflammation: all functions not shared by conventional foams. Innovation: This article supports a paradigm shift for wound management guidance materials to embrace a more evidence-based, patient-centered method of classifying products. The results presented here, using PMDs for PUs as an example, show that functional attributes, indications, and patient results are not always dictated by dressing substrates. Rather than being comparable with conventional foam dressings, PMDs have substantially enhanced functions and results. Conclusion: These results strongly support the author's assertion that evidence-based wound management requires guidelines and recommendations that categorize advanced dressings based upon how they function in real-life settings, rather than upon their base substrate.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cell migration is an essential process in skin wound healing. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhances wound healing by photoactivating a photosensitizer with a specific wavelength of light. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel expressed in multiple layers of keratinocytes. Recent studies showed that the activation of CFTR-related downstream signaling affects skin wound healing. We examined whether indocyanine green (ICG)-mediated PDT-enhanced cell migration is related to CFTR activation. Approach: The spatial and temporal expression levels of CFTR and proteins involved in focal adhesion, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, were evaluated during cell migration in vitro and in vivo for wound healing. Results: ICG-PDT-conditioned medium collected from cells exposed to 5 J/cm2 near-infrared light in the presence of 100 μg/mL ICG activated CFTR and enhanced HaCaT cell migration. The expression of phosphorylated FAK Tyr861 and phosphorylated paxillin in focal adhesions was spatially and temporally regulated in parallel by ICG-PDT-conditioned medium. Curcumin, a nonspecific activator of CFTR, further increased PDT-enhanced cell migration, whereas inhibition of CFTR and FAK delayed cell migration. The involvement of CFTR in ICG-PDT-enhanced skin wound healing was confirmed in a mouse back skin wound model. Innovation: CFTR is a potential new therapeutic target in ICG-PDT to enhance wound healing. Conclusion: ICG-PDT-enhanced cell migration may be related to activation of the CFTR and FAK pathway. Conditioned medium collected from ICG-PDT may be useful for treating patients with chronic skin ulcer by regulating CFTR expression in keratinocytes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) comprise 80% of leg ulcers. One of the key parameters that can promote healing of VLUs is tissue oxygenation. To date, clinicians have employed visual inspection of the wound site to determine the healing progression of a wound. Clinicians measure the wound size and check for epithelialization. Imaging for tissue oxygenation changes surrounding the wounds can objectively complement the subjective visual inspection approach. Herein, a handheld noncontact near-infrared optical scanner (NIROS) was developed to measure tissue oxygenation of VLUs during weeks of treatment. Approach: Continuous-wave-based diffuse reflectance measurements were processed using Modified Beer-Lambert's law to obtain changes in tissue oxygenation (in terms of oxy-, deoxy-, total hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation). The tissue oxygenation contrast obtained between the wound and surrounding tissue was longitudinally mapped across weeks of treatment of four VLUs (healing and nonhealing cases). Results: It was observed that wound to background tissue oxygenation contrasts in healing wounds diminished and/or stabilized, whereas in the nonhealing wounds it did not. In addition, in a very slow-healing wound, wound to background tissue oxygenation contrasts fluctuated and did not converge. Innovation: Near-infrared imaging of wounds to assess healing or nonhealing of VLUs from tissue oxygenation changes using a noncontact, handheld, and low-cost imager has been demonstrated for the first time. Conclusion: The tissue oxygenation changes in wound with respect to the surrounding tissue can provide an objective subclinical physiological assessment of VLUs during their treatment, along with the gold-standard visual clinical assessment.",

Approach: Patients with nonhealing wounds who qualified to receive advanced wound therapies were consecutively enrolled and treated weekly with vLPM plus standard of care (SOC) at five centers. Data were de-identified and retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes included closure, time to closure, number of vLPM applications, and adverse events (AEs). Results: Seventy-eight patients with 98 wounds (41 diabetic foot ulcers [DFUs], 19 venous leg ulcers [VLUs], 10 surgical, and 28 others) with an average size of 13.3 cm2 and 8.7 months duration were treated. Fifty-eight of the 98 wounds (59.2%) achieved complete closure with median time to closure of 63 days and 6 vLPM applications. The closure by wound etiology was 63% for DFUs, 47% for VLUs, 70% for surgical wounds, and 57% for other types of wounds. Similar closure rates have been previously demonstrated for vCPM. Wound duration was the main predictor of closure: 65.8% versus 30.0% (p = 0.004) closure was achieved for wounds of ≤12 and >12 months duration, respectively. There were no AEs related to vLPM application. Innovation: This is the first multicenter case series evaluating the clinical outcomes of vLPM in a real-world setting.

    "abstract": "Significance: Keloids are benign fibro-proliferative raised dermal lesions that spread beyond the original borders of the wound, continue to grow, rarely regress, and are the most common in pigmented individuals after an abnormal wound healing response. The current treatment failure and respective challenges involved highlighting the underlying issue that the etiopathogenesis of keloids is still not well understood. Disease models are required to better understand the disease pathogenesis. It is not possible to establish keloids in animals because of the uniqueness of this disease to human skin. To address this challenge, along these lines, non-animal reproducible models are vital in investigating molecular mechanisms of keloid pathogenesis and therapeutics development. Recent Advances: Various non-animal models have been developed to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in keloid scarring and aid in identifying and evaluating the therapeutic potential of novel drug candidates. In this scenario, the current review aims at describing in vitro monocultures, co-cultures, organotypic cultures, and ex vivo whole skin keloid tissue organ culture models. Critical Issues and Future Directions: Current treatment options for keloids are far from securing a cure or preventing disease recurrence. Identifying universally accepted effective therapy for keloids has been hampered by the absence of appropriate disease model systems. Animal models do not accurately mimic the disease, thus non-animal model systems are pivotal in keloid research. The use of these models is essential not only for a better understanding of disease biology but also for identifying and evaluating novel drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Increased macrophage recruitment in the early stages of wound healing leads to an excessive inflammatory response associated with elevated fibrosis and scarring. This recruitment relies upon integrins on the surface of monocytes that regulate their migration and extravasation from the circulation into the wound site, where they differentiate into macrophages. The aim of this study was to determine if inhibiting monocyte extravasation from the circulation into burns would reduce macrophages numbers in burns and lead to reduced inflammation and scar formation. Approach: Scald burns were created on mice and treated with integrin alpha L (αL) function blocking antibody via intravenous delivery day 1 after injury. The effect of inhibiting macrophage recruitment into the burn was assessed using macro- and microscopic wound parameters as well as immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cell markers, cytokines, and collagen deposition. Results: Burn wound-associated macrophages were reduced by 54.7% at day 3 following treatment with integrin αL antibody, with levels returning to normal by day 7. This reduction in macrophages led to a concomitant reduction in inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and Il-10 as well as a reduction in proscarring transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1). This reduced inflammatory response was also associated with less alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression and an overall trend toward reduced scar formation with a lower collagen I/III ratio. Innovation: Treatment of burns with integrin αL function blocking antibodies reduces inflammation in burn wounds. Conclusion: These results suggest that reducing macrophage infiltration into burn wounds may lead to a reduced early inflammatory response and less scar formation following burn injury.",

Approach: In this case-control study conducted on 75 patients with chronic wounds, 50 patients with aspirate or cultured BM were used as cases and 25 with only daily saline dressings were used as controls. Results: Autologous BM aspirate either as fresh or cultured even without identification, isolation, and selective application of stem cells achieved significant reduction in the wound surface area when compared with control group. Innovation: The application of cultured BM cells had significantly higher percentage reduction of wound size compared to freshly applied BM aspirate; this reflects a high importance of stem cell therapy.

    "abstract": "Significance: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) requires the placement of a dressing over a wound, covered with an adhesive film, and applying to these dressing a negative pressure in a controlled fashion. This therapy is a powerful complement to surgical care of wounds. Data are however poor on its use in pediatric burns. Recent Advances: This systematic review, including a total of 466 patients, shows that NPWT as the initial treatment for burned children and after skin grafting has been shown to produce promising results. In the majority of studies, skin graft take rate is close to 100%. This therapy is particularly beneficial in the pediatric population because of less frequent dressing changes and early mobilization. NPWT devices accurately quantify burns water losses and allow tailoring liquid resuscitation. Critical Issues: NPWT is not in the subject of controlled clinical trials in pediatric; most publications are case reports or retrospective reviews. The sporadic complications include bleeding, local infections, and mechanical device issues. Future Directions: NPWT has been used in 2-month up to 18-year-old children with deep second- to third-degree burn of multiple etiologies, from a few days up to several months, on small to 40% total body surface area (%), and in difficult areas. Data gathered provide empirical guidelines on NPWT use in pediatric burns using continuous mode with a pressure of -50 to -75 mmHg for children younger than 2 years, and -75 to -125 mmHg in children over 2 years of age. Prospective randomized studies are needed to provide validated rules.",

Approach: We quantified the angiogenesis within HSCs both in vitro and in vivo through computational analyses of immunofluorescent (IF) staining. We assayed with real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) the expression of key endothelial, dermal, and epidermal genes in 2D culture and HSCs. Epidermal integrity and proliferation were also evaluated through haematoxylin and eosin staining, and IF staining. Results: IF confirmed iEC commitment to endothelial phenotype. RT-qPCR showed HUVECs and iECs immaturity compared with HDBECs. In vitro, the vascular network extension was comparable for HDBECs and HUVECs despite differences in vascular diameter, whereas iECs formed unorganized rudimentary tubular structures. In vivo, all ECs produced discrete vascular networks of varying dimensions. HUVECs and HDBECs maintained a higher proliferation of basal keratinocytes. HDBECs had the best impact on extracellular matrix expression, and epidermal proliferation and differentiation. Innovation: To our knowledge, this study represents the first direct and quantitative comparison of HDBECs, HUVECs, and iECs angiogenic performance in HSCs. Conclusions: Our data indicate that HUVECs and iECs can be an alternative cell source to HDBEC to promote the short-term viability of prevascularized engineered grafts. Nevertheless, HDBECs maintain their capillary identity and outperform other EC types in promoting the maturation of the dermis and epidermis. These intrinsic characteristics of HDBECs may influence the long-term function of skin grafts.",

Failure of wound healing can result in complications including infection, prolonged hospitalization, critical illness, organ failure, readmission, new or worsening enterocutaneous fistula, and even death. Recent Advances: Recent advances are relevant for the role of specific micronutrients, such as vitamin D, trace elements, and the interplay between molecules with pro- and antioxidant properties. Our understanding of the role of other small molecules, genes, proteins, and macronutrients is also rapidly changing. Recent work has elucidated relationships between oxidative stress, nutritional supplementation, and glucose metabolism. Thresholds have also been established to define adequate preoperative nutritional status. Critical Issues: Further work is needed to establish standards and definitions for measuring the extent of wound healing, particularly for inflammatory bowel disease and ulcers. In addition, a mounting body of evidence has determined the need for adequate preoperative nutritional supplementation for elective surgical procedures. Future Directions: A large portion of current work is restricted to model systems in rodents. Therefore, additional clinical and translational research is needed in this area to promote gastrointestinal wound healing in humans, particularly those suffering from critical illness, patients with enterocutaneous fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcers, and those undergoing surgical procedures.",

This study aimed at constructing a bi-layered composite chitosan/chitosan-β-tricalcium phosphate (CS/CS-β-TCP) scaffold and at repairing the rat osteochondral defect. Approach: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold was fabricated by lyophilization, and its microstructure was observed by a scanning electron microscope. Chondrocytes and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were seeded into the CS layer and the CS-β-TCP layer, respectively. Viability and proliferation ability of the cells were observed under a confocal microscope. After subcutaneous implantation, the chondrogenic ability of the CS layer and osteogenic ability of the CS-β-TCP layer were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Then, the bi-layered scaffolds were implanted into the rat osteochondral defects and the harvested samples were macroscopically and histologically evaluated. Results: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold exhibited the distinctive microstructures for each layer. The seeded chondrocytes in the CS layer could maintain the chondrogenic lineage, whereas BMSCs in the CS-β-TCP layer could continually differentiate into the osteogenic lineage. Moreover, cells in both layers could maintain well viability and excellent proliferation ability. For the in vivo study, the newly formed tissues in the bi-layered scaffolds group were similar with the native osteochondral tissues, which comprised hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone, with better repair effects compared with those of the pure CS group and the blank control group. Innovation: This is the first time that the bi-layered composite CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold has been fabricated and evaluated with respect to osteochondral defect repair. Conclusion: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffolds could facilitate osteochondral defect repair and might be the promising candidates for osteochondral tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study sought to examine the real-world impact of multimodality cyclical-pressure topical wound oxygen therapy (TWO2) on hospitalizations and amputations in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) compared with patients without TWO2. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of deidentified patient medical records at 2 U.S. Veterans Affairs hospitals between January 2012 and January 2020. DFU patients were assigned to TWO2 or NO TWO2 cohorts based on their treatment records. Patients received appropriate standard of care and may have received other advanced wound treatments, including skin substitutes, negative pressure wound therapy, and growth factors. Primary study outcomes were patients requiring hospitalization and/or amputation within 360 days of initial wound documentation. Findings: Among unmatched cohorts of 202 patients with DFU (91 TWO2, 111 NO TWO2), 6.6% and 12.1% of TWO2 patients had hospitalizations and amputations, respectively, compared with 54.1% and 41.4% of NO TWO2 patients within 360 days (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001), representing 88% and 71% reductions. Among propensity score-matched cohorts of 140 DFU patients (70 TWO2, 70 NO TWO2), compared with NO TWO2, 82% fewer TWO2 patients were hospitalized (7.1% vs. 40.0%, p < 0.0001) and 73% fewer TWO2 patients had amputations (8.6% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.0007). Logistic regression among matched cohorts demonstrated nearly ninefold and fivefold higher risk of hospitalization and amputation, respectively, for NO TWO2 versus TWO2. Interpretation: This retrospective cohort study demonstrates that treating patients with DFU with TWO2 is associated with significant reductions in hospitalizations and amputations in the real-world setting.",

It is unclear how well PAR performs as a surrogate marker for complete wound closure. This review aimed to summarize all available evidence evaluating PAR as a predictor of complete DFU and VLU healing. Recent Advances: A review searching the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMCARE databases was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Randomized-controlled trials and observational studies reporting PAR and any measure of its predictive ability were included. Outcomes included performance measures of PAR, timing of PAR, outcome measurement, and specific PAR cutoffs. Critical Issues: Meta-analysis was not possible due to high variability in wound duration at study start (2-48 weeks), PAR timing (2-8 weeks), PAR cutoff (-3% to 90%; determined post hoc in most studies), and outcome assessment (10-24 weeks). Six studies (21,430 DFU patients) report PAR as having acceptable to outstanding discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.720-0.910). Five studies (29,775 VLU patients) report PAR as having poor to excellent discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.680-0.830). One study (241 DFU and VLU patients) reports PAR sensitivity and specificity of 58.5% and 90.5%, respectively. All studies were determined to have high risk of bias. Future Directions: Despite promising discriminatory ability, most studies report post hoc analysis of patients in randomized trials, are highly heterogenous in study design, and have high risk of bias. There is scant evidence to support PAR in isolation as a surrogate for complete DFU or VLU healing in routine clinical practice.",

Approach: We assessed a wound measurement application (eKare inSight®) for result consistency in patients presenting with wounds. Assessments were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed for intrarater (ICC1,1) and inter-rater (ICC2,1) analysis using a two-way random effects model. Paired t-test assessed the statistical difference between measurement methods. Results: Forty-two lesions were analyzed with surface areas ranging from 0.2 to 23 cm2 (average 4.33 ± 5.44 cm2). A high level of reliability was observed for repeat wound area measurements by the same examiner (ICC1,1 = 0.997) and between examiners with iPhone 13 mini (ICC2,1 = 0.998). There was no significant difference between iPhone 12 and iPad mini/Structure Sensor (p = 0.78) or between iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 12 (p = 0.22). Minimal difference existed between iPhone 13 mini and iPad mini/Structure Sensor (p = 0.049, Cohen's d = 0.01). Innovation: Increased pervasiveness of smartphones in clinical care, coupled with advances in smartphone imaging and machine learning, allows for a potential solution to the problem of fast and accurate wound measurements. The application investigated produces wound measurement results quickly and with demonstrated accuracy. It does not require a calibration sticker or reference marker and allows for automatic wound boundary delineation.

Understanding what comorbidities most affect the individual versus their wounds could be a key metric. Recent Advances: The last 20 years have seen substantial advances in QoL instruments and conversion of patient data to a single value known as the health utilities index (HUI). We review these advances, along with wound-related QoL, and analyze real-world comorbidities challenging wound care. Critical Issues: To understand the impact of underlying comorbidities in a real-world patient population, we examined a convenience sample of 382 patients seen at a hospital-based outpatient wound center. This quality reporting study falls outside the regulations that govern human subject research. Comorbid conditions were used to calculate HUIs using a variety of literature-reported approaches, while Wound-Quality-of-Life (W-QoL) questionnaire data were collected from patients during their first visit. The mean number of conditions per patient was 8; 229 patients (59.9%) had utility values for comorbidities/conditions, which were worse/lower than their wounds' values. Sixty-three (16.5%) patients had depression and/or anxiety, 64 (16.8%) had morbid obesity, and 204 (53.4%) had gait and mobility disorders, all of which could have affected W-QoL scoring. The mean minimum utility value (0.5) was within 0.05 units of an average of 13 studies reporting health utilities from wound care populations using the EuroQol 5 Dimension instrument. Future Directions: The comorbidity associated with the lowest utility value is what might most influence the QoL of patients with chronic wounds. This finding needs further investigation.",

These lipids regulate hemostasis, onset and resolution of inflammation, migration and proliferation cells, angiogenesis, epithelialization, and remodeling of collagen. The objective of this overview is to demonstrate the applicability of systems level lipid analyses to identify and quantify lipid involved in events leading to wound healing.Current advances in liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry have provided the means for carrying out quantitative and qualitative analysis of lipids at a systems level. This emerging field is collectively referred to as lipidomics and its potential in wound healing research is largely ignored.While comprehensive applications of lipidomics in wound healing are limited, studies carried out by the authors as well as others demonstrate distinct changes in the lipidome during the wound healing process.Until recently, investigations into lipids were limited to the study of a few lipids at a time. Lipidomics approaches provide the capability to quantitatively and qualitatively assay almost the full complement of lipid signaling circuits at the same time. This allows obtaining a system level understanding of changes to the entire lipidome during the wound healing process.The technology provides promising approach to understanding new signaling pathways based on lipids involved in wound healing. The understanding gained from such studies has the potential for the development of novel lipid based treatment strategies to promote wound healing.",

The advantages and disadvantages of several dental stem cells are discussed, including the developmental stage and specific locations from which these cells can be purified. In particular, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth may act as a very practical and easily accessibly reservoir for autologous stem cells and hold the most value in stem cell therapy. Dental pulp stem cells and periodontal ligament stem cells should also be considered for their triple lineage differentiation ability and relative ease of isolation. Further, we address the potentials and limitations of induced pluripotent stem cells as a cell source in dental regenerative.From an economical and a practical standpoint, dental stem cell therapy would be most easily applied in the prevention of periodontal ligament detachment and bone atrophy, as well as in the regeneration of dentin-pulp complex. In contrast, cell-based tooth replacement due to decay or other oral pathology seems, at the current time, an untenable approach.",

    "abstract": "A below-knee amputation (BKA) can be the most functional option for select patients with a diseased lower extremity and may offer a better quality of life than limb salvage in some patients.Because of advances in prosthetic technology, some patients may have a better quality of life with a BKA than a salvaged lower extremity. Those who cannot wear a prosthesis will do better with a poorly functioning leg. Understanding which patients will not benefit from an amputation helps ensure that a maximum of patients will continue ambulating.We lack a thorough understanding of which patients will be more functional with a BKA than a salvaged extremity. Some will do better with a prosthesis, whereas others will do better with a poorly functioning peg leg. This is because so many amputees never wear their prosthesis.A better understanding of patient selection and optimal operative technique would allow us to better council patients as to how to optimize their functional outcome. Over the past 30 years, a number of useful studies have been published regarding the BKA. However, recent advances in wound care, prosthetics, and medical care in general require a re-evaluation of the BKA within the limb salvage concept.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The effect of chronic hyperglycemic exposure on endothelial cell (EC) phenotype, impaired wound neovascularization, and healing is not completely understood. The hypotheses are: 1) chronic exposure to diabetic conditions in vivo impairs the angiogenic potential of ECs and 2) this deficiency can be improved by an extracellular microenvironment of angiogenic peptide nanofibers. Approach: Angiogenic potential of microvascular ECs isolated from diabetic (db/db) and wild type (wt) mice was assessed by quantifying migration, proliferation, apoptosis, capillary morphogenesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression for cell cultures on Matrigel (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or nanofibers under normoglycemic conditions. The in vivo effects of nanofiber treatment on wound vascularization were determined using two mouse models of diabetic wound healing. Results: Diabetic ECs showed significant impairments in migration, VEGF expression, and capillary morphogenesis. The nanofiber microenvironment restored capillary morphogenesis and VEGF expression and significantly increased proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis of diabetic cells versus wt controls. In diabetic wounds, nanofibers significantly enhanced EC infiltration, neovascularization, and VEGF protein levels, as compared to saline treatment; this effect was observed even in MMP9 knockout mice with endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) deficiency. Innovation: The results suggest a novel approach for correcting diabetes-induced endothelial deficiencies via cell interactions with a nanofiber-based provisional matrix in the absence of external angiogenic stimuli. Conclusion: Impaired endothelial angiogenic potential can be restored by angiogenic cell stimulation in the nanofiber microenvironment; this suggests that nanofiber technology for diabetic wound healing and treatment of other diabetes-induced vascular deficiencies is promising.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although significant resources are invested in wound care and healing annually, chronic wounds remain a major medical problem as they often present a more difficult challenge than the underlying disease. Current treatment options include a multitude of dressing materials, topical agents including antibiotics, enzymatic debriders, and growth factors, mechanical debridement, and optimization of medical comorbidities. The Problem: Even under optimal circumstances, the healing process leads to some form of fibrosis and scarring. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: Studies suggest that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from these diverse tissues possess similar biological characteristics, differentiation potential, and immunological properties. Enthusiasm about MSCs for use in reconstruction and regenerative medicine has been fueled by evidence that these cells possess the ability to participate in the tissue repair process through a variety of paracrine mechanisms affecting tissue regeneration and inflammation. Clinical Care Relevance: Recent advances in stem cell immunobiology have led to increased interest in MSCs as a new therapeutic modality to address chronic wounds and other inflammatory pathology. Conclusion: A thorough understanding of the immunobiology of MSCs is necessary to realize the complement of pathological processes that could be affected by MSC-based therapy. The novel methods reviewed here are highly promising, with the collective goal of identifying new therapeutic approaches to wound healing that are broadly applicable to many chronic diseases, and can safely accelerate the transition of basic research findings into clinical advances in many areas of regenerative medicine and reconstructive surgery.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Splinting full-thickness cutaneous wounds in mice has allowed for a humanized model of wound healing. Delineating the epithelial edge and assessing time to closure of these healing wounds via macroscopic visualization have remained a challenge. Approach: Double transgenic mice were created by crossbreeding K14-Cre and ROSAmT/mG reporter mice. Full-thickness excisional wounds were created in K14-Cre/ROSAmT/mG mice (n = 5) and imaged using both normal and fluorescent light on the day of surgery, and every other postoperative day (POD) until wound healing was complete. Ten blinded observers analyzed a series of images from a single representative healing wound, taken using normal or fluorescent light, to decide the POD when healing was complete. K14-Cre/ROSAmT/mG mice (n = 4) were subsequently sacrificed at the four potential days of rated wound closure to accurately determine the histological point of wound closure using microscopic fluorescence imaging. Results: Average time to wound closure was rated significantly longer in the wound series images taken using normal light, compared with fluorescent light (mean POD 13.6 vs. 11.6, *p = 0.008). Fluorescence imaging of histological samples indicated that reepithelialization was complete at 12 days postwounding. Innovation: We describe a novel technique, using double transgenic mice K14-Cre/ROSAmT/mG and fluorescence imaging, to more accurately determine the healing time of wounds in mice upon macroscopic evaluation. Conclusion: The accuracy by which wound healing can be macroscopically determined in vivo in mouse models of wound healing is significantly enhanced using K14-Cre/ROSAmT/mG double transgenic mice and fluorescence imaging.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Chronic skin ulcers, including venous, diabetic, and pressure ulcers, constitute a major health care burden, affecting 2-6 million people in the United States alone, with projected increases in incidence owing to the aging population and rising epidemic of diabetes. The ulcers are often accompanied by pain. Standard of care fails to heal ∼50% of diabetic foot ulcers and 25% of venous leg ulcers. Even advanced therapies do not heal >60%. Thus there is an unmet need for novel therapies that promote healing and also address the concomitant pain issue. Recent Advances: Prolotherapy involves injection of small amounts of an irritant material to the site of degenerated or painful joints, ligaments, and tendons. Multiple irritants are reported to be efficacious, but the focus here is on dextrose prolotherapy. In vitro and in vivo studies support translation to clinical use. Concentrations as low as 5% dextrose have resulted in production of growth factors that have critical roles in repair. Numerous clinical trials report pro-reparative effects of dextrose prolotherapy in joint diseases, tendon, and ligament damage, and for painful musculoskeletal issues. However, most of the studies have limitations that result in low-quality evidence. Critical Issues: The preclinical data support a role for dextrose prolotherapy in promoting tissue repair that is required for healing chronic wounds and ameliorating the associated pain. Critical issues include provision of evidence of efficacy in human chronic wounds. Another potential obstacle is limitation of reimbursement by third-party payers for a therapy with as yet limited evidence. Future Directions: Preclinical studies in models of chronic wounds would support clinical translation. As dextrose prolotherapy has some mechanistic similarities to already approved honey therapies, it may have a shortened pathway for clinical translation. The gold standard for widespread adoption would be a well-designed clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) occur in almost 25% of all patients with diabetes in their lifetime, with oxygen being the key limiting factor in healing. Identifying regions of compromised oxygenated flow can help clinicians cater the wound treatment process, possibly reducing wound healing time. Herein, a handheld, noncontact near-infrared optical scanner (NIROS) was developed and used to measure temporal changes in hemoglobin concentrations in response to a breath-hold (BH) paradigm. Approach: Noncontact imaging studies were carried out on DFU subjects and control subjects in response to a 20-s BH paradigm. Continuous-wave-based multiwavelength diffused reflective signals were acquired to generate effective oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation concentration maps using modified Beer-Lambert's law. Pearson's correlation analysis was carried out to determine variations in oxygen flow from hemoglobin concentration maps and the extent of variation observed in controls versus DFU subjects. Results: Temporal changes in hemoglobin concentration maps were observed in controls and DFU subjects. However, the oxygen flow in response to BH varied within 10% in all controls but significantly varied between wound and background regions in subjects with DFUs. Innovation: A method to assess variations in oxygen supply in and around DFUs was demonstrated using NIROS. This approach has potential to better cater DFU treatment process. Conclusion: Changes in all hemoglobin parameters due to 20 s of BH was observed. Pearson's analysis indicates that oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation fluctuations are synchronous in controls. In DFUs, changes are asynchronous with blood flow between the wound region and background region being significantly different.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is an essential component of normal cutaneous wound repair, but is altered in pathogenic forms of wound healing, such as chronic wounds and fibrosis. We previously reported that endothelial expression of integrin α6β4 is developmentally regulated, with α6β4 expression correlating with tissue maturation and further showed that endothelial α6β4 is downregulated in explant angiogenesis assays. These data support the hypothesis that dynamic regulation of α6β4 may play an important role during new vessel formation in healing wounds.To test this hypothesis, we examined the endothelial expression of α6β4 using a murine model of cutaneous wound healing and in vitro cultures of primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs).Expression of α6β4 is downregulated during early stages of wound healing; angiogenic vessels in day 7 wounds do not express α6β4. Endothelial expression of α6β4 is resumed in day 14 wounds. Moreover, explanted HDMECs do not express α6β4, but expression is induced by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors.We provide in vivo data supporting a role for the dynamic regulation of α6β4 during vessel formation and remodeling during cutaneous wound repair and in vitro findings that suggest endothelial β4 expression is regulated transcriptionally, providing an important foundation for future studies to understand the transcriptional mechanisms involved in endothelial cell maturation during normal wound repair.Our data indicate that α6β4 is dynamically regulated during angiogenesis and vessel maturation and suggest that disruption of this regulation may contribute to defective angiogenesis associated with diabetic wounds or cutaneous fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The contemporary treatment of a full-thickness burn consists of early eschar excision followed by immediate closure of the open wound using autologous skin. However, most animal models study burn wound healing with the persistence of the burn eschar. Our goal is to characterize a murine model of burn eschar excision to study wound closure kinetics. Approach: C57BL/6 male mice were divided into three groups: contact burn, scald burn, or unburned control. Mice were burned at 80°C for 5, 10, or 20 s. After 2 days, the eschar was excised and wound closure was documented until postexcision day 13. Biopsies were examined for structural morphology and α-smooth muscle actin. In a subsequent interval-excision experiment (80°C scald for 10 s), the burn eschar was excised after 5 or 10 days postburn to determine the effect of a prolonged inflammatory focus. Results: Histology of both contact and scald burns revealed characteristics of a full-thickness injury marked by collagen coagulation and tissue necrosis. Excision at 2 days after a 20-s burn from either scald or contact showed significant delay in wound closure. Interval excision of the eschar, 5 or 10 days postburn, also showed significant delay in wound closure. Both interval-excision groups showed prolonged inflammation and increased myofibroblasts. Innovation and Conclusions: We have described the kinetics of wound closure in a murine model of a full-thickness burn excision. Both contact and scald full-thickness burn resulted in significantly delayed wound closure. In addition, prolonged interval-excision of the eschar appeared to increase and prolong inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fast and seamless healing is essential for both deep and chronic wounds to restore the skin and protect the body from harmful pathogens. Thus, finding new targets that can both expedite and enhance the repair process without altering the upstream signaling milieu and causing serious side effects can improve the way we treat wounds. Since cell migration is key during the different stages of wound healing, it presents an ideal process and intracellular structural machineries to target. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is rising as an important structural and functional regulator of wound healing. MTs have been reported to play different roles in the migration of the various cell types involved in wound healing. Specific microtubule regulatory proteins (MRPs) can be targeted to alter a section or subtype of the MT cytoskeleton and boost or hinder cell motility. However, inhibiting intracellular components can be challenging in vivo, especially using unstable molecules, such as small interfering RNA. Nanoparticles can be used to protect these unstable molecules and topically deliver them to the wound. Utilizing this approach, we recently showed that fidgetin-like 2, an uncharacterized MRP, can be targeted to enhance cell migration and wound healing. Future Directions: To harness the full potential of the current MRP therapeutic targets, studies should test them with different delivery platforms, dosages, and skin models. Screening for new MT effectors that boost cell migration in vivo would also help find new targets for skin repair.",

The key features of this noncontact investigation technique like its precise burn depth analysis and the approaches it follows to convert the probed data into a quantitative measure have also been discussed in this article.

Tool modality distinguishing between partial and full-thickness burn contributing toward correct medical care is indeed awaited.

Immediately after surgery, Stage 1 pressure injuries appeared on the left lateral heel and right lateral ankle, despite the absence of local pressure to these areas. Both lesions eventually resolved. Eight months later, a Doppler evaluation was performed of the patient's lower extremities, the peroneal artery and its tributaries were marked, and the intraoperative positioning was simulated to determine if a wedge at the back of the calf could have obstructed blood flow in these vessels. In this position, the feet naturally abducted so that the lateral calcaneal and posterior malleolar arteries became positioned immediately underneath the wedge. We propose a vascular mechanism of pressure injury development, postulating that some heel pressure injuries are not the result of localized pressure but rather angiosomal ischemia, based on the observation that the anatomical pattern of these lesions frequently follow the distribution of a named vessel. We hypothesize that in this case, intraoperative positioning along with permissive hypotension may have occluded arterial or venous flow to the relevant angiosomes, causing an ischemia reperfusion injury to the downstream tissues.",

However, there is no single source of information or consensus recommendations regarding CETE application. Future Directions: Prospective evidence on the efficacy and safety of CETE in clinical practice is required to communicate the best techniques and share important experiences.

    "abstract": "Significance: Rare bacterial taxa (taxa of low relative frequency) are numerous and ubiquitous in virtually any sample-including wound samples. In addition, even the high-frequency genera and species contain multiple strains. These strains, individually, are each only a small fraction of the total bacterial population. Against the view that wounds contain relatively few kinds of bacteria, this newly recognized diversity implies a relatively high rate of migration into the wound and the potential for diversification during infection. Understanding the biological and medical importance of these numerous taxa is an important new element of wound microbiology. Recent Advances: Only recently have these numerous strains been discovered; the technology to detect, identify, and characterize them is still in its infancy. Multiple strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have been found in a single wound. In the few cases studied, the distribution of the bacteria suggests microhabitats and biological interactions. Critical Issues: The distribution of the strains, their phenotypic diversity, and their interactions are still largely uncharacterized. The technologies to investigate this level of genomic detail are still developing and have not been largely deployed to investigate wounds. Future Directions: As advanced metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and advanced microscopy develop, the study of wound microbiology will better address the complex interplay of numerous individually rare strains with both the host and each other.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel treatment, intermittent electrical stimulation (IES), for preventing deep tissue injury (DTI) in different healthcare settings. Approach: Testing was conducted in an acute rehabilitation unit of a general hospital, a tertiary rehabilitation hospital, a long-term care facility, and homecare (HC). IES was delivered through surface electrodes placed either directly on the gluteal muscles or through mesh panels inside a specialized garment. Study participants at risk for DTI used the system for an average of 4 weeks. Outcome measures included skin reaction to long-term stimulation, demands on the caregiver, stability of induced muscle contraction, and acceptability as part of the users' daily routine. Results: A total of 48 study participants used the IES system. The system proved to be safe and feasible in all four clinical settings. No pressure ulcers were observed in any of the participants. There was no difference between the clinical settings in patient positioning, ease of finding optimal stimulation site, and patient acceptance. Although donning and doffing time was longer in the long-term care and HC settings than the acute rehabilitation unit and tertiary rehabilitation facility, time required to apply the IES system was <18 min (including data collection). The patients and caregivers did not find the application disruptive and indicated that the stimulation was acceptable as part of their daily routine in over 97% of the time. Innovation and Conclusion: We demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel method of IES to prevent DTI in a continuum of healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To design and validate a novel murine model of full-thickness (FT) vaginal wound healing that mirrors postinjury tissue repair and underscores the impact of estrogen signaling-driven healing kinetics, inflammation, and neovascularization. Approach: Five-week-old female CD1 mice were subjected to two 1-mm FT wounds. To assess wound healing kinetics, vaginas were harvested at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days postinjury. Wounds from all time points were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome to, respectively, assess the rate of wound closure and tissue deposition. Inflammatory leukocyte (CD45), neutrophil (Ly6G), and macrophage (F480 and CD206) infiltration was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the resulting anti-inflammatory M2 (CD206)/total (F480) macrophage ratio quantified. Neovascularization (CD31) and estrogen receptor-α (ERα) expression levels were similarly determined by IHC. Results: We observed rapid healing with resolution of mucosal integrity by 48 h (p < 0.05), and overall neutrophils and polarized type 2 macrophages (M2) apexed at 12 h and reduced to near control levels by day 7 postinjury. Tissue repair was virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding vagina. CD31+ vessels increased between 12 h and day 7 and ERα trended to decrease at 12 h postinjury and rebound at day 7 to uninjured levels. Innovation: A proof-of-concept murine model to study vaginal wound healing kinetics and postinjury regenerative repair in the vagina was developed and verified. Conclusion: We surmise that murine vaginal mucosal repair is accelerated and potentially regulated by estrogen signaling through the ERα, thus providing a cellular and molecular foundation to understand vaginal healing responses to injury.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health costs. Standard care (SC) associated with nonsurgical offloading is the mainstay treatment for DFUs, but it has high recurrence and infection rates. Metatarsal head resection (MHR) has been proposed as an effective surgical offloading technique for the treatment of plantar neuropathic DFUs, but with no evidence synthesis yet. Recent Advances: Based on PRISMA guidelines, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of MHR. Four electronic databases were searched for. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 477 patients (494 feet and 593 neuropathic forefoot ulcers). The studies included three retrospective comparative studies and eight case series. Critical Issues: Meta-analytical results of comparative studies on recent noninfected DFUs showed MHR having significantly better rates of healing, time to healing, ulcer recurrence, and infection than SC. Failure to heal, recurrence, and infection rates were 4 times higher in the SC group than in the MHR group, and the amputation rate was two times higher in the SC group than in the MHR group. The outcomes of the meta-analysis of case series on chronic and recalcitrant ulcers treated with MHR were similar. Future Directions: Considering the natural history of DFUs treated conservatively and the satisfactory outcomes with a significantly low complication rate of MHR, physicians should consider the use of MHR more often and include this technique in the early management of DFUs. Scope and Significance: DFU impose great public health burden around the globe. Standard of care using in-office debridement and topical agents is the usual mainstay of treatment. However, such conservative care is known to result in high rates of ulcer recurrence and complications. In this systematic review, we quantitatively investigate the outcomes of a surgical off-loading technique, the MHR in the treatment of chronic plantar neuropathic wounds. Translational Relevance: Many biochemical factors are implicated in the complex process of wound healing. In the case of diabetic neuropathic ulcers of the forefoot, additional mechanical factors induced by the presence of diabetic neuropathy lead to high pressure loads of the metatarsal heads on the plantar skin. With time, such chronic loads could favor ulcer formation. Removal of the causal mechanical factor could alleviate the pressure and allow wound healing. Clinical Relevance: Neuropathic plantar ulcers are difficult-to-heal wounds and chronicity is associated to frequent hospitalizations, higher rates of amputation, and mortality. Early removal of the indirect causal agent, the resection of the metatarsal head, after failure of a well-conducted conservative standard of care could be a needed solution for wound healing and consequently a potential for reducing complications and costs.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Pain affects wound healing, treatment, and quality of life because it has significant impacts on physical, psychological, and social well-being. Despite the fact that more than half of chronic venous leg ulcer (CVLU) patients experience mild-to-moderate pain, the multidimensional characteristics of CVLU pain are not well documented. The objective of this study was to describe the multidimensional pain characteristics, including the sensory, affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions, of CVLU before debridement. Approach: Participants (N = 40) were recruited from a wound clinic. We conducted a descriptive analysis of clinical data, including pain, wound, and demographic characteristics, collected at the first visit. Results: The mean age of participants was 70.8 ± 9.1 years, 22 (55%) participants were female, and 35 (87.5%) were white. Participants reported mean current pain intensity (2.9 ± 2.7), least (1.2 ± 2.2) and worst (4.8 ± 3.4) pain intensity in 24 h, and tolerable pain level (4.9 ± 2.64) on a 0-10 scale. They described pain as periodic (66.7%, n = 26) with multiple pain quality descriptors (5.4 ± 2.9). Their past pain treatments provided some pain relief (65%, n = 25). For 68% (n = 27), their pain was the same as they expected. Nearly all had a tendency not to tell others about their pain (95%, n = 38). Innovation: This study is the first to describe the multidimensional pain characteristics of patients with CVLU as measured with PAINReportIt. Conclusion: Patients with CVLU reported willingness to tolerate a relatively high level of pain and experience the level of pain they anticipate. Multidimensional pain assessment will assist clinicians to select individualized therapies to manage pain and improve quality of life for these patients.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Nonhealing wounds are a significant burden for the health care system all over the world. Existing treatment options are not enough to promote healing, highlighting the urgent need for improved therapies. In addition, the current advancements in tissue-engineered skin constructs and stem cell-based therapies are facing significant hurdles due to the absence of a renewable source of functional cells. Recent Advances: Induced pluripotent stem cell technology (iPSC) is emerging as a novel tool to develop the next generation of personalized medicine for the treatment of chronic wounds. The iPSC provides unlimited access to various skin cells to generate complex personalized three-dimensional skin constructs for disease modeling and autologous grafts. Furthermore, the iPSC-based therapies can target distinct wound healing phases and have shown accelerating wound closure by enhancing angiogenesis, cell migration, tissue regeneration, and modulating inflammation. Critical Issues: Since the last decade, iPSC has been revolutionizing the field of wound healing and skin tissue engineering. Despite the current progress, safety and heterogeneity among iPSC lines are still major hurdles in addition to the lack of large animal studies. These challenges need to be addressed before translating an iPSC-based therapy to the clinic. Future Directions: Future considerations should be given to performing large animal studies to check the safety and efficiency of iPSC-based therapy in a wound healing setup. Furthermore, strategies should be developed to overcome variation between hiPSC lines, develop an efficient manufacturing process for iPSC-derived products, and generate complex skin constructs with vasculature and skin appendages.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Tendon injury possesses a high morbidity rate and is difficult to achieve a satisfying prognosis with currently available treatment strategies. Current approaches used for tendon healing always lead to the formation of fibrovascular scar tissue, which significantly compromises the biomechanics of the healed tendon. Moreover, the related functional deficiency deteriorates over time with an increased injury recurrence risk. Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) link and interact with collagen fibrils to regulate tendon structure and biomechanics, which can provide a new and promising method in the field of tendon injury management. Recent Advances: The effect of SLRPs on tendon development has been extensively investigated. SLRP deficiency impairs tendon collagen fibril structure and biomechanic properties, while administration of SLRPs generally benefits tendon wound healing and regains better mechanical properties. Critical Issues: Current knowledge on the role of SLRPs in tendon development and regeneration mostly comes from uninjured knockout mice, and mainly focuses on the morphology description of collagen fibril profile and mechanical properties. Little is known about the regulatory mechanism on the molecular level. Future Directions: This article reviews the current knowledge in this highly translational topic and provides an evidence-based conclusion, thereby encouraging in-depth investigations of SLRPs in tendons and the development of SLRP-based treatments for desired tendon healing.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PDRN administration in preventing postoperative scars. Approach: In this randomized controlled trial (NCT05149118), 44 patients who underwent open thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to the PDRN treatment or untreated control group. Only patients in the treatment group received two consecutive injections of PDRN 1 and 2 days after surgery. The modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS), patients' subjective symptoms, erythema index (EI), melanin index (MI), and scar height were assessed 3 months after surgery. Results: Patients in the treatment group had lower mVSS scores (1.619 ± 1.244 vs. 2.500 ± 1.540, respectively; p = 0.059) and a significantly lower vascularity subscore (0.476 ± 0.512 vs. 0.900 ± 0.447, respectively; p = 0.010) than those in the control group at the 3-month follow-up. Compared with the control group, the level of subjective symptoms, EI, and scar height were all significantly lowered in the PDRN injection group. No specific side effects related to PDRN injection were observed. Innovation: This is the first clinical study that demonstrated that PDRN injections rapidly decreased postsurgical wound erythema and as a result, significantly reduced both excessive scar formation and accompanying symptoms. Conclusion: Early postoperative injection of PDRN is an effective and safe treatment to prevent hypertrophic scars and improve scar outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Randomized controlled trials using complete healing as an endpoint suffer from poor statistical power, owing to the heterogeneity of wounds and their healing trajectories. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently consulted with expert groups to consider percentage area reduction (PAR) of the wound over a 4-week period as a valid intermediate endpoint, creating the opportunity for more powerful study designs. Methods: A within-subject controlled study design comparing the PAR of venous leg ulcers (VLU) in patients over 4 weeks receiving different interventions. Twenty-nine patients received multilayer compression over 4 weeks, followed by neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) of the leg muscle pump in addition to compression for a further 4 weeks. Paired comparison was then made of PAR between the two phases. A second cohort of 22 patients received only multilayer compression throughout both 4-week phases. Results: Patients randomized to NMES saw a significant increase in healing rate compared with compression alone, whereas patients receiving compression only saw no significant change in healing rate throughout the course of the study. Conclusions: Intermittent NMES of the common peroneal nerve significantly accelerates the healing of VLU. It is well tolerated by patients and deserves serious consideration as an adjuvant to compression therapy. PAR is a useful metric for comparing the performance of wound healing interventions, and the self-controlled trial design allows sensitive discrimination with a relatively small number of subjects over a reasonably short trial period. The study is reported according to the CONSORT reporting guidelines. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03396731 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Approach: The serum specimens that were evaluated in this study were obtained from DM patients with DFU who participated in a prospective study and were seen biweekly until they healed their ulcer or the exit visit at 12 weeks. The group was divided into Healers (who healed their DFU during the study) and Non-Healers. Results: Interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 and interferon-gamma were higher in the Healers while Fractalkine, IL-8, and TNFα were higher in the Non-Healers. The trajectory of IL-10 levels remained stable over time within and across groups, resulting in a strong prognostic ability for the prospective DFU healing course. Classification and Regression Tree analysis created an 11-node decision tree with healing status as the categorical response. Innovation: Consecutive measurements of proteins associated with wound healing can identify biomarkers that can predict DFU healing over a 12-week period. IL-10 was the strongest candidate for prediction. Conclusion: Measurement of serum proteins can serve as a successful strategy in guiding clinical management of DFU. The data also indicate likely superior performance of building a multiprotein biomarker score instead of relying on single biomarkers.",

Care pathways that standardize procedures promote adherence to best practices, reduce variability in treatment, and encourage collaboration among health care teams. This approach ultimately improves patient outcomes, enhances safety, and boosts the overall effectiveness of health care services. However, despite these benefits being widespread across most of the U.S. health care system, wound care stands out as an area where standards can vary significantly. The inconsistency in wound care standards in the United States can be traced to several factors. These include limited structured clinical wound care education, the discretion of health care providers in different business environments, differences in wound care settings, varying access to advanced treatments and technology, patient demographics and socioeconomic status, as well as differences in state laws and regional or institutional practices. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the complex interplay of the abovementioned factors. Active measures are needed to improve access, equity, and the quality of wound care services for all patients, regardless of where they live, their socioeconomic status, their health care coverage, or the business interests of providers and their institutions as well as of vendors marketing wound care products inconsistent with evidence-based practice. By understanding and actively addressing these factors, we can work toward achieving more standardized, evidence-based, and patient-centered practices in wound care across the nation.",

This approach has limitations including limited availability of human cadaver skin, the risk of disease transmission from cadaveric grafts, and inconsistent cadaver allograft quality.Near-diploid neonatal human keratinocyte cell line (NIKS)-based human skin tissue is a full-thickness, living human skin substitute composed of a dermal analog containing normal human dermal fibroblasts and a fully-stratified, biologically and metabolically active epidermis generated from NIKS keratinocytes, a consistent and unlimited source of pathogen-free human epidermal progenitor cells.NIKS-based human skin tissue is a living bioengineered skin substitute (BSS) intended to provide immediate wound coverage and promote wound healing through sustained expression by living cells of wound healing factors.A phase I/IIa clinical trial found that NIKS-based BSS was well tolerated and comparable to cadaver allograft in the ability to prepare full-thickness complex skin defects prior to autografting. There were no deaths and no adverse events (AE) associated with this BSS. Exposure of the study subjects to the skin substitute tissue did not elicit detectable immune responses. Notably, this tissue remained viable and adherent in the wound bed for at least 7 days.",

The Problem: Presently, however, wound healing education is only included to a minor degree, in the education of nurses and medical doctors, and there is no consensus in Europe on the minimum education program needed to be an educated expert in handling wound patients. Clinical Care Relevance: In this article, educational initiatives and models for education of medical doctors and nurses in Europe and especially in Denmark are described. Conclusion: The goal for the future should be to achieve a general consensus on the minimal education program, and in Europe this could be achieved as a collaboration between the Educational program of European Wound Management Association (EWMA and national programs).",

    "abstract": "Laser plays an increasingly prominent role in skin rejuvenation. The advent of fractional photothermolysis revolutionizes its application. Microcolumns of skin are focally injured, leaving intervening normal skin to facilitate rapid wound healing and orderly tissue remodeling.Even with the popularity of fractional laser devices, we still have limited knowledge about the ideal treatment parameters and postlaser wound care.Many clinicians believe that higher microbream energy in fractional laser devices results in better clinical outcome. Two recent studies argue against this assumption. One article demonstrates that lower fluence can induce comparable molecular changes with fewer side effects. Another study corroborates this by showing that lower-density settings produce similar clinical outcome in scar remodeling as higher-density ones, but with fewer side effects. To shed light on the optimal post-treatment wound care regimen from fractional ablative resurfacing, another paper shows that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can reduce transepidermal water loss and skin color changes within 1 month after treatment.For fractional nonablative resurfacing, lower settings in fluence or density may produce similar dermal remodeling as higher settings and with a better side-effect profile. Moreover, autologous PRP appears to expedite wound healing after fractional ablative resurfacing.Lower microbeam energy in fractional laser resurfacing produces similar molecular changes and clinical outcome with fewer side effects. The findings might portend a shift in the paradigm of treatment parameters. Autologous PRP can facilitate better wound healing, albeit modestly. Long-term follow-ups and larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Significance: A wide range of cell types can migrate in response to physiological or externally applied direct current electric field (dcEF), a process termed electrotaxis. In particular, electrotaxis of epithelial cells to wound-generated dcEF for mediating wound healing is a well-accepted mechanism. In addition, various immune cells have been demonstrated to undergo electrotaxis, suggesting a link between electrotaxis and inflammatory responses in wound healing. Electrotaxis research will generate important insight into the electrical guiding mechanism for cell migration thereby providing the scientific basis to further develop clinical applications for wound care. Development of advanced electrotaxis assays will critically enable in-depth experimental electrotaxis studies in vitro. Recent Advances: Recently, a number of new electrotaxis assays or new uses of previously developed assays for electrotaxis studies have been reported. These new developments provide improved solutions for experimental throughput, configuration of three-dimensional cell migration environments and coexisting guiding signals, measurements of collective electrotactic cell migration, and sorting electrotactic populations. Critical Issues: These new developments face the challenge of playing a more important role to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying electrotaxis, in addition to making a stronger impact on relevant applications. Future Directions: On one hand, specific electrotaxis assays should be further developed to improve its function and tested for a broader range of experimental conditions and electrotactic populations. On the other hand, joint efforts among electrotaxis researchers are needed to integrate the unique features of specific electrotaxis assays, allowing more advanced and efficient electrotaxis analyses to answer both basic science and clinical questions.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus is essential for protein processing, sorting, and transport. Processing includes carbohydrate modifications and proteolytic cleavage, and transport can involve secretion from the cell or relocation to a specific cellular compartment. Rapid and synchronized reorientation of the Golgi in migrating cells is thought to facilitate polarized secretion, providing membrane and secreted products to the proximal plasma membrane. This function is a fundamental process in cell motility. Whether the Golgi structure and positioning is functionally required for directed secretion and polarity in cell migration responses, such as wound healing, is yet to be elucidated.: Exciting recent analysis examined the effects of perturbed Golgi positioning without disruption of microtubular or actin cytoskeleton assembly or protein secretion, in the context of cellular polarity and directional migration in wound repair. This was achieved by Yadav et al. (2009) through depletion of Golgin-160 or GMAP210 (Golgi microtubule associated protein of 210 kDa), which resulted in fragmentation and dispersal of Golgi without altering secretion kinetics. As a consequence, the direction of secretion, cell polarization, and cell migration in response to wounding were severely impaired. Thus, in response to a scratch wound, cell polarity requires peri-centrosomal positioning of the Golgi apparatus, implying that after initiation by a polarity cue there is a dependence on the Golgi's directed secretion to maintain the polarized state that facilitates cell migration.Golgi peri-centrosomal positioning can now be included among the growing list of cellular processes and signaling pathways that are critical for establishment of cellular polarity in response to external stimuli-a key feature of wound repair.A complete understanding of the function of Golgi components in motility merits attractive avenues for future investigations that will ultimately bring regulators of Golgi into the clinic whereby treatment of skin-related disorders will greatly benefit.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency can lead to recalcitrant leg ulcers. Compression has been shown to be effective in healing these ulcers, but most products are difficult to apply and uncomfortable for patients, leading to inconsistent/ineffective clinical application and poor compliance. In addition, compression presents risks for patients with an ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) <0.8 because of the possibility of further compromising the arterial circulation. The ABPI is the ratio of systolic leg blood pressure (taken at ankle) to systolic arm blood pressure (taken above elbow, at brachial artery). This is measured to assess a patient's lower extremity arterial perfusion before initiating compression therapy.1.Using materials science, two-layer compression systems with controlled compression and a low profile were developed. These materials allow for a more consistent bandage application with better control of the applied compression, and their low profile is compatible with most footwear, increasing patient acceptance and compliance with therapy. The original 3M™ Coban™ 2 Layer Compression System is suited for patients with an ABPI ≥0.8; 3M™ Coban™ 2 Layer Lite Compression System can be used on patients with ABPI ≥0.5.Both compression systems are composed of two layers that combine to create an inelastic sleeve conforming to the limb contour to provide a consistent proper pressure profile to reduce edema. In addition, they slip significantly less than other compression products and improve patient daily living activities and physical symptoms.Both compression systems are indicated for patients with venous leg ulcers, lymphedema, and other conditions where compression therapy is appropriate.As with any compression system, caution must be used when mixed venous and arterial disease is present to not induce any damage. These products are not indicated when the ABPI is <0.5.",

Even though lymphangiogenesis is a part of the regeneration process, the significance of the controlled restoration of lymphatic vessels has only recently been recognized. Recent Advances: Identification of lymphatic markers and growth factors paved the way for the exploration of the roles of lymphatic vessels in health and disease. Emerging pro-lymphangiogenic therapies use vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C to combat fluid retention disorders such as lymphedema and to enhance the local healing process. Critical Issues: The relevance of recently identified lymphatic functions awaits verification by their association with pathologic conditions. Further, despite a century of research, the complete etiology of secondary lymphedema, a fluid retention disorder directly linked to the lymphatic function, is not understood. Finally, the specificity of pro-lymphangiogenic therapy depends on VEGF-C transfection efficiency, dose exposure, and the age of the subject, factors that are difficult to standardize in a heterogeneous human population. Future Directions: Further research should reveal the role of lymphatic circulation in internal organs and connect its impairment with human diseases. Pro-lymphangiogenic therapies that aim at the acceleration of tissue healing should focus on the controlled administration of VEGF-C to increase their capillary specificity, whereas regeneration of collecting vessels might benefit from balanced maturation and differentiation of pre-existing lymphatics. Unique features of pre-nodal lymphatics, fault tolerance and functional hyperplasia of capillaries, may find applications outreaching traditional pro-lymphangiogenic therapies, such as immunomodulation or enhancement of subcutaneous grafting.",

Approach: One hundred two subjects with qualifying DFUs were randomized to daily treatment with either CCO or a silver-containing product for 6 weeks followed by a 4 -week follow-up period. The primary outcome was the mean percent reduction in DFU area. A secondary outcome was the incidence of ulcer infections between groups. Results: At the end of treatment, the mean percent reduction in area from baseline of DFUs treated with CCO was 62% (p < 0.0001) and with silver was 40% (p < 0.0001). The difference between groups-22%-was not statistically significant (p = 0.071). Among ulcers closed by the end of treatment, the mean time to closure was 31.1 ± 9.0 days versus 37.1 ± 7.7 days, respectively (not statistically significant). There was a numerically greater incidence of target ulcer infections in the silver group (11, 21.6%) than in the CCO group (5, 9.8%; p = 0.208). No clinically relevant safety signals were identified in either group. Innovation: CCO treatment can progress a wound toward closure. Ulcer infection prophylaxis may not be sacrificed when treating DFU with CCO in lieu of silver-containing products. Conclusion: Both CCO and silver-containing products promote significant reduction in DFU area over 6 weeks of treatment with no clinically relevant safety concerns. Mean percent reduction in lesion area was numerically (22%) but not significantly greater with CCO compared to silver, as was time to ulcer closure, with an incidence of ulcer infection at least as low as for silver-containing products.",

Distant flaps require lengthy time to detach causing patient discomfort. Human α1-antitrypsin (hAAT) is a clinically available serum glycoprotein. hAAT was shown to support mature vessel formation and enhance tissue survival following ischemia-reperfusion injuries. The purpose of the presented study was to examine the effect of hAAT on skin flap survival and distant \"tube\" flap perfusion through its recipient site. Approach: Random-pattern skin flaps were performed on mice treated with clinical-grade hAAT using three unique routes of administration (transgenic, i.p. and s.c. infiltration); necrotic area and tissue perfusion were assessed. Blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were used to explore aspects of mechanism of action. A distant tube flap model was performed to examine time to perfusion. Results: hAAT-treated mice displayed approximately two-fold smaller necrotic flap areas versus controls across all hAAT administration routes. Flaps displayed greater perfusion as early as 3 days postsurgery (64.6% ± 4.0% vs. 43.7% ± 1.7% in controls; p = 0.007). hAAT-mediated flap survival was prominently NOS dependent, but only partially VEGF dependent. Finally, distant flaps treated with hAAT displayed significantly earlier perfusion versus controls (mean 9.6 ± 1.6 vs. 13.1 ± 1.0 days; p = 0.0005). Innovation: The established safety record of hAAT renders it an attractive candidate toward improving skin flap surgery outcomes, particularly during VEGF blockade. Conclusions: hAAT treatment enhances survival and accelerates perfusion of skin flaps in animal models in a NOS-dependent manner, partially circumventing VEGF blockade. Further mechanistic studies are required.",

We accomplished this by preparing a viscoelastic hydrogel using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified platelet-free plasma (PEGylated PFP) combined with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Approach: PEGylated PFP hydrogels were prepared by polymerizing the liquid mixture of PEG and PFP±ASCs and gelled either by adding calcium chloride (CaCl2) or thrombin. Rheological and in vitro studies were performed to assess viscoelasticity and the ability of hydrogels to direct ASCs toward a vasculogenic phenotype, respectively. Finally, a pilot study evaluated the efficacy of hydrogels±ASCs using an athymic rat full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Hydrogels prepared within the range of 11 to 27 mM for CaCl2 or 5 to 12.5 U/mL for thrombin exhibited a storage modulus of ∼62 to 87 Pa and ∼47 to 92 Pa, respectively. The PEGylated PFP hydrogels directed ASCs to form network-like structures resembling vasculature, with a fourfold increase in perivascular specific genes that were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining. Hydrogels combined with ASCs exhibited an increase in blood vessel density when applied to excisional rat wounds compared with those treated with hydrogels (110.3 vs. 95.6 BV/mm2; p < 0.05). Furthermore, ASCs were identified in the perivascular region associated with newly forming blood vessels. Innovation: This study demonstrates that PFP modified with PEG along with ASCs can be used to prepare cost-effective stable hydrogels, at the bed-side, to treat extensive skin wounds.

Approach: A rat AV loop model was used for tissue engineering of vascularized soft-tissue flaps. NHC or collagen-elastin (CE) scaffolds were implanted into isolation chambers together with an AV loop and explanted after 15 days. Saphenous veins were implanted into the scaffolds as controls. Neoangiogenesis, ultrastructure, and protein expression of SYNJ2BP, EPHA2, and FOXC1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and compared between the groups. Rheological properties were compared between the two scaffolds and native human adipose tissue. Results: A functional neovascularization was evident in NHC flaps with its amount being comparable with CE flaps. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a strong mononuclear cell infiltration along the nanofibers in NHC flaps and a trend toward higher fiber alignment compared with CE flaps. SYNJ2BP and EPHA2 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) was lower in NHC flaps compared with CE flaps, whereas FOXC1 expression was increased in NHC flaps.

During the remodeling stage of wound healing, collagen deposition is the most important event. The collagen deposition process may be altered by nutritional deficiency, diabetes mellitus, microbial infection, or radiation exposure, leading to impaired healing. This study describes the fabrication of an engineered bilayer skin substitute and evaluates its effectiveness for the production of collagen bundles in an impaired healing model. Approach: Rats were exposed to 10 Gy of radiation. Two months postirradiation, the wounds were excised and treated with one of three skin replacement products: bilayer engineered skin substitutes, chitosan skin templates, or duoderm©. The collagen deposition was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: On day 21 postwound, the irradiated wounds displayed increased collagen bundle deposition after treatment using bilayer engineered skin substitutes (3.4±0.25) and chitosan skin templates (3.2±0.58) compared with duoderm (2.0±0.63). Innovation: We provide the first report on the fabrication of bilayer engineered skin substitutes using high density human dermal fibroblasts cocultured with HFSCs on chitosan skin templates.

Approach: Female mice were implanted with a 17β-estradiol (E2) secreting pellet or placebo before receiving a full-thickness dermal excisional wound. Mice receiving the E2 pellet attained hormone levels that are comparable to those achieved during pregnancy. At 1, 3, and 5 days after injury, the dermal excision wound was examined for their histologic appearance, rate of closure, and chemokine levels. Results: Wound closure, assessed by percent reepithelialization, was slower in E2-treated mice relative to placebo (42.6%±6.6% vs. 70.0%±5.3%, respectively, 3 days after injury). In addition, there was a marked reduction in the subepithelial inflammatory infiltrate and granulation tissue in E2-treated mice relative to placebo. Wound levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were increased by 3 days after injury and continued to rise at 5 days after injury in placebo-treated mice (p<0.01). By contrast, MCP-1 levels were significantly reduced at 3 and 5 days after injury in E2-treated mice relative to placebo-treated controls (p<0.01). This attenuation could be reversed by treatment with an estrogen receptor antagonist. Innovation: High levels of estrogen are able to suppress normal wound closure. Conclusion: Dermal wound healing can be altered by manipulating the gonadal steroid hormone levels. In particular, high levels of estrogen can be utilized to slow down the rate of wound healing through a reduction in the inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "It was once common practice in the treatment of breast cancer for total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection to be conventionally performed. However, breast-conserving surgery is increasingly being performed with marked improvement in a multidisciplinary treatment approach, including surgery, chemotherapy, irradiation, and antihormonal therapy. We must choose the optimal reconstructive methods with the reduction of the excision range. Furthermore, we also consider the local chronic radiation injury after adjuvant radiotherapy on breast reconstruction. As for breast reconstruction, the use of autologous tissues or artificial prostheses is common. However, after radiotherapy or if radiotherapy is planned, the complications such as infection, skin necrosis, or exposure of the implant are increased in breast reconstruction with implants. Therefore, the breast is reconstructed with autologous tissue mainly with radiotherapy using an autologous flap transfer. Meanwhile, the autologous fat transfer with adipose-derived regenerative cells for repair and regeneration has recently been investigated in reconstructive surgery. We discuss the autologous flap and fat transfer for breast reconstruction.",

Approach: Patients with VLUs from 13 centers participated in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Each subject was randomly assigned to treatment with either MP NPWT or EP NPWT and evaluated for 16 weeks or complete wound closure. Results: Forty patients (n=19 MP NPWT and n=21 EP NPWT) completed the study. Primary endpoint analysis of wound size reduction found wounds in the MP NPWT group had significantly greater wound size reduction than those in the EP NPWT group at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks (p-value=0.0039, 0.0086, 0.0002, and 0.0005, respectively). Kaplan–Meier analyses showed greater acceleration in complete wound closure in the MP NPWT group. At 30 days, 50% wound closure was achieved in 52.6% (10/19) of patients treated with MP NPWT and 23.8% (5/21) of patients treated with EP NPWT. At 90 days, complete wound closure was achieved in 57.9% (11/19) of patients treated with MP NPWT and 38.15% (8/21) of patients treated with EP NPWT. Innovation: These data support the use of MP-NPWT for the treatment of VLUs. Conclusions: In this group of venous ulcers, wounds treated with MP NPWT demonstrated greater improvement and a higher likelihood of complete wound closure than those treated with EP NPWT.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In diabetes, hyperglycemia causes the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through binding the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Because exogenous growth factors have had little success in enhancing chronic wound healing, we investigated whether hyperglycemia-induced AGEs interfere with cellular responses to extracellular signals. We used stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), an angiogenic chemokine also known to promote stem cell recruitment in skin wounds. Approach: Human leukemia-60 (HL-60) cells and mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which express the SDF-1 receptor CXCR-4, were incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with 25 mM d-glucose. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) was used to block RAGE activation. Response to SDF-1 was measured in cellular migration and ROS assays. A diabetic murine excisional wound model measured SDF-1 liposome and sRAGE activity in vivo. Results: Hyperglycemia led to significant accumulation of AGEs, decreased SDF-1-directed migration, and elevated baseline ROS levels; it suppressed the ROS spike normally triggered by SDF-1. sRAGE decreased the ROS baseline and restored both the SDF-1-mediated spike and cell migration. Topically applied sRAGE alone promoted healing and enhanced the effect of exogenous SDF-1 on diabetic murine wounds. Innovation: While there is interest in using growth factors to improve wound healing, this strategy is largely ineffective in diabetic wounds. We show that sRAGE may restore signaling, thus potentiating the effect of exogenously applied growth factors. Conclusion: Blocking RAGE with sRAGE restores SDF-1-mediated cellular responses in hyperglycemic environments and may potentiate the effectiveness of SDF-1 applied in vivo.",

We aimed at establishing an equine wound model with bacterial aggregates to investigate the impact of bacterial inoculation on normal (thorax) and impaired (limb) wound healing. Approach: Wounds were created on three limbs and both thorax sides of six horses. Twelve out of 20 wounds per horse were inoculated with 104Staphylococcus aureus and 105Pseudomonas aeruginosa on day 4. Healing was monitored until day 27 by clinical assessment, including wound scoring, surface pH measurements, and digital photography for area determination. Biopsies were used for bacterial culture and for peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect bacterial aggregates. Results: Inoculated limb wounds healed slower than noninoculated limb wounds from day 10 onward (p < 0.0001). Inoculated and noninoculated thorax wounds healed equally well and faster than limb wounds. The odds ratio of detecting bacterial aggregates in inoculated limb wounds was 7.1 (2.4–21.0, p = 0.0086) compared with noninoculated limb wounds and 36.2 (3.8–348, p = 0.0018) compared with thorax wounds. Innovation: This equine wound model with bacterial aggregates might be superior to other animal wound models, as both normal and impaired healing can be studied simultaneously. In this model, many aspects of wound healing, including novel treatments, may be studied. Conclusions: The impaired healing observed in inoculated limb wounds may be related to the persistent bacterial aggregates. Both in capability of clearing inoculated bacteria from the wounds and in healing pattern, thorax wounds were superior to limb wounds.",

Approach: The trial will comprise 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with neuroischemic DFUs who will be randomized into two groups: (1) a control group in which standard-of-care (SOC) will be used to treat the DFUs, and (2) a test group in which SOC and RMD-G1 will be used to treat the DFUs. On day 0, all participants will be randomized to receive either RMD-G1 and SOC treatment or SOC alone. The primary endpoint of the study is complete closure of the DFU within the 12-week study period following daily treatments and dressing changes. Results: Interim results reveal that those DFUs which were treated with RMD-G1 responded positively: there was a significant reduction in the wound areas. In contrast, the condition of those DFUs which were treated with only SOC deteriorated. Innovation: To date, no topical therapies with proven efficacy for treating DFUs exist. Topical application of EPO-based RMD-G1 in conjunction with SOC to a DFU accelerates their healing and closure. Conclusions: The interim results of this trial indicate that topical RMD-G1 is a safe adjunctive therapy to SOC, which accelerates the closure of a DFU. RMD-G1 is safe pharmaceutical because EPO has a proven safety profile.",

This research aimed at fabricating the nanofiber-reinforced aerogels and evaluating their physiochemical and biological properties. Approach: The chitosan (CS) aerogels incorporated with cellulose acetate (CA) and poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers were fabricated via ball milling and freeze-drying techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), compressive experiment, and in vitro experiment were conducted to assess their physiochemical properties and biological behavior. Results: The SEM examination showed that satisfying morphology was attained in the CA/PCL/CS aerogels with incorporation of CA/PCL nanofibers and CS solution. The results of FT-IR and XPS indicated the perfect incorporation of CA, PCL, and CS. A compressive experiment confirmed that the CA/PCL/CS aerogels enhanced the compressive modulus of the pure CS aerogel. For in vitro experiment, the CA/PCL/CS composite scaffolds were proven to possess better cytocompatibility compared with the pure CS. Also, cells on the CA/PCL/CS showed well-extended morphology and could infiltrate into a porous scaffold. Furthermore, confocal experiment revealed that the CA/PCL/CS could also promote the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Innovation: This study fabricated the nanofiber-reinforced aerogels mainly to optimize the cell/material interaction of the pure CS scaffold. Conclusion: The CA/PCL nanofibers not only improved the mechanical property of the CS aerogel to some extent but also facilitated cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Thus, it could be considered a promising candidate for bone tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Impaired dermal wound healing represents a major medical issue in today's aging populations. Granulation tissue formation in the dermis and reepithelization of the epidermis are both important and necessary for proper wound healing. Although a number of artificial dermal grafts have been used to treat full-thickness dermal loss in humans, they do not induce reepithelization of the wound, requiring subsequent epithelial transplantation. In the present study, we sought a novel biomaterial that accelerates the wound healing process. Approach: We prepared a composite biomaterial made of jellyfish and porcine collagens and developed a hybrid-type dermal graft that composed of the upper layer film and the lower layer sponge made of this composite biomaterial. Its effect on dermal wound healing was examined using a full-thickness excisional wound model. Structural properties of the dermal graft and histological features of the regenerating skin tissue were characterized by electron microscopic observation and immunohistological examination, respectively. Results: The composite biomaterial film stimulated migration of keratinocytes, leading to prompt reepithelization. The regenerating epithelium consisted of two distinct cell populations: keratin 5-positive basal keratinocytes and more differentiated cells expressing tight junction proteins such as claudin-1 and occludin. At the same time, the sponge made of the composite biomaterial possessed a significantly enlarged intrinsic space and enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, accelerating granulation tissue formation. Innovation: This newly developed composite biomaterial may serve as a dermal graft that accelerates wound healing in various pathological conditions. Conclusion: We have developed a novel dermal graft composed of jellyfish and porcine collagens that remarkably accelerates the wound healing process.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Keloid is an abnormal scar that often develops in high-tension skin. It is caused by excessive fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA) is an important motor protein that regulates the mechanical transduction of cells. However, the role of NM-IIA in keloid pathogenesis remains unclear. Approach: NM-IIA expression was examined and compared in keloid skin and normal skin by immunofluorescence. The organization of smooth muscle actin (SMA)-mediated stress fibers in normal and keloid fibroblasts (NFs and KFs, respectively) were determined. Cell proliferation and cell contractility were measured in fibroblasts derived from normal and keloids. The NM-II pharmacological inhibitor (blebbistatin) and RNA interference were applied to block NM-IIA and investigate its regulatory role in SMA-mediated stress fibers, cell contractility, and cell proliferation after NM-IIA inhibition. Results: NM-IIA expression is increased in keloid tissue. Inhibition of NM-II by blebbistatin or targeting NM-IIA by RNA interference reduced transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-mediated SMA-mediated stress fiber formation, cell proliferation, and cell contractility of NFs and KFs. Although TGF-β failed to mediate phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC, the activator of NM-II), pMLC can interact with SMA-mediated stress fiber. Finally, inhibition of NM-II by blebbistatin also reduced NF and KF proliferation after TGF-β stimulation. Innovation: NM-IIA synergizes with TGF-β to regulate fibroblast proliferation, contraction activity, and myofibroblasts differentiation. Conclusion: NM-IIA might be one of the therapeutic targets in keloids.",

Recent Advances: With the recent and evolving technological advancements in prostheses, there are numerous devices available to individuals with lower limb loss. Current literature demonstrates the importance of expanding the knowledge of all prosthetic device-specific factors and the significance of proper prescription, fit, and alignment, along with adequate device-/activity-specific training, to enhance human–device interaction, reduce gait abnormalities and compensatory motions, and as a result, mitigate risk for secondary musculoskeletal conditions. Critical Issues: Inadequate device prescription, fit, alignment, and training are evident owing to the lack of knowledge or awareness of the many device-specific properties and factors, leading to suboptimal use, as well as, biomechanical compensations, which collectively and adversely affect the function, activity level, and overall health of the prosthesis user. Future Directions: To maximize optimal outcomes after lower limb loss, it is essential to better appreciate the factors that affect both prosthesis use and satisfaction, particularly any modifiable factors that might be targeted in rehabilitation interventions such as device prescription, fit/alignment, and training regimes. A better understanding of such device-specific factors will help enhance the human–device interaction and resulting functional performance, thereby reducing secondary musculoskeletal conditions, allowing for the readiness of the fighting force (return-to-duty/redeployment) and/or improved reintegration into civilian society/work, and overall enhancing quality of life after lower limb loss.",

    "abstract": "Background: A large volume of service members have sustained complex injuries during Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF). These injuries are complicated by contamination with particulate and foreign materials, have high rates of bacterial and/or fungal infections, are often composite-type defects with massive soft tissue wounds, and usually have multisystem involvement. While traditional treatment modalities remain a mainstay for optimal wound care, traditional reconstruction approaches alone may be inadequate to fully address the scope and magnitude of such massive complex wounds. As a result of these difficult clinical problems, the use of regenerative medicine therapies, such as autologous adipose tissue grafting, stem cell therapies, nerve allografts, and dermal regenerate templates/extracellular matrix scaffolds, is increased as adjuncts to traditional reconstructive measures. Basic and Clinical Science Advances: The beneficial applications of regenerative medicine therapies have been well characterized in both in vitro studies and in vivo animal studies. The use of these regenerative medicine techniques in the treatment of combat casualty injuries has been increasing throughout the recent war conflicts. Clinical Care Relevance: Military medicine has shown positive results when utilizing certain regenerative medicine modalities in treating complex war wounds. As a result, multi-institution clinical trials are underway to further evaluate these observations and reconstruction measures. Conclusion: Successful combat casualty wound care often requires a combination of traditional aspects of the reconstructive ladder/elevator with adoption of various regenerative medicine therapies. Due to the recent OIF/OEF conflicts, a high volume of combat casualties have benefited from adoption of regenerative medicine therapies and increased access to innovative clinical trials. Furthermore, many of these patients have had long-term follow-up to report on clinical outcomes that substantiate current treatment paradigms and concepts within regenerative medicine, reconstructive, and rehabilitation care. These results are applicable to not only combat casualty care but also to nonmilitary patients.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Fibrosis-related events play a part in the pathogenesis or failure of treatment of virtually all the blinding diseases around the world, and also account for over 40% of all deaths. It is well established that the eye and other tissues of some group of patients, for example Afro-Caribbean people, scar worse than others. However, there is a current lack of reliable biomarkers to stratify the risk of scarring and postsurgical fibrosis in the eye. Recent Advances: Recent studies using genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, clinical phenotyping, and high-resolution in vivo imaging techniques have revealed potential novel biomarkers to identify and stratify patients at risk of scarring in different fibrotic eye diseases. Critical Issues: Most of the studies, to date, have been done in animals or small cohorts of patients and future research is needed to validate these results in large longitudinal human studies. Detailed clinical phenotyping and effective biobanking of patient tissues will also be critical for future biomarker research in ocular fibrosis. Future Directions: The ability to predict the risk of scarring and to tailor the antifibrotic treatment regimen to each individual patient will be an extremely useful tool clinically to prevent undertreating, or exposing patients to unnecessary treatments with potential side effects. An exciting future prospect will be to use new advances in genotyping, namely next-generation whole genome sequencing like RNA-Seq, to develop a customized gene chip in ocular fibrosis. Successful translation of future biomarkers to benefit patient care will also ultimately require a strong collaboration between academics, pharmaceutical, and biotech companies.",

Furthermore, we wished to evaluate the practicality of the innovation and end-user acceptability. Approach: Twenty immobile subjects, age ranging from 19 to 86 years old with a Braden Scale score ranging from 9 to 16 (very high to moderate risk of developing pressure ulcers), were enrolled. Intermittent 35 Hz electrical stimulation was administered through surface electrodes to the gluteal muscles causing them to contract for 10 s every 10 min. Subjects utilized IES on a program that increased from 4 to 24 h per day over 8 days and lasted up to a maximum of 4 weeks. Results: Bedside nurses reported that IES was simple to use, took an average of 6 min to apply, and 2 min to remove. Furthermore, IES could be easily incorporated into routine patient care. No pressure ulcers occurred in any subject during the study. No untoward reactions or adverse events had occurred directly as a result of IES. Innovation: IES represents a potential method of preventing bedsores. This study represents a necessary pilot study, investigating safety and feasibility before proceeding with a larger randomized controlled trial to determine efficacy.

NPWT may also play a role in preventing or treating wound infections, possibly by increasing wound penetration of antibiotics. However, clinical data in patients undergoing antibiotic and NPWT treatment are limited. Approach: To evaluate the wound penetration of antibiotics in NPWT patients, we conducted a prospective, observational study of burn and trauma patients treated with NPWT and systemic antibiotics. We evaluated the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of systemic vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as total and unbound antibiotic concentrations in wound exudate from the same patients. Results: Data from 32 patients with 37 wounds undergoing NPWT demonstrated that vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam all penetrated wounds with exudate to plasma concentration ratios more than 0.8. Cefazolin did not penetrate wounds in patients undergoing NPWT as effectively, with an average exudate to plasma concentration ratio of 0.51. Innovation: Clinical data on the wound penetration of antibiotics in patients undergoing NPWT are limited, but these data suggest that antibiotics have different capacities for wound penetration during NPWT that should be considered when making clinical decisions. Conclusion: This initial report suggests that (1) vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam effectively penetrate wounds during NPWT and (2) cefazolin as well as other antibiotics may not penetrate wounds during NPWT.",

Nonetheless, excisional procedures remain relevant as an important tool in the comprehensive surgical management of lymphedema. Recent Advances: Modifications to the Charles procedure and other direct excisional procedures have improved the complication profile and patient outcomes. Moreover, the use of liposuction techniques for minimally invasive tissue excision has expanded the scope of excisional surgery to benefit patients with less severe lymphedema. Recent operations combining excisional and physiologic procedures may prove to have superior results to stand-alone procedures. Critical Issues: No standard protocol exists for the comprehensive surgical management of lymphedema. Proper patient selection for any procedure requires robust outpatient assessment, cooperation with physiotherapy treatment teams, careful patient stratification, and a clear understanding of the procedure's goal.

    "abstract": "Significance: The present review covers an overview of the current understanding of biology of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and suggests an important role of their differential potential for clinical approaches associated with tissue repair and fibrosis. Recent Advances: Genetic lineage tracing technology has enabled the delineation of cellular hierarchies and examination of MSC cellular origins and myofibroblast sources. This technique has led to the characterization of perivascular MSC populations and suggests that pericytes might provide a local source of tissue-specific MSCs, which can differentiate into tissue-specific cells for tissue repair and fibrosis. Autologous adipose tissue MSCs led to the advance in tissue engineering for regeneration of damaged tissues. Critical Issues: Recent investigation has revealed that perivascular MSCs might be the origin of myofibroblasts during fibrosis development, and perivascular MSCs might be the major source of myofibroblasts in fibrogenic disease. Adipose tissue MSCs combined with cytokines and biomaterials are available in the treatment of soft tissue defect and skin wound healing. Future Directions: Further investigation of the roles of perivascular MSCs may enable new approaches in the treatment of fibrogenic disease; moreover, perivascular MSCs might have potential as an antifibrotic target for fibrogenic disease. Autologous adipose tissue MSCs combined with cytokines and biomaterials will be an alternative method for the treatment of soft tissue defect and skin wound healing.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess safety and dose-finding efficacy of esmolol hydrochloride (Galnobax) for healing of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). This is phase 1/2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind vehicle-controlled study. Participants having diabetes and noninfected, full-thickness, neuropathic, grade I or II (Wagner classification) DFU, area 1.5-10 cm2, and unresponsive to standard wound care (at least 4 weeks) were randomized to receive topical Galnobax 14% twice daily (BID), Galnobax 20% BID, Galnobax 20% once daily (OD)+vehicle, or vehicle BID with standard of care. The primary efficacy end point was the reduction in area and volume of target ulcer from baseline to week 12 or wound closure, whichever was earlier. The wound duration was 12.5 weeks (5-49.1 weeks) and wound area 4.10 ± 2.41 cm2 at baseline. The ulcer area reduction was 86.56%, 95.80%, 80.67%, and 82.58% (p = 0.47) in the Galnobax 14%, Galnobax 20%, Galnobax20%+vehicle, and vehicle only groups, respectively. Ulcer volume reduction was 99.40% in the Galnobax14%, 83.36% in Galnobax20%, 55.41% in the Galnobax20%+vehicle, and 84.57% in vehicle group (p = 0.86). The systemic concentration of esmolol was below the quantification limit (10 ng/mL) irrespective of doses of Galnobax (Cmax esmolol acid 340 ng/mL for 14% Galnobax, AUC 2.99 ± 4.31 h*μg/mL after single dose). This is the first clinical study of the short acting beta blocker esmolol hydrochloride used as novel formulation for healing of DFU. We found that esmolol when applied topically over wounds had minimal systemic concentration establishing its safety for wound healing in patients with diabetes. Esmolol hydrochloride is a safe novel treatment for DFU.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Lower-extremity diabetic ulcers (LEDUs) affect more than 500,000 U.S. Medicare beneficiaries each year. Dehydrated human amnionic and chorionic allografts (DHACAs) are clinically effective complements to standard of care (SoC; e.g., surgical debridement, offloading, infection, and moisture control) when treating LEDUs. However, Medicare and commercial payer coverage have restricted access to DHACAs. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of DHACAs versus SoC among Medicare beneficiaries with LEDUs for reduction of adverse outcomes such as mortality, recurrency, and major amputation. Approach: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of U.S. Medicare claims for LEDUs between 2018 and 2022. LEDU claims were collapsed into episodes of care (EOC). Frequency distribution of characteristics was compared using univariate and bivariate statistics. Zero-inflated binomial regression with 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity score matching evaluated six main outcome measures: mortality; wound recurrence; major amputation; minor amputation; emergency department (ED) utilization; and readmission. Results: There were 25,760 Medicare EOCs between 2018 and 2022 representing 12,880 matched samples in the DHACA and SoC cohorts. DHACAs were associated with a 20% reduction in 30-day mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]:10%, 29%), 28% reduction in risk of major amputation (95% CI: 19%, 36%), 9% reduction in ED utilization (95% CI: 3%,14%), and 8% reduction in 30-day readmission (95% CI: 2%, 13%). DHACAs were noninferior for minor amputation rates and wound recurrence compared to SoC cohort. Conclusion: Beneficiaries with LEDUs benefit significantly from DHACAs on multiple outcomes, including a lower risk of mortality. Providers should examine the appropriateness of DHACAs for patients with LEDU as part of wound management. Medicare and commercial payers should consider improved outcomes when defining coverage policies that restrict access to DHACAs given the observed benefits.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The mechanisms of structured exercise therapy (SET) in peripheral artery disease (PAD) are not clear. We have developed an SET module for our large animal model of ischemic myopathy. We hypothesized that SET would increase muscle strength and walking distance in this model. The objective was to discover the SET-dependent mechanisms involved in this process. Approach: After induction of unilateral hind limb ischemia, three animals were exposed to standard environmental enrichment (sedentary or SED) and four animals underwent SET thrice weekly for 4 weeks postoperatively. Walking, hind limb pressure indices, and strength testing were performed weekly. Terminal muscle samples were used for skeletal muscle testing. Results: SET animals increased walking distance over time. SET increased muscle strength in both the ischemic and nonischemic limb. When comparing the ischemic SED hind limb muscle with that of ischemic + SET, the SET group has improved respiration and decreased oxidative stress. Markers of cell death and impaired functional regeneration were increased in SED ischemic muscles but returned toward baseline in the SET ischemic muscle. Innovation: This study uses a validated, large animal model of ischemic myopathy similar to that seen in humans with PAD. The effects of exercise on limb function, strength, and skeletal muscle health are reported in this model. Conclusion: SET increases muscle strength and regeneration by increasing endogenous antioxidants and mitochondrial respiration, resulting in favorable muscle health despite ongoing ischemia. This model may assist in preclinical testing of PAD therapies designed to improve muscle health. [Figure: see text].",

The FlexiForce B201 pressure sensor offers precise pressure measurements, thereby demonstrating a promising solution. Approach: This study used a Bama pig scar model with an untreated group, a pressure garment group, and a pressure monitoring group that was treated with FlexiForce B201 sensors and pressure garments. The therapeutic effects were recorded over 1 month. The clinical research followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and was registered as ChiCTR2200064173. Eighty-two patients with peri-joint hypertrophic scars were enrolled. Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to the control group and received conventional pressure garment therapy, whereas the remaining 41 patients were included in the monitoring group. Treatment outcomes were tracked at 3 months and 6 months. Results: The Bama pig scar model demonstrated reduced scar hypertrophy in the monitoring group. In the clinical study, the scar thickness in the monitoring group was 47.76% of the initial thickness after 6 months, thereby representing an additional 11.33% reduction compared to the control group. The Vancouver Scar Scale score of the monitoring group (6.44 ± 1.62) was significantly better than that of the control group (7.33 ± 1.53). Innovation: The FlexiForce B201 pressure sensor is soft and flexible. It provides accurate pressure measurements within the pressure garment and guides physicians in adjusting the pressure distribution.

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries, especially those with complete transection of major nerves, create significant morbidity including debilitating pain, loss of protective haptic feedback, and impaired volitional control of musculature. The societal burden and cost of medical care for these injuries are enormous, with estimates in the United States alone in excess of $670 million per year. In clinical scenarios with a segmental nerve gap where end-to-end coaptation without tension is not possible, a \"bridge\" or scaffold must be interposed to facilitate communication between the proximal and distal stumps to facilitate organized growth following Wallerian degeneration. A multitude of constructs have been created and studied to facilitate this regeneration. Among the three overall types of bridge employed in contemporary clinical care-conduit/scaffold, allograft, and autograft-each has significant downsides ranging from limited successful nerve ingrowth to donor site morbidity. Despite the tremendous work over the last 150 years in nerve biology and medical technology for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury, the biological processes governing nerve regeneration remain incompletely understood. Especially in cases of long segmental gaps, there remains room for significant improvement. Ongoing studies have identified several promising modalities for nerve scaffolds to facilitate more efficient and effective neuronal outgrowth but still require further investigation. Here, we review contemporary paradigms in the treatment of segmental nerve injuries with interposing scaffolds and reexamine nerve physiology, regulatory programs in nerve regeneration, and strategic targets for neurogenic pathways that may facilitate novel treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Fat grafting is widely applied for various purposes, including volume restoration, improving tissue quality, and promoting wound healing, but it has poor long-term graft survival predictability. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) administration is hypothesized to improve fat graft outcomes by expediting inflammatory resolution and graft vascularity and reducing necrosis. Approach: Mice heterozygote to human AAT was grafted fat under the scalp alongside 400 µg/graft AAT or albumin (ALB) on days 0 and 3. Graft volume was determined by micro-magnetic resonance imaging, and explants were assessed for viability, histology, immunohistochemistry, and expression of selected genes. AAT expression was examined in hypoxia-exposed adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Results: After 90 days, AAT-treated grafts maintained higher volumes (70.06% vs. 34.54%, n = 8, p = 0.02) and displayed improved tissue quality. On day 10 after grafting, grafts exhibited more blood vessels (mean 1.94/mm2 vs. 0.33/mm2) and 6.25-fold more adiponectin transcript levels (n = 12, p = 0.02). Although day-3 interleukin (IL)-1β expression was 5-fold greater in AAT-treated grafts (n = 6, p = 0.4), day-10 IL-1β expression was 2-fold lower compared to ALB-treated grafts (n = 22, p = 0.01). In the Methoxynitrosulfophenyl-tetrazolium carboxanilide (XTT) assay, day-3 AAT-treated grafts were 1.56-fold more metabolically functional (n = 6, p = 0.04) and exhibited greater perilipin-positive regions (18.5% versus 3.1%). Hypoxia-exposed ADSC expressed 9-fold higher AAT transcript levels (p = 0.04). Innovation: Fat grafting outcomes improved by early AAT treatment, probably by accelerating inflammatory resolution. Due to its marked safety profile, the study's findings are for adjunct clinical-grade AAT therapy. Conclusion: AAT has a promising potential to be utilized as a fat graft outcome enhancer in terms of volume retention predictability and tissue quality.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common complication of diabetes, characterized by chronic, hard-to-heal wounds that can lead to serious infections and amputations. Effective self-management is crucial for treatment and prevention. Recent Advances: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across academic databases, clinical practice guideline (CPG) databases, and the websites of diabetes societies. The characteristics, recommendations, and evaluation criteria of the CPGs were extracted and organized using Excel. Four researchers independently assessed the methodological and reporting quality of the CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II instrument and the Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare checklist. Data were synthesized and visualized through evidence mapping to provide an overview of current guideline coverage and key recommendations. Critical Issues: This study included 13 CPGs and synthesized 46 recommendations. Self-management strategies for patients with DFU mainly involve health education, foot self-care, lifestyle change, comorbidity/symptom management, as well as follow-up and medical help-seeking. The identified CPGs were of mixed quality, with four classified as high quality. With respect to methodology, the CPGs performed well in scope and purpose (82.6%±10.9%) and clarity (80.77%±9.19%), but showed deficiencies in stakeholder involvement (52.8%; interquartile range [IQR]: 17.3%) and editorial independence (58.3%; IQR: 82.3%). For reporting quality, limitations were noted in transparency regarding review and quality assurance (18.75%; IQR: 100%), as well as funding and declaration of interests (12.5%; IQR: 32.82%). Future Directions: The evidence provided by CPGs for DFU self-management varied in strength, and some recommendations were inconsistent. The results adds to our knowledge and promotes the development of trustworthy CPGs on DFU. Further research is necessary to propose more evidence-based and high-quality recommendations.",

This review aims to fill the current research gap regarding the application and potential of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) based therapies in the treatment of OA, thereby providing guidance for future research and clinical practice. Recent Advances: Chondrocytes respond to the inflammatory microenvironment via an array of signaling pathways and thus are critical in cartilage degeneration and OA progression. Mitochondria, as an important metabolic center in chondrocytes, play a vital role in responding to inflammatory stimuli. Multiple MQC mechanisms, including mitochondrial antioxidant defense, mitochondrial protein quality control, mitochondrial DNA repair, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, sustain mitochondrial homeostasis under pathological conditions. Critical Issues: Despite extensive OA research, effective therapies remain limited. Elucidating MQC mechanisms in disease progression and post-traumatic cartilage repair is crucial. While preclinical studies demonstrate potential, clinical translation requires addressing protocol standardization, patient stratification, and long-term efficacy, as well as safety validation. Future Directions: Future research should focus on developing personalized MQC-based OA therapies guided by biomarker profiling and signaling pathway modulation. However, translational challenges persist, particularly regarding pervasive off-target effects, inadequate OA-specific targeting capacity, interpatient heterogeneity, and reliable evaluation of long-term therapeutic efficacy. Strategic prioritization of OA-specific MQC targets coupled with delivery system optimization may significantly improve both clinical translatability and therapeutic outcomes.",

Approach: SEMTWIST model was standardized to quantify biofilm infection (BFI) abundance in 240 distinct SEM images from 60 human chronic wound-edge biospecimens (four technical replicates of each specimen). Results from SEMTWIST were compared against human expert assessments and the gold standard for molecular BFI detection, that is, peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH). Results: Correlation and Bland-Altman plot demonstrated a robust correlation (r = 0.82, p < 0.01), with a mean bias of 1.25, and 95% limit of agreement ranging from -43.40 to 47.11, between SEMTWIST result and the average scores assigned by trained human experts. While interexpert variability highlighted potential bias in manual assessments, SEMTWIST provided consistent results. Bacterial culture detected infection but not biofilm aggregates. Whereas the wheat germ agglutinin staining exhibited nonspecific staining of host tissue components and failed to provide a specific identification of BFI. The molecular identification of biofilm aggregates using PNA-FISH was comparable with SEMTWIST, highlighting the robustness of the developed approach.

    "abstract": "Credible guideline articles are essential for advancing evidence-based medicine, yet their development demands rigorous methodology to ensure transparency, reliability, and applicability. This editorial outlines a framework for writing and critically evaluating guideline articles, emphasizing standardized approaches such as GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation), IOM (Institute of Medicine) standards, and GIN (Guidelines International Network) criteria. Key steps include: (1) transparent and credible author panel selection: incorporating diverse stakeholders with established expertise (objective benchmark requirements that are publicly disclosed), including clinician scientists, translational scientists, methodologists, and patients (where applicable), to mitigate bias and enhance relevance; (2) Transparency and conflict-of-interest management: adhering to IOM principles for panel selection and publicly available documentation to uphold trustworthiness; (3) Systematic evidence synthesis: using structured methods such as GRADE to assess the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations while relying on the expertise of an appropriately chosen panel to address limitations such as sparse data in emerging fields; and (4) Implementation planning: leveraging structured tools (employ GIN as applicable) to ensure real-world feasibility and adaptability. The article contrasts these frameworks with ad hoc expert opinion articles, which are vulnerable to bias. Hybrid approaches, as applicable to specific needs, are strongly encouraged. For example, combining GRADE for evidence assessment, IOM for procedural credibility, and GIN for practical rollout should be considered for optimal rigor. Niche systems such as USPSTF (US Preventive Services Task Force) for preventive services and NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) for cost-effectiveness integration are discussed. By adhering to these principles, as applicable to the specific case, guideline authors can produce actionable, ethically sound recommendations that bridge research and practice, ultimately improving healthcare quality and reducing variability in clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Endogenous bioelectric signaling (including transepidermal potential [TEP] and the current of injury) plays a fundamental role in normal wound repair. Despite this, commonly used wound management frameworks do not consider this important driver of healing. The objectives of this review are to explore whether the patient characteristics/pathologies common in delayed healing are associated with weakened electrical properties of the skin and to consider whether compromised currents of injury are a barrier to healing that could be addressed with electrical stimulation therapy (EST) and incorporated into existing frameworks. Approach: This systematic review of PubMed was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and aimed to explore the impact of three characteristics associated with delayed healing (older age, diabetes, and chronic inflammation) on the electrical properties of skin/wounds. Results: Twelve relevant studies were identified, revealing that TEP in older or diabetic people is significantly lower, and the current of injury is approximately half that of young, healthy controls. Innovation: Lower currents of injury are associated with slower wound healing; therefore, the reduced current of injury/TEP identified here can be considered a barrier to healing. EST is designed to boost the weakened current of injury, back up to normal levels, stimulating a healing response. The incorporation of EST into existing wound management frameworks is therefore proposed. Conclusion: Endogenous bioelectrical signaling in the wound healing process appears to be compromised particularly in older people and those with diabetes. Patients may benefit from incorporating treatment with EST, which boosts bioelectrical signaling, into relevant wound treatment frameworks. [Figure: see text].",

    "abstract": "Significance: Refractory wounds are complicated multistep biological processes that can lead to severe complications in patients. Selective autophagy plays a crucial role in precisely controlling the quality of intracellular components and regulating biological behavior. This review explores the features and underlying mechanisms of various types of selective autophagy and highlights their implications in burn injury and wound healing. Recent Advances: In-depth studies have underscored the critical role of selective autophagy, including mitophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy, pexophagy, xenophagy, lysophagy, ferritinophagy, and lipophagy, in effectively controlling the quality of intracellular components and regulating biological behavior, which may enhance wound-healing process. Critical Issues: Autophagy is a housekeeping and self-renewal process that utilizes lysosomal machinery to degrade and recycle cellular components, thereby enhancing cellular adaptability to stressful conditions. In addition to nonselective bulk degradation, autophagy selectively recycles specific cell constituents, including mitochondria, ER, peroxisomes, pathogens, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and ferritin. The effective management of the quality of cellular components during wound healing remains a challenge in clinical practice. Future Directions: Understanding the basic mechanisms and intricate crosstalk underlying selective autophagy may facilitate the development of comprehensive strategies and therapeutic targets for wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming biomedical research and health care, offering new paradigms for discovery, diagnosis, and decision-making. This article provides a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and reviewers seeking to understand and apply AI with rigor and relevance. It begins with a historical anchor: the birth of AI in health care at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1970s, where the INTERNIST-1 system pioneered diagnostic reasoning through symbolic logic, a milestone that laid the foundation for today's intelligent systems. Structured into three tiers-foundations, core techniques, and applications-the article addresses the full spectrum of biomedical AI. It introduces foundational concepts such as data engineering and preprocessing, knowledge representation and reasoning, and symbolic AI, which together enable structured, interpretable intelligence. Core techniques including expert systems, machine learning, deep learning, and explainable AI are presented with clinical examples, highlighting their role in wound care, image analysis, and predictive modeling. The applications tier showcases natural language processing, non-machine learning computer vision, robotics and automation, and distributed AI/multi-agent systems, demonstrating how AI integrates into real-world workflows. Ethical considerations and bias mitigation strategies are addressed with emphasis on Institutional Review Board oversight and fairness frameworks. Crucially, the article emphasizes that successful AI adoption begins not with technology, but with people. It outlines a systematic approach to building a biomedical AI workforce from within, empowering clinicians, researchers, and staff to become AI-literate contributors and leaders. With rigor checklists, practical guidance, and a vision for human-AI collaboration, this article invites readers to move beyond hype and toward responsible, transformative innovation in health care and biomedical science.

    "abstract": "The transition from volume-based healthcare to value-based care is advancing via the reporting of quality measures, initially as a part of \"pay for performance\" within Medicare's Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) initiative. However, \"value-based purchasing\" requirements within the Affordable Care Act will increase the percentage of reimbursement linked to the reporting of quality measures. Currently, only five PQRS measures are relevant to wound care, and the venous ulcer care measure will be retired this year. PQRS measures in wound care can only be reported via claims or qualified patient registries, and no wound care measures are endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF). The recent Health Informational Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act promoting the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) requires quality reporting by clinicians wishing to access EHR adoption money. These clinicians will be able to comply with the next stage of \"meaningful use\" of EHRs, beginning in 2015, by submitting data to a qualified registry, and registry submission may eventually be required by Medicare for reimbursement of some wound care products and procedures. Other specialties are using registries to track adverse events, measure compliance with practice guidelines, and for comparative effectiveness data. Evidence-based measures should be developed as electronic measures that can be submitted directly from the clinicians' EHR. New wound care measures should undergo testing for NQF endorsement. The not-for-profit U.S. Wound Registry is a qualified patient registry that is available for PQRS reporting, measure testing, and future registry submission requirements. The lack of tested wound care quality measures threatens the entire wound care industry, as quality-based reimbursement is not limited to physician payment. Quality measures are an increasingly important part of many Medicare payment systems, including those for acute care hospitals, hospital-based outpatient wound care departments, and accountable care organizations.",

Furthermore, the mechanism of action for stimulation by hypoxia (i.e., a pivotal role of reactive oxygen species and related signal pathways) will be discussed.Hypoxia is a critical stimulatory factor for ASCs. Therefore, understanding the response and adaptation of ASCs to hypoxia may be invaluable for developing novel cell therapeutic strategies.Culturing ASCs under hypoxia may uniquely benefit proliferation, stemness, migration, and growth factor secretion. Therefore, the preconditioning of ASCs by hypoxia shows a prominent wound-healing effect in clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Many wounds are difficult to heal because of the large, complex community of microbes present within the wound.Classical laboratory culture methods do not provide an accurate picture of the microbial interactions or representation of microorganisms within a wound. There is an inherent bias in diagnosis based upon classical culture stemming from the ability of certain organisms to thrive in culture while others are underrepresented or fail to be identified in culture altogether. Chronic wounds also contain polymicrobial infections existing as a cooperative community that is resistant to antibiotic therapy.New methods in molecular diagnostic medicine allow the identification of nearly all organisms present in a wound irrespective of the ability of these organisms to be grown in culture. Advances in DNA analyses allow absolute identification of microorganisms from very small clinical specimens. These new methods also provide a quantitative representation of all microorganisms contributing to these polymicrobial infections.Technological advances in laboratory diagnostics can significantly shorten the time required to heal chronic wounds. Identification of the genetic signatures of organisms present within a wound allows clinicians to identify and treat the primary organisms responsible for nonhealing wounds.Advanced genetic technologies targeting the specific needs of wound care patients are now accessible to all wound care clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Dysfunctional remodeling of the extracellular matrix contributes to the formation of TLR-dependent feed forward loops that drive chronic inflammation. We have previously shown that two Type III domains of Fibronectin, FnEDA and FnIII-1c, cooperate to induce the synergistic release of interleukin 8 (IL-8) from dermal fibroblasts. We now identify steps in the TLR4 pathway where synergy can be demonstrated as well as additional kinases functioning in fibronectin activation of TLR4 signaling. We also evaluate the ligand and cell-type specificity of this synergistic response. Approach: FnEDA, FnIII-1c, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced genes in fibroblasts were analyzed by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and protein was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Kinases functioning in gene expression were identified by using specific inhibitors. Activated TLR4-dependent effector molecules were identified by cell fractionation and Western blot and quantified by image analysis. Results: The addition of FnEDA and FnIII-1c to dermal fibroblasts resulted in a synergistic increase in the expression of IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). Synergy between these domains was detected at the level of nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) activation. Induction of IL-8 by fibronectin ligands was partially attenuated in the presence of inhibitors to either epidermal growth factor receptor or Src kinases. FnIII-1c also synergized with LPS to induce IL-8 in dermal fibroblasts, whereas the combined effect of FnEDA and LPS on IL-8 synthesis was additive. In contrast, synergistic responses to these ligands were not observed in THP-1 monocytic cells. Innovation: The data suggest that chronic inflammation may be driven by matrix- and pathogen-derived TLR4 ligands that work in synergy to promote an exuberant innate response. Conclusion: The data suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying synergistic responses to TLR4 ligands lies upstream of IKK activation, likely in the molecular composition of the TLR4 receptor complex that assembles in response to each ligand. In addition, synergistic responses to TLR4 activation may be both cell-type and ligand specific.",

Approach: A retrospective review was performed in a series of patients with infected and exposed LVADs who were treated with instillation NPWT in conjunction with surgical debridement. Results: Three consecutive patients were included who developed periprosthetic infection subsequent to LVAD implantation. In all cases, the utilization of a vacuum-assisted closure with instillation (VACi) along with surgical debridement and IV antibiotics eradicated infection resulting in successful retention of hardware. Cases 1 and 2 received definitive wound closure within 3 and 12 days of starting treatment, respectively. Case 3 initially deferred surgery in favor of local wound care. Eventually the patient elected for surgical treatment and underwent closure 164 days after initial presentation. All three patients healed completely without residual evidence of infection. Flap reconstruction with a pedicled rectus flap was used to achieve definitive closure in all patients. One patient subsequently required pump replacement secondary to thrombosis and mechanical pump failure. Innovation: LVAD infections are met with high morbidity and mortality rates, and timely salvage is critical. In this initial series, VACi has proven a viable therapy option to help control and eradicate infection without LVAD removal. Conclusion: This series illustrates the value of newer techniques such as VACi in combination with surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy in effectively salvaging LVADs that were infected.",

Approach: PubMed and The Cochrane Library and CNKI databases were searched to identify prior randomized controlled trials. Methodological qualities of included studies were assessed using Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention. Healing rate was considered the primary outcome; the secondary outcomes included healing time and adverse events. Results: Fifteen studies involving a total of 827 subjects were analyzed in the meta-analysis. Considering the primary outcome, the average healing rate in APG group was 85.8% and ranged from 68.4% to 100%. Relatively, the control group was 57.4% and ranged from 18.2% to 75.0%. Eligible studies were compared with a fixed effects model (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.496), indicating a higher healing rate with APG (risk ratio [RR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-1.57, z = 8.50, p < 0.001). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis is robust. Considering the secondary outcomes, APG therapy needed less time (weighted mean difference -10.75 days, 95% CI: -11.67 to 8.86 days, z = 14.34, p < 0.001) and had fewer adverse events (RR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.76, z = 2.94, p = 0.003). Innovation: APG therapy is an innovative and effective approach to promote DF wound healing and reduce healing time and adverse events. Conclusion: The meta-analysis demonstrates that APG therapy has a positive effect on the treatment of DF wounds. However, additional well-designed and high-quality studies are needed to reach a conclusion with more confidence.",

Recent Advances: A systematic approach was used to conduce a formal consensus initiative. A multidisciplinary panel of experts identified relevant clinical questions, performed a systematic search of the literature, and created a list of statements. GRADE Working Group guidelines were followed. An independent international jury reviewed and voted recommendations for clinical practice. Consent was developed according to Delphi rules and GRADE method was used to attribute grade of strength. Critical Issues: The extensive search of the literature retrieved 42 pertinent articles (26 clinical studies, 7 systematic reviews or meta-analysis, 5 other reviews, 2 consensus-based articles, and 2 in vitro studies). Thirty-five recommendations and statements were created. Only 1 of 35, concerning ankle-brachial pressure index reliability in diabetic patients, was rejected by the panel. No sufficient agreement was achieved on toe brachial index test to rule out the orphan heel syndrome, removing dry eschar in adult patients without vascular impairment, and using an antimicrobial dressing in children with infected heel pressure injuries. Eleven recommendations were approved with a weak grade of strength. Experts strongly endorsed 20 recommendations. Offloading, stages I and II pressure injuries, and referral criteria were areas characterized by higher level of agreement. Future Directions: We believe that the results of our effort could improve practice, especially in areas where clear and shared opinions emerged.

Approach: After generating a full-thickness skin defect wound model of endothelial Sox7- and/or Sox17-deficient mice, we measured the wound healing rates and performed histological analysis. The effects of an anti-Dll4 antibody on wound angiogenesis in Sox7-deficient mice and db/db diabetic mice were assessed. Results: Sox7 and/or Sox17 deletion delayed wound healing. Moreover, the loss of Sox7 and Sox17 inhibited wound angiogenesis, without affecting the expression of the other. Of interest, after anti-Dll4 antibody treatment, Sox17 levels were increased and the suppression of angiogenesis was alleviated in Sox7-deficient mice and db/db diabetic mice. Consequently, Dll4 blockade effectively recovered the observed delay in wound healing. Innovation: The proangiogenic role of Sox7 and Sox17 in wound angiogenesis was addressed and effective treatment of nonhealing wounds by Dll4 blockade was suggested. Conclusion: This study revealed the proangiogenic role of the transcription factors Sox7 and Sox17 in wound angiogenesis. Furthermore, we suggest a novel method for treating nonhealing wounds by particularly targeting the Dll4-Sox17 axis.",

Results: Vessel recruitment and remodeling were observed in the healing process. Burn injury reached to the worst extent within the first 24 h and had no expansion thereafter. The interrupted microcirculation in the mouse ear was progressively recovered in the consequent postburn days and completely healed on postburn day 7. Innovation: OMAG provides a novel way for noninvasive visualization and quantification of vasculature changes over time after burn injuries. The high resolution achieved by the imaging system reveals microvascular details down to capillary level.

    "abstract": "Significance: Emerging evidence has shown a link between the status of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and wound healing responses. Thus, better understanding HSCs will contribute to further advances in wound healing research. Recent Advances: Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages are critical players in the process of wound healing. HSCs actively respond to wound injury and other tissue insults, including infection and produce the effector myeloid cells, and a failing of the HSC response can result in impaired wound healing. Technological advances such as transcriptome at single-cell resolution, epigenetics, three-dimensional imaging, transgenic animals, and animal models, have provided novel concepts of myeloid generation (myelopoiesis) from HSCs, and have revealed cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms that can impact HSC functions in the context of health conditions. Critical Issues: The newer concepts include-the programmed cellular fate at a differentiation stage that is used to be considered as the multilineage, the signaling pathways that can activate HSCs directly and indirectly, the mechanisms that can deteriorate HSCs, the roles and remodeling of the surrounding environment for HSCs and their progenitors (the niche). Future Directions: The researches on HSCs, which produce blood cells, should contribute to the development of blood biomarkers predicting a risk of chronic wounds, which may transform clinical practice of wound care with precision medicine for patients at high risk of poor healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In a systematic preclinical investigation of ischemic wound healing, we investigated the hypothesis that electrical stimulation (ES) promotes the healing of ischemic wounds. Approach: The effects of varying clinically relevant ES variables were evaluated using our modified version of the Gould F344 rat ischemic wound model. Stimulation was delivered using the novel lightweight integrated, single-channel, current-controlled modular surface stimulation (MSS) device. Stepwise variation allowed the effects of five different stimulation paradigms within an appropriate current density range to be studied. Within each group, 8-10 animals were treated for 28 days or until the ischemic wounds were healed and 5 animals were treated for 12 days. Eight rats received sham devices. A quantitative multivariable outcomes assessment procedure was used to evaluate the effects of ES. Results: Ischemic wounds treated with a decreased interpulse interval (IPI) had the highest rate of complete wound closure at 3 weeks. Wounds treated with decreased pulse amplitude (PA) had a lower proportion of closed wounds than sham ischemic wounds and showed sustained inflammation with a lack of wound contraction. Innovation: Our systematic study of varying ES paradigms using the novel MSS device provides preliminary insight into potential mechanisms of ES in ischemic wound healing. Conclusion: Clinically appropriate ES can more than double the proportion of ischemic wounds closed by 3 weeks in this model. Ninety percent of wounds treated with a decreased IPI healed by 21 days compared with only 29% of ischemic wounds treated with decreased PA, which appears to inhibit healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Impaired and chronic wounds occur due to defects in one or more of the overlapping stages of healing. However, problems related to the vascular system are critical for nonhealing, and chronic wounds in humans often show the presence of fibrin cuffs/clots. We hypothesized that these clots are due to alterations in platelet function; hence, we have investigated whether alterations in platelet function are present during impaired healing. Approach: Platelets were subjected to different agonists to determine the rate of aggregation and evaluate the molecules involved in adhesion and aggregation that could lead to faster thrombosis and potentially contribute to impaired wound healing. Results: We show that wounding of TNFSF14/LIGHT-/- mice, which have impaired healing, leads to an enhanced response in platelet aggregation and a faster time to blood vessel occlusion (thrombosis). In addition, after wounding, platelets from these mice have increased levels of P-selectin, integrin αIIbβ3, and phosphatidylserine, molecules that contribute to platelet adhesion. They also have more extensive open canalicular system than platelets of control mice, suggesting increased surface area for interactions upon activation. Innovation: These results show a novel function for TNFSF14/LIGHT during wound healing. Conclusion: The absence of TNFSF14/LIGHT from the cell surface of platelets causes rapid platelet aggregation and thrombus formation that may contribute to impaired healing by reducing the ability of the blood vessels to transport nutrients and oxygen and other molecules needed for proper healing.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Half of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy as a component of their treatment regimen, and the most common resulting complication is radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) of the skin and soft tissue. This thickening of the dermis paired with decreased vascularity results in functional limitations and esthetic concerns and poses unique challenges when considering surgical exploration or reconstruction. Existing therapeutic options for RIF of the skin are limited both in scope and efficacy. Cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising means of utilizing regenerative cell populations to improve both functional and esthetic outcomes, and even as prophylaxis for RIF. Recent Advances: As one of the leading areas of cell-based therapy research, adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) demonstrate significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of RIF. The introduction of the ADSC-augmented fat graft has shown clinical utility. Recent research dedicated to characterizing specific ADSC subpopulations points toward further granularity in understanding of the mechanisms driving the well-established clinical outcomes seen with fat grafting therapy. Critical Issues: Various animal models of RIF demonstrated improved clinical outcomes following treatment with cell-based therapies, but the cellular and molecular basis underlying these effects remains poorly understood. Future Directions: Recent literature has focused on improving the efficacy of cell-based therapies, most notably through (1) augmentation of fat grafts with platelet-rich plasma and (2) the modification of expressed RNA through epitranscriptomics. For the latter, new and promising gene targets continue to be identified which have the potential to reverse the effects of fibrosis by increasing angiogenesis, decreasing inflammation, and promoting adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Despite the significant function of lymphatics in wound healing, and frequent clinical use of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), the effect of mechanical force application on lymphangiogenesis remains to be elucidated. We utilize a murine incisional wound healing model to assess the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis following NPWT. Approach: Dorsal incisional skin wounds were created on diabetic mice (genetically obese leptin receptor-deficient mice [db/db]; n = 30) and covered with an occlusive dressing (Control, n = 15) or NPWT (-125 mmHg, continuous, 24 h for 7 days; NPWT, n = 15). The wounds were macroscopically assessed for 28 days. Tissue was harvested on day 10 for analysis. Qualitative functional analysis of lymphatic drainage was performed on day 28 using Evans Blue staining (n = 2). Results: NPWT increased lymphatic vessel density (40 ± 20 vs. 12 ± 6 podoplanin [PDPN]+ and 25 ± 9 vs. 14 ± 8 lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 [LYVE-1]+) and vessel diameter (28 ± 9 vs. 12 ± 2 μm). Western blotting verified the upregulation of LYVE-1 with NPWT. Leukocyte presence was higher with NPWT (22% ± 3.7% vs. 9.1% ± 4.1% lymphocyte common antigen [CD45]+) and the leukocytes were predominately B cells clustered within vessels (8.8% ± 2.5% vs. 18% ± 3.6% B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 [CD20]+). Macrophage presence was lower in the NPWT group. Lymphatic drainage was increased in the NPWT group, which exhibited greater Evans Blue positivity. Innovation: The lymphangiogenic effects take place independent of macrophage infiltration, appearing to correlate with B cell presence. Conclusion: NPWT promotes lymphangiogenesis in incisional wounds, significantly increasing the lymph vessel density and diameter. This study highlights the potential of NPWT to stimulate lymphatic drainage and wound healing of surgical incisions.",

    "abstract": "Objective:Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can establish chronic infections and form biofilm in wounds. Because the wound environment is largely devoid of oxygen, P. aeruginosa may rely on anaerobic metabolism, such as nitrate respiration, to survive in wounds. While nitrate reductase (Nar) typically reduces nitrate to nitrite, it can also reduce chlorate to chlorite, which is a toxic oxidizing agent. Therefore, chlorate can act as a prodrug to specifically eradicate hypoxic/anoxic, nitrate-respiring P. aeruginosa populations, which are often tolerant to conventional antibiotic treatments. Approach: Using a diabetic mouse model for chronic wounds, we tested the role that anaerobic nitrate respiration plays in supporting chronic P. aeruginosa infections. Results:P. aeruginosa forms biofilm deep within the wound where the environment is anoxic. Daily treatment of P. aeruginosa-infected wounds with chlorate supported wound healing. Chlorate treatment was as effective as a treatment with ciprofloxacin (a conventional antibiotic that targets both oxic and hypoxic/anoxic P. aeruginosa populations). Chlorate-treated wounds showed markers of good-quality wound healing, including well-formed granulation tissue, reepithelialization and microvessel development. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments showed that P. aeruginosa requires nitrate respiration to establish a chronic wound infection and form biofilms. Innovation: We show that the small molecule chlorate, kills the opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa, by targeting a form of anaerobic metabolism called nitrate respiration. Conclusion: Chlorate holds promise as a treatment to combat diverse bacterial infections where oxygen is limiting and/or where pathogens grow as biofilms because many other pathogens possess Nar and survive using anaerobic metabolism.",

Therefore, we examined the effects of drug modulation of HIF-1α activity for wound healing in our previously developed mouse model of nonirradiated hind limb lymphedema. Approach: Mouse hind limb lymphedema models (n = 17) and a sham group (n = 6) were created using 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6N mice. Mice with hind limb lymphedema were randomized into experimental groups receiving roxadustat, 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1), or dimethyl sulfoxide and were given intraperitoneal injections every 2 days for up to 2 weeks. Four days after the surgery, an 8-mm diameter full-thickness skin wound was created in the hind limb. The number of days required for wound closure and the percentage of wounds closed were measured. Skin samples taken at wound creation were evaluated by histological and molecular analysis. Results: Administration of roxadustat accelerated wound healing, whereas YC-1 delayed it, with a significant decrease and increase in skin thickness, respectively. The relative mRNA expression of Hif1α, matrix metalloproteinase-3, and interleukin-6 was significantly higher in the roxadustat group and that of metalloproteinase-9 was significantly lower in the roxadustat group compared with the control group. Innovation: This study is the first to demonstrate delayed wound healing in a mouse model of hind limb lymphedema and the first to demonstrate the promotion of significant wound healing through the use of roxadustat. Conclusion: Roxadustat exerts wound-healing effects and may promote the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling via gene expression in hind limb lymphedema wound models.",

Preclinical and non-clinical studies supported a first in human healthy volunteer study to predict the need for protection of periwound skin. Approach: Pharmacologic activity testing compared in vitro digestion of collagen, fibrin, and elastin with relevant enzymes. A Yorkshire pig model of burn injury was used to evaluate debridement over 10 days and effects on intact skin. A human 21-day cumulative irritation study using Webril patches taped to the backs of 38 healthy adult volunteers compared four enzyme concentrations (0.10%, 0.20%, 0.40%, and 0.80% w/w) with the hydrogel vehicle, saline (low irritant control), and 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate (positive irritant control) using randomized placements and blinded evaluation. Results: SN514 showed excellent digestion of fibrin, elastin, and collagen in vitro. Burn wound studies in Yorkshire pigs showed efficient eschar debridement with minimal periwound erythema. Direct treatment on intact porcine skin for 5 days produced no to limited erythema. The preclinical findings of minimal irritation with SN514 were verified by a Phase 1 first-in-human 21-day cumulative skin irritation test. Irritation was observed to increase stepwise by concentration, confirming formulation accuracy. Each enzyme concentration was found to be \"possibly mild in use\" (Berger and Bowman method). No treatment emergent adverse events were observed during the study. Innovation: A fast-acting enzyme with a favorable irritation profile, prepared as a stable, ready to use hydrogel formulation, overcomes many recognized shortcomings of enzyme debriders.

Approach: Single-cell RNA sequencing data were retrieved from public databases, revealing distinct gene expression patterns in FB subpopulations. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to identify the surface molecular phenotypes of FBs that affect KD recurrence. Simultaneously, logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of changes in FB subpopulation percentages for clinical KD recurrence. Results: The percentage of keloid fibroblasts was significantly greater than that in normal tissues. Through further clustering analysis of the FB population, we obtained four subpopulations, FB1-FB4, in which the percentages of FB1 subpopulation were increased, and functional enrichment analysis suggested that the FB1 subpopulation may play a greater role in extracellular matrix collagen oversynthesis in KD. In addition, the gene expression of CD26 (DPP4), CD117 (c-KIT), and CD34 in the FB1 subpopulation was significantly higher than that in FB2-4 subpopulations. Moreover, the percentage of CD26+/CD117+/CD34+ cell subpopulations in the FCM data of patients with KD recurrence was significantly increased. Regression analysis confirmed that the CD26+/CD117+/CD34+ FB subpopulation was a risk factor for relapse. Innovation: We demonstrated that the molecular phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of FBs influences KD recurrence. Conclusion: We identified key pathogenic FB subpopulations that may affect KD development, which can be used as potential markers to predict recurrence and provide potential target cell populations for future clinical treatment.",

Approach: Following the CONSORT guidelines, patients with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) and noninfected wounds eligible for treatment with NPWT were randomized into two groups. One group received NPWT followed by standard wound care dressings, whereas the other was treated exclusively with COD. The primary outcome was wound size reduction, measured blindly using a 3D wound-imaging system. Secondary outcomes included patient and caregiver convenience (assessed via visual analog scores), cost, and additional wound parameters. Results: COD showed statistically significant noninferiority to NPWT in wound size reduction throughout the study (p < 0.01). The percentage of wounds that closed was 47.83% (11/23) and 34.78% (8/23) in the COD and NPWT arms, respectively (p > 0.05). The average time to wound closure, adjusted to potential confounders, such as gender, age, body mass index, diabetes, and smokers, was similar in both arms (p > 0.05). COD were found to be more convenient than NPWT for both patients (p < 0.001) and caregivers (p = 0.003), with a significantly shorter application time (p < 0.001). The COD cost was 14% of NPWT cost ($470 compared with $3,360). Innovation: COD may be considered as the first line of treatment for diabetic foot wounds when NPWT seems indicated. Conclusions: Using copper dressings as a first line of treatment of diabetic wounds, when NPWT is indicated, is expected to reduce health costs, improve convenience, and increase compliance without compromising the final outcome.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Chronic wounds have a high prevalence and poor outcomes in a geriatric population. It is unknown whether higher rates of successful wound healing are associated with better long-term outcomes. We sought to determine the association of risk-adjusted healing rates in wound care clinics with postdischarge outcomes. Approach: This observational study compared outcomes of Medicare patients with chronic wounds who received care at clinics with the highest risk-adjusted wound healing rates (n = 91) to those with the lowest rates (n = 88) in a network of 510 specialized U.S. wound care clinics. All 12,703 patients with chronic wounds at the clinics that could be identified in Medicare data were included. The outcomes were incidences of wound recurrence, gangrene, sepsis, and amputation after discharge. Results: The study included 6,462 and 6,241 patients in top- and bottom-performing clinics, respectively. Being treated in a top-performing clinic was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of all four outcomes. The difference was statistically significantly lower for wound recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.87, p < 0.001) and gangrene (aHR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.76, p < 0.001) but not for sepsis (aHR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.76-1.001, p = 0.065) and amputation (aHR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-1.00, p = 0.055). Innovation: This study is the first to suggest that patients treated in clinics with better wound-healing outcomes also have better outcomes after discharge. This finding can inform analyses to understand differences in practice patterns that lead to better outcomes. Conclusion: Treatment of chronic wounds in wound care clinics with higher risk-adjusted healing rates is associated with a lower risk of wound-related adverse events during follow-up, particularly in the first year. More research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to this effect and to determine interventions to improve outcomes sustainably as well as assess the impact of changes in outcomes on resource utilization and patients' quality of life.",

Recent Advances: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines complete wound closure as the achievement of 100% re-epithelialization of the wound surface, with no detectable exudate, drainage, or need for wound dressing, as verified during two sequential clinical assessments conducted at least 14 days apart. Clinically, wounds may meet this current FDA-recommended clinical criteria for wound closure, yet not achieve functional wound closure which requires the re-establishment of barrier function at the site of repair. Such wounds are likely to recur. High TEWL posthealing predicts wound recurrence. Thus, TEWL measurement at the site of repair posthealing is emerging as a significant measurement of wound healing endpoint. Critical Issues: Appropriate clinical measurement of TEWL requires a basic understanding of the related technologies and their appropriate use. Such understanding will help achieve the necessary rigor and reproducibility in clinical measurement. Future Directions: Recent reports on the critical significance of TEWL in wound care open new horizons wherein TEWL is likely to have broader applications involving altered skin barrier functions, such as during aging and other factors that determine skin health. Evidence to support revisiting the FDA definition of wound closure to include restoration of barrier function at the site of closure is strong. Widespread adoption of TEWL in wound care practices to determine functional wound closure is anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To elucidate the global disease burden and care quality associated with pressure injury (PI). Approach: This study examined temporal trends in PI incidence over the past 32 years. Decomposition analysis attributed these trends to demographic and epidemiological shifts, and cross-national health inequities were quantified. The Quality of Care Index (QCI) was constructed using principal component analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in global PI care quality. A log-linear age-period-cohort model was employed to forecast trends over the next 15 years. Results: In 2021, there were nearly 2.47 million PI cases globally, a 115.92% increase from 1.14 million in 1990. Decomposition analysis revealed that population aging and demographic growth were the primary drivers of increasing PI incidence. Lower QCI was concentrated in African countries and those with low sociodemographic index (SDI). Incidence rates increased gradually with improving SDI. Significant health inequalities existed among 204 countries and regions, with minimal changes in inequality slope indices over time. Projections indicate a gradual increase to 3.5 million PI cases globally by 2035. Innovation: This study developed a novel comprehensive indicator, the QCI, and for the first time, shed light on health inequalities in PI across 204 countries and territories. Conclusion: Over the past 32 years, the global disease burden of PI has been significant, accompanied by health inequalities across countries and regions. For nations with low SDI, there remains considerable room for improvement in the quality of care for PI, necessitating more effective strategies to address health care disparities.",

Approach: This study used GBD 2021 data to analyze PIs prevalence and DALYs by age, sex, and Sociodemographic Index (SDI) region. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model was employed for temporal trend analysis and future projections. Results: From 1990 to 2021, the global prevalence slightly decreased from 8.246 to 7.920 per 100,000 (estimated annual percentage change -0.023%), whereas DALYs decreased by 9.7%. High-SDI regions presented significant DALY reductions (-39.3%), whereas middle- and low-middle-SDI regions presented increased prevalence rates (20.5% and 28.9%, respectively). The prevalence was highest in the ageing population, peaking in the 95+ year age group. Projections estimate that there will be 720,660 global cases by 2035, with the greatest burden expected among older adults in developing regions. Innovation: This study provides a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of PIs, revealing global disparities and emphasizing demographic-specific risks, especially in ageing populations and low-SDI regions. Bayesian modeling offered robust future projections. Conclusion: Despite modest improvements globally, significant disparities in the prevalence of PIs persist, particularly in developing regions and among older adults. Targeted interventions, preventive strategies, and health care policies are critical for addressing these challenges and mitigating future disease burdens.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate patterns and risk factors associated with co-occurring pressure injuries (PrIs) using real-world clinical data. Approach: This retrospective cohort study analyzed electronic health records (EHRs) of adult patients with PrIs from 2015 to 2023 across five hospitals within a large U.S. health care system. An EHR-based phenotype-a set of algorithmic rules using structured clinical data-was developed and validated to identify patients with co-occurring PrIs, enabling classification of all patients in the study cohort into either single-occurring or co-occurring PrI groups. The accuracy of the co-occurring PrI phenotype was assessed through chart review. Univariate analyses and binary logistic regression were employed to identify risk factors associated with co-occurring PrIs. All findings are reported in accordance with the STROBE checklist. Results: Among 18,195 patients with at least one PrI record, 4,415 (24.3%) had co-occurring PrIs. The phenotype demonstrated high accuracy (accuracy = 0.96). Pattern analysis showed a direct association between the number of PrIs and severe-stage injuries. Logistic regression revealed that severe PrIs (odds ratio [OR] 3.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.23-3.74) were most strongly associated with co-occurring PrIs, followed by Black or African American race (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14-1.84) and spinal cord injury (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.14-1.52). Innovation: This study introduces a validated EHR-based phenotype for identifying co-occurring PrIs. It reveals a direct link between co-occurring PrIs and injury severity, as well as unique risk factors associated with co-occurring PrIs. Conclusions: Co-occurring PrIs are prevalent and strongly associated with severe PrIs. This study also revealed distinct occurrence patterns, with injury severity increasing as the number of co-occurring PrIs rises. The findings from this study emphasize the need for targeted risk assessment and prevention efforts for co-occurring PrIs.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Wound healing is a complex, tightly regulated process involving a range of enzymes, growth factors, and cytokines that coordinate cellular activities essential for tissue repair and wound closure. However, in cases of extensive or severe injury, the intrinsic repair mechanisms are often insufficient, underscoring the need for advanced therapeutic strategies to accelerate healing and minimize scar formation. Recent Advances: Electrically conductive hydrogels (ECHs), combining the advantageous properties of hydrogels with the physiological and electrochemical characteristics of conductive materials, present a safer and more convenient alternative to traditional electrode-based electrical stimulation (ES) for treating chronic and nonhealing wounds. This review summarizes the various types of ECHs and their functional roles in facilitating wound healing. Critical Issues: Understanding the mechanisms by which ECHs interact with electrical signals in the skin, along with precise control of the synergy between these signals and other functional properties, is critical for achieving optimal wound healing outcomes. Future Directions: Future development of ECHs should focus on elucidating underlying mechanisms, standardizing ES parameters, validating efficacy in clinically relevant animal models, and integrating multifunctional systems. Additionally, material design must be optimized for biocompatibility, adaptability, and scalability to facilitate clinical translation in chronic and nonhealing wound treatment.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In a complex environment such as that in a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), multiple factors, including cross talk between distinct cell types of the affected tissue, play a significant role. We identified a transcription factor (TF) cocktail that induces a transition from nonhealing to healing states across multiple cell types. Approach: Thirty-three skin and wound single-cell RNA-sequencing samples (85,928 cells) from patients with diabetes with healing or nonhealing DFU were analyzed (GSE165816). The relative activity of cell type-specific TF in healing versus nonhealing DFU was compared, and the cumulative additive effect of different TF cocktails was assessed. Results: We used a cumulative additive-effect approach to identify five transcription factors, FOS Like 2, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit (FOSL2), CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 3 Like 1, RELB Proto-Oncogene, NF-KB Subunit, ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1), and X-Box Binding Protein 1, whose targets include 66.5% of pro-healing genes and only 12.5% of anti-healing genes across all cell types. In vascular endothelial cells, this TF panel accounted for 95% of vasculature-development genes; in myeloid cells, it regulated 85% of antimicrobial-response genes. In silico knockout of ETS1 or FOSL2 shifted cells toward nonhealing states, whereas Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 knockout shifted endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and myeloid cells toward healing-associated state. Innovation: This work recognizes a TF panel that is likely to have therapeutic value in promoting healing in nonhealing DFU. Conclusion: In this work, we identified a set of candidate TFs with the potential to induce a cell state transition favoring a switch from nonhealing to healing outcomes in patients with nonhealing DFU. Overall, our gene regulatory network-driven TF cocktail provides a rational blueprint for reprogramming DFU cell states and paves the way toward targeted regenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous tissue repair involves an initial inflammatory phase, followed by a fibroproliferative phase and finally by a resolution phase. Failure to initiate fibroblast recruitment during the fibroproliferative phase results in chronic wounds, whereas failure to terminate the fibroproliferative phase results in fibroproliferative disorders. Thus, understanding how to regulate the fibroproliferative phase of tissue repair is, therefore, of high clinical relevance. Controlling the rate of the fibroproliferative response is essential to promote proper wound repair.(1) The myofibroblast is essential for mediating the fibroproliferative phase of tissue repair. (2) The potent profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a major in vivo contributor to myofibroblast differentiation and activity in vivo.An increasing body of evidence indicates that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) plays a key in vivo role in suppressing the fibrogenic response by antagonizing TGF-β signaling. Excessive scarring and/or chronic wounds, caused by a dysregulated fibroproliferative phase, are major clinical problems in response to tissue injury.The development of drugs to control the rate of the fibroproliferative response are clinically relevant. Controlling PPAR-γ activity may be useful for prevention of scarring as well as for promoting the closure of chronic wounds.",

Recent Advances: In addition to existing standard imaging modalities that are used for clinical evaluation of patients suffering from traumatic extremity injury, novel noninvasive imaging techniques are in development that may facilitate rapid and sensitive assessment of various aspects of traumatic extremity injuries and residual limb health. Critical Issues: Despite recent advances, there remains a clinical need for noninvasive quantitative imaging techniques that are capable of providing rapid objective assessments of residual limb health at the time of initial presentation as well as after various forms of medical treatment. Future Directions: Ongoing development of imaging techniques that allow for assessment of anatomical and physiological characteristics of extremities exposed to traumatic injury should greatly enhance the quality of patient care and assist in optimizing clinical outcomes.",

Results: A standardized methodology that employs noninvasive imaging and probe-based approaches to measure residual limb skin health are described.

    "abstract": "Objective: Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are one of the most common complications in lower extremity wounds. To date, clinicians employ visual inspection of the wound site during its healing process by monitoring surface granulation and reduction in wound size across weeks of treatment. In this study, a handheld near-infrared optical scanner (NIROS) has been developed at the Optical Imaging Laboratory to differentiate healing from nonhealing VLUs based on differences in blood flow to the wound and its surroundings. Approach: Noncontact near-infrared (NIR) area imaging of 12 VLUs have been carried out at two podiatric clinics. Diffuse reflectance images of the wounds were used to quantify optical contrasts between the wound and its surroundings. The variability in imaging conditions, analysis, and operator dependency were assessed to determine the robustness of the imaging approach. Results: Optical contrast obtained from diffuse reflectance images of VLUs were distinctly different for healing (positive contrast) and nonhealing (negative contrast) wounds, independent of the varying imaging and data analysis conditions. Innovation: NIR imaging of wounds to differentiate healing from nonhealing VLUs using a noncontact wide-area imager has been demonstrated for the first time. Conclusion: The application of a portable handheld imager to assess the healing or nonhealing nature of VLUs during weekly clinical treatment is significant since physiological changes, as observed using NIROS, manifest before visual reduction in wound size during the healing process.",

This review describes the characteristics of KTS with wound complications in light of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the disease. Recent Advances: KTS is a slow-flow combined vascular malformation characterized by the triad of capillary malformation, venous malformation with or without lymphatic malformation, and limb overgrowth. KTS is encompassed within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), having recently been linked to activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This clearly has implications for both molecular diagnosis and potential treatment strategies for the disease. Critical Issues: KTS should be distinguished from Parkes Weber syndrome, a fast-flow-type combined vascular malformation with limb overgrowth. Individualized management is needed for KTS and should be focused on the treatment of symptoms.

However, its effects have not been studied in surgically wounded skin. Given the significant clinical applications of modulating the inflammatory response in wound healing, we examined the role of mMCP-4 and the effect of its inhibitor chymostatin on leukocyte and polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) recruitment in our skin model. Approach: Recruitment was assessed on day-1 postwounding of three groups of mice (n = 10 each): mMCP-4 null mice, wild-type (WT) mice treated with the mMCP-4 inhibitor chymostatin, and WT with no other intervention. Leukocytes were stained with CD-45 cell marker, and PMN cells were stained with chloroacetate esterase. Results: The WT mice had 27 ± 9 leukocytes per field compared with 11 ± 6 for the mMCP-4 nulls, a decrease of 60% (p = 0.03), whereas the chymostatin-injected group had a count comparable with the uninjected WT controls at 24 ± 9. The WT group had a PMN count of 96 ± 12 cells, compared with just 24 ± 8 in the mMCP-4 null group, a decrease of 75% (p = 0.001), whereas the chymostatin-treated group had 60 ± 18 cells, a decrease of 38% compared with the WT group (p = 0.03). Innovation: We showed that the inflammatory process can be influenced by impeding the arrival of PMNs into the surgically injured site using the mMCP-4 inhibitor chymostatin.

    "abstract": "Objective: No active treatment is required in the majority of cases of infantile hemangioma (IH), while they proliferate and involute without sequelae. However, ulceration, bleeding, or destruction/obstruction of important structures may occur in 10% of cases during the proliferating phase. These lesions lead to a disfigured appearance with redundant skin, fibrofatty residuum, protruding surface, drooping, and scarring. This study focused on prevention and management of disfiguring scars in involuted IH. Approach: A retrospective photography and chart review were performed for patients with IH who visited our hospital (Shinshu University Hospital). Results: The study population consisted of 107 patients with IH. The lesions were located on the head and neck (59.8%), trunk (27.1%), upper limb (7.5%), or lower limb (5.6%). Twenty-four patients (22.4%) underwent surgical excision of the disfigured lesion after involution. The percentage of surgical interventions was highest for lesions in the head and neck area (28.9%) compared with other regions. The fibrofatty tissue and redundant skin after involution of each lesion were partly resected and sutured. All suture lines were finally set on the wrinkle line or the anatomical borderline. Innovation: Although total excision of the lesion was impossible in some cases, a natural surface contour was obtained. The operative scar was not visible in the residual damaged skin after involution. Conclusion: Effective preventive therapies during the proliferating phase are required to avoid tissue damage due to hyperexpansion of the surrounding tissue and surface breakdown to present excellent cosmetic results in patients with IH.",

    "abstract": "Residual limb wounds or ulcers are one of the most frequent skin problems reported by lower extremity prosthesis users. Healing often requires prosthesis disuse, which can logically impair physical functioning. However, there are limited data available to support this idea. We report the impact of prosthesis disuse by presenting assessments of balance, gait, physical activity, and balance confidence obtained on a case subject before experiencing a wound and following reintroduction to a well-fit prosthesis after wound-related prosthesis disuse. The case subject was a 76-year-old male who suffered a unilateral, transtibial amputation due to synovial sarcoma 13 years before. After presenting with a history of pain in the area of a chronic skin plaque, he received a punch biopsy, which resulted in 4 weeks of prosthesis disuse followed by 12 weeks of limited use before a final well-fitting socket was received. The following data were collected 24 weeks before the biopsy and 4 weeks after receiving the final well-fitting socket: Berg Balance Scale, L-test of walking, quantitative gait analysis, Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and 1 week of community-based activity. Balance confidence decreased nearly 19%, walking speed decreased by 12%, and steps/day decreased by 19% following ∼4 months of prosthesis disuse/limited use; functional measures were not impacted. Lower balance confidence is not trivial as it can lead to activity avoidance and increased fall risk. Interventions to target balance confidence changes following prosthesis disuses may be important to minimize the impact of disuse on physical and mental well-being.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: The Tight Skin 2 (Tsk2) mouse model of systemic sclerosis (SSc) has many features of human disease, including tight skin, excessive collagen deposition, alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), increased elastic fibers, and occurrence of antinuclear antibodies with age. A tight skin phenotype is observed by 2 weeks of age, but measurable skin fibrosis is only apparent at 10 weeks. We completed a series of wound healing experiments to determine how fibrosis affects wound healing in Tsk2/+ mice compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. Method: We performed these experiments by introducing four 4 mm biopsy punched wounds on the back of each mouse, ventral of the midline, and observed wound healing over 10 days. Tsk2/+ mice showed significantly delayed wound healing and increased wound size compared with the WT littermates at both 5 and 10 weeks of age. We explored the potential sources of this response by wounding Tsk2/+ mice that were genetically deficient either for the NLRP3 inflammasome (a known fibrosis mediator), or for elastic fibers in the skin, using a fibulin-5 knockout. Conclusion: We found that the loss of elastic fibers restores normal wound healing in the Tsk2/+ mouse and that the loss of the NLRP3 inflammasome had no effect. We conclude that elastic fiber dysregulation is the primary cause of delayed wound healing in the Tsk2/+ mouse and therapies that promote collagen deposition in the tissue matrix in the absence of elastin deposition might be beneficial in promoting wound healing in SSc and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Complex skin defects resulting from acute skin trauma and chronic, nonhealing wounds are life-threatening injuries. Infection is one of the most common obstacles to the healing of these types of wounds. Host defense peptides (HDPs) possessing a broad spectrum of activity against microorganisms and serving as innate immune modulators have emerged as potential treatment strategies for infected wounds.The increase in multidrug-resistant clinical bacterial isolates highlights the need for new and innovative anti-infective therapies for the treatment of both acute and chronic skin wounds.To address the critical need for new therapeutic options to reduce infection and improve wound healing, a bioengineered skin substitute (BSS) tissue has been created to act as an anti-infective living human skin tissue that provides enhanced expression of the endogenous HDP, cathelicidin. To generate a BSS exhibiting these antimicrobial properties, the clinically tested NIKS progenitor cells were employed to provide a source of genetically uniform, nontumorigenic, pathogen-free human keratinocytes that are amenable to genetic engineering using nonviral means.Pathogenic bacterial strains are increasingly developing antibiotic resistance, thereby forcing the clinician to use potent antibiotics with deleterious effects on keratinocyte viability and migration. Therefore, an urgent need exists for new wound therapies that can circumvent many of the problems associated with current antibiotic treatments.Enhanced expression of cathelicidin in a genetically engineered human BSS has been shown to inhibit the bacterial growth of a multidrug-resistant clinical strain of Acinetobacter baumannii in vivo, creating a new and innovative therapeutic option for combating these debilitating wound infections while also promoting healing.",

It is commonly used in the coverage of ankle and heel defects and chronic nonhealing ulcers of the foot; its use is reported to have a favorable long-term outcome. The muscle's apt bulk and size, its simple surgical isolation, absence of donor-site defect, unvaried anatomy, and long neurovascular pedicle are some of the advantages that make it a promising muscle flap. During routine cadaver dissection in the Department of Anatomy of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry, India, we identified an anatomical variation in AH in both feet of a 45-year-old embalmed male Indian cadaver. The variant muscle had innumerable proximal attachments, a majority of them arising atypically in the form of tough tendinous slips from the medial intermuscular septum at the junction of central and tibial components of plantar aponeurosis, the medial surface of first metatarsal and the intermuscular septum separating AH from the flexor hallucis brevis. The tendon: muscle ratio was 1.76, higher than the normal reported ratio of 0.56±0.07. This article highlights the variation noted and its implication for clinicians. On Internet search, we did not come across the variations described in our article. Findings of the anatomical variation reported in this article could benefit surgeons who decide to use AH flaps in the future.",

Approach: This analysis was designed to compare the effectiveness of a bioengineered living cellular construct (BLCC) to a cryopreserved cadaveric skin allograft (CCSA) for the treatment of VLUs. Treatment records were collected from a large wound care-specific electronic medical record database on 717 patients (799 VLUs) receiving treatment at 177 wound care centers. Ulcers ≥28 days duration, between ≥1 and < 40 cm2 that closed ≤40% within the 28 days before treatment were included. Results: Patient baseline demographics and wound characteristics were comparable between groups. The median time to wound closure was 52% faster with BLCC compared with CCSA (15 weeks vs. 31 weeks). In addition, the proportion of wounds healed were significantly higher for BLCC by 12 weeks (42% vs. 24%) and 24 weeks (65% vs. 41%) (p = 0.0002). Treatment with BLCC increased the probability of healing by 97% compared with CCSA (hazard ratio = 1.97 [95% confidence interval 1.39–2.79], p = 0.0002). Innovation: This is the first real-world comparative effectiveness analysis to evaluate BLCC and CCSA for the treatment of VLUs. Conclusion: Treatment with a bioengineered cellular technology significantly improved the incidence and speed of wound closure compared with a CCSA.",

Our aim is to present a clear format for functional testing of a skin scarring ointment, using noninvasive and invasive measurements, categorizing findings under the physiological, structural, and mechanical parameters of a scar. Approach: A double-blinded, randomized volunteer research study of 45 subjects receiving an ointment composing of natural ingredients against a widely used antiscarring topical used as a positive control with temporal sequential punch biopsies (up to 16 weeks) was evaluated using noninvasive quantitative devices and validated by gene and protein studies. Results: Outcome measures included physiological, mechanical, and structural features of scars. Significant non-invasive findings included an increase in skin hydration (p < 0.05) at week (W) 4, 8, and 12, and elasticity (W16; p = 0.009). These findings were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Hyaluronic acid IHC (W4 p = 0.014, W12 p = 0.034, and W16 p = 0.042), qRT-PCR (W16 p = 0.049); Collagen I (W16 p = 0.034, and 0.049) IHC and qRT-PCR, respectively.

    "abstract": "Significance: Fractional resurfacing involves producing arrays of microinjuries on the skin, by thermal or mechanical means, to trigger tissue regeneration. Originally developed for cosmetic enhancement, fractional resurfacing induces a broad array of improvements in the structural and functional qualities of the treated skin and is especially effective at returning defective skin to a more normal state. In addition to fascinating questions about the nature of this remarkable regenerative capacity, there may be potential utility in ulcer prevention by halting or even reversing the progressive decline in overall skin quality that usually precedes chronic wound development. Recent Advances: Photoaging and scarring are the two skin defects most commonly treated by fractional resurfacing, and the treatment produces profound and long-lasting improvements in skin quality, both clinically and at the cellular/histologic level. Chronic wounds usually occur in skin that is compromised by various pathologic factors, and many of the defects found in this ulcer-prone skin are similar to those that have seen improvements after fractional resurfacing. Critical Issues: The mechanisms responsible for the regenerative capacity of fractional resurfacing are mostly unknown, as is how ulcer-prone skin, which is usually afflicted by stressors external to the skin tissue itself, would respond to fractional resurfacing. Future Directions: Better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the unique healing response to fractional resurfacing could reveal fundamental information about adult tissue regeneration, lead to improvements in current applications, as well as new therapies in other pathologic conditions.",

Approach: WCM, a highly purified homogenate of 2.6% fibrillar bovine dermal collagen that conforms to the wound surface, was evaluated in comparison to daily saline-moistened gauze dressing changes (SOC) as part of a retrospective subset analysis of a randomized controlled trial in DFU. Following a 2-week run-in period during which patients received SOC, patients whose wounds did not reduce in area by >30% during run-in were randomly assigned to receive WCM (one or two applications) or SOC. Results: Statistically significant acceleration of early healing rates was observed following a single application of WCM with weekly outer dressing changes compared with daily saline-moistened gauze dressing changes (SOC). Over a 4-week period, 50% of patients receiving a single application of WCM achieved ≥75% reduction in wound area compared with 13% for SOC. WCM appeared to be safe and well tolerated, with no adverse events related to treatment and no evidence of an immunologic reaction to bovine collagen. Innovation: WCM is unique in its intimate contact with the wound bed and its ability to progress a wound toward healing with a single application. Conclusion: WCM is a treatment modality to accelerate DFU healing rates, with the potential to reduce the likelihood of infection and other complications, and cost of care.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Flightless I (Flii), a cytoskeletal protein and inhibitor of wound healing, on EpSC activation during wound repair. Approach: Genetically modified Flii mice (Flii knockdown: Flii+/−, wild type: WT, Flii overexpressing: FliiTg/Tg) received two incisional wounds along the lateral axis of the dorsal skin. Indicators of EpSC activation (epidermal growth factor receptor 1 [EGFR1], leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains-1 [Lrig1], K14), Wnt/β-Cat signaling (Lgr6, Flap2, β-Cat, and axis inhibition protein 2 [Axin2]), and cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. β-Cat stabilization was examined using western blotting with cell cycling and differentiation of isolated CD34+ITGA6high EpSCs examined using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction after treatment with wound-conditioned media. Results:Flii+/− led to increased numbers of activated EpSCs expressing PCNA, elevated EGFR1, and decreased Lrig1. EpSCs in Flii+/− hair follicle niches adjacent to the wounds also showed expression of Wnt-activation markers including increased β-Cat and Lgr6, and decreased Axin2. EpSCs (CD34+ITGA6high) isolated from Flii+/− unwounded skin showed elevated expression of cell-cycling genes including ΔNp63, filaggrin (Fila), involucrin (Invo), cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), and cell-division cycle protein-20 (Cdc20); and elevated ΔNp63 and Invo after treatment with wound-conditioned media compared with WT and FliiTg/Tg counterparts. Innovation: Flii was identified as an inhibitor of EpSC activation that may explain its negative effects on wound reepithelialization. Conclusion: Flii may inhibit EpSC activation by interrupting Wnt/β-Cat signaling. Strategies that reduce Flii may increase activation of EpSCs and promote reepithelialization of wounds.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Clinical studies have demonstrated that the use of cryopreserved amnion or trophoblast (TR)-free chorion, containing viable cells, in the treatment of chronic wounds results in high rate of wound closure. Recently, a new lyopreservation method has been developed for preservation of amnion that also retains the endogenous viable cells. The objective of this study was to use this method for lyopreservation of TR-free chorionic membrane (viable lyopreserved chorionic membrane [VLCM]) and compare it with the viable cryopreserved chorionic membrane (VCCM). A second objective was to investigate the immunogenicity of chorion, an important question that has not been fully addressed. Approach: Chorion immunogenicity was tested in vitro in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge assay, and in vivo in a mouse subcutaneous pocket implantation model. VLCM tissue structure was assessed histologically, growth factor content by multiplex assay, and cell viability by LIVE/DEAD cell fluorescent staining. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α secretion by LPS-activated THP-1 cells and endothelial cell tubule formation assays were performed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic properties, respectively. An in vivo rabbit abdominal adhesion model was used to evaluate the antifibrotic properties. Results: Chorionic membrane without trophoblast (CM) was shown to be nonimmunogenic. Tissue architecture, growth factors, and cell viability of fresh CM were maintained in VLCM and VCCM. In vitro studies showed that anti-inflammatory and angiogenic properties were retained in VLCM. Furthermore, VLCM prevents formation of postsurgical adhesions in a rabbit abdominal surgical adhesion model. Innovation: Characterization of structural and functional properties of VLCM is reported for the first time. Conclusion: Similar to VCCM, VLCM retains native components of fresh CM, including collagen-rich extracellular matrix, growth factors, and viable cells. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that VLCM is anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic and antifibrotic. Results of this study support the structural and functional equivalency between VLCM and VCCM.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Approximately 6.5 million people in the United States suffer from chronic wounds. The chronic wound population is typically older and is characterized by a number of comorbidities associated with inflammation. In addition to experiencing wound-related pain, individuals with chronic wounds commonly experience multiple concurrent psychoneurological symptoms such as fatigue and depression, which delay wound healing. However, these distressing symptoms have been relatively overlooked in this population, although their adverse effects on morbidity are well established in other chronic disease populations. Recent Advances: Inflammation is involved in multiple pathways, which activate brain endothelial and innate immune cells that release proinflammatory cytokines, which produce multiple symptoms known as sickness behaviors. Inflammation-based activation of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway and its metabolites is a mechanism associated with chronic illnesses. Critical Issues: Although putative humoral and neuronal routes have been identified, the specific metabolic variations involved in sickness behaviors in chronic wound patients remain unclear. To improve health outcomes in the chronic wound population, clinicians need to have better understanding of the mechanisms underlying sickness behaviors to provide appropriate treatments. Future Directions: This article presents a synthesis of studies investigating associations between inflammation, metabolic pathways, and sickness behaviors in multiple chronic diseases. The presentation of a theoretical framework proposes a mechanism underlying sickness behaviors in the chronic wound population. By mediating the immune system response, dysregulated metabolites in the KYN pathway may play an important role in sickness behaviors in chronic inflammatory conditions. This framework may guide researchers in developing new treatments to reduce the disease burden in the chronic wound population.",

    "abstract": "Objective: One of the leading causes of death following traumatic injury is exsanguination. Biological material-based hemostatic agents such as fibrin, thrombin, and albumin have a high risk for causing infection. Synthetic peptide-based hemostatic agents offer an attractive alternative. The objective of this study is to explore the potential of h9e peptide as an effective hemostatic agent in both in vitro and in vivo models. Approach:In vitro blood coagulation kinetics in the presence of h9e peptide was determined as a function of gelation time using a dynamic rheometer. In vivo hemostatic effects were studied using the Wistar rat model. Results were compared to those of the commercial hemostatic product Celox™, a chitosan-based product. Adhesion of h9e peptide was evaluated using the platelet adhesion test. Biocompatibility of h9e peptide was studied in vivo using a mouse model. Results: After h9e peptide solution was mixed with blood, gelation started immediately, increased rapidly with time, and reached more than 100 Pa within 3 s. Blood coagulation strength increased as h9e peptide wt% concentration increased. In the rat model, h9e peptide solution at 5% weight concentration significantly reduced both bleeding time and blood loss, outperforming Celox. Preliminary pathological studies indicate that h9e peptide solution is biocompatible and did not have negative effects when injected subcutaneously in a mouse model. Innovation: For the first time, h9e peptide was found to have highly efficient hemostatic effects by forming nanoweb-like structures, which act as a preliminary thrombus and a surface to arrest bleeding 82% faster compared to the commercial hemostatic agent Celox. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that h9e peptide is a promising hemostatic biomaterial, not only because of its greater hemostatic effect than commercial product Celox but also because of its excellent biocompatibility based on the in vivo mouse model study.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease that affects 63 in every 100,000 Americans. Its etiology remains unknown, although inflammatory pathways appear to be important. Given the dynamic environment of the lung, we examined the significance of mechanotransduction on both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling during IPF. Innovation: Mechanotransduction pathways have not been thoroughly examined in the context of lung disease, and pharmacologic approaches for IPF do not currently target these pathways. The interplay between mechanical strain and inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely understood. Approach: In this study, we used conditional KO mice to block mechanotransduction by knocking out Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) expression in fibroblasts, followed by induction of pulmonary fibrosis using bleomycin. We examined both normal human and human IPF fibroblasts and used immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western Blot to evaluate the effects of FAK inhibitor (FAK-I) on modulating fibrotic and inflammatory genes. Results: Our data indicate that the deletion of FAK in mice reduces expression of fibrotic and inflammatory genes in lungs. Similarly, mechanical straining in normal human lung fibroblasts activates inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The FAK inhibition decreases these signals but has a less effect on IPF fibroblasts as compared with normal human fibroblasts. Conclusion: Administering FAK-I at early stages of fibrosis may attenuate the FAK-mediated fibrotic response pathway in IPF, potentially mediating disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The epidermis provides the main barrier function of skin, and therefore its repair following wounding is an essential component of wound healing. Repair of the epidermis, also known as reepithelialization, occurs by collective migration of epithelial cells from around the wound edge across the wound until the advancing edges meet and fuse. Therapeutic manipulation of this process could potentially be used to accelerate wound healing. Recent Advances: It is difficult to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms of reepithelialization in human tissue, so a variety of model organisms have been used to improve our understanding of the process. One model system that has been especially useful is the embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila, which provides a simple, accessible model of the epidermis and can be manipulated genetically, allowing detailed analysis of reepithelialization at the molecular level. This review will highlight the key insights that have been gained from studying reepithelialization in Drosophila embryos. Critical Issues: Slow reepithelialization increases the risk of wounds becoming infected and ulcerous; therefore, the development of therapies to accelerate or enhance the process would be a great clinical advance. Improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie reepithelialization will help in the development of such therapies. Future Directions: Research in Drosophila embryos has identified a variety of genes and proteins involved in triggering and driving reepithelialization, many of which are conserved in humans. These novel reepithelialization proteins are potential therapeutic targets and therefore findings obtained in Drosophila may ultimately lead to significant clinical advances.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop an efficacious and efficient method for treating chronic wounds using \"nanosheet\" that improves the survival and localization of transplanted cells without prior seeding to optimally derive the regenerative potentials of uncultured stromal vascular fraction cells. Approach: We propose a method whereby the wound is covered by uncultured stromal vascular fraction cells using the nanosheet (porous poly(D,L,-lactic acid) (PDLLA) films) designed to hold cells in a single-cell layer. A chronic wound model was created on 12-month-old db / db mice by inflecting a full-thickness skin excision on their dorsum and was subsequently given either no treatment or a treatment with SVF cells alone (with Tegaderm dressing), nanosheet alone, or nanosheet with SVF cells. Results: The placement of the nanosheet improved the grafted cell retention rate at day 10 timepoint by 5 folds, and the wound area was the smallest in the wounds treated with SVF cells plus nanosheet in comparison to the other groups. Collagen deposition and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were significantly higher in the wound beds treated with SVF cells with the nanosheet, offering some mechanistic insights. Innovation: Porous poly(D,L,-lactic acid) (PDLLA) films or \"nanosheet\" printed on the nanoscale (1-100 nm thick) as a cellular scaffold for cytotherapy for the treatment of chronic wounds. Conclusion: The use of the nanosheet is an effective way to improve the transplanted SVF cell retention and accelerate the overall wound closure.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant bacteria make many antibiotics ineffective; therefore, new approaches to combat microbial infections are needed. In addition, antibiotics are not selective-they kill pathogenic organisms as well as organisms that could positively contribute to wound healing (bio flora). Approach: Here we report on selective inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, potential pathogens involved in wound infections with pulsed electric fields (PEFs) and antibiotics (mix of penicillin, streptomycin, and nystatin). Results: Using a Taguchi experimental design in vitro, we found that, under similar electric field strengths, the pulse duration is the most important parameter for P. aeruginosa inactivation, followed by the number of pulses and pulse frequency. P. aeruginosa, a potential severe pathogen, is more sensitive than the less pathogenic S. epidermidis to PEF (alone or in combination with antibiotics). Applying 200 pulses with a duration of 60 μs at 2.8 Hz, the minimum electric fields of 308.8 ± 28.3 and 378.4 ± 12.9 V/mm were required to inactive P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis, respectively. Addition of antibiotics reduced the threshold for minimum electric fields required to inactivate the bacteria. Innovation: This study provides essential information, such as critical electric field parameters for bacteria inactivation, required for developing in vivo treatment and clinical protocols for using PEF for wound healing. Conclusion: A combination of PEFs with antibiotics reduces the electric field threshold required for bacteria disinfection. Such an approach simplifies devices required to disinfect large areas of infected wounds.",

In addition, the wound dressings were evaluated for their ability to suppress biofilms in a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro wound biofilm model and modulate the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). Approach: Problematic biofilms are well known to affect fibroblast and keratinocyte viability. To assess wound repair and inflammatory cytokine modulation, a direct cytotoxicity assay and a 3D keratinocyte-fibroblast model were employed. Results: At 1 and 7 days posttreatment, the non-antimicrobial dressing was noncytotoxic and the antimicrobial dressing was moderately cytotoxic to adult human dermal fibroblasts cells. Within the 3D wound model, the biofilm demonstrated a decelerating effect on wound closure and a decrease in viable cells. When the non-antimicrobial- and antimicrobial-based concentrated surfactant-based wound dressing was applied to the wound model, reduced biofilm was observed. The application of wound dressings to the biofilm-infected wound also resulted in a reduction of IL-6 and TNFα. The concentrated surfactant-based wound dressing without an antimicrobial was shown to enhance cellular viability and migration. Innovation and Conclusion: We have demonstrated the ability of a surfactant-based wound dressing to minimize the deleterious effects of a wound biofilm, modulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and enhance cellular proliferation in a biofilm-infected wound model. Furthermore, the non-antimicrobial-based concentrated surfactant dressings did not affect cellular viability and therefore represents a multifaceted approach to the treatment of wounds infected with biofilms.",

A decision-scoring model for TM implementation was constructed. Results: The cost per patient in TM modality, compared to the same-room care, was 7% higher; however, in a proportion similar to same-room care, the cost of TM was lower. The TM implementation decision score was 0.236, while the weight of the direct cost factors is 0.70. Face-to-face only model, compared to the study sample, demonstrated 30% higher costs.

Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of PARP1 inhibitor, rucaparib, for keloids. Approach: The protein expressions of PARP1 and smad3 were evaluated with western blotting in keloids and controls. The effect of rucaparib was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and migration assay. We further analyzed the effect of rucaparib on patient-derived keloid xenograft murine model. Results: The protein expressions of PARP1 and smad3 were significantly higher in keloid tissue. Rucaparib (20 μM) significantly suppressed the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts. Moreover, the combination of rucaparib (20 μM) and triamcinolone (50 μM) showed additive suppressive effect on keloid fibroblasts. Migration assay showed that rucaparib (10 μM) significantly suppressed the migration of keloid fibroblasts. Fibrosis markers in keloid fibroblasts significantly decreased after rucaparib treatment (20 μM). In patient-derived keloid xenograft model, rucaparib significantly reduced the size of keloid tissue. Innovation and Conclusion: The study data suggest PARP1 might be a novel therapeutic target for keloid disease. PARP1 inhibitor, rucaparib, might be a promising therapeutic drug for the treatment of keloid disease.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical efficacy and advantages of five-in-one comprehensive limb salvage technologies for the treatment of severe diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Approach: Clinical data for 120 patients with severe DFU treated between January 2012 and December 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The control group (48 cases) was treated with traditional therapies, including controlling blood sugar, improving microcirculation, preserving nerve function, and dressing changes, whereas the experimental group (72 cases) was treated with traditional therapy combined with additional techniques, such as early and thorough debridement, negative pressure wound therapy, revascularization, and skin graft or flap. Ankle–brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), wound healing rate, healing time, ulcer recurrence rate, and amputation rate were recorded. Results: Compared with the control group, the experimental group significantly improved wound healing rate (93.1% vs. 72.9%; p < 0.01), decreased wound healing time (16.2 ± 5.4 days vs. 32.2 ± 7.8 days; p < 0.05), reduced major limb amputation rate (1.4% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.05), and ulcer recurrence rate (5.6% vs. 14.6%; p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in amputation rate between experimental and control group (29.2% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.628). After revascularization, the revascularization group showed significantly improved ABI (0.75 ± 0.21 vs. 0.35 ± 0.16, p < 0.05) and TcPO2 (36 ± 6 mmHg vs. 15 ± 4 mmHg, p < 0.05). Innovation: We propose a five-in-one comprehensive treatment method, which provides a multidisciplinary cooperative model for comprehensive medical and surgical treatments for DFU. Conclusion: The five-in-one comprehensive limb salvage treatment technologies played a vital role in enhancing the healing rate of severe DFU, shortening the healing time, and reducing the rate of recurrence and major amputation, thus improving the overall quality of life.",

As the global population faces a rising burden of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, the prevalence of heart failure due to ischemic heart disease is estimated to increase. We sought to develop a model that may more accurately identify therapeutic targets to mitigate the development of heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). Approach: Having utilized fetal large mammalian models of scarless wound healing, we proposed a fetal ovine model of myocardial regeneration after MI. Results: Use of this model has identified critical pathways in the mammalian response to MI, which are differentially activated in the regenerative, fetal mammalian response to MI when compared to the reparative, scar-forming, adult mammalian response to MI. Innovation: While the foundation of myocardial regeneration research has been built on zebrafish and rodent models, effective therapies derived from these disease models have been lacking; therefore, we sought to develop a more representative ovine model of myocardial regeneration after MI to improve the identification of therapeutic targets designed to mitigate the development of heart failure following MI. Conclusions: To develop therapies aimed at mitigating this rising burden of disease, it is critical that the animal models we utilize closely reflect the physiology and pathology we observe in human disease. We encourage use of this ovine large mammalian model to facilitate identification of therapies designed to mitigate the growing burden of heart failure.",

Retained foams are among its side effects, and they pose a rare but devastating complication at the site of this therapy, which might be associated with wound-healing complications, infection persistence, repeated surgical revisions, and prolonged antibiotic courses. Recent Advances: In the past 15 years, an increasing number of studies have identified this potential problem. Although the exact incidence remains unknown, initial studies have indicated rates of up to 10% in large collectives being treated by NPWT. Critical Issues: The lack of radiopaque markers does not allow for the visual control of retained foams using plain radiographs. Further imaging methods (e.g., CT and MRI) also do not help in adequate differential diagnosis. The lack of routine documentation of the number, type, and localization of the inserted foam(s) and unplanned surgery with a different surgical team pose risk factors for foam retainment. Future Directions: Introducing new documentation records for wounds treated with NPWT is recommended. At foam removal, all dressing materials should be examined for integrity. The development of foams with radiopaque markers by the industry, such as those routinely used in surgical gauze swabs, might also be a useful step to minimize the risk of foam retainment within wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Skin scarring is a permanent, irreversible end point of cutaneous injury. However, not everyone will acquire the same exact scar type. Skin scarring is generally recognized as complex with significant variability in individuals' scar type and response to treatment. Despite these tangible differences in treatment response, to date there has been no simplified approach in defining spectrum of skin scarring in relation to prediction and outcome post-treatment. Thus, in this study we propose that skin scarring consists of distinct endotypes, which is characterized by their specific pathology. Four distinct scar endotypes can be observed: (1) Stretched (flat), (2) Contracted, (3) Atrophic (depressed), and (4) Raised scarring, which can be abbreviated to S.C.A.R. endotypes. Each of these endotypes can certainly include subphenotypes and each phenotype can be present in more than one endotype. To define these endotypes, we also present a structured approach in assessment of all relevant parameters in skin scar evaluation including clinical (scar symptoms and signs) and nonclinical parameters (device measurements of structural, mechanical, and physiological properties of scars as well as gene and protein laboratory studies). Recent Advances: Scars can be phenotypically characterized based on a multitude of parameters assessed; however, not all scar types will share all the same characteristics. This leads to the question of whether skin scarring is a single disease entity with varying phenotypic characteristics or should be classed as several disease entities that have certain similar parameters. We suggest the latter and propose distinct scarring phenotypes arise mainly owing to genetic and environmental susceptibilities associated with the development of each specific scar endotype. Characteristic features of skin scarring, however, can be objectively and quantitively evaluated and used as an aid in the theranostic goal-directed management of scarring. Critical Issues: The concept of identifying different endotypes is key in formulating personalized treatments with improved outcomes beyond what is achieved with current nonspecific approaches in scar management. This approach has gained interest and significant traction in several other medical conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Future Directions: To begin identifying distinct endotypic features in skin scarring, it is important to have a better understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms leading to further insight into the heterogeneous nature of skin scarring endotypes. This approach may lead to improved theranostic outcomes and further understanding of the pathophysiology of the complex nature of human skin scarring.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Hypertrophic scars (HTS) and keloids are common after thermal injuries and other trauma to deep regions of dermis of the skin. These abnormal scars can cause contractures and the thick masses of scar tissue that result in functional and cosmetic impairment. Management of these dermal fibrotic conditions includes a wide range of medical and surgical treatments, which can be time consuming, only partially effective, and often uncomfortable for patients. Recent Advances: The molecular pathophysiology of HTS has become more understood over the past two decades, where thermal injury to the reticular dermis results in an inflammatory response, fibrogenic growth factor release, and the formation of a dermal scar with increased collagen and proteoglycan composition in an abnormal morphology. Lasers are becoming a widely used form of treatment for these types of scars; however, the evidence for the beneficial effects of laser treatments and the understanding of their mechanism of action are still evolving. Critical Issues: Paradoxically, laser delivery of thermal energy to the skin is suggested to improve scar remodeling and wound healing, yet HTS is a well-recognized complication of excessive thermal energy delivered by laser treatments. This review aims to examine the current evidence for the use of lasers for HTS, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms where re-injury of a burn scar from laser treatment could result in overall improvements in scar quality. Future Directions: Improved design of clinical trials for the treatment of scarring in the future will evolve from new methodology and models of HTS in animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In this work, we introduce a novel hyperosmotic nanoemulsion (HNE) topical agent for use in wound healing. These topical emulsion complexes combine a lipophilic thymol nanoemulsion with a hyperosmotic saccharide matrix. This combination has been previously shown to possess synergistic antimicrobial activity against a host of common and drug-resistant pathogens in vitro. Approach: In this study, we present additional data to assess the safety and efficacy of these emulsions in a partial thickness injury model in swine. Ten wounds sized 2 × 3.5 cm were created in 18 pigs using an electrodermatome set at a depth of 0.76 mm. The wounds were subsequently contaminated with a cocktail of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans at 5 × 107 total colony forming unit per wound. Treatments were subdivided in the control group and emulsion concentrations at 0.0%, 0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.063% thymol content. Longitudinal metrics for wound healing included rate of reepithelialization, wound bed color measurements, amount of wound exudate, wound swab culture data, and histological examination at 4, 7, and 14 days. The cosmetics of the healed wound were obtained at day 14 with three-dimensional photogrammetry. Results: Experimental results showed that HNE reduced the wound level bacteria count by ∼0.5-1 log versus controls after 24 h. The amount of pathogen reduction was weakly correlated to the concentration of the emulsion. In addition, all HNE groups maintained a moist wound environment and showed increased fibrin formation and improved hemostatic response. Innovation: No significant difference in the rate of reepithelialization or wound closure was found between treatment concentrations and control groups. HNE treatment did not demonstrate any adverse host tissue response. Conclusion: These results suggest HNE may be a candidate for reducing wound bacterial counts without compromising reepithelialization.",

Approach: This is an experimental analysis of membrane potential and cell migration of murine fibroblasts when grown in treated media that has been reconstituted with an aqueous solution that has been exposed to an EMF, which is generated by this device versus fibroblasts grown in identically prepared control media that has not been exposed to the EMF. Results: The growth of fibroblasts in the treated media shows a strong percent change in polarization of the plasma membrane and significant increase in cell migration compared to control groups. Innovation: These experiments show the potential for an adjunct wound care therapy using a continuous DC EMF application through a medium of water. Conclusion: Growth media that was reconstituted with an aqueous solution that had been exposed to this DC derived EMF shows significant changes in cell polarity and cell migration of fibroblasts in vitro. The BEFE device has shown enhanced chronic wound healing in anecdotal reports from patients globally for decades when used as a footbath/bath and could lead to a novel EMF application in wound healing.",

We compared the effectiveness of vCPM with other CTPs on: (1) reduction of post-treatment ulcer occurrence, and (2) reduction in 1 year mortality. We controlled for selection bias and differential risk characteristics between comparison groups in a two-stage inverse probability treatment weighting model. Results: Overall, 7,869 DFU episodes with CTP use met inclusion criteria: 786 received vCPM, 4,546 received another \"cellular\" CTP, and 2,537 received \"acellular\" CTP. For ulcer occurrence, we examined: 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365 days post-treatment. We found a significant reduction in ulcers at each period for vCPM compared with either alternative CTP-results range from a 36.7% percentage point reduction in ulcer occurrence at 30 days compared with cellular CTP, and a 58.5% percentage point reduction at 365 days compared with acellular CTP. Further, the application of vCPM reduces mortality within 1 year by 2.3 percentage points (13-13.8% change) compared with other CTPs. Innovation: This study examines the differences in ulcer occurrence and mortality for Medicare DFU patients receiving vCPM and other CTPs. Our strict DFU definition excludes beneficiaries without foot ulcer with demonstrated diabetes etiology.

    "abstract": "Objective: Recent preliminary reports indicate that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) might be useful for chronic wounds, especially venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. However, there is limited evidence for the utility and safety of ESWT in pressure ulcers (PUs). Therefore, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to assess immediate planimetric and clinical effects following a single radial ESWT session in PUs. Approach: A group of 40 patients with PUs was randomly assigned into 2 groups: active ESWT (n = 20), which underwent a single treatment with radial ESWT (300 + 100 impulses/1 cm2, 2.5 bars, 0.15 mJ/mm2, and 5 Hz) and placebo ESWT (n = 20), which was exposed to sham-radial ESWT. All patients continued standard wound care procedures. The planimetric assessment and clinical outcomes using Wound Bed Score (WBS) and Bates–Jansen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) were assessed before (M0) and after ESWT sessions (M1). Results: There was a significant planimetric enhancement observed after active ESWT reported as a reduction in all metric parameters: wound area from 11.51 to 8.09 cm2 (p < 0.001), wound length from 4.97 to 4.41 cm (p < 0.001), and wound width from 3.15 to 2.49 cm (p < 0.0001). Also, there was a significant beneficial clinical improvement observed with a WBS as an increased score from 3.85 to 9.65 points (p < 0.001) and with the BWAT as a decreased score from 45.45 to 30.70 points (p < 0.001). In turn, a regression in the placebo ESWT group was observed in all studied outcomes. Innovation: This study is the first RCT to provide the positive and immediate clinical effects of radial ESWT in promoting the healing of PUs. Conclusion: This preliminary RCT showed that even a single session of ESWT is a promising and clinically effective modality in managing PUs. However, there is still limited data regarding the usefulness of ESWT in PUs, and further studies are in demand.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study is to characterize breath-hold (BH)-induced oxygenation changes in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and develop an oxygenation flow index (OFI) to discern nonhealing from healing DFUs. Approach: The imaging approach utilizes an innovative BH stimulus that induces vasoconstriction and measures for altering oxygenation flow in and around the tissues of DFUs and controls. The modified Beer–Lambert law was utilized to calculate hemoglobin-based spatiotemporal oxygenation maps in terms of oxygen saturation. Results: We found controls had synchronous BH-induced oxygenation changes across the dorsal (OFI: 29.0%) and plantar (OFI: 57.6%) aspects of the foot. Nonhealing DFUs, however, had less synchronous BH-induced oxygenation changes (OFI <28%). In addition, two complicated healing DFU cases, or cases with underlying issues or poor long-term healing outcomes, were observed to have OFIs <28%. Innovation: An OFI was developed to differentiate nonhealing DFUs from healing DFUs using a single, noncontact, near-infrared optical scanner for spatiotemporal oxygenation monitoring. The OFI has potential to provide immediate feedback on the microcirculation in DFUs, through hemoglobin-based oxygenation parameters. Conclusion: A preliminary threshold (OFI <28%) could differentiate nonhealing and complicated DFUs from healing DFUs. The overall oxygenation flow pattern was less synchronous (or the OFI value reduced) in the nonwound areas of the feet that were nonhealing. In other words, the reduced OFI value (<28%) in the entire foot, excluding the wound region is a possible indicator that the wound may not heal.",

    "abstract": "The first step to a successful reimbursement strategy is to ensure that your wound care product has the most appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code (or billing) for your product. The correct HCPCS code plays an essential role in patient access to new and existing technologies. When devising a strategy to obtain a HCPCS code for its product, companies must consider a number of factors as follows: (1) Has the product gone through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory process or does it need to do so? Will the FDA code designation impact which HCPCS code will be assigned to your product? (2) In what \"site of service\" do you intend to market your product? Where will your customers use the product? Which coding system (CPT® or HCPCS) applies to your product? (3) Does a HCPCS code for a similar product already exist? Does your product fit under the existing HCPCS code? (4) Does your product need a new HCPCS code? What is the linkage, if any, between coding, payment, and coverage for the product? Researchers and companies need to start early and place the same emphasis on a reimbursement strategy as it does on a regulatory strategy. Your reimbursement strategy staff should be involved early in the process, preferably during product research and development and clinical trial discussions.",

    "abstract": "Integrins are transmembrane proteins that are present in the plasma membrane of basal ketatinocytes and connect them to the underlying basement membrane and to the dermis. There are primarily two types of interactions between the epidermis and the dermis-via focal adhesion plaques and hemidesmosomes. It is critical that these interactions form properly to confer the skin strong mechanical properties. Integrins are also critical during wound healing, particularly in closure of the wound.Margadant et al. (2009) address proper closure of cutaneous wounds. They developed a conditional knockout mouse for integrin α3 and showed that the absence of the α3 integrin resulted in faster migration of the keratinocytes during wound healing. However, its absence also led to inflammation, hair loss, basement membrane duplication, and loss of dermal epidermal interactions with blister formation. The latter has important consequences for the ability of the skin to withstand mechanical challenges.Models such as the conditional model developed by Margadant et al. (2009) will provide the opportunity for making major advances in understanding the complex function of integrins during healing.The model and the findings provide an opportunity to decipher mechanisms of disease and for potential development of treatments for human skin disorders and impaired healing, including chronic ulcers.This work provides knowledge that leads to the understanding of delayed re-epithelialization during wound healing and dermal epidermal defects, blistering, and chronic skin diseases, hence providing the opportunity to understand the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in these situations.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Steady electric fields (EFs) surround cells and tissues in vivo and may regulate cellular behavior during development, wound healing, or tissue regeneration. Application of exogenous EFs of similar magnitude as those found in vivo can direct migration, growth, and division in most cell types, ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. These EF effects have therapeutic potential, for instance, in accelerating wound healing or improving nerve repair. EFs are thought to signal through the plasma membrane to locally activate or recruit components of the cytoskeleton and the polarity machinery. How EFs might function to steer polarity is, however, poorly understood at a molecular level. Recent Advances: Here, we review recent work introducing genetically tractable systems, such as yeast and Dictyostelium cells, that begin to identify proteins and pathways involved in this response both at the level of ion transport at the membrane and at the level of cytoskeleton regulation. Critical Issues: These studies highlight the complexity of these EF effects and bring important novel views on core polarity regulation. Future Directions: Future work pursuing initial screening in model organisms should generate broad mechanistic understanding of electrotactic effects.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Technological advances have provided new alternatives to the analysis of skin flap viability in animal models; however, the interrater validity and reliability of these techniques have yet to be analyzed. The present study aimed to evaluate the interrater validity and reliability of three different methods: weight of paper template (WPT), paper template area (PTA), and photographic analysis. Approach: Sixteen male Wistar rats had their cranially based dorsal skin flap elevated. On the seventh postoperative day, the viable tissue area and the necrotic area of the skin flap were recorded using the paper template method and photo image. The evaluation of the percentage of viable tissue was performed using three methods, simultaneously and independently by two raters. The analysis of interrater reliability and viability was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland Altman Plot Analysis was used to visualize the presence or absence of systematic bias in the evaluations of data validity. Results: The results showed that interrater reliability for WPT, measurement of PTA, and photographic analysis were 0.995, 0.990, and 0.982, respectively. For data validity, a correlation >0.90 was observed for all comparisons made between the three methods. In addition, Bland Altman Plot Analysis showed agreement between the comparisons of the methods and the presence of systematic bias was not observed. Innovation: Digital methods are an excellent choice for assessing skin flap viability; moreover, they make data use and storage easier. Conclusion: Independently from the method used, the interrater reliability and validity proved to be excellent for the analysis of skin flaps' viability.",

Approach: Forty Wistar rats were selected. Among these, 32 were submitted to total tenotomy of the calcaneous tendon and divided into 5 groups: control group (CG, n = 8), without tenotomy or any treatment; tenotomy group (n = 8), with tenotomy and without treatment; TUS groups-TUS3 (n = 8), TUS4 (n = 8), and TUS5 (n = 8)-submitted to tenotomy and treated with TUS for 3, 4, and 5 min per effective radiating area (ERA), respectively. The animals were sacrificed on the 12th postoperative day. The tendons were surgically removed for analysis of the collagen fiber organization using the birefringence technique (OR, optical retardation). Results: The collagen fibers exhibited better aggregation and organization in the UST3, TUS4, and TUS5 groups compared with CG (p < 0.05). The TUS5 group had better response rates in intergroup comparison. Innovation: The dose response of therapeutic TUS is influenced by many variables. The scientific evidence to support the dosimetry is insufficient. The application time is an important variable to be considered in TUS. In this study, the longer the application time, the better for organization and aggregation of collagen fibers in the rat tendon. Conclusion: TUS applied for 5 min per ERA presented higher dose response to the organization of collagen fibers in the healing process of rat Achilles tendon rupture.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to illustrate the differences in the cost-to-heal wounds using two methods: (1) reimbursement-based costing and (2) activity-based costing (ABC). Approach: A small cohort (100 patients with multiple wounds of which 1 was a diabetic foot ulcer [DFU]) was randomly selected from the U.S. Wound Registry to be representative of all patients with DFUs in the registry. Unit costs, resource utilization, and total costs were estimated through both methods. For the ABC method, costs were calculated in ranges: low, mid, and high. Results: The mean cost to heal through the reimbursement-based costing method was US$20,618 compared with a range of US$18,627-US$35,185 for the ABC method. About 20% of DFUs that cost US$10,000-US$20,000 to heal with the reimbursement-based costing method shifted to much higher values based on the ABC method. The percentage of costs represented by inpatient procedures was much lower for the reimbursement method compared with the ABC method. Innovation and Conclusions: The results show that (1) the \"true\" cost-to-heal DFUs strongly depend on the method used to calculate the costs, and (2) the reimbursement-based costing method may not accurately reflect real costs. The concept of aggregating episodes of care to obtain a single value equating to cost to heal is likely to remain a challenging exercise for the foreseeable future. A better approach may be to provide a range of cost values that are dependent on specific methods, such as the ABC method.",

Significance: Diabetes and ischemia are two major etiologies of nonhealing wounds of the lower extremities. Hyperglycemia from diabetes and oxidative stress from ischemia activate polyadenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is a nuclear enzyme that is best known for its role in DNA repair. However, the exact function of PARP-1 in ischemic/diabetic wound healing has not been well studied. Recent Advances: Poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) polymer has been detected in the wound bed and many of the PARylation-related reactions (oxidative stress response, expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, cell proliferation, and migration) are important in the wound healing process. However, the role of PARP-1 in wound healing and the potential of targeting PARP-1 therapeutically in wounds are only recently being elucidated, with much still unknown. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field, highlighting some of the mechanisms through which PARP-1 may affect normal wound closure. Future Directions: The review also presents a perspective on some of the downstream targets of PARP-1 that may be explored for their role in wound healing and discusses about the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors for wound healing.",

However, the signaling mechanisms that regulate this severe disease are still unclear. In this study, we explored the involvement of gastrokine 2 (GKN2) in the development of acute gastric lesions in mice. Approach: We measured the degree of injury using the water immersion restraint stress mouse model. Inflammatory cells and factors were analyzed after gastric lesion induction. The luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the transcription activity of nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) in regulation of GKN2. We also detected the downstream pathway of GKN2 in gastric lesions. Results: The results showed that GKN2 could aggravate stress-induced gastric lesions and gastric mucosal cell death. Moreover, the gastric lesion promoted by GKN2 was gastric acid independent. GKN2 could recruit neutrophils and promote the release of inflammatory factors to contribute to inflammation. NR3C1, activated by cortisol under stress, could act as a transcription factor to upregulate the expression of GKN2. Innovation: This study elucidates the process of gastric lesion at a molecular level and explores the possible contender biomarkers for diagnosis and drug targets in wound healing of gastric lesions. Conclusion: In conclusion, GKN2, which was upregulated by cortisol, aggravated the gastric lesion through activation of the inflammasome and inflammatory reaction.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Proper wound care and management are essential in health care facilities to prevent complications. There are many statistical studies on wound management both globally and in the Middle East. However, patient perception and knowledge regarding wound care have not been assessed in depth. Therefore, this study explored patient perception, attitude, and knowledge of wound care as well as the factors influencing patient perception among the Saudi population. Approach: This cross-sectional study included 414 individuals (mean age, 34 years; females, 64%) from varied social backgrounds who met the inclusion criteria. It was conducted in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), from June to December 2019. Data were obtained from the participants using a pretested, validated self-administered questionnaire. Results: Of the participants, 78.0% completed a bachelor's degree or higher. The majority (71.7%) had an average level of knowledge regarding wound care. Most of the participants sought medical information from nonmedical resources-from social media (42.8%) and from relatives and friends (40.6%). Moreover, most of them (73.3%) used home remedies, 77.1% Vaseline, 71% butter, 70.2% coffee beans, 71.5% toothpaste, and 83.1% Zamzam water for their wounds. Innovation: This study is the first study to address the beliefs of the Saudi nonhealth care community toward wound care. Conclusion: Our findings revealed a gap between the level of education and knowledge and beliefs of our population, which could negatively affect clinical outcomes. To address this issue, there is a need to develop an awareness program on wound care and management for patients and providers.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Placental tissues, including membranes composed of amnion and chorion, are promising options for the treatment of chronic wounds. Amnion and chorion contain multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and a multitude of growth factors and cytokines that, when used clinically, assist in the progression of difficult to heal wounds through restoration of a normal healing process. The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro physical and biological properties of a dehydrated tri-layer placental allograft membrane (TPAM) consisting of a chorion layer sandwiched between two layers of amnion. Approach: Mechanical properties were evaluated by mechanical strength and enzyme degradation assays. The ECM composition of TPAM membranes was evaluated by histological staining while growth factors and cytokine presence was evaluated by a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proliferation, migration, and ECM secretion assays were performed with fibroblasts. Immunomodulatory properties were assessed by a pro-inflammatory cytokine reduction assay while the macrophage phenotype was determined by quantifying the ratio of M1 versus M2 secreted factors. Results: The unique three-layer construction improves mechanical handling properties over single- and bi-layer membranes. Results demonstrate that TPAM is rich in ECM proteins, growth factors, cytokines, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and favorably influences fibroblast migration, proliferation, and ECM secretion when compared to negative controls. Furthermore, after processing and preservation, these membranes maintain their intrinsic immunomodulatory properties with the ability to suppress pro-inflammatory processes and modulate the M1 and M2 macrophage phenotype toward a pro-regenerative profile when compared to a negative control. Innovation: This is the first study to characterize both the biophysical and biological properties of a tri-layer placental membrane. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that TPAM has improved handling characteristics over single- and bi-layer membranes, stimulates pro-healing cellular responses, and advantageously modulates inflammatory responses, altogether making this scaffold a promising option for treating wounds, especially those that are complex or difficult to heal.",

Approach: We conducted a prospective observational study of 77 patients admitted for ischemic diabetic foot ulcers (IDFU). Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria were used to diagnose malnutrition. Values obtained with a dynamometer were dichotomized into values < and ≥ mean according to the values obtained in both sexes. The Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method were applied. STROBE guidelines for cohorts were met in the present study. Results: In total, 55 patients (71.4%) were malnourished. Malnutrition according to GLIM criteria was not associated with adverse outcomes. HGS < mean was associated with patient age, duration of diabetes mellitus, body mass index, brachial circumference, plasma albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin, transferrin, and HbA1c levels. Predictive variables of mortality after applying multivariate Cox model were age >69years (hazard ratio [HR] 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-12.0, p = 0.01), and HGS < mean (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.3, p = 0.01). Survival time in patients with HGS < mean was shorter than in those with HGS ≥ mean, p < 0.01. Innovation: HGS is an easy and useful tool associated with nutritional parameters and with prognosis in patients admitted for IDFU. Conclusions: Neither malnutrition nor muscle function impairment were associated with limb loss or a need for readmission. Patients with HGS < mean presented shorter survival times. As HGS is a simple and cost-effective tool, it should be implemented as part of the nutritional admission evaluation.",

    "abstract": "While many studies have established a paradigm for tissue repair at the level of cellular remodeling, it is not clear how an organism restricts a response only to the injured region of a damaged tissue. Skin, the largest organ in the human body, is prone to injury, and repair of epidermal tissue represents a medically relevant system to investigate. Significance: Studies in Drosophila melanogaster provide a robust genetic system to identify molecular components that will positively impact repair and healing. The Drosophila skin consists of a single-cell epidermal layer and relies on well-conserved cellular mechanisms to coordinate gene expression during development. Many studies have established that key developmental genes promote a response to epidermal injury, but the balance between activator and inhibitor signals to coordinate a localized response remains unknown. Recent Advances: Discovery of a genetic pathway that promotes the restriction of transcriptional response to damage only in effected regions. Interestingly, genome-wide microarray studies have identified an intersection between gene expression after aseptic injury and activation of the innate immune response. Critical Issues: The use of a transcriptional activation reporter provides an innovative approach to uncover well-conserved components that promote the localization of a response during epidermal injury and may influence other pathological conditions of tissue damage. Future Directions: The work reviewed in this critical review may lead to development of molecular strategies of repair and improved healing after injury or infection. The outcomes on the fundamental contribution of a transcriptional response to injury will be translatable to mammalian systems.",

The two most widely used modalities of NPWT are vacuum-assisted closure (V.A.C.) therapy (KCI, Inc., San Antonio, Texas) and the RENASYS NPWT system (Smith & Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom). This evaluation compares the performance of the two systems in the management of wounds of mixed etiology. Approach: The evaluation is based on retrospective evaluation of more than 1,000 patients treated with NPWT in a community setting in Canada. Results: Patients were well matched according to their baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and wound characteristics. No difference was seen between the two NPWT systems in terms of the percentage of patients reaching their predetermined treatment goal (90.0% and 93.6%, respectively). The time taken to achieve the treatment goal (median 8 weeks in both groups), percentage reduction in wound area (64.2% and 65.3%, respectively), and weekly rate of reduction in wound area (9.7% and 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.156). Innovation: This evaluation is believed to comprise the largest cohort of patients treated with NPWT published to date and is one of the few studies that have attempted to provide a direct comparison of the performance of alternative NPWT systems. Conclusion: Findings suggest that there are no clinically meaningful differences in the efficacy and performance of the two most widely used NPWT devices, based on consideration of a number of wound outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Although the use of dexamethasone as an adjunct agent is associated with alleviating pain and prolonging analgesic duration in local wound infiltration (LWI), efficacy and safety of dexamethasone infiltration have not been fully explored. The study sought to quantify the pooled effects of dexamethasone infiltration on postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, and side effects through a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Approach: RCTs comparing dexamethasone + LWI with LWI alone were retrieved from seven electronic databases. Co-primary outcomes were rest pain scores and cumulative morphine equivalent consumption within 24 h postoperatively. The study followed PRISMA, AMSTAR, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Eight trials comprising 609 patients were included in the final analysis. Results indicated that dexamethasone infiltration effects were only statistical but not clinically significant at individual time points of rest pain and patient satisfaction scores. Notably, the effect of dexamethasone infiltration therapy on other pain-related parameters, including cumulative morphine consumption (mean difference, -9.05 mg; 95% CI: -22.47 to 4.37), was not significantly different compared with the control group. Analysis showed no significant differences in safety indicators between the two groups. The overall quality of evidence was high to very low. Innovation: Although statistically significant effects of dexamethasone infiltration were observed for some outcomes of postoperative wound pain, the overall benefits were below the expected minimal clinically important difference. Conclusions: In summary, the current evidence does not support routine clinical use of dexamethasone in LWI. However, further studies should explore the clinical value of preemptive analgesia and safety of a combination of dexamethasone with ropivacaine for LWI.",

    "abstract": "Objective: At present, there is an urgent need to develop a novel and practical therapeutic approach to accelerate the healing of acute wounds. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for acute skin wounds. However, there are still challenges in clinical application of this strategy, such as low survivability, low retention time, and less engraftment in skin wounds. Approach: Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) were seeded into three-dimensional (3D) gelatin microspheres (GMs) to identify the biocompatibility of GMs. WJMSCs were embedded in GMs and then encapsulated with Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP) combination to transplant onto acute full-thickness skin wound in mice. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence assay were used to investigate the skin wound healing, dermis regeneration, collagen deposition, cell proliferation, and neovascularization. Results: Three-dimensional GM had strong biocompatibility, compared with two-dimensional adherent culturing, GM loading increased the cell viability and proliferation ability of WJMSCs. WJMSCs+GM+PF-127+SAP transplantation increased skin wound healing rate, dermis regeneration, and type III collagen deposition through improving macrophage polarization, cell proliferation, neovascularization, cell retention, and engraftment at skin wound site. Innovation: The effective 3D encapsulation technology for WJMSCs solved the main problems of cell activity and residence time during MSC transplantation. WJMSCs+GM+PF-127+SAP transplantation will be a new and effective MSC biomaterials-based therapeutic strategy for acute skin traumatic wounds. Conclusion: WJMSCs+GM+PF-127+SAP transplantation facilitated acute full-thickness skin wound healing and regeneration and might be a new and effective therapy for acute skin traumatic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin 22 (IL-22) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are two important regulators of inflammation. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are considered inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), due to the belief that these diseases result from dysregulated responses of the intestinal immune system to bacteria present in the commensal flora.It is debated whether a breakdown of immune tolerance is the primary cause of these diseases or occurs downstream of an initial defect of the intestinal barrier and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).Recent reports suggest a crucial role for IL-22 in the regulation of gut inflammation as well as epithelial barrier integrity. Local IL-22 gene delivery enhances expression of its downstream effector, STAT3, within colonic epithelial cells and induces both STAT3-dependent expression of mucus-associated molecules and restitution of mucus-producing goblet cells. IEC-specific deletion of STAT3 results in significant susceptibility to experimental colitis with a striking defect in epithelial restitution. STAT3 activation, thus, may regulate immune homeostasis in the gut by promoting IL-22-dependent mucosal wound healing.The importance of IL-22/STAT3 signaling in IEC wound healing suggests a critical role for epithelial homeostasis in IBDs.Effective healing of the IECs could be considered a primary target in the development of treatments for IBDs. IL-22/STAT3 signaling exerts a protective role in the process of intestinal mucosal wound healing and may thereby provide a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of IBDs.",

An understanding of baseline healing patterns is important to inform study design for future trials that test therapies for this disease. Approach: In this study, an electronic wound management system was leveraged to analyze retrospective data on 133 unique sickle cell patients who were treated across 114 wound healing centers, and to describe their characteristics and healing patterns as compared with those of venous ulcer patients. The data included 198 care episodes for 427 wounds. Results: Patients with sickle cell ulcers were younger and had fewer comorbid diseases than those with venous ulcers. Larger size and longer duration were predictors of poor healing. Between the first and fourth assessments, mean change in area for sickle cell ulcers showed a 58% increase, compared with a 13% decrease for venous ulcers. Kaplan-Meier curves showed poorer healing in sickle cell ulcers than in venous ulcers across all categories of size and duration. Patients with sickle cell ulcers had longer care episodes and were more likely to re-present for care. Innovation: This study reports on the largest data set of sickle cell ulcer patients analyzed to date in the published literature to provide a more detailed understanding of wound healing patterns of this disease. Conclusion: A national network of electronic health records can effectively identify a large number of patients with sickle cell ulcers to support analysis of epidemiology, healing patterns, and health care utilization.",

Approach: We isolated and in vitro expanded a subset of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like precursor cells from the peripheral blood of adult mice with the surface markers: CD34+, leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)+, CD44+, c-kit+, lineage negative (lin-), and E-cadherin-.

    "abstract": "Objective: As an aberrant response to cutaneous wound healing, keloid scarring is a challenge to cure, and its clinical management remains unsatisfactory. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mitochondrial function and morphology were impaired in keloid pathology. Approach: Keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and normal skin fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated and cultured from excised samples. A real-time extracellular flux analyzer was used to monitor the oxygen consumption rate for evaluating the mitochondrial respiratory function. Real-time PCR or Western blot was performed to detect the levels of mRNAs or proteins, respectively, including those associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial fission and fusion, and mitochondrial biogenesis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the mitochondrial mass were measured by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Results: Compared with NFs, KFs showed reduced basal oxidative respiration (p < 0.05), maximal oxidative respiratory capacity, ATP production, and coupling efficiency (p < 0.01) but increased proton leakage (p < 0.01). ROS were decreased (p < 0.05) in KFs, whereas the mitochondrial mass was increased (p < 0.01). The mRNA and protein expressions related to mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) and biogenesis were significantly upregulated in KFs (p < 0.05). Mitochondria in both KFs and keloid tissue were distended and swollen, along with displaying vacuolization and effacement of the cristae. Innovation: The possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormities in keloid pathology may promote promising therapeutic strategies for wound healing disorders. Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggested that both mitochondrial dysfunction and morphological impairment might play vital roles during keloid pathogenesis.",

Medical management has significantly improved outcomes for acute myocardial infarction (MI); however, improved strategies are needed to regenerate functional myocardium and prevent the progression to heart failure. Cytotherapy using cardiac progenitor cells (PCs) to regenerate functional myocardium holds tremendous potential; however, a better understanding of PC biology is needed. Recent Advances: Reports of cardiac regeneration in lower animals have been reported in the last decade. However, just recently, two separate models of mammalian cardiac regeneration have been published and offer potential to better define PC biology, including PC recruitment, differentiation, proliferation, and integration. Critical Issues: Numerous clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing to evaluate possible cytotherapy options in the treatment of acute and chronic ischemic cardiac disease. To date, results have demonstrated improvements in cardiac function as a result of paracrine effects of cytotherapy, but regeneration of functional myocardium has yet to be observed. Future Directions: Future translation of cardiac PC biology from these models is necessary to promote regenerative cardiac healing following MI and to prevent the progression to heart failure following the loss of functional myocardium. Knowledge gained from mammalian models of cardiac regeneration will allow for the development of therapeutic regimens in the treatment of heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Split-thickness autograft is the standard wound treatment for full-thickness burns. In large burns, sparse availability of uninjured skin prevents rapid closure of the wound, resulting in increased scar tissue formation or mortality. Tissue-engineered skin (ES) offers promise when autografts are not available.ES, constructed from a polymeric scaffold and skin cells, has been shown to reduce donor site area required to permanently close wounds, mortality, and morbidity from scarring but cannot restore all skin functions. Current generations of ES are orders of magnitude weaker than normal human skin, leading to difficulty in surgical application, greater susceptibility to mechanical damage during fabrication and application, and less elasticity and strength once engrafted.Previous studies to improve ES biomechanics focus on altering the scaffolding material, which resulted in modest improvements but often inhibited proper skin development. As the skin is naturally under static strain, adding these mechanical cues to the culture environment is hypothesized to improve ES biomechanics. ES was cultured under applied static strains ranging from 0% to 40% strain for a total of 10 days. Strain magnitudes of 10% and 20% strain resulted in significantly stronger ES than unstrained controls, showed upregulation of many genes encoding structural extracellular matrix proteins, and exhibited increased epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation.Enhanced biomechanical properties of ES can allow for facile surgical application and less damage during dressing changes.These findings suggest that mechanical cues play a significant role in skin development and should be further explored.",

Previous studies have shown that gene transfer of HoxA3 to wounds of diabetic mice accelerates wound healing, increasing angiogenesis and keratinocyte migration. In this study, we examined whether HoxA3 can also improve angiogenesis, epidermal integrity, and viability of composite skin grafts. Approach: To determine the effects of HoxA3 on composite skin grafts, we constructed bilayered composite grafts incorporating fibroblasts engineered to constitutively secrete HoxA3. We then transplanted these composite grafts in vivo. Results: The composite grafts produced a stratified epidermal layer after seventeen days in culture and following transplantation in vivo, these grafts exhibit normal epidermal differentiation and reduced contraction compared to controls. In addition, HoxA3 grafts showed increased angiogenesis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of HoxA3 graft tissue reveal an increase in the downstream HoxA3 target genes MMP-14 and uPAR expression, as well as a reduction in CCL-2 and CxCl-12. Innovation: Expression of secreted HoxA3 in composite grafts represents a comprehensive approach that targets both keratinocytes and endothelial cells to promote epidermal proliferation and angiogenesis. Conclusion: Secreted HoxA3 improves angiogenesis, reduces expression of inflammatory mediators, and prolongs composite skin graft integrity.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Fetuses early in gestation heal skin wounds without forming scars. The biological mechanisms behind this process are largely unknown. Fibroblasts, however, are cells known to be intimately involved in wound healing and scar formation. We examined fibroblasts in different stages of development to characterize differences in gene expression that may result in the switch from regenerative wound repair to repair with scarring. Approach: Fibroblasts were isolated and cultured from the back skin of BALB/c wild-type mouse fetuses at embryonic day (E)14 and E18 (n = 10). The fibroblast total RNA was extracted, and microarray analysis was conducted using chips containing 42,000 genes. Significance analysis of microarrays was performed to identify genes with greater than twofold expression difference and a false discovery rate of less than two. Identified genes subsequently underwent enrichment analysis to detect differentially expressed pathways. Results: Two hundred seventy-five genes were differentially expressed between E14 and E18 in fetal fibroblasts. Thirty genes were significantly downregulated and 245 genes were significantly upregulated at E18 compared with E14. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified the top 20 signaling pathways differentially activated in fetal fibroblasts between the E18 and E14 time points. Innovation: To our knowledge, this work represents the first instance where differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways between fetal fibroblasts at E14 and E18 have been studied. Conclusion: The genes and pathways identified here potentially underlie the mechanism behind the transition from fetal wound healing via regeneration to wound healing by repair, and may prove to be key targets for future therapeutics.",

Determining the available working space is important for the development of surgical instruments, to track movements during surgery, as well as to classify the invasiveness of the procedure. Approach: We evaluate three measurement methods to assess the volume of eight surgical sites in a cadaver study. The cavities were filled with an alginate cast to determine its dimensions. Second, the depth, height, and width of the surgical site were measured with a ruler and the volume was calculated. Last, the surface registration method was used to reconstruct the site. Results: We found that the mold filling method provides accurate results in determining the volume of a surgical site. The manual method using a ruler showed excellent reliability, but the calculations tended to overestimate the volume of the surgical site. In contrast, surface reconstruction tended to underestimate the volume of a surgical site, but the results closer resembled the ones derived from the mold filling method. Innovation: We presented a new method to assess the size of the surgical site intraoperatively in minimally invasive hip surgery. Conclusion: The manual method is reliable, but not as accurate as the surface reconstruction, while the mold filling method cannot be used in an intraoperative setup. Although surface reconstruction showed deficits regarding reliability, due to the lack of direct contact to the patient, it remains an appealing technique to measure the surgical site.",

CeN produces a hardened eschar believed to resist bacterial colonization/infection. To evaluate this potential mechanism, we treated in vitro skin models or Pseudomonas aeruginosa with CeN and measured mechanical properties of the models and bacterial virulence, respectively. Approach: We treated three-dimensional-collagen matrix and ex-vivo-burned porcine skin with CeN and evaluated stiffness and P. aeruginosa penetration. In addition, we treated P. aeruginosa with CeN and evaluated the bacteria's motility, skin model penetration, susceptibility to be phagocytized by the human monocytic cell line THP-1, and ability to stimulate this cell line to produce cytokines. Results: CeN treatment of skin models stiffened them and made them resistant to P. aeruginosa penetration. Inversely, CeN treatment of P. aeruginosa reduced their motility, penetration through skin models (ex-vivo-burned porcine skin), and ability to stimulate cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α] and interleukin 8 [IL-8]) by THP-1 cells. In addition, CeN-treated Pseudomonas was more readily phagocytized by THP-1 cells. Finally, P. aeruginosa inoculated on CeN-treated ex-vivo-burned porcine skin was more susceptible to killing by a silver dressing. Innovation:In vitro skin models offer a platform for screening drugs that interfere with bacterial penetration into wounded tissue. Conclusion: CeN treatment reduced P. aeruginosa virulence, altered the mechanical properties of ex-vivo-burned porcine skin and collagen matrix, retarded penetration of P. aeruginosa through the skin models, and resulted in increased vulnerability of P. aeruginosa to killing by antimicrobial wound dressings. These data support the use of CeN in burn management.",

PI occurred in 10.9% (1,496/13,675) of the vasoconstrictor agent administration population and 3.5% (1,027/29,503) of the drug-free population. The pooled unadjusted odds ratio was 2.83 (95% CI = 2.21–3.64, p < 0.001). The adjusted odds ratio was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.26–2.68, p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression found that the risk of PI did not vary with research design, time of occurrence, patient age, or male proportion. Future Directions: Vasoconstrictor agent administration raised the risk of PI in critical care patients by nearly twofold. More emphasis should be placed on the timely prevention of PI in patients receiving vasoconstrictor agent administration in the ICU.",

To better understand the pathogenesis and to advance on new therapeutic options, we focused on the proteomic analysis of PU, which offers substantial opportunities to identify significant changes in protein abundance during the course of PU formation in an unbiased manner. Approach: To better define the protein pattern of this pathology, we performed a proteomic approach in which we compare severe PU tissue from spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with control tissue from the same patients. Results: We found 76 proteins with difference in abundance. Of these, 10 proteins were verified as proteins that define the pathology: antithrombin-III, alpha-1-antitrypsin, kininogen-1, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, apolipoprotein A-I, collagen alpha-1 (XII) chain, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein B-100, and complement factor B. Innovation: This is the first study to analyze differential abundance protein of PU tissue from SCI patients using high-throughput protein identification and quantification by tandem mass tags followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Conclusion: Differential abundance proteins are mainly involved in tissue regeneration. These proteins might be considered as future therapeutic options to enhance the physiological response and permit cellular repair of damaged tissue.",

Approach: Transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing human Sufu (hSufu) in the epidermis were applied to investigate the effects of Sufu on epidermal and dermal cellular properties and in wound healing. Results: Histological staining revealed a reduction of epidermal and dermal thickness and an increase of hypodermal adipose tissue in homozygous K14-hSufu TG mice when compared with wild-type (WT) controls. TG mice exhibited significantly delayed skin wound healing. Moreover, the migratory and proliferative capabilities of cultured keratinocytes were decreased in K14-hSufuTG mice. Transforming growth factor-β treatment increased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin more in WT than in TG fibroblasts. Sufu overexpression significantly decreased the expression of β-catenin, glioma transcription factor 1 (Gli1), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 in wounds of K14-hSufu TG mice when compared with controls, probably indicating a delaying effect of Sufu on wound healing via blocking the hedgehog (Hh)/Gli and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Innovation: Our results indicate a new property of Sufu in the process of skin wound healing. It provides an important basis for Sufu as a potential target for skin wound healing. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Sufu overexpression in the epidermis impairs wound healing via dampening the Hh/Gli and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These data provide an important basis for further analyses of Sufu in skin wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The goal of any topical formulation is efficient transdermal delivery of its active components. However, delivery of compounds can be problematic with penetration through tough layers of fibrotic dermal scar tissue. Approach: We propose a new approach combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) using a topical of unknown composition against a well-known antiscar topical (as control). Results: Positive detection of compounds within the treatment topical using both techniques was validated with mass spectrometry. RS detected conformational structural changes; the 1,655/1,446 cm−1 ratio estimating collagen content significantly decreased (p < 0.05) over weeks 4, 12, and 16 compared with day 0. The amide I band, known to represent collagen and protein in skin, shifted from 1,667 to 1,656 cm−1, which may represent a change from β-sheets in elastin to α-helices in collagen. Confirmatory elastin immunohistochemistry decreased compared with day 0, conversely the collagen I/III ratio increased in the same samples by week 12 (p < 0.05, and p < 0.0001, respectively), in keeping with normal scar formation. Optical coherence tomography attenuation coefficient representing collagen deposition was significantly decreased at week 4 compared with day 0 and increased at week 16 (p < 0.05). Innovation: This study provides a platform for further research on the simultaneous evaluation of the effects of compounds in cutaneous scarring by RS and HPLC, and identifies a role for RS in the therapeutic evaluation and theranostic management of skin scarring. Conclusions: RS can provide noninvasive information on the effects of topicals on scar pathogenesis and structural composition, validated by other analytical techniques.",

However, the variability in scarring outcomes between individuals and in particular, the association between genetic factors and scarring, is not well understood. This scoping review aims to summarize the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding. The objectives were to determine the study designs used, the characteristics of participants included, the tools used to assess scarring and the length of follow-up after wounding. Recent Advances: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), The Human Genetic Epidemiology (HuGE) Navigator (database of genetic association studies), and the genome-wide association study Catalog were searched from January 2008 to April 2020. Cohort studies and case-control studies that examined the association between one or more genetic variations and the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring were eligible for inclusion. A narrative synthesis that grouped studies by wound type was conducted. Critical Issues: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (five in burns, four surgical wounds, and none in other types of acute wounds). Seven assessed hypertrophic scarring, one keloid scarring, and one both scar types. Seven studies used a prospective cohort design. All studies used subjective methods (clinician or patient observation) to assess scarring. There was considerable variation in how scar scales were operationalized. Future Directions: This review identified a small body of evidence on genetic susceptibility to scarring after acute wounding. Further studies are needed, and in a wide range of populations, including patients with wounds caused by trauma.",

We aimed to summarize the efficacy and safety of ketorolac-infiltration based on published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Approach: This work followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews and the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. We searched for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of ketorolac-infiltration in adults in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese databases, and Google Scholar. The two co-primary outcomes of this meta-analysis were rescue analgesic consumption in the 24-h postoperative period and rest pain scores. Results: Twelve trials (761 patients) were analyzed. Ketorolac-infiltration provided a clinically unimportant benefit in morphine consumption (mean difference, -2.81 mg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.11 to -0.50; p = 0.02; moderate-quality evidence). Low-to-moderate quality evidence supported a brief (2-6 h), clinically subtle, but statistically consistent effect of surgical site ketorolac-infiltration in reducing wound pain at rest. High-quality evidence supported shorter hospital stays for surgical patients receiving local ketorolac-infiltration when compared to controls (mean difference, -0.12 days; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.08; p < 0.00001). Further, ketorolac-infiltration does not improve any opioid-related side effects. Innovation: Ketorolac-infiltration provides statistically significant but clinically unimportant benefits for improving postoperative wound pain. Conclusion: Overall, despite the fact that current moderate-to-high quality of evidence does not support routine using of ketorolac as an adjuvant to local anesthetic for wound infiltration, these findings underscore the importance of optimizing agents and sustained delivery parameters in postoperative local anesthetic practice.

Approach: Retrospective review of patients presenting to our wound care center between 2014 and 2018 with both chronic wounds and a history of inflammatory disease. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and progression to complete wound healing were compared between those taking DMARDs or not at the time of wound onset. The study adheres to the STROBE statement. Results: Fifty-eight patients with a total of 296 wounds were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were taking at least one DMARD at wound onset in 217 (73.3%) of these wounds. The average number of DMARDs at wound onset was 1.5 (standard deviation 1.2). Two hundred ten wounds progressed to heal (70.9%), with a median time to healing of 229.5 days (interquartile range 71.0-490.0). Of the 210 wounds that healed, patients taking at least one DMARD had a significantly shorter time to healing relative to patients who were not on any DMARDs (median 190.5 days vs. 340.0 days, p = 0.0156). Innovation: Characterizing wound healing outcomes at a tertiary hospital with a dedicated wound care center and analyzing the role of DMARDs in wound healing progression. Conclusions: The median time to healing in the studied cohort was 229.5 days, which is much longer than the healing time for noninfected diabetic foot ulcers at our institution.

    "abstract": "Significance: Skin wounds and disorders compromise the protective functions of skin and patient quality of life. Although accessible on the surface, they are challenging to address due to paucity of effective therapies. Exogenous extracellular vesicles (EVs) and cell-free derivatives of adult multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are developing as a treatment modality. Knowledge of origin MSCs, EV processing, and mode of action is necessary for directed use of EVs in preclinical studies and methodical translation. Recent Advances: Nanoscale to microscale EVs, although from nonskin cells, induce functional responses in cutaneous wound cellular milieu. EVs allow a shift from cell-based to cell-free/derived modalities by carrying the MSC beneficial factors but eliminating risks associated with MSC transplantation. EVs have demonstrated striking efficacy in resolution of preclinical wound models, specifically within the complexity of skin structure and wound pathology. Critical Issues: To facilitate comparison across studies, tissue sources and processing of MSCs, culture conditions, isolation and preparations of EVs, and vesicle sizes require standardization as these criteria influence EV types and contents, and potentially determine the induced biological responses. Procedural parameters for all steps preceding the actual therapeutic administration may be the key to generating EVs that demonstrate consistent efficacy through known mechanisms. We provide a comprehensive review of such parameters and the subsequent tissue, cellular and molecular impact of the derived EVs in different skin wounds/disorders. Future Directions: We will gain more complete knowledge of EV-induced effects in skin, and specificity for different wounds/conditions. The safety and efficacy of current preclinical xenogenic applications will favor translation into allogenic clinical applications of EVs as a biologic.",

Approach: Twelve healthy human volunteers received an application of the new product on one thigh and of the comparator on the other thigh. An infrared camera using ThermaCAM™ software imaged the skin and measured the temperature at the skin surface over time to characterize the thermal cure profile induced by the products on the skin. Results: The new product led to a drop in skin surface temperature (endothermic reaction), whereas the commercial product displayed an exotherm and a slight rise in skin surface temperature. Innovation: Cyanoacrylate-based chemistries come in various formulations, differing in the side chains and additives used. They are liquid monomers that polymerize after application, and this polymerization is accompanied by an exothermic reaction that can be perceived as an unpleasant warming sensation, especially on compromised skin. A new formulation was designed to mitigate this rise in temperature. Conclusion: The new skin protectant may potentially be more comfortable for IAD patients, since it causes a drop in skin surface temperature instead of a rise during the curing process that follows application.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Wound care practitioners have no professional society to promote participation in a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR), which is essential to thrive under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), and until recently have lacked relevant quality measures to report. Practitioners can now participate in the nonprofit U.S. Wound Registry (USWR) QCDR for MIPS credit, which can receive data from any certified electronic health record (EHR) and, in so doing, generate data useful for comparative effectiveness research. Recent Advances: For 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved 12 wound care and hyperbaric medicine-relevant quality measures and several clinical practice Improvement Activities, which can be reported for MIPS credit through the USWR. Several QCDR measures have met the CMS 3-year reporting criteria to establish national benchmark rates, likely enabling practitioners to achieve higher quality scores than possible with standard MIPS measures. The structured registry data generated have been harnessed to evaluate adherence to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, understand real-world patient healing rates, and demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of wound therapies. Critical Issues: Wound care practitioners can participate in a QCDR for MIPS credit, which enables them to optimize their MIPS score, particularly if they transmit data directly from their EHR. Utilizing structured data for comparative effectiveness research may help ensure patient access to advanced therapeutics. Future Directions: By 2019, to overcome technological barriers to participation, USWR quality measures will be available as \"apps\" for EHRs that support the interface required to achieve the next stage of EHR certification as part of the open Application Programming Initiative.",

Real-time RT-PCR revealed that BD upregulated messenger RNA expression of Ahsg (alpha 2-HS glycoprotein) and Csf2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) in osteoblasts. Innovation: The prevention of bone and soft-tissue reduction associated with tooth extraction has been eagerly anticipated in the field of dentistry. This study first reported the effect of BD on extraction socket healing. Conclusion: A single dose of topically administered BD-loaded PLGA microcarriers promoted bone and soft-tissue healing at the extraction site of tooth.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Inserts are typically used in conjunction with pressure garment to improve the outcomes of hypertrophic scar (HS) treatment. However, the types of insert materials currently available have many limitations, thus hindering their therapeutic effect. An innovative insert material, the Smart Scar Care Pad (SSCP), was invented to maximize treatment outcomes through enhanced compression and occlusion. The study aimed to investigate the properties of the SSCP and its efficacy to serve as a suitable insert material for HS management. Approach: The physical properties and biocompatibility of SSCP were examined. A self-controlled clinical study of 45-day intervention using SSCP in comparison with Plastazote was conducted on 25 subjects with HS. Study outcomes included scar parameters measured both subjectively and objectively and patient feedback questionnaire. Results: The SSCP demonstrated equivalent and even superior performance when compared with commercial products in tests of biological safety and physical properties. Both arms demonstrated significant time effects on Vancouver Scar Scale total score (p = 0.000), melanin score (p = 0.042), pliability (p = 0.039), and hydration score (p = 0.013). Significant intervention and time interaction effect was found in the pliability (p = 0.048). From the feedback questionnaire, patients reported that SSCP was more conformable and there was less displacement during movement (p = 0.040) compared with conventional insert. Innovation: The SSCP is the first insert that combined the pressure enhancing effect of a traditional pressure insert and occlusion effect of silicone insert. Conclusion: The SSCP can serve as a safe and effective insert material in HS treatment, especially in improving HS pliability.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We recently developed the approach of using \"microcolumns\" of autologous full-thickness skin tissue for wound repair. The small size of these micro skin tissue columns (MSTCs, ∼0.5 mm in diameter) allows donor sites to heal quickly without scarring. Treatment with MSTCs significantly accelerate wound healing, and suppled various skin cell types and skin structures to replenish the wound volume. This technology is now starting clinical use. In this study, we investigate whether MSTCs may also influence wound healing by releasing soluble signaling factors. Approach: Freshly harvested MSTCs were incubated in culture medium for 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected and tested for its effects on migration and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts, and its ability to induce tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Proteins released into the conditioned medium were characterized by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and compared with medium conditioned by an equivalent mass of intact full-thickness skin. Results: MSTC-conditioned medium increased fibroblast migration and proliferation, as well as HUVEC tube formation. MSTCs released many soluble factors known to play prominent roles in wound healing. A subset of proteins showed significantly different release profiles compared with intact full-thickness skin. Innovation: The technology for harvesting and using MSTCs to augment wound healing was recently developed as an alternative to conventional autologous skin grafting. This study shows that MSTCs could also function as \"cytokine factories.\" Conclusion: In addition to supplying autologous cells to repopulate the wound volume, MSTCs can also function as a source of growth factors and cytokines to further enhance wound healing.",

Scar models that best mimic in vivo human scarring are essential for understanding scar development and progression, assessing the efficacy of therapeutics, and providing reliable and valid research outcomes. Recent Advances: In 2016, Lanier et al. proposed a new in vivo patient model, the Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model, that overcomes the prior limitations of both animal and human models, with greater representativeness of the human scarring process, expedited recruitment, smaller sample requirements, and greater flexibility in the types and number of interventions that can be studied simultaneously. Critical Issues: Existing animal models suffer from limitations that impede generalization to human scars. Human scar studies are difficult to conduct and rarely used due to recruitment difficulties, ethical concerns regarding purposeful wounding, and inherent variability based on location, type of scar, and the heterogeneity of the host response between humans. Although overcoming many of these hurdles, the Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model still has a few limitations. In addition, there remains a need for further study of and comparison between the Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model and existing human and animal models, to inspire more widespread acceptance of a standardized human scar model. Future Directions: The Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model is a critical stepping stone toward better human scar models. This model hopefully will inspire other in vivo patient models utilizing elective surgery to overcome recruitment and ethical concerns.",

Results: Benefits have been observed to both students and to the clinic, as reflected by online survey results, increased productivity in the form of posters and manuscripts, and opportunities for professional networking. Discussion: Rotations and clerkships can be transformed from haphazard, bystander observational experiences to active participation that enhances comprehension and retention, while also providing benefits to preceptors. Innovation: Integration between research, education, and clinical activities in a structured way can provide opportunity for enhanced learning experiences and promote the concept of evidence-based practice. Conclusion: With observed benefits to students, researchers, and staff in this clinical setting, other clerkship rotation settings should consider an integrated and structured approach to learning, which includes scholarly activities. Further rigorous program evaluation is necessary to further quantify preliminary positive feedback regarding this approach.",

Recent studies have shown that iPSC-derived fibroblasts display enhanced cellular functions suggesting that iPSC may eventually become an important source of stem cells for regenerative therapies. Recent Advances: The discovery of approaches to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent cells opens exciting avenues for their use in personalized, regenerative therapies. The controlled differentiation of functional cell types from iPSC provides a replenishing source of fibroblasts. There is intriguing evidence that iPSC reprogramming and subsequent differentiation to fibroblast lineages may improve cellular functional properties. Augmenting the biological potency of iPSC-derived fibroblasts may enable the development of novel, personalized stem cell therapies to treat oral disease. Critical Issues: Numerous questions need to be addressed before iPSC-derived cells can be used as a practical oral therapy. This will include understanding why iPSC-derived cells are predisposed towards differentiation pathways along lineages related to their cell of origin, screening iPSC-derived cells to ensure their safety and phenotypic stability and developing engineered, three-dimensional tissue models to optimize their function and efficacy for future therapeutic transplantation. Future Directions: Future research will need to address how to develop efficient methods to deliver and integrate iPSC-derived fibroblasts into the oral mucosa. This will require an improved understanding of how to harness their biological potency for regenerative therapies that are specifically targeted to the oral mucosa.",

Materials and Methods: Surgical skin wounds (2.5 cm) were created on 84 male Wistar rats divided into four groups (n=21): Group I (Control), Group II (LED), Group III (LED+D), and Group IV (US+D). On days 7, 14, and 21, the tissue samples were removed and divided into two pieces, one was used for histological examination (collagen) and the other for FT-IR. Results: The histomorphometric analysis showed no significant differences among groups for collagen deposition at 7 days. However, at 14 days, more deposition of collagen was noted in the groups LED (p<0.05) and LED+D (p<0.001) than in the control. At 21 days, the groups LED, LED+D, and US+D presented significantly greater deposition of collagen when compared with the control. The FT-IR spectra, at 14 days, LED+D had greater amounts of type I collagen, a better organization of fibers, and greater difference of mean separation between the groups, not observed at 7 and 21 days. Innovation: The histomorphometric and FT-IR analyses suggest that the association of semipermeable dressing to LED therapy and to TUS modulates biological events, increasing fibroblast/collagen response and accelerating dermal maturation. Conclusion: The histomorphometric and FT-IR analyses showed that LED therapy is more efficacious than TUS, when combined with a semipermeable dressing, and induced the collagen production in skin lesions.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful inflammatory skin disease. Management is largely medical, with surgery reserved for severe refractory cases. In this study, we sought to conduct a retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional surgical database to investigate the surgical management of patients with HS and identify trends in the postoperative outcomes. Approach: The 2011-2019 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent surgery for management of HS. Postoperative outcomes were assessed, including surgical and medical complications, length of hospital stay, reoperation, readmission, and nonhome discharge. This article was reported according to the STROBE criteria. Results: We identified 1,030 patients, of which 62% were female and 50% were black. The most common comorbidity was obesity (61%). Surgery was mainly performed by general surgeons (62%) and plastic surgeons (31%). Complications were overall low, with readmission being the most common (7.1%, unplanned 6.0%), followed by reoperation (5.8%). The most common surgical complication was superficial incisional infection (5.1%) and most common medical complication was sepsis (3.8%). Obesity is seen to affect surgical complication rates, with patients with obesity having higher rates of dehiscence (obese: 3.1% and nonobese: 1.0%; p = 0.03) but lower rates of organ space infection (obese: 0.5% and nonobese: 2.0%; p = 0.03) and transfusion (obese: 2.5% and nonobese: 5.2%; p = 0.04). A focus on complications in patients undergoing flap reconstruction (n = 293; 23%), identified higher rates of surgical complications, with superficial incisional infection being the most common (flap reconstruction: 7.5% and incision and drainage, debridement, skin graft: 4.1%; p = 0.04). Innovation: The surgical management of HS is analyzed at the national level, with postoperative complications seen to depend on race and obesity-status. Conclusions: Surgical management for HS is associated with low postoperative complications, making surgery a viable treatment option for this debilitating disease.",

Recent Advances: With increasing understanding of the nuanced physiology and cellular responses of orofacial soft tissue, novel scaffolds, seeded cells, and bioactive molecules were developed in the past 5 years to specifically target orofacial soft tissue regeneration, particularly for tissues primarily found within the orofacial region such as oral mucosa, taste buds, salivary glands, and masseter muscles. Critical Issues: Due to the tightly packed and complex anatomy, orofacial soft tissue injury commonly implicates multiple tissue types, and thus functional unit reconstruction in the orofacial region is more important than single tissue regeneration. Future Directions: This article reviews the up-to-date knowledge in this highly translational topic, which provides insights into novel biologically inspired and engineered strategies for regenerating orofacial component tissues and functional units.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Inflammation has been linked to progression of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU); however, specific predictive markers of nonhealing are scarce. The goal of this study was to identify biochemical and immunological parameters from the blood as predictors of nonhealing in grade 1 and grade 2 DFU. Approach: Individuals with low-grade foot ulcers were enrolled in the study to determine if histopathological, biochemical, and immunological parameters could be used to predict individuals whose ulcers would not heal. Data analysis was performed using traditional univariate analyses as well as univariate and multivariable logistic regression, and STROBE guidelines were used for reporting data. Results: Among the 52 individuals who completed the study, we observe that no single histopathological and biochemical parameter was predictive. Conventional univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the expression of the cell surface proteins CD63, HLA-DR, and CD11b on monocytes was significantly lower in nonhealed individuals, but with moderate discriminative ability. In comparison, a multivariable logistic regression model identified four of the 31 parameters to be salient predictors with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] 18.83, confidence interval [CI] 18.83-342) and cell-surface expression of CD63 on monocytes (OR 0.12, CI 0.12-0.45) showing significance and demonstrating high discrimination ability. Innovation: The approach of using a combination of biochemical and immunological parameters to predict ulcer healing is new. Conclusion: Through this study we conclude that LDL cholesterol and cell-surface expression of CD63 on monocytes strongly correlate with nonhealing in individuals with grade 1 and grade 2 DFU.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Chronic wound healing is a complex process that is still not well understood. The tryptophan (TRP)-L-Kynurenine (KYN) pathway has recently been under increased scrutiny in regards to wound healing. The study applied metabolomics to elucidate the TRP-L- KYN pathway associated with wound healing in chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLUs). Approach: This study used a longitudinal comparative design of 60 serum samples collected from 30 older adult patients with CVLUs, receiving weekly sharp debridement at a wound clinic. The serum samples were collected at baseline and week 4 (healed wounds) or week 8 (non-healed wounds). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics was used to analyze targeted metabolites. A Bayesian approach was employed to examine robust correlations between changes in metabolite values and linear healing slope and to compare by group. Results: The mean age was 71.13 (±9.46). Half of the sample were female and the minority (17%) were Black. The mean values of evaluated metabolites for the non-healed group were consistently lower than those for the healed group. The healed group (n=12) had higher KYN values; Those on a healing trajectory (n=23) had lower KYN levels and higher TRP levels at baseline and over time. There was moderate support (Bayes Factor = 3.70) for a negative association between change in Kynurenic Acid and linear healing slope (r = -0.35, CrI = -0.62, -0.04, PD= 98%). Results suggest KYN and TRP may be markers for healing in individuals with CVLUs. Innovation and Conclusion: Gaining a better understanding of the associations between the TRP-L- KYN pathway and the healing of CVLUs may help to clarify the links of inflammation with the rate and success of wound healing. Biomarker development focused on the TRP-L- KYN pathway could be pursued, if the associations are further supported by focused research studies.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Determine the validity and reliability of the LIMB-Q scales, Function, and Symptoms in patients with chronic lower extremity wounds. Approach: Cognitive debriefing interviews with people with current or previous wounds were conducted to examine content validity. Scales were field-tested in an international sample of people with chronic lower extremity wounds sourced from an online platform (i.e., Prolific). Psychometric properties were examined using the Rasch Measurement Theory analysis. A test–retest reproducibility study was performed, and construct validity was examined. Results: Content validity was established after 10 cognitive interviews. A total of 233 people with lower extremity wounds (age 19–80 years, mean 39.3) participated in the field test. All 25 items tested demonstrated good fit to the Rasch model with ordered thresholds. One item had a fit residual outside –2.5, but no items had significant v2 values after Bonferroni adjustment. Reliability was high with the person separation index, Cronbach alpha, and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.8. Strong correlations were found between the Function and Symptoms scales and EQ-5D dimensions measuring similar constructs as well as the EQ-5D global score. All hypotheses for construct validity were confirmed. Innovation: Patient-reported outcome measures are an important component of patient-centered care, as they capture the patient’s perspective in a rigorous and reproducible way. Adding these two scales to the WOUND-Q provides a means to measure function and symptoms associated with lower extremity wounds. Conclusion: These new WOUND-Q scales can be used to measure outcomes important to patients with lower extremity wounds in clinical settings and research studies.",

Approach: First-in-human study investigating the safety and tolerability as primary endpoints and wound size effect and antimicrobial efficacy as secondary endpoints of SBE treatment in chronic leg wound patients. The study was divided into two as follows: a randomized, double-blinded, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) phase (n = 16 SBE; n = 4 placebo), where patients were treated with SBE or saline (placebo) only once, followed by an open-label, Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) phase (n = 8), where patients were treated with SBE once daily or twice daily over five days. Reporting is according to CONSORT guidelines. Results: SBE was safe and well-tolerated in chronic leg wound patients. There were no significant differences in pain during and after treatment with SBE or the placebo. The SBE treatment reduced bioburden in wounds compared to baseline, with 98% and 49% median reduction after SBE or placebo treatment, respectively. A dose-dependent trend in absolute wound size reduction was observed in the MAD groups with a median (min, max) change of -2.99 (-14.25, -1.5) cm2 in the once-daily and -10.48 (-17.95, -0.38) cm2 in the twice-daily group, respectively. Innovation and Conclusion: This study demonstrated the safe use of HOCl-based SBE in chronic leg wounds with promising trends of immediate antimicrobial action and beneficial effect on wound healing.",

Approach One hundred adults with foot wounds were recruited from Blacktown high risk foot service with a follow up period of 12 months. Serum vitamin C, D and zinc as well as routine baseline blood testing was undertaken. Wounds were measured using a three-dimensional wound camera and classified using the WIfI system at regular intervals. Results Vitamin C deficiency was present in 75% of participants, 50% had vitamin D deficiency and 38% had zinc deficiency. Diabetes was present in 91% of participants, and 50% had history of a previous amputation. Wound chronicity (p=.03) and toe pressures (p=.04) were predictive of wound healing. Serum vitamin C, D and zinc were not associated with significant differences in wound healing, or time to wound healing. Innovation Deficiencies in vitamin C, D and zinc were highly prevalent in patients participants with active foot ulceration. Wound chronicity was predictive of healing outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid access to best practice care. Conclusion This cohort had high deficiency rates of vitamin C, D and zinc consistent with previous literature, however there was not a relationship between these deficiencies and wound healing, or time to heal. Large randomised controlled trials are required to comprehensively determine if adequate levels of these nutrients improve wound healing outcomes.",

Approach: A crossover study with 36 professional scrub nurses at two medical centers was performed to compare 4% CHG followed by alcohol-based 1% CHG sanitizer lotion, the Two-stage method with handwashing using natural soap followed by alcohol-based 1% CHG sanitizer lotion, and the Waterless method, after a period of 10 days of use.

The Waterless method was significantly better than the Two-stage method regarding \"foaming,\" \"quality,\" \"longevity\" (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively), but \"disappearance\" was significantly better by the Two-stage method (p = 0.0095) during washing and rubbing. Immediately after washing and rubbing, the Waterless method was significantly better regarding \"tightness\" and \"moisture,\" whereas the Two-stage method was significantly better regarding \"stickiness\" (p = 0.0114, p = <0.0001, and 0.0059, respectively) Innovation: The Waterless method using natural soap during handwashing followed by alcohol-based 1% CHG sanitizer lotion was as effective as the Two-stage method of 4% CHG followed by alcohol-based 1% CHG sanitizer lotion.

    "abstract": "Significance: The standard of care for deep burn wounds is eschar excision and autologous skin grafting within the first postburn days. However, when this is not practical due to medical reasons, unavailable surgical facilities, or lack of donor sites or other coverage, surgeons have used topical cerium nitrate (CN) in a cream with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) for over four decades to convert the eschar into a pliable and protective crust that facilitates the postponement or staging of eschar excision and grafting. CN+SSD treatment is reported to reduce dressing changes, improve patient comfort, and reduce bacterial burden, with unaffected epithelialization and few complications. Recent Advances: CN aqueous solutions applied topically alone or together with solid silver dressings in animal models have mitigated wound injury progression, wound microbial burden, and systemic immune dysfunction. Critical Issues: CN+SSD cream is not approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its efficacy in clinical trials has been challenging to demonstrate. One reason is that CN changes the eschar visibly, introducing unavoidable bias. Also, the market and patient population is small and burn wound presentation is highly variable. Future Directions: For use in settings wherein the once- or twice-daily CN+SSD cream dressing changes are least feasible (low-income, military, and mass casualty settings), it may be possible to develop a solid dressing containing cerium and silver that requires infrequent dressing changes. For future clinical studies, the trial design most suited to comparing silver-containing dressings with and without cerium may be paired difference of matched intrapatient wounds.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Many treatments are utilized in the management of skin scarring; however, difficulties arise due to the high rates of recurrence and the identification of treatment efficacy in each patient, in particular, in the case of raised dermal scarring. Therefore, evaluation of treatments and the provision of objective scar assessment pre-therapy and post-therapy is of paramount importance to identify changes in scar characteristics using noninvasive devices. Recent Advances: There have been a number of emerging noninvasive objective quantitative devices, which assess specific scar parameters such as pliability, volume, color, perfusion, and depth. These can include three-dimensional imaging, optical coherence tomography, in vivo confocal microscopy, full-field laser perfusion imaging, and spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis. Critical Issues: Clinical assessment and grading scales are most commonly used to assess scarring; however, there is a need for more objective quantitative measures to monitor their maturation and response to therapy. Currently, there is no consensus as to which objective measuring device is most optimal when assessing skin scarring. There is a need for a predictor tool that allows early implementation of treatment and addresses diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Future Directions: Validation of noninvasive objective scar assessment tools is essential as well as further development of technologies. There are currently more modalities that assess physical scar characteristics and only few that measure the physiological parameters. Therefore, the development of a technology that quantifies the metabolic and cellular activity in skin scars is necessary to allow for bespoke strategies for each patient.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In this study, we seek to identify patient characteristics associated with limb loss and mortality while exploring the potential impact a multidisciplinary care team may have. Approach: This was a 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting to our tertiary care center for limb salvage with a diagnosis of lower extremity (LE) necrotizing fasciitis (NF). Patient demographics, clinical history, and outcomes were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors and between those who underwent LE amputation and those who did not. The article adheres to the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology statement. Results: Sixty-two patients presented to our tertiary care center for limb salvage with LE NF. Forty-two patients underwent LE amputation: 27 (43.5%) underwent below-knee amputation, 1 (1.6%) underwent above-knee amputation, 8 (12.9%) underwent transmetatarsal amputation and 2 (3.2%) underwent calcanectomy. The overall mortality rate was 16.1% (n = 10). Risk factors for mortality included increased age (p = 0.034), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.011), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.002), hypotension (p = 0.015), erythema (p = 0.010), pain (p = 0.027), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.012), and malignancy (p < 0.001). Risk factors for LE amputation included DM (p = 0.017), peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.033), and an elevated laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINC) (p = 0.033). Innovation: To identify outcomes after admission to a tertiary hospital with a dedicated limb salvage team with LE NF and to analyze risk factors for mortality and amputation. Conclusions: This is a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for mortality and amputation after LE NF. Our institution's experience highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the care of these patients.",

This seminal longitudinal study in mechanically ventilated adults describes image quality, the incidence of image artifacts, and their effect on image quality in critically ill subjects. Approach: Mechanically ventilated subjects from three adult intensive care units were enrolled, and multiple sacral images from each subject were obtained daily. Using a subset of best image per patient per day, artifacts were grouped, and their effect on image quality was statistically evaluated. Results: Of a total of 1761 images collected from 137 subjects, 8% were rated as poor. In the subset, 70% had good quality ratings. Four groups of artifacts were identified as follows: \"bubbles,\" \"texture problems,\" \"layer nondifferentiation,\" and \"reduced area for evaluation.\" Artifacts from at least one group were found in 83% of images. Bubbles were most frequently seen, but artifacts with adverse effect on image quality were \"layer nondifferentiation,\" \"texture problems,\" and \"reduced area for evaluation.\" Innovation: HFUS image evaluation is still in the development phase with respect to tissue injury use. Artifacts are generally omnipresent. Quickly recognizing artifacts that most significantly affect image quality during scanning will result in higher quality images for research and clinical applications. Conclusion: Good quality images were achievable in study units; although frequent artifacts were present in images, in general, they did not interfere with evaluation. Artifacts related to \"layer nondifferentiation\" was the greatest predictor of poor image quality, prompting operators to immediately rescan the area.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Use test methods to assess the oxygen compatibility of various wound care products. Approach: There are currently no standard test methods specifically for evaluating the oxygen compatibility and safety of materials under hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) conditions. However, tests such as the oxygen index (OI), oxygen exposure (OE), and autogenous ignition temperature (AIT) can provide useful information. Results: The OI test measures the minimum oxygen concentration that will support candle-like burning, and it was used to test 44 materials. All but two exhibited an OI equal to or greater (safer) than a control material commonly used in HBO. The OE test exposes each material to an oxygen-enriched atmosphere (>99.5% oxygen) to monitor temperature and pressure for an extended duration. The results of the OE testing indicated that none of the 44 articles tested with this method self-ignited within the 60°C, 3 atm pressurized oxygen atmosphere. The AIT test exposes materials to a rapid ramp up in temperature in HBO conditions at 3 atm until ignition occurs. Ten wound care materials and seven materials usually avoided in HBO chambers were tested. The AIT ranged from 138°C to 384°C for wound care products and from 146°C to 420°C for the other materials. Innovation: This work provides useful data and recommendations to help develop a new standard approach for evaluating the HBO compatibility of wound care products to ensure safety for patients and clinicians. Conclusion: The development of an additional test to measure the risk of electrostatic discharge of materials in HBO conditions is needed.",

The aim of this study was to improve cell distribution within the scaffold, to increase seeding efficiency, to facilitate tissue ingrowth and vascularization of the resultant grafts, and finally to boost the successful rate of transplantation. Approach: A syringe-aided inoculation method was designed to anchor bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) onto the central pores of the chitosan scaffold by repeat positive aspiration. The cell distribution, cell number, vascularization and mineralization at the central region of the tissue-engineered constructs treated by syringe-aided and regular two-side inoculation methods were evaluated side by side using the WST-8, immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and von Kossa staining. Results: The tissue-engineered constructs treated by the syringe-aided inoculation methods exhibited a larger number of BMSCs with uniform distribution, as well as more robust vascularization and mineralization in the central regions when compared with those treated by the two-side inoculation method both in vitro and in vivo. Innovation: This is the first time that the influence of a syringe-aided inoculation method has been evaluated with respect to the vascularization and mineralization of implanted grafts. Conclusion: The syringe-aided inoculation methods used in this study might provide an approach through which to improve cell distribution within the scaffold, facilitate the subsequent tissue ingrowth into the scaffold, and promote the vascularization and mineralization of tissue-engineered grafts.",

    "abstract": "Objective: MRL/MpJ mice are known for enhanced healing, but mechanistic details or how specific aspects of wounding (e.g., angiogenesis) contribute to healing are unknown. While previous studies investigated the systemic effects of immunity in MRL/MpJ healing, few have focused on tissue-intrinsic effects. Approach:Ex vivo skin biopsies from MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mice were cultured in ex vivo conditions that favor endothelial cell growth to compare their angiogenic potential. We localized enhanced angiogenesis quantitative trait loci (QTL) in an F2 intercross. We then performed an expression analysis in cultured skin biopsies from MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J mice to determine the pathways that are associated with the capacity for differential growth. Results: MRL/MpJ biopsies have a two- to threefold greater growth potential than C57BL/6J mice, supporting the hypothesis that angiogenesis may contribute to enhanced healing in MRL/MpJ skin. We mapped two QTLs that are unique from previously mapped MRL/MpJ wound healing QTLs and detected interactions between wound healing QTLs and loci in this cross. Additionally, we found that pathways previously implicated in MRL/MpJ healing are also enriched in skin biopsies. Innovation: We have developed a novel approach to determine how specific aspects of tissue development contribute to wound healing that will ultimately lead to the discovery of unidentified genes that contribute to enhanced healing. Conclusion: We have shown that, consistent with previous studies following wound closure in MRL/MpJ mice, vessel growth during healing is also influenced by genetic background. Our ongoing work will identify the genetic factors that should be useful biomarkers or as therapeutic targets for enhanced wound healing.",

Approach:In vitro model systems of re-epithelialization using the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line were utilized in monitoring expression of differentiation markers, including desmoplakin and various cytokeratins while evaluating for an association with chemokine CXCL11 expression. Results: CXCL11 expression was elevated in sparse culture with peak expression near the time of confluence. This somewhat followed the accumulation of desmoplakin in detergent-insoluble pool of proteins. However, in postconfluent, despite continued accumulation of desmoplakin within cells, CXCL11 expression decreased to baseline levels. This biphasic pattern was also seen in low calcium culture, an environment that inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and accumulation of desmosomal proteins. Highest CXCL11-expressing areas best correlated with newly confluent areas within culture expressing basal keratin 14, but also activated keratin 6. Innovation: Achievement of a threshold cellular density induces cell signaling cascade through CXCR3 that, in addition to other undiscovered pathways, can progress cutaneous wounds from the proliferative into the remodeling phases of cutaneous wound healing. Conclusion: These results suggest that the achievement of confluence with increased cellular density by migrating keratinocytes at the wound edge triggers expression of CXCL11. Since CXCR3 stimulation in endothelial cells results in apoptosis and causes neovascular pruning, whereas stimulation of CXCR3 in fibroblasts results decreased motility and cellular contraction, we speculate that CXCL11 expression by epidermal cells upon achieving cellular confluence could be the source of CXCR3 stimulation in the dermis ushering a transition from proliferative to remodeling phases of wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with increased risk of nonhealing ulcers, amputation, and mortality due to occlusive atherosclerotic plaques. Computed tomography (CT) imaging detects vascular calcification in PAD; however, quantitative vessel-by-vessel analysis of calcium burden in the feet of PAD patients has not been assessed. This study sought to perform quantitative analysis of vessel-specific calcium burden and examine the patient-level determinants of foot calcium burden in PAD patients. Approach: PAD patients (n = 41) were prospectively enrolled and underwent CT imaging of the lower extremities. Manual segmentation of the medial plantar, lateral plantar, and dorsalis pedis arteries was performed. CT image Hounsfield units (HUs) were obtained for each artery to quantify vessel-by-vessel calcium mass using a cutoff value of ≥130 HU. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate patient-level determinants of calcium burden for each foot artery. STROBE guidelines were used for reporting of data. Results: Univariate analyses revealed that body mass index, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were significant determinants of foot calcium burden in PAD patients. Image analysis demonstrated that PAD patients with DM had significantly higher calcium mass for the medial plantar (p = 0.005), lateral plantar (p = 0.039), and dorsalis pedis (p = 0.001) arteries compared with PAD patients without DM. Innovation: This is the first study to use CT imaging to quantify vessel-specific calcium burden in the feet of patients with PAD and evaluate the patient-level determinants of foot calcium burden in the setting of PAD. Conclusion: CT imaging quantifies vessel-specific calcification in the feet of PAD patients, which is exacerbated with concomitant DM, CKD, and/or obesity.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Pressure injuries are prevalent, yet preventable global health care problem estimated to affect 14% of hospital patients and up to 46% of aged care residents. One common prevention strategy is improving skin integrity through emollient therapy to optimize hydration and avoid skin breakdown. Therefore, this study aimed to review the literature and determine effectiveness of inert emollients, moisturizers, and barrier preparations compared with standard care, to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. Recent Advances: Search terms were derived with database searches, including ProQuest, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and the Cochrane library. The Robins1 and Risk of Bias 2 (Rob2) quality appraisal tools were used. A meta-analysis of the effects of interventions was conducted (random effects). Four studies met the inclusion criteria, with heterogeneous quality. Pooling of nonrandomized studies found that the application of emollients, moisturizers or barrier preparations did not significantly reduce incidence of pressure injury compared with standard care (relative risk 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-1.63, Z = 1.15, p = 0.25). Critical Issues: This review suggests that the use of inert moisturizers, emollients, or barrier preparations for preventing pressure injuries was not effective to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. However, there was a distinct lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with only one meeting the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, most of the included studies did not report on the frequency of application of the product, making it difficult to determine if application was in line with current international guidelines. One included study, which utilized a combination of neutral body wash and emollient demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of stage one and two pressure injuries. This combination of care may further support skin integrity and should be further examined in future trials. Future Directions: Future studies should ideally be RCTs, which control for skin cleansing, and implement an inert moisturizer emollient or barrier preparation as part of a pressure injury reduction bundle of care. Standardization of the application of the product, the volume of product applied at each application, and the quality of the product should also be considered.",

Approach: Narrative description of HEOR methodology with supporting references. Results: With the increasing costs of clinical trials, the use of observational studies in a real-world setting will be essential. Wound care clinicians should understand the importance of proper methods for conducting CER studies. Propensity score methods and marginal structural modeling can create a \"quasi-randomized\" environment for measuring wound closure and can help drive informed decision-making. In wound care, a paucity of HEOR information is available with great reluctance to use this information by payers, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and other agencies. Furthermore, a limited amount of high-quality retrospective data to measure wound care outcomes exist. The U.S. Wound Registry is one of few data sources that accurately reports on outcomes for all wound types and is a Qualified Clinical Data Registry. Innovation and Conclusions: Several CER approaches in observational studies provide sufficiently detailed information to help decision-makers make informed choices about wound care products regarding efficacy in the real-world setting. Using CER and cost-effectiveness studies succinctly needs to be incorporated if progress is to be made in improving wound care outcomes and reducing cost.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Despite the effectiveness of skin autotransplantation, the high degree of immunogenicity of the skin precludes the use of allografts and systemic immunosuppression is generally inappropriate for isolated skin grafts. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) is a potent immunoregulatory factor with allo- and autoimmune suppression and tolerance induction properties. This study examines the potential use of locally expressed IDO to prolong the allogeneic skin graft take in a mouse model. Approach: Syngeneic-fibroblasts were transfected with noncompetent IDO viral vector and the level of Kynurenine (Kyn) in conditioned medium was measured as an index for IDO activity. Either 1 or 3 × 106 IDO-fibroblasts were introduced intra/hypo-dermally to the mouse skin. The expression, localization, and functionality of IDO were then evaluated. The cell-injected areas were harvested and grafted on the back of allogeneic mice. The graft survival, immune-cells infiltration, and interaction with dendritic cells were evaluated. Results: The results showed a significant improvement in allogeneic graft take injected with 1 × 106 IDO-fibroblasts (18.4 ± 3.3 days) compared with control (12.2 ± 1.9 days). This duration increased to 35.4 ± 4.7 days in grafts injected with 3 × 106 IDO-expressing cells. This observation might be due to a significantly lower T cells infiltration within the IDO-grafts. Further, the result of a flow cytometric analysis showed that the expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 on CD11c+/eFluor+ cells in the regional lymph nodes of injected skin areas was significantly higher in IDO groups compared with control. Conclusion: These data suggest that allogeneic skin graft survival outcome can be prolonged significantly by local overexpression of IDO without any systemic effect.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Gastrostomy tubes (GTs) are one of the most common procedures in neonatal surgery, and their malfunction represents one of the most common complaints in the emergency room and clinic. Complications can occur in up to one-third of patients and include pain, peristomal leak, and infection, but can range in severity. We hypothesize that a preventative strategy employing a GT fixation dressing at the time of operation minimizes these postoperative complications in neonates. Approach: All patients less than 1 year of age who underwent laparoscopic GT placement by a single surgeon in the study period were reviewed. All tubes were secured in place on the external abdominal wall for 2 weeks postoperatively. Demographics and outcomes were evaluated. Results: Fifty-three percent of our cohort were male, and 47% were premature. The most common indication for placement was failure to thrive (59%), and common comorbid conditions were characterized as neurologic (71%), and cardiac (59%). The dressing did not prevent hypertrophic granulation tissue formation, but no patient experienced surgical site infection or device-related pressure injury at 30 and 120 days postoperatively. No patient required reoperation or readmission. Innovation: This simple, one-time, cost-effective fixation dressing has the potential to reduce some of the most common postoperative surgical issues in neonatal patients and can be applied in almost any health care setting. Conclusions: A dressing aimed at tube fixation and immobilization for the first two postoperative weeks averts some of the major complications of GT placement over a standard follow-up period as compared with the literature.",

The literature lacks a comprehensive review of the volume, management, and outcomes of children sustaining soft tissue injury. We briefly review the existing literature for traumatic wounds such as open fractures and burns. Such injuries require dedicated wound care and we propose a novel approach for more efficient and more effective delivery of dedicated pediatric wound care. Recent Advances: New pediatric literature is emerging regarding the long-term effects of wound care pain in traumatic injuries-especially burns. A variety of wound dressings and alternative management techniques exist and are geared toward reducing wound care pain. Our institution utilizes a unique model to provide adequate sedation and pain control through a dedicated pediatric wound care unit. We believe that this model reduces the cost of wound care by decreasing emergency department and operating room visits as well as hospital length of stay. Critical Issues: First, medical costs related to pediatric traumatic wound care are not insignificant. The need for adequate pain control and sedation in children with complex wounds is traditionally managed with operating room intervention. Afterward, added costs can be from a hospital stay for ongoing acute wound management. Second, morbidities of complex traumatic wounds are shown to be related to the acute wound care received. Future Directions: Further guidelines are needed to determine the most effective and efficient care of complex traumatic soft tissue injuries in the pediatric population.",

The highest-risk patient populations have foot ulcers, ischemic disease, diabetes mellitus, and/or compromised kidney function. Optimal wound healing protocols require evaluation of both tissue and arterial perfusion. The most widely known test, ankle brachial index (ABI), has general but limited utility in foot ulcer patients. False negatives secondary to medial artery calcification are common and ABI alone is not considered predictive of wound healing. As many high-risk patients consider their medical home to be their primary care physician (PCP) not a limb preservation center (LPC), high-risk patients can be underserved secondary to inadequate awareness of the disease, limited diagnostics, and inefficient referral.Access to clinically appropriate, tissue-diagnostic tools for high-risk populations coupled with health information transfer (HIT) between PCP and LPCs provides the opportunity to bring PAD/CLI expertise to a patient's medical home. Coordinated data management coupled with PAD/CLI protocols can promote timely and appropriate referral and subsequent intervention.SensiLase® Studycast® System provides a noninvasive diagnostic and data management system specifically designed for high-risk patients.

    "abstract": "Objective: Xenografts of human skin in immunodeficient mice provide a means of assessing human skin physiology and its response to wounding. Approach: We describe a novel xenograft model using full-thickness human neonatal foreskin to examine human skin wound repair. Full-thickness 8 mm human neonatal foreskin biopsies were sutured into the dorsum of NOD scid gamma (NSG; NOD.Cg-Prkdc scidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) pups as subcutaneous grafts. At postnatal day 21 the subcutaneous grafts were exposed to cutaneous grafts. Following maturation of 2 months, xenografts were then wounded with 5 mm linear incisions and monitored until postwound day (PWD) 14 to study skin repair and fibrosis. To explore whether our model can be used to test the efficacy of topical therapies, wounded xenografts were injected with antifibrotic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) for the first four consecutive PWDs. Xenografts were harvested for analysis by histology and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Results: Xenografts were successfully engrafted with evidence of mouse-human anastomoses and resembled native neonatal foreskin at the gross and microscopic level. Wounded xenografted skin scarred with human collagen and an expansion of CD26-positive human fibroblasts. Collagen scar was quantitated by neural network analysis, which revealed distinct clustering of collagen fiber networks from unwounded skin and wounded skin at PWD7 and PWD14. Collagen fiber networks within FGF2-treated wounds at PWD14 resembled those in untreated wounded xenografts at PWD7, suggesting that FGF2 treatment at time of wounding can reduce fibrosis. Innovation and Conclusion: This novel xenograft model can be used to investigate acute fibrosis, fibroblast heterogeneity, and the efficacy of antifibrotic agents during wound repair in human skin.",

Approach: The study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), AMSTAR, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Randomized controlled trials comparing LP with placebo were retrieved from five electronic databases. Primary outcome in the study was cumulative intravenous morphine equivalent consumption (mg) within 24 h postoperatively. Results: Twelve trials comprising 617 patients were included in the final analysis. Primary result indicated that the analgesic effects LP were only statistical but not clinically significant of postoperative intravenous morphine consumption within 24 h (mean difference, -4.61 mg; 95% confidence interval, -8.09 to -1.14). Interestingly, the results of subgroup and meta-regression analysis indicated that preoperative administration of LP had potential advantages in postoperative wound pain management. It is also worthwhile to mention that LP provided a clinically important benefit in rest pain scores within 24-h postoperatively. Apart from these, other secondary outcome analysis did not uncover any particularly significant analgesic or safety advantages to LP. Finally, LP also does not increase the risk of any local anesthetic-related side effects. Innovation: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides moderate-to-high quality evidence undermining the role of LP for management of acute postoperative wound pain after surgical procedures and the justification for the associated extra costs. Conclusion: Taken together, the current evidence does not support LP as part of a routine multimodal analgesia strategy to alleviate early postoperative acute pain. However, further studies should explore the clinical value of preoperative administration and the long-term effect of LP.",

Elucidating this remarkable mechanism can result in tremendous benefits to prevent scarring. Fetal mouse cutaneous wounds before embryonic day (E)18 heal without scar. Herein, we analyze expression profiles of fetal and postnatal wounds utilizing updated gene annotations and pathway analysis to further delineate between repair and regeneration. Approach: Dorsal wounds from time-dated pregnant BALB/c mouse fetuses and adult mice at various time points were collected. Total RNA was isolated and microarray analysis was performed using chips with 42,000 genes. Significance analysis of microarrays was utilized to select genes with >2-fold expression differences with a false discovery rate of <2. Enrichment analysis was performed on significant genes to identify differentially expressed pathways. Results: Our analysis identified 471 differentially expressed genes in fetal versus adult wounds following injury. Utilizing enrichment analysis of significant genes, we identified the top 20 signaling pathways that were upregulated and downregulated at 1 and 12 h after injury. At 24 h after injury, we discovered 18 signaling pathways upregulated in adult wounds and 11 pathways upregulated in fetal wounds. Innovation: These novel target genes and pathways may reveal repair mechanisms of the early fetus that promote regeneration over fibrosis. Conclusion: Our microarray analysis recognizes hundreds of possible genes as candidates for regulators of scarless versus scarring wound repair. Enrichment analysis reveals 109 signaling pathways related to fetal scarless wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of a concentrated surfactant gel preserved with antimicrobials and a concentrated surfactant gel with 1% silver sulfadiazine (SSD) against 12 clinical strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and the type strain A. baumannii ATCC 19606. Approach: The biofilm-forming potential of the A. baumannii isolates was investigated using a crystal violet assay and classifying the isolates as \"non-adherent,\" \"weak,\" \"moderate,\" or \"strong\" biofilm formers. The antimicrobial activity was determined using the zone of inhibition (ZOI) method. The antibiofilm activity was evaluated against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 using the Center for Disease Control bioreactor model. Results:A. baumannii readily forms biofilms with 8 out of the 12 clinical isolates being classified as strong biofilm formers (OD570 > 0.4). The concentrated surfactant gel with 1% SSD demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all isolates with a ZOI of 7.2-14 mm. Antibiofilm activity against a 24 h biofilm of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 was found, with a ≥7 log decrease in bacterial cell density following 24 h treatment with the concentrated surfactant gel with 1% SSD. The concentrated surfactant gel preserved with antimicrobials also showed some biofilm disruption with ∼3 log decrease in bacterial cell density being found. Innovation: The concentrated surfactant gel with 1% SSD used in this study showed antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against A. baumannii. Conclusion: The concentrated surfactant gel with 1% SSD used in this study showed efficacy against A. baumannii, a common cause of wound infections, and should be considered for treatment of wounds infected with A. baumannii in health care settings.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Full-thickness burn wounds require immediate coverage, and the primary clinical approaches comprise of skin allografts and autografts. The use of allografts is often temporary due to the antigenicity of allografts. In contrast, the availability of skin autografts may be limited in large burn injuries. In such cases, skin autografts can be expanded through the use of a skin mesher, creating meshed split-thickness skin grafts (MSTSGs). MSTSGs have revolutionized the treatment of large full-thickness burn injuries since the 1960s. However, contractures and poor esthetic outcomes remain a problem. We previously formulated and prepared an in situ forming skin substitute, called MeshFill (MF), which can conform to complex shapes and contours of wounds. The objective of this study was to assess the esthetic and wound healing outcomes in full-thickness wounds treated with a combination of MF and MSTSG in a porcine model. Approach: Either MSTSGs or MSTSG+MF was applied to full-thickness excisional wounds in Yorkshire pigs. Wound healing outcomes were assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and wound surface area analysis from day 10 to 60. Clinical evaluation of wounds were utilized to assess esthetic outcomes. Results: The results demonstrated that the combination of MSTSGs and MF improved wound healing and esthetic outcomes. Innovation: Effects of MSTSGs and reconstitutable liquid MF in a full-thickness porcine model were investigated for the first time. Conclusion: MF provides promise as a combination therapeutic regimen to improve wound healing and esthetic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that fail to heal with standard care should be treated with advanced wound care products. Efficacy of advanced therapies is dependent on many factors. A secondary analysis of pivotal trial data for a bilayered cellular construct used in the treatment of DFU was undertaken to determine if glycemic control and other factors had an effect on time to healing. Approach: We analyzed the effect of age, gender, diabetes type, insulin usage, body mass index, smoking, initial and ending glycohemoglobin (HgbA1c), Charcot deformity, and wound area, duration, and location on likelihood of healing for wounds treated with bilayered cellular construct (BLCC). Results: In those treated with BLCC, initial wound area (cm2), age, and history of Charcot deformity were found to significantly affect healing. Neither initial HgbA1c nor change in HgbA1c was associated with healing. The bilayered product was found to be equally effective regardless of initial or change in HgbA1c levels (p-values 0.94 and 0.44, respectively). In the control group, initial HgbA1c, insulin usage, female gender, and wound location at the toes significantly influenced healing. Innovation: BLCC subgroup analysis to elucidate selection criteria allowing for targeted use of advanced products on those more likely to respond as well as direct further research into prognostic indicators for BLCC-treated patients. Conclusion: The bilayered cellular construct product remains equally effective regardless of initial or change in HgbA1c levels. Further specific research into the effect of glucose control and other factors on the effectiveness of different advanced DFU treatment products is recommended.",

Approach: Wound material was extracted from patients with nonhealing diabetic ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and arterial wounds. Microbial species were identified, and wound colonization was quantified. Extracted samples were then exposed to a PPA-containing topical anti-infective as an instillation solution with negative pressure wound therapy NPWT at concentrations of 1,000, 1,500, or 2,500 ppm for a period of 1, 5, or 10 min to determine the effect of exposure on isolated pathogens, including effect on proteins. Results: A total of 32 samples were collected from patients. Samples presented with a range of bacteria and fungi representing 14 genera and 22 species, many of which are or are evolving to be resistant to many, if not most, current systemic antibiotics. Thirteen of twenty-three samples (57%) from chronic wounds had bacteria counts ≥105 and most were 6 logs or more. Seven of 10 samples (70%) from acute wounds had bacteria counts ≤105 and most were much lower. Exposure to PPA-containing topical anti-infective at 1,000 ppm killed all bacteria and fungi in all samples within 1 min of exposure. Innovation: PPA-containing topical anti-infective is a potentially valuable clinical option for NPWT. Conclusion: PPA-containing topical anti-infective is a potential candidate for use as an NPWT instillation solution for the treatment of wound infections caused by susceptible pathogens.",

    "abstract": "For patients suffering from catastrophic burns, few treatment options are available. Chimeric coculture of patient-derived autologous cells with a \"carrier\" cell source of allogeneic keratinocytes has been proposed as a means to address the complex clinical problem of severe skin loss.Currently, autologous keratinocytes are harvested, cultured, and expanded to form graftable epidermal sheets. However, epidermal sheets are thin, are extremely fragile, and do not possess barrier function, which only develops as skin stratifies and matures. Grafting is typically delayed for up to 4 weeks to propagate a sufficient quantity of the patient's cells for application to wound sites.Fully stratified chimeric bioengineered skin substitutes could not only provide immediate wound coverage and restore barrier function, but would simultaneously deliver autologous keratinocytes to wounds. The ideal allogeneic cell source for this application would be an abundant supply of clinically evaluated, nontumorigenic, pathogen-free, human keratinocytes. To evaluate this potential cell-based therapy, mixed populations of a green fluorescent protein-labeled neonatal human keratinocyte cell line (NIKS) and unlabeled primary keratinocytes were used to model the allogeneic and autologous components of chimeric monolayer and organotypic cultures.Relatively few autologous keratinocytes may be required to produce fully stratified chimeric skin substitute tissue substantially composed of autologous keratinocyte-derived regions. The need for few autologous cells interspersed within an allogeneic \"carrier\" cell population may decrease cell expansion time, reducing the time to patient application.This study provides proof of concept for utilizing NIKS keratinocytes as the allogeneic carrier for the generation of bioengineered chimeric skin substitute tissues capable of providing immediate wound coverage while simultaneously supplying autologous human cells for tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The worldwide estimate of burns requiring medical attention each year is 11 million. Each year in the United States, ∼486,000 burn injuries receive medical attention, including 40,000 hospitalizations. Scars resulting from burns can be disfiguring and impair functions. The development of prophylactic drugs for cutaneous scarring could improve the outcomes for burns, traumatic lacerations (>6 million/year treated in U.S. emergency rooms), and surgical incisions (∼250 million/year worldwide). Antiscar pharmaceuticals have been estimated to have a market of $12 billion. Recent Advances: Many small molecules, cells, proteins/polypeptides, and nucleic acids have mitigated scarring in animal studies and clinical trials, but none have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval yet. Critical Issues: The development of antiscar pharmaceuticals involves the identification of the proper dose, frequency of application, and window of administration postwounding for the indicated wound. Risks of infection and impaired healing must be considered. Scar outcome needs to be evaluated after scars have matured. Future Directions: Once treatments have demonstrated safety and efficacy in rodent and/or rabbit and porcine wound models, human testing can begin, such as on artificially created wounds on healthy subjects and on bilateral-surgical wounds, comparing treatments versus vehicle controls on intrapatient-matched wounds, before testing on separate cohorts of patients. Given the progress made in the past 20 years, FDA-approved drugs for improving scar outcomes may be expected.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To analyze long-term outcomes following inpatient treatment of infected wounds with antimicrobial or normal saline instillation during negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Approach: This was a single-center retrospective study analyzing the course of patients receiving 0.9% normal saline or 0.1% polyhexanide plus 0.1% betaine as instillation for wounds requiring surgery. Measured outcomes included rates of dehiscence, new wounds, re-operations, amputations, and mortality over 5 years. The article adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. Results: Forty-two patients received normal saline instillation and 41 the antiseptic solution. Rates of dehiscence, wound recurrence, and re-operations in the saline and antiseptic cohorts were 6.3% and 5.6%, 9.4% and 5.6%, and 14.3% and 9.8%, respectively (p > 0.05). In patients requiring further surgery, time to wound closure averaged 104 and 130 days in the saline and antiseptic cohorts, respectively (p = 0.81). Five-year amputation and mortality rates were 14.3% and 22% (p = 0.36) and 24% and 17% (p = 0.45) in the saline and antiseptic cohorts, respectively. Innovation: To compare clinical outcomes associated with two fundamentally different instillation solutions over the full wound care episode and elucidate the potential impact of these results for future applications. Conclusion: This is the first evaluation of nonsurrogate outcomes of different instillations for NPWT in infected wounds. The results indicate that normal saline instillation outcomes are comparable to those of 0.1% polyhexanide plus 0.1% betaine. The clinical success, cost benefit, and accessibility of normal saline can expand the utilization of this therapeutic approach for larger patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We hypothesized that patients with poor glycemic control undergoing treatment for diabetic foot infections (DFIs) would have a poorer prognosis than those with better metabolic control assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Approach: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 245 patients with moderate and severe DFIs. HbA1c values were dichotomized (<7% or ≥7% and ≤75th percentile (P75) and >P75) to analyze patient outcomes regarding metabolic control. The present study adhered to the STROBE guidelines for cohort studies. Results: One hundred sixty-nine patients (69%) were men. Their mean age was 60.7 years (10.8). HbA1c ≥7% was detected in 203 patients (82.9%). P75 HbA1c was 10.9%. After performing univariate analysis, we found an association of HbA1c <7% with major amputations and mortality. However, after applying the logistic regression model, we did not find HbA1c <7% to be a predictive factor of major amputation. The risk factors for mortality following application of Cox's proportional hazards model were osteomyelitis (HR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.07-0.62, p < 0.01), eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0-7.5, p = 0.04), and HbA1c <7% (HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.8-13.2, p < 0.01). Innovation: The group with optimal glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) had a shorter survival time than those with worse metabolic control. Conclusions: We did not find a longer duration of hospitalization, a higher rate of amputations, or longer healing times in the groups with worse metabolic control. HbA1c <7% was a risk factor for mid-term mortality.",

Approach: Utilize a novel noninvasive fine-sampled photographic methodology to quantify wound healing parameters for healing phases from wounding through to wound closure. Results: Parameters associated with key healing phases were quantified and compared between nonaged and aged cohorts of both genders. The results identify a sexual dimorphism in dermal wound healing, with nonaged females exhibiting a greater overall healing efficiency than males. This enhanced healing in females, however, senesces with age such that healing parameters for aged males and females are statistically indistinguishable. Topical application of FGF-1 was identified as an effective therapeutic intervention to treat dermal healing senescence in aged females. Innovation: The FGF intervention is being analyzed using a new recently published model. This approach significantly increases the amount of preclinical animal data obtainable in wound healing studies, minimizes cohort number compared with (lethal) histological studies, and permits a direct statistical comparison between different healing studies. Conclusion: Quantitative parameters of dermal wound healing, obtained from noninvasive fine-sampled photographic data, identify topical FGF-1 as an effective therapeutic to treat the senescence of dermal healing present in aged female BALB/cByJ mice.",

Approach: First, the central retinal artery was secured with embolization by the transophthalmic arterial, a terminal branch of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and then, the branches of the external carotid artery (ECA) were embolized to cause a response in the AVM vasculature followed by sclerotherapy and surgery. Results: Over a 3-year follow-up of palpebral and periorbital AVMs in four females and one male 20 to 50 years of age with a mean age of 38 years, complete remission of the lesions were seen with no major complication, such as blindness, ptosis, or cerebral infarction, with functionally sound and esthetically acceptable results, with no recurrence or worsening even with one case of ulceration postembolization. Innovation: Planned treatment of palpebral and periorbital AVMs, which have been often left untreated because of their complex vasculature and a risk of total blindness due to occlusion of the central retinal artery. A \"wait-and-watch\" approach is frequently taken. It is important to secure the periphery to the bifurcation of the central retinal artery of the ICA, and then, embolization through the ECA results in complete remission of the lesion, followed by sclerotherapy and surgery, which are successful both in terms of function and esthetics. Conclusion: First, securing the central retinal artery leads to safer and complete resolution of palpebral and periorbital AVMs; wounding or therapeutic complications such as skin necrosis may be seen, but this approach results in complete remission in 3 years with no major complications.",

Approach: We compared chemical properties as well as bacteriostatic ability of MPO in different concentrations with NeutroPhase. Subsequently, we applied MPO (MPO group), NeutroPhase (NeutroPhase group), NaCl+H2O2 (NaCl+H2O2 group), or NaCl (control group) on rat dorsal burn wounds inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Their effects on MRSA-colonized wounds were evaluated by microscopy, histologic section, and Western blot. Results: MPO produced more H+ and HClO-, leading to a more acidic environment. Moreover, MPO inhibited the growth of MRSA more intensely after 6 h of inoculation ex vivo. In vivo the open wound rate in the MPO group was significantly lower, while the contraction rate and epithelialization rate of MPO group were higher than that of the control group, NaCl+H2O2 group, and NeutroPhase group on day 20. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of MPO group showed better wound healing than other groups. More vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was expressed in wound tissue of MPO group by Western blot. Innovation: This is the first study to use MPO for MRSA-colonized burn wound therapy.

    "abstract": "Objective: In recent years, reticulated open-cell foam-based closed-incision negative pressure therapy (ROCF-ciNPT) has shown effectiveness in management of various postoperative incisions. These dressings consist of a skin interface layer that absorbs fluid from the skin surface and reduces the potential for microbial colonization within the dressing by means of ionic silver. This study examines the ability of silver to reduce the bioburden within the dressing as well as the localized effect due to potential silver mobility. Approach: Ability of silver to reduce bioburden within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was assessed using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. Furthermore, silver mobility was assessed using an in vitro skin model to study the zone of inhibition along with released silver quantification. Using a porcine model, diffusion of silver into blood and tissue was studied using emission spectrometry and histology. Results: Microbial growth in the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was significantly reduced (∼2.7–4.9 log reduction) compared to a silver-free negative control. No zone of inhibition was observed for microbial colonies for up to 7 days with minimal localized silver release (<5.5 ppm release). In vivo studies demonstrated no measurable concentration (<0.2 μg/g) of silver in the blood, urine, feces, kidney, and liver tissue biopsy. Innovation: This study provides an important insight into silver concentration and mobility within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing, given emerging concerns associated with potential silver cytotoxicity. Conclusion: These results indicate the concentration of silver (0.019% silver by weight) in the ROCF-ciNPT dressings has been adequate to reduce bioburden within the skin interface layer, while severely limiting the amount of silver leaching out.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To compare the number of ulcer-free days during 24 months in persons with diabetes and a healed foot ulcer below the ankle provided with adjusted therapeutic shoes who were given standard information and participated in participant-driven group education compared with standard information alone. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the number of ulcer-free days after participant-driven group education in addition to standard information compared with standard information alone. The number needed to treat (N = 174) was not met, as only 138 persons with diabetes and previously healed foot ulcer were recruited (age median 63 years [34-79], 101 men/37 women). Results: A total of 138 persons were recruited, of whom 107 (77.5%) completed the study, 7 (5%) dropped out, and 12 (9%) deceased. No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention group compared with the control group after 6, 18, or 24 months. After 12 months, more patients in the intervention group had developed ulcers. Seventy-seven participants (56%) developed new foot ulcers, irrespective of side and site. Development of one ulcer appeared in 36 participants, two ulcers in 19, and 22 participants developed three ulcers. Forty-eight participants remained ulcer-free (35%) during the 24-month follow-up. Median ulcer-free days until first ulceration were 368 (4-720); until second ulceration, 404 (206-631); and until third ulceration, 660 (505-701). The participants wore prescribed therapeutic shoes during 88% of the follow-up visits. Conclusions: One-third of the participants remained ulcer-free for 24 months. Patient-driven education in groups did not give better results than standard information in this underpowered study. This study illustrates the challenges to perform comparative preventive studies in this group of patients with extensive comorbidity. Further studies are needed to evaluate interventions on ulceration in persons with a healed foot ulcer.",

    "abstract": "Scope and Significance: Pressure ulcers are very difficult to treat and pose an economic burden, just below cancer and cardiovascular illness, at 4.82 billion U.S. dollars. It is important to understand the pathophysiology of the condition, risk stratification, and ways of preventing it. Prevention forms the most important aspect of their management. The authors systematically evaluated the existing risk prediction scales and explored the evidence from literature regarding the role of additional factors including body mass index, obesity, subcutaneous tissue thickness, and skin integrity in pressure ulcers. With this review it is hoped that the future management of pressure ulcers will concentrate on the preventable and alterable factors in its pathophysiology. Translational Relevance: The review focuses on how adipose tissue thickness can predict the occurrence of pressure ulcer. If adequately proved that a definite thickness of peripheral adipose tissue is efficient in prevention of pressure ulcers, then methods of maintaining the thickness of this tissue will be the next effective strategy in the management of this chronic issue. Clinical Relevance: The review addresses the management of pressure ulcers to wound care providers and emphasize on confounding parameters of obesity, subcutaneous tissue thickness, and skin integrity during the treatment regimen of pressure ulcers. Objectives: The main objective of this review is to draw a consensus concerning the role of adipose tissue in pressure ulcers, based on the published research. A review of the various preexisting predictive scales for pressure ulcers is a secondary objective to highlight the shortcomings in ulcer management. This review finally aims in the future at paving a way to refine our prognosticating scales for pressure sores based on these results. Accurate preventative injury risk scales are needed so that preventative resources can be directed to the patients for whom they are the most appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Significance: A variety of topical antiseptic substances have been used historically to treat open wounds with suspected tissue infection or that are slow to heal. However, the effectiveness of these substances in treating infected or recalcitrant wounds remains controversial. Recent Advances: Newly formulated topical antiseptics delivered through differing dressing technologies, such as ionic substances, hold the potential to limit the development of and treat antibiotic-resistant microbes in open wounds. Other topically delivered substances, such as insect-derived substances, orthomolecular agents, and phytochemicals, also present opportunities to optimize wound healing by decreasing tissue bioburden and facilitating the wound healing process. Critical Issues: Limited systemic perfusion of open wounds in individuals with certain diagnoses, such as peripheral arterial disease or necrotizing infection and the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant wound pathogens, suggests a continued role for topically applied antiseptic agents. Likewise, the failure of wounds to heal when treated with standard of care therapy opens the door to innovative treatment approaches that include the natural substances described in this article. Future Directions: Evidence for the use of select topical antiseptic agents from each of the aforementioned categories will be discussed in this article. Additional well-controlled clinical studies are needed to provide definitive recommendations for many of these topical agents.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Tissue-engineered artificial skin for clinical reconstruction can be regarded as an established practice. Bi-layered skin equivalents are available as established allogenic or autologous therapy, and various acellular skin replacements can support tissue repair. Moreover, there is considerable commonality between the skin and other soft tissue reconstruction products. This article presents an attempt to create a comprehensive global landscape review of advanced replacement materials and associated strategies for skin and soft tissue reconstruction. Recent Advances: There has been rapid growth in the number of commercial and pre-commercial products over the past decade. In this survey, 263 base products for advanced skin therapy have been identified, across 8 therapeutic categories, giving over 350 products in total. The largest market is in the United States, followed by the E.U. zone. However, despite these advances, and the investment of resources in each product development, there are key issues concerning the clinical efficacy, cost-benefit of products, and clinical impact. Each therapeutic strategy has relative merits and limitations. Critical Issues: A critical consideration in developing and evaluating products is the therapeutic modality, associated regulatory processes, and the potential for clinical adoption geographically, determined by regulatory territory, intellectual property, and commercial distribution factors. The survey identifies an opportunity for developments that improve basic efficacy or cost-benefit. Future Directions: The economic pressures on health care systems, compounded by the demands of our increasingly ageing population, and the imperative to distribute effective health care, create an urgent global need for effective and affordable products.",

The goal of this study was to determine if a low-cost portable microscope could provide sufficient performance to be used to document delivery of cell products and track retention over time. Approach: A Dino-Lite fluorescence microscope and an Odyssey CLx whole-animal scanner were compared on the basis of resolution, sensitivity, and linearity. The impact of different injection profiles on image quality was also compared and the system was used to track cells, injected freely or on scaffolds, in a model of diabetic wound healing. Results: Both systems were able to detect 50 fluorescently labeled cells and there was a linear relationship between the fluorescence signal and cell number in vitro. In vivo, both systems were found to be nonlinear, but highly correlated with one another. The Dino-Lite system was able to distinguish between depth of injection, diffuse injections, subcutaneous injections, and failed injections. Innovation: In contrast to traditional imaging systems, the technique presented here is affordable, rapid enough that it can be used to validate every injection, and can be brought to the animal, reducing handling and stress that may interfere with wound healing processes. Conclusion: Collectively, we found that the speed, affordability, and portability of handheld microscopes combined with their technical capabilities make them a valuable and accessible tool for routine validation, documentation, and tracking of cell products delivered to wounds.",

Approach: Four Yucatan pigs each received 12 4.5 cm full-thickness incisions that were closed with 1 of 4 options: Suture bridge with nylon, suture bridge with nylon and subdermal polyglactin, nylon simple interrupted, and nylon simple interrupted with subdermal polyglactin. Epithelial reaction, inflammation, and scarring were examined histologically at days 10 and 42. Wound strength was examined mechanically at days 10 and 42 on ex vivo wounds from euthanized pigs. Results: Histopathology in the suture entry/exit planes showed greater dermal inflammation with a simple interrupted nylon suture retained for 42 days compared with the SBD retained for 42 days (p < 0.03). While tensile wound strength in the device and suture groups were similar at day 10, wounds closed with the devices were nearly 8 times stronger at day 42 compared with day 10 (p < 0.001). Innovation: A novel SBD optimized for cutaneous wound closure that protects the skin surface from suture strands, forms a protective bridge over the healing wound edges, and knotlessly clamps sutures. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of a SBD increases the tolerability of nylon sutures in porcine acute skin wound closures allowing for prolonged mechanical support of the wound. For slow healing wounds, this may prevent skin wound disruption, such as edge necrosis and dehiscence.",

The Summit brought together a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that included payers, government agency policymakers, prominent researchers, wound care medical specialty societies, patient and clinical associations, wound care clinics, and manufacturers to discuss wound care evidence and coverage issues. The Summit focused on a wide variety of wound care topics, with an emphasis on the processes payers use to create their coverage policies and the type, quantity, and characteristics of clinical evidence payers require. The most valuable outcome of the Summit was the frank and open discourse among stakeholders, with unprecedented participation from payers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the subjects of trial design, product-approval pathways, and coverage policy determination. Stakeholders provided actionable ideas for ways to improve clinical trial research and design that will yield better evidence and ultimately better wound care.

    "abstract": "This response critically evaluates the study \"A Novel Randomized Trial Protocol for Evaluating Wound Healing Interventions,\" highlighting key concerns and proposing improvements. The study's departure from standard analytical principles, characterized by inadequate power and a lack of cohort comparisons, raises questions about the reliability of its conclusions. Rigorous adherence to established randomized controlled trial methodologies is crucial for valid evidence in wound healing research. Additionally, the inclusion of a run-in phase presents challenges in subject recruitment, resulting in a significant loss of eligible participants. Streamlining study designs to minimize such barriers is imperative for ensuring feasibility and achieving sufficient statistical power. The use of a laser-assisted wound measurement (LAWM) device, though validated for area measurement, overlooks wound depth, introducing potential bias. This limitation underscores the need for meticulous consideration of measurement tools to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. The study's proposed outcome protocol neglects crucial wound healing parameters like wound bed quality and tunnelling/undermining. Advocating for customized scoring systems based on wound etiology could address these oversights, enhancing the study's clinical relevance. This critical response emphasizes the importance of methodological rigor and comprehensive outcome assessments in advancing wound healing research. Addressing these concerns will contribute to a more robust evidence base, fostering improved translational outcomes in wound healing interventions. On behalf of Bull et al, Harding & Clements categorically respond to the concerns raised.",

Patients rated the ciNPT device highest on items relating to its function and appearance, and lowest on noise and interference with sleep and physical activity. The overall mean score for the combined cohort was 64.8/100. The mean score for SM patients (74.8±19.9) was significantly greater than for IBR patients (53.9±9.6, p<0.01). The mean overall patient satisfaction rating was 3.92 on a 5-point scale; 4.0 in the SM group and 3.8 in the IBR group. Innovation: This study is the first to report on the patient experience with these novel, wide-coverage ciNPT dressings. Conclusion: Overall, the dressing was well tolerated by patients, and satisfaction was high. The positive reception of ciNPT with wide coverage dressings supports continued use at our hospital.",

    "abstract": "Objective Having a wound decreases patients' quality of life and brings uncertainty, especially if the wound does not show a healing tendency. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a model to dynamically predict time to wound healing at subsequent routine wound care visits. Approach A dynamic prediction model was developed in a cohort of wounds treated by nurse practitioners between 2017-2022. Potential predictors were selected based on literature, expert opinion, and availability in the routine care setting. To assess performance for future wound care visits, the model was validated in a new cohort of wounds visited in early 2023. Reporting followed TRIPOD guidelines. Results We analyzed data from 92,098 visits, corresponding to 14,248 wounds and 7,221 patients. At external validation, discriminative performance of our developed model was comparable to internal validation (c-statistic = 0.70 [95% CI 0.69, 0.71]) and the model remained well-calibrated. Strong predictors were wound-level characteristics and indicators of the healing process so far (e.g., wound surface area). Innovation Going beyond previous prediction studies in the field, the developed model dynamically predicts the remaining time to wound healing for many wound types at subsequent wound care visits, in line with the dynamic nature of wound care. In addition, the model was externally validated and showed stable performance. Conclusion: The developed model can potentially contribute to patient satisfaction and reduce uncertainty around wound healing times when implemented in practice. When the predicted time of wound healing remains high, practitioners can consider adapting their wound management.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)/collagen/silver-ORC (OCSO) dressings have individually demonstrated effectiveness in supporting wound healing, but few studies have examined their combined use. This retrospective data analysis compared wound outcomes following outpatient NPWT with and without OCSO dressings. Approach: A search of de-identified records from the U.S. Wound Registry resulted in 485 cases of wounds managed with NPWT with OCSO dressings. A matched cohort of patients who received NPWT without any collagen dressing (n=485) was created using propensity scoring. For patients in the NPWT+OCSO group, OCSO was applied topically on or after the day of NPWT initiation and stopped on or before the day of NPWT termination. Results: Wounds managed with NPWT+OCSO were significantly more likely to improve and/or heal compared to wounds that received NPWT alone (p=0.00029). The relative wound area reduction was 40% for patients receiving NPWT+OCSO, compared to 9% for patients receiving only NPWT (p=0.0099). The median time to achieve 75-100% granulation coverage with no measurable wound depth was shorter by 8 days with NPWT+OCSO in all wound types (p=0.00034), and by 14 days in surgical wounds (p=0.0010), than with NPWT alone. Innovation: This is the first study examining the clinical outcomes associated with the integration of NPWT and OCSO dressings compared to the use of NPWT alone. These data support the novel practice of applying NPWT concurrently with OCSO dressings. Conclusion: This retrospective comparative analysis using real world data demonstrated improved healing outcomes with integrated use of NPWT with OCSO dressings versus NPWT alone.",

This edition of Advances in Wound Care includes some of the work that was presented at the 2014 ISPeW meeting in Rome. The first article by Dr. Romanelli, is an in-depth description of the progression of skin physiology throughout its maturational stages and clinical implication. A cutting edge article by Dr. Timothy King then follows, with regard to scar prevention in postnatal tissues. This is followed by a comprehensive look at debridement techniques in pediatric trauma by Dr. Ankush Gosain. Next, is a cautionary article by Dr. Luca Spazzapan that examines the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers in children and the potential for an epidemic. The last article in this series is from the keynote speaker, Dr. Amit Geffen, who eloquently examines the use of biomaterials to offload and prevent pediatric pressure ulcers.",

Approach: An 8-year retrospective review was conducted for all solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients with LE wounds necessitating surgical management at our tertiary limb salvage center. Outcomes of interest included wound healing, surgical treatment, progression to amputation, and amputation level. Factors contributing to amputation progression were analyzed. The article adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Results: Sixty-four SOT recipients underwent surgical management for their LE wounds between 2010 and 2018. Median number of surgeries per patient was 5 (interquartile range = 2-8); 47 of 64 patients (73.4%) underwent amputation, and 17 of 64 patients (26.6%) underwent nonamputation surgical management. In the amputation group, the majority of primary amputations were minor (42/47, 89.4%); 24 of 42 (57.1%) patients progressed to a higher amputation level, 16 of 42 (38.1%) healed after their index procedure, and 2 of 42 (4.8%) were lost to follow-up (LTFU) after their primary minor amputation. Five of 47 (10.6%) patients undergoing amputations required primary below-knee amputations. In the nonamputation group, 15 of 17 (88.2%) healed, 1 of 17 (5.9%) expired, and 1 of 17 (5.9%) was LTFU. Innovation: To identify the outcomes of patients undergoing surgical management for LE wounds after SOT and elucidate clinical factors that impact the rate of limb salvage. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive analysis of LE wounds in the transplant population. Our analysis indicates high rates of failed minor amputation, and frequent progression to major amputation in SOT patients. Preexisting comorbidities and immunosuppressive regimens complicate limb salvage; therefore, further research is warranted to optimize surgical LE wound management in this population.",

Approach: A PubMed search identified placental membrane allograft studies published between 2015 and 2019. Industry payments were collected using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database. Self-declared COI were compared with recorded payments. Risk factors for positive product recommendation were determined at study and author levels. Results: Eighty-nine studies (417 authors) were identified. Seventy-five studies (84%) had at least one author receive undisclosed payments. From 2015 to 2019, 5,841 general payments (totaling $15,558,026) and 1,234 research payments (totaling $18,290,062) were made by 46 companies. Travel/lodging was the most commonly reported transaction (34%). Authors were comprised mostly of podiatrists (27%), plastic surgeons (15%), and orthopedic surgeons (15%). Comparative studies were less likely to have a positive product recommendation compared to noncomparative studies (odds ratio [OR] 0.204, 95% confidence interval 0.06-0.066, p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed no association between COI discrepancy and product recommendation. Innovation: The accuracy of self-reported financial COI in placental membrane studies is evaluated for the first time. Conclusion: The majority of placental membrane product studies did not declare all industry payments. Whether these payments represent \"relevant COI\" remains unclear. In addition, not all placental product companies report to the Open Payments database, suggesting that the issue may be even more significant. This study highlights the need for improved definitions of \"relevant COI,\" a standardized reporting system across journals, and the uniform participation of all medical product vendors.",

Prepared with autologous fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and biopolymers, CSS can provide permanent wound closure upon engraftment to excised burns.CSS containing only two cell types are limited in anatomy and physiology compared with normal uninjured skin. Identifying deficiencies in CSS can instruct further tissue engineering advances.Expression profiling of CSS during in vitro maturation and after transplantation in vivo with Affymetrix GeneChip® Arrays was used to characterize pathways that are abnormal or deficient in CSS compared with normal human skin. Examination of the large data set generated from microarray expression analysis revealed similarities between healed CSS and normal skin, particularly in expression of genes involved in epidermal differentiation and barrier function. However, deficiencies in several pathways were also noted, such as the genetic pathways regulating development of adnexal structures, including hair follicles.A deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular events guiding morphogenesis of engineered skin can lead to improvements that will increase clinical efficacy.The results of GeneChip analysis highlighted the processes that act to regulate tissue development in vitro and adaptation to the wound environment and healing in vivo. This knowledge can be used to inform modifications to the model that will facilitate incorporation of additional cell types for increased homology with native human skin and improved functional outcome for burn patients treated with engineered skin grafts.",

    "abstract": "Background: Adhesions are fibrous bands of scar tissue that form between opposed organs and=or inner body wall. They can be a feature of all three serosal cavities—peritoneum, pericardia, and pleura. Many different types of injury cause adhesions to form. In particular, they are a serious problem after abdominal-pelvic surgery. Development of adhesions is a consequence of normal wound healing where fibrin-rich bridges between opposed surfaces become remodeled into fibrous strands of scar tissue. Current prevention is based on careful surgical practice and physically keeping damaged surfaces apart using gels, films, or liquids. No pharmacological approach is clinically available at present. The Problem: Adhesion-related complications such as bowel obstruction, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain result in significant morbidity and health care costs. Any treatment that prevents adhesion development must still allow normal repair at adjacent sites to occur. Basic/Clinical Science Advances: Inadequate clearance of the provisional fibrinrich matrix initiates adhesion formation after tissue damage. A number of biologically active agents have been identified that can alter the balance between fibrin matrix deposition and fibrinolysis and so may be useful in reducing adhesion formation. Clinical Care Relevance: Application of pharmacological agents aimed at regulating fibrinolysis delivered in custom-made bioresorbable materials at the time of surgery may lead to advances in clinical care. Conclusion: Adhesions form as a consequence of the repair process due to an imbalance between the deposition and clearance of the provisional fibrin-rich matrix. Manipulation of this process may improve clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining an appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for a new product is the first step in a successful reimbursement strategy. However, applying for a new HCPCS code can be a frustrating, confusing, and complex process even for those who have prepared and submitted applications many times. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) staff provide excellent instructions for the various steps of the process (such as completing the application and presenting at the public meetings), the uninitiated and even veterans can learn tips from those who have been involved in this process for many years. The planning for a new HCPCS code should take place well in advance before the submission actually takes place. The company's reimbursement staff should be involved early in the product research and development and clinical trial discussions. This article addresses the strategy and activities that companies should undertake before applying for a new HCPCS code. In addition, the article also addresses key milestones in the HCPCS coding process, such as completing the HCPCS code application, attending, and speaking at the HCPCS public meeting.",

This article provides an overview of the process for obtaining a new or revised ICD-10-Clinical Modification and/or ICD-10-Procedure Coding System code. Manufacturers, providers and researchers often forget that this process can be lengthy and must be included in product development timelines. An example of timelines required for implementation of new 2020 ICD-10 codes is provided in the article. In addition, the article provides insight into the appropriate individuals, within a manufacturing organization or consulting firm, who may be able to assist with evaluating whether pertinent ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure codes exist within the ICD-10 coding system or whether an application must be submitted for one or more new/revised ICD-10 codes.",
