    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine functional relationships between composition of air spora and meteorological factors, using multivariate statistical technique: canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Analyses were conducted for the data collected during the 4 year (2007-2010) and, in order to show the dynamics of such relationships, for each year separately. The CCA results indicated that all statistically significant variables accounted for 15.3 % of the total variance in the spore data in the 4 years. The largest amount of the total variance was explained in this period by the mean air temperature (9.2 %). The meteorological factors impacted spore composition differently in different years, when analysis was done for each year separately. The highest values of the total variance in the spore data, explained by the statistically significant variables, were found in 2010 (32.3 %), with the highest contribution of mean air temperature (23.8 %). In that year, the above-mentioned parameter had the lowest value in comparison to other years. Canonical correspondence analysis provides not only a comprehensive assessment of the impact of meteorological factors on specific spore combinations in the air, but also informative graphical presentations of the results, illustrating the correlation between the occurrence of particular spore taxa and meteorological variables.",

The goal of this study was to determine microbial contamination in these work places and estimate the influence of microclimatic parameters and total dust content on microbial contamination. In addition, research included evaluation of ergosterol concentration and fungal bioaerosol particle size distribution. Numbers of micro-organisms in the air and on the surfaces in museums were higher (2.1 × 102-7.0 × 103 cfu/m3 and 1.4 × 102-1.7 × 104 cfu/100 cm2, respectively) than in archives and libraries (3.2 × 102-7.2 × 102 cfu/m3 and 8.4 × 102-8.8 × 102 cfu/100 cm2, respectively). The numbers of micro-organisms detected in the tested museums, archives and libraries did not exceed occupational exposure limits proposed by Polish Committee for the Highest Permissible Concentrations and Intensities of Noxious Agents at the Workplace. The concentrations of respirable and suspended dust in museum storerooms were 2-4 times higher than the WHO-recommended limits. We found a correlation between microclimatic conditions and numbers of micro-organisms in the air in the tested working environments. In addition, a correlation was also found between ergosterol concentration and the number of fungi in the air. Fungi were the dominant micro-organisms in the working environments tested. Particles within the dominant fractions of culturable fungal aerosols sampled from museum storerooms had aerodynamic diameters between 1.1 and 2.1 µm.",

Although this technique has been recently standardised, it suffers from several drawbacks, notably data usually only being available with a delay of 3–9 days and usually delivered at a daily resolution. Several automatic instruments have come on to the market over the past few years, with more new devices also under development. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of all available and developing automatic instruments, how they measure, how they identify airborne pollen, what impacts measurement quality, as well as what potential there is for further advancement in the field of bioaerosol monitoring.",

Knowledge of the main pollen season can improve diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. Our objective in this study is to provide clear, quantitative visualizations of pollen data and make information accessible to many disciplines, in particular to allergy sufferers and those in the health field. We use data from 31 National Allergy Bureau (NAB) pollen stations in the continental USA and Canada from 2003 to 2017 to produce pollen calendars. We present pollen season metrics relevant to health and describe main pollen season start and end dates, durations, and annual pollen integrals for specific pollen taxa. In most locations, a small number of taxa constitute the bulk of the total pollen concentration. Start dates for tree and grass pollen season depend strongly on latitude, with earlier start dates at lower latitudes. Season duration is correlated with the start dates, such that locations with earlier start dates have a longer season. NAB pollen data have limited spatiotemporal coverage. Increased spatiotemporal monitoring will improve analysis and understanding of factors that govern airborne pollen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have focused on occupational and indoor environments because people spend more than 90% of their time in them. Nevertheless, air is the main source of bacteria in indoors, and outdoor exposure is also crucial. Worldwide studies have indicated that bacterial concentrations vary among different types of outdoor environments, with considerable seasonal variations as well. Conducting comprehensive monitoring of atmospheric aerosol concentrations is very important not only for environmental management but also for the assessment of the health impacts of air pollution. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present outdoor and seasonal changes of bioaerosol data regarding an urban area of Poland. This study aimed to characterize culturable bacteria populations present in outdoor air in Gliwice, Upper Silesia Region, Poland, over the course of four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) through quantification and identification procedures. In this study, the samples of bioaerosol were collected using a six-stage Andersen cascade impactor (with aerodynamic cut-off diameters of 7.0, 4.7, 3.3, 2.1, 1.1 and 0.65 μm). Results showed that the concentration of airborne bacteria ranged from 4 CFU m-3, measured on one winter day, to a maximum equal to 669 CFU m-3 on a spring day. The average size of culturable bacterial aerosol over the study period was 199 CFU m-3. The maximal seasonally averaged concentration was found in the spring season and reached 306 CFU m-3, and the minimal seasonally averaged concentration was found in the winter 49 CFU m-3. The most prevalent bacteria found outdoors were gram-positive rods that form endospores. Statistically, the most important meteorological factors related to the viability of airborne bacteria were temperature and UV radiation. These results may contribute to the promotion and implementation of preventative public health programmes and the formulation of recommendations aimed at providing healthier outdoor environments.",

The paper presents the results of detailed studies of the composition and source of the \"yellow rain\" in 2013, and as a comparison, the Pinaceae pollen concentrations and samples collected from the ground surface in 2014 were considered. The air samples were collected using the volumetric method (Hirst-type device), while pollen grains sampled from the ground surface were processed using a modified Erdtman acetolysis method. Finally, all samples were studied using a light microscope. In 2013, the period of higher Abies, Picea and Pinus pollen concentrations was observed from the 5 to 12 of May, earlier than the main pollen season occurred. The presence of rainfall on the 12 and 13 of May 2013 caused the pollen deposition on the ground surface, where the prevalence of Pinaceae pollen was found. The synoptic situation and the analysis of the back-trajectories and air mass advection at the beginning of May 2013 indicated that Pinaceae pollen grains could have been transported from Ukraine, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. In contrast, Pinaceae pollen grains deposited on the ground surface as a \"yellow\" film in May 2014, originated from local sources.",

    "abstract": "Primary biological aerosols are transported over large distances, are traveling in various media such as dry air masses, clouds or fog, and eventually deposited with dry deposition, especially for larger particles, or precipitation like rain, hail or snow. To investigate relative abundance and diversity of airborne bacterial and fungal communities, samples have been collected with a liquid impinger (Coriolis µ) from the top of Mount Sonnblick (3106 m asl, Austrian Alps) from the respective sources under a temporal aspect over four seasons over the year to include all climatic conditions. Bacterial and fungal samples (16S rRNA and ITS) were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing, investigated for relative abundance by qPCR(16S rRNA and 18S rRNA) and ice nucleation activity. Results show that there is no stable free tropospheric air microbial community and air mass origin was different for the four sampling periods which exerted influence on the microbial composition of the atmosphere although a core microbiome could be identified consisting of 61 bacterial OTUs and eight fungal genera. Differentiation between seasons was stronger pronounced in air than in precipitation, with rain being most different and variable of precipitation types, indicating distinct forces driving microbial fate in the air. Microorganisms precipitated with snow, hail or rain or being transported by clouds differ in their species composition from free tropospheric air masses and do not mirror the air community structure. They were more diverse, distinct in composition, 16S:18S ratio and abundance from free-floating PBA. Hence, snow or cloud samples are not suitable proxies for free tropospheric air microbiome composition, since separation processes in aerosolization, transport and scavenging occur. The microbial composition of arriving precipitation or clouds represents only a part of the microbial air composition communities of the cumulative sources of origin. Relative abundance and composition of ice nucleation-active bacteria showed a higher share of relative % reads of known ice nucleation-active bacteria present in all wet phases compared to air. Results propose a separation of IN-active reads with higher shares occurring in precipitation. This study presents the first comparison of free tropospheric bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity in time series of air over several seasons in contrast to various precipitation forms in the free troposphere.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated and compared the microbial communities adhering to the obverse and the reverse sides of an oil painting on canvas exhibiting signs of biodeterioration. Samples showing no visible damage were investigated as controls. Air samples were also analysed, in order to investigate the presence of airborne microorganisms suspended in the indoor atmosphere. The diversity of the cultivable microorganisms adhering to the surface was analysed by molecular techniques, such as RAPD analysis and gene sequencing. DGGE fingerprints derived from DNA directly extracted from canvas material in combination with clone libraries and sequencing were used to evaluate the non-cultivable fraction of the microbial communities associated with the material. By using culture-dependent methods, most of the bacterial strains were found to be common airborne, spore-forming microorganisms and belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, whereas culture-independent techniques identified sequenced clones affiliated with members of the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The diversity of fungi was shown to be much lower than that observed for bacteria, and only species of Penicillium spp. could be detected by cultivation techniques. The selected strategy revealed a higher microbial diversity on the obverse than on the reverse side of the painting and the near absence of actively growing microorganisms on areas showing no visible damage. Furthermore, enzymatic activity tests revealed that the most widespread activities involved in biodeterioration were esterase and esterase lipase among the isolated bacterial strains, and esterase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase among fungi strains.",

The goal of the present study is to provide a baseline for spatial and temporal variations in airborne Ambrosia pollen in Europe that can be used for the management and evaluation of this noxious plant. The study covers the full range of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. distribution over Europe (39°N-60°N; 2°W-45°E). Airborne Ambrosia pollen data for the principal flowering period of Ambrosia (August-September) recorded during a 10-year period (2004-2013) were obtained from 242 monitoring sites. The mean sum of daily average airborne Ambrosia pollen and the number of days that Ambrosia pollen was recorded in the air were analysed. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated regardless of the number of years included in the study period, while trends are based on those time series with 8 or more years of data. Trends were considered significant at p < 0.05. There were few significant trends in the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric Ambrosia pollen (only 8% for the mean sum of daily average Ambrosia pollen concentrations and 14% for the mean number of days Ambrosia pollen were recorded in the air). The direction of any trends varied locally and reflected changes in sources of the pollen, either in size or in distance from the monitoring station. Pollen monitoring is important for providing an early warning of the expansion of this invasive and noxious plant.",

    "abstract": "This discussion paper reveals the contribution of pollen transport conditions to the inter-annual variability of the seasonal pollen index (SPI). This contribution is quantified as a sensitivity of the pollen model predictions to meteorological variability and is shown to be a noticeable addition to the SPI variability caused by plant reproduction cycles. A specially designed SILAM model re-analysis of pollen seasons 1980-2014 was performed, resulting in the 35 years of the SPI predictions over Europe, which was used to compute the SPI inter-annual variability. The current paper presents the results for birch and grass. Throughout the re-analysis, the source term formulations and habitation maps were kept constant, which allowed attributing the obtained variability exclusively to the pollen release and transport conditions during the flowering seasons. It is shown that the effect is substantial: it amounts to 10-20% (grass) and 20-40% (birch) of the observed SPI year-to-year changes reported in the literature. The phenomenon has well-pronounced spatial- and species-specific patterns. The findings were compared with observation-based statistical models for the SPI prediction, showing that such models highlight the same processes as the analysis with the SILAM model.",

    "abstract": "Air sampling was conducted in Szczecin (Poland) throughout April–September 2013. The final data set included 177 daily and 4248 hourly samples. The total of 21 types of spores, which occurred in a number >10 in the season, were taken into account. The following meteorological parameters were analyzed: air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Effects of individual weather parameters on hourly and daily concentrations of different fungal spore types were examined using Spearman's rank association test, whereas effects of complex of meteorological factors on hourly and daily compositions of spore were assessed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Airborne fungal spore distribution patterns in relation to meteorological variables were determined by RDA, after DCA results detected a linear structure of the spore data. The RDA results obtained indicated that all the applied variables accounted for 20 and 22% of the total variance in the hourly and daily spore data, respectively. The results of stepwise forward selection of variables revealed all included hourly and daily meteorological variables were statistically significant. The largest amount of the total variance in the spore composition was explained by the air temperature in both cases (16%). Multivariate ordination did not show large differences between the hourly and daily relationships (with exception of wind speed impact), while the differences between simple hourly and daily correlations were more clear. Correlations between daily values of variables were in most cases higher than between hourly values of variables.",

    "abstract": "Assimilation of pollen observations for increasing accuracy of the deterministic model forecast and reanalysis faces several roadblocks. The most-evident problem today is the long delay of the data because of the manual character of the observations. Automatic monitors are about to eliminate this issue but more are on the way. This paper shows that the classical assimilation of the model state, i.e. pollen concentrations, has very little effect on the forecasts. Due to short relaxation time of the system, the updates generated by the assimilation are forgotten within a few hours. In a search of approaches with a longer-lasting impact, a numerical experiment is conducted assimilating the total seasonal pollen emission, which controls the overall season severity. It turned out to be a prominent example of parameters affecting the model predictions over the long period—in the retrospective simulations. It remains to be demonstrated that this parameter can substantially benefit from assimilation of the near-real-time data that are becoming available from the automatic pollen monitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Operational pollen monitoring networks have developed across Europe, and the world more generally, in response to the increasing prevalence of pollen allergy and asthma. Routine pollen observations are in large part currently still based on time-intensive manual techniques developed in the 1950s. These methods suffer from low temporal resolution and long delays in data availability. Recent technological developments are revolutionising the field making real-time high-temporal resolution measurements possible. This paper describes the rationale behind the EUMETNET AutoPollen programme, which aims to develop a prototype automatic pollen monitoring network across Europe. We provide a brief description of the current state-of-the-art, then an overview of new technologies, and finally the main tasks of the AutoPollen programme.",

    "abstract": "Real-time bioaerosol monitoring is improving the quality of life for people affected by allergies, but it often relies on deep learning models which pose challenges for widespread adoption. These models are typically trained in a supervised fashion and require considerable effort to produce large amounts of annotated data, an effort that must be repeated for new particles, geographical regions, or measurement systems. In this work, we show that self-supervised learning and few-shot learning can be combined to classify holographic images of pollen grains using a large collection of unlabelled data and only a few identified particles per type. We first demonstrate that self-supervision on pictures of unidentified particles from ambient air measurements enhances identification even when labelled data are abundant. Most importantly, it greatly improves few-shot classification when only a handful of labelled images are available. Our findings suggest that real-time bioaerosol monitoring workflows can be substantially optimized, and the effort required to adapt models for different situations considerably reduced.

    "abstract": "Being major ornamental street trees, species of Platanus are widely planted in the Shanghai urban area. A great deal of allergenic Platanus pollen is released from the trees and suspended in the atmosphere during its flowering season, ultimately causing allergic respiratory diseases. Few papers have focused on the distribution of this type of pollen and its expression of allergenic proteins. In order to investigate any differences in protein expression in Platanus pollen following exposure to gaseous and particulate pollutants, a special apparatus was designed. Exposure condition (such as temperature, humidity, and exposure time) of Platanus pollen and gaseous pollutants can be simulated using of this apparatus. Fresh Platanus orientalis pollen, pollutant gases (NO2, SO2, NH3), and typical urban ambient particles (vehicle exhaust particles, VEPs) were mixed in this device to examine possible changes that might occur in ambient airborne urban pollen following exposure to such pollutants. Our results showed that the fresh P. orientalis pollen became swollen, and new kinds of particles could be found on the surface of the pollen grains after exposure to the pollutants. The results of SDS-PAGE showed that five protein bands with molecular weights of 17-19, 34, 61, 82, and 144 kDa, respectively, were detected and gray scale of these brands increased after the pollen exposure to gaseous pollutants. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that a Platanus pollen allergenic protein (Pla a1, with a molecular weight of 18 kDa) increased in abundance following exposure to pollutant gases and VEPs, implying that air pollutants may exacerbate the allergenicity of pollen.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to elevated air pollution levels can aggravate pollen allergy symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between airborne birch (Betula) pollen, urban air pollutants NO2, O3 and PM10 and their effects on antihistamine demand in Gothenburg and Malmö, Sweden, 2006-2012. Further, the influence of large-scale weather pattern on pollen-/pollution-related risk, using Lamb weather types (LWTs), was analysed. Daily LWTs were obtained by comparing the atmospheric pressure over a 16-point grid system over southern Sweden (scale ~3000 km). They include two non-directional types, cyclonic (C) and anticyclonic (A) and eight directional types depending on the wind direction (N, NE, E…). Birch pollen levels were exceptionally high under LWTs E and SE in both cities. Furthermore, LWTs with dry and moderately calm meteorological character (A, NE, E, SE) were associated with strongly elevated air pollution (NO2 and PM10) in Gothenburg. For most weather situations in both cities, simultaneously high birch pollen together with high air pollution had larger over-the-counter (OTC) sales of antihistamines than situations with high birch pollen alone. LWTs NE, E, SE and S had the highest OTC sales in both cities. In Gothenburg, the city with a higher load of both birch pollen and air pollution, the higher OTC sales were especially obvious and indicate an increased effect on allergic symptoms from air pollution. Furthermore, Gothenburg LWTs A, NE, E and SE were associated with high pollen and air pollution levels and thus classified as high-risk weather types. In Malmö, corresponding high-risk LWTs were NE, E, SE and S. Furthermore, occurrence of high pollen and air pollutants as well as OTC sales correlated strongly with vapour pressure deficit and temperature in Gothenburg (much less so in Malmö). This provides evidence that the combination of meteorological properties associated with LWTs can explain high levels of birch pollen and air pollution. Our study shows that LWTs represent a useful tool for integrated daily air quality forecasting/warning.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are almost no studies concerning bioaerosol and particulate matter levels in animal enclosures of zoos. Numerous air contamination sources can be found there, and zoos are both working environments and popular tourist objects. The aim of this study was to assess bacterial aerosol levels in premises for animals (giraffes, monkeys, pheasants and ostriches) of the Kraków Zoo. Bioaerosol samples were collected using six-stage Andersen impactor to assess the concentration and size distribution of airborne mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci. Particulate matter levels (PM10, PM4, PM2.5 and PM1) were assessed using DustTrak Aerosol Monitor. The results showed that the concentration of airborne bacteria varied significantly between enclosures for the analyzed animal groups and various groups of bacteria reached their maximum concentrations in premises for different animals. The mean share of respirable fraction of bacteria was quite high—68%, with values ranging from 12.8% for Gram-negative bacteria to 98% for mannitol-positive staphylococci, indicating potential harmfulness to the health of exposed people. Dust concentrations remained at similar, relatively low levels (maximum of 0.105 mg/m3 for PM10 in rooms for giraffes). This study showed that neither bacterial bioaerosol levels, nor dust concentrations exceed the permissible values provided by Polish guidelines, but comparing the values with other countries' limits suggests that the air could be considered as contaminated. The animals are a significant source of bioaerosol; therefore, attention should be paid to thorough cleaning of animals themselves and their premises and to maintaining appropriate levels of microclimatic parameters prevailing in the rooms.",

The provision of real-time information at high temporal resolution opens the door to a wide range of improvements in terms of the products and services made available to a widening range of end-users and stakeholders. As technology and methods mature, it is essential to properly quantify the impact automatic monitoring has on the different end-user domains to better understand the real long-term benefits to society. In this paper, we focus the main domains where such impacts are expected, using Europe as a basis to provide qualitative estimates and to describe research needs to better quantify impacts in future. This will, in part, also serve to justify further investment and help to expand monitoring networks.",

    "abstract": "Air filters efficiency is usually determined by non-biological test aerosols, such as potassium chloride particles, Arizona dust or di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate (DEHS) oily liquid. This research was undertaken to asses, if application of non-biological aerosols reflects air filters capacity to collect particles of biological origin. The collection efficiency for non-biological aerosol was tested with the PALAS set and ISO Fine Test Dust. Flow rate during the filtration process was 720 l/h, and particles size ranged 0.246-17.165 μm. The upstream and downstream concentration of the aerosol was measured with a laser particle counter PCS-2010. Tested bioaerosol contained 4 bacterial strains of different shape and size: Micrococcus luteus,Micrococcus varians, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis. Number of the biological particles was estimated with a culture-based method. Results obtained with bioaerosol did not confirmed 100% filters efficiency noted for the mineral test dust of the same aerodynamic diameter. Maximum efficiency tested with bacterial cells was 99.8%. Additionally, cells reemission from filters into air was also studied. Bioaerosol contained 3 bacterial strains: Micrococcus varians, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis. It was proved that the highest intensity of the reemission process was during the first 5 min. and reached maximum 0.63% of total number of bacteria retained in filters. Spherical cells adhered stronger to the filter fibres than cylindrical ones. It was concluded that non-biological aerosol containing particles of the same shape and surface characteristics (like DEHS spherical particles) can not give representative results for all particles present in the filtered air.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is the environmental factor that systematically changes for decades and, as in plants and animals, can significantly affect the growth and development of fungi, including the abundance of their sporulation. During the time of study (2010-2012), a rapid increase in air temperature was observed in Poland, which coincided with the substantial decrease in rainfall. The increase in annual mean temperatures at three monitoring sites of this study was 0.9 °C in Lublin and Rzeszow (east Poland) and 2.0 °C in Poznan (west Poland). Such warming of air masses was comparable to the average global air temperature rise in the period of 1880-2012 accounting for 0.85 °C, as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Moreover, there was a substantial decrease in rainfall, ranging from 32.7 % (Poznan) to 43.0 % (Rzeszow). We have demonstrated that under such conditions the mean and median values of total Cladosporium spore counts significantly increased and the spore seasons were greatly accelerated. Moreover, earlier start and later end of the season caused its extension, lasting from over 20 days in Rzeszow to around 60 days in Lublin and Poznan, when the cumulative amount of 5-95 % of spores was considered. The time of reaching the cumulative amount of 50 % of spores was up to 25 days earlier (difference in Poznan between 2010 and 2012). There was also a striking acceleration of the date of the maximal Cladosporium spore concentration per cubic metre of air (26 days for Lublin, 43 for Poznan and 56 for Rzeszow).",

    "abstract": "In this study, the morphology and chemical composition of pollen grains of six birch species (Betula utilis Doorenbos, B. dahurica, B. maximowicziana, B. pendula, B. pubescens and B. humilis) were examined to verify which of these features allow distinguishing them in a more unambiguous way. For this purpose, scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and curve-fitting analysis of amide I profile, were performed. The microscopy images show that the pollen grains of B. pubescens, B. pendula and B. humilis are similar in diameter and significantly smaller than those of others species, with the largest diameter observed for B. utilis Doorenbos. However, the results obtained from FTIR spectroscopy indicate that the chemical compositions of B. pubescens and B. pendula are similar, but B. humilis is outlaying. Summarizing, it is not possible to unambiguously state, which feature or which technique is the best for differentiating between the six chosen birch species. However, the study showed that both techniques have potential for identification of birch pollen species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ragweed pollen is a prevalent allergen in late summer and autumn, worsening seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms. In the atmosphere, pollen can osmotically rupture to produce sub-pollen particles (SPP). Because of their smaller size, SPP can penetrate deeper into the respiratory tract than intact pollen grains and may trigger severe cases of asthma. Here we characterize airborne SPP forming from rupturing giant ragweed ( Ambrosia trifida ) pollen for the first time, using scanning electron microscopy and single-particle fluorescence spectroscopy. SPP ranged in diameter from 20 nm to 6.5 μm. Most SPP are capable of penetrating into the lower respiratory tract, with 82% of SPP &lt; 1.0 μm, and are potential cloud condensation nuclei, with 50% of SPP &lt; 0.20 μm. To support predictions of the health and environmental effects of SPP, we have developed a quantitative method to estimate the number of SPP generated per pollen grain ( $${n}_{\\mathrm{f}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mi>f</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ) based upon the principle of mass conservation. We estimate that one giant ragweed pollen grain generates 1400 SPP across the observed size range. The new measurements and method presented herein support more accurate predictions of SPP occurrence, concentration, and air quality impacts that can help to reduce the health burden of allergic airway diseases.

    "abstract": "Abstract Technologies for monitoring pollen concentrations in real-time made substantial advances in the past years and become increasingly available. This opens the possibility to calibrate numerical pollen forecast models in real-time and make a significant step forward regarding the quality of pollen forecasts. We present a method to use real-time pollen measurements in numerical pollen forecast models. The main idea is to calibrate model parameterizations and not to assimilate measurements in a nudging sense. This ensures that the positive effect persists throughout the forecast period and does not vanish after a few forecast hours. We propose to adapt in real-time both the model phenology scheme and the overall tuning factor that are present in any numerical pollen forecast model. To test this approach, we used the numerical pollen forecast model COSMO-ART (COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) on a mesh size of 1.1 km covering the greater Alpine domain. Test runs covered two pollen seasons and included Corylus , Alnus , Betula and Poaceae pollen. Comparison with daily measurements from 13 Swiss pollen stations revealed that the model improvements are large, but fine-tuning of the method remains a challenge. We conclude that the presented approach is a first valuable step towards comprehensive real-time calibration of numerical pollen forecast models.",

    "abstract": "The investigation into airborne fungal spore concentrations was conducted in Szczecin (Poland) between 2004 and 2009. The objective of the studies was to determine a seasonal variation in concentrations of amerospores on the basis of meteorological parameters. The presence of spores in Szczecin was recorded using a volumetric method. Fungal spores were present in the air in high numbers in late summer and early autumn. The highest concentrations were noted in September, October and November. The peak period was recorded in August, September, October and November. The highest annual number of spores occurred in 2005 and 2007 and the lowest in 2006. High values of daily concentration of amerospores occurred during the afternoon and late at night. In 2005 and 2007 the late-night maximum was overdue about 1 or 2 h. For daily values of dew point temperature and relative humidity, the coefficients were positive, significant for p = 0.001 and ranged from 0.342 to 0.258. The average wind speed was positively correlated for p = 0.01 and the coefficient was 0.291. The similar relations were noted for hourly values of spore concentrations for p = 0.05, p = 0.01 and p = 0.001. For these spore types, the dew point temperature and relative humidity appeared to be the most influential factor.",

Pollen monitoring was conducted using a Lanzoni VPPS 2000 sampler. The atmospheric pollen seasons were determined with the 98% method. Regression analysis was used to determine correlations between meteorological conditions and the pattern of the birch pollen season. On average, the birch pollen season started on 12 April, ended on 13 May, and lasted 32 days. The peak value and the Seasonal Pollen Index showed the greatest variation in particular years. All the seasons were right-skewed. During the study years, a trend was found towards earlier occurrence of the seasonal peak. Regression equations were developed for the following parameters of the atmospheric pollen season: start, duration, peak value and average pollen concentration during the season. The obtained model fit was at a level of 64-81%. Statistical analysis shows that minimum temperature of February and March and total rainfall in June in the year preceding pollen release have the greatest effect on the birch atmospheric pollen season in Lublin. Low temperatures in February promote the occurrence of high pollen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa are closely related sibling fungal pathogens that cause phoma leaf spotting, stem canker (blackleg) and stem necrosis of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The disease is distributed worldwide, and it is one of the main causes of considerable decrease in seed yield and quality. Information about the time of ascospore release at a particular location provides important data for decision making in plant protection, thereby enabling fungicides to be used only when necessary and at optimal times and doses. Although the pathogens have been studied very extensively, the effect of climate change on the frequencies and distributions of their aerially dispersed primary inoculum has not been reported to date. We have collected a large dataset of spore counts from Poznan, located in central-west part of Poland, and studied the relationships between climate and the daily concentrations of airborne propagules over a period of 17 years (1998–2014). The average air temperature and precipitation for the time of development of pseudothecia and ascospore release (July–November), increased during the years under study at the rates of 0.1 °C and 6.3 mm per year. The day of the year (DOY) for the first detection of spores, as well as the date with maximum of spores, shifted from 270 to 248 DOY, and from 315 to 265 DOY, respectively. The acceleration of the former parameter by 22 days and the latter by 50 days has great influence on the severity of stem canker of oilseed rape.",

    "abstract": "Alternaria and Cladosporium spores belong to the most frequent and allergenic particles in bioaerosol in the temperate climate. The investigation of Alternaria and Cladosporium spore concentrations was performed in two cities in Poland, Szczecin and Cracow, in 2004-2013. The meteorological parameters taken to assess their impact on fungal spores were average, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and average wind velocity. In order to reveal whether changes in dynamics of spore seasons are driven by meteorological conditions, ordination methods were applied. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to explore redundancy among the predictors (meteorological parameters). Prior to ordination analyses, the data were log(x)-transformed. Concentrations of Alternaria and Cladosporium spores were significantly higher in Szczecin comparing to Cracow, but it was also observed the decreasing trend in the spore concentrations in Szczecin. As regards temperature, it was higher in Cracow and was still increasing in the studied years. Relative humidity and wind velocity were significantly lower in Cracow. In Szczecin meteorological conditions did not explain changes in spore season characteristics (insignificant redundancy analysis models), while in Cracow's redundancy analysis models indicated that spore season parameters were in over 40 % determined by meteorological conditions, mainly air temperature and wind velocity. If they increase, the peak value, total number of spores and their average concentrations in a season will also increase.",

Important secondary effects of climate change include those on water resource availability, agricultural yields, urban healthy living, biodiversity, ecosystems, food security, and public health. The aim of this explorative study was to determine the range of expected airborne pathogen concentrations during a single outbreak or release in a future climate compared to a historical climatic period (1981-2010). We used five climate scenarios for the periods 2016-2045 and 2036-2065 defined by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and two conversion tools to create hourly future meteorological data sets. We modelled season-averaged airborne pathogen concentrations by means of an atmospheric dispersion model and compared these data to historical (1981-2010) modelled concentrations. Our results showed that modelled concentrations were modified several percentage points",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urban green spaces, especially urban parks, are essential for the proper functioning of cities, but they can be a serious source of airborne fungal spores. Aerobiological monitoring was carried out in urban parks of different typology to estimate the risk associated with fungal spores for citizens. Volumetric method was applied with the use of portable Burkard Sampler. In the air of the studied parks, the most dominant spores are strong allergenic or considered as potentially allergenic. Cladosporium spores were found in enormous concentrations in all studied parks, and it affected the low biodiversity of fungal spores in the parks. Compared to Cladosporium , concentrations of Alternaria spores in the air were several dozen times lower, but still a risk for people who are allergic. The fungal spores spectra and their seasonal occurrence in each park were similar. The highest similarities in the patterns of the season were found in the case of Cladosporium, Alternaria , Epicoccum , and the lowest in the case of Torula and Drechslera type. Due to the fact that allergy sufferers are most often polysensitized, the period when they should limit long visits in the urban parks is July–August, when the concentration of allergenic fungal spores of many taxa is the highest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pollen allergies are responsible for a considerable global public health burden, and understanding exposure is critical to addressing the health impacts. Atmospheric pollen counts are routinely used as a predictor of risk; however, immune responses are triggered by specific proteins known as allergens, which occur both within and on the surface of the pollen grain. The ratio between atmospheric pollen counts and allergen concentrations (‘pollen potency’) has been shown to be inconsistent, with potentially important implications for pollen monitoring practice. Despite this, there has been no previous synthesis of the literature and our understanding of the factors that influence pollen potency remains poor. We conducted a scoping review with the aim of deriving a current understanding of: (a) the factors that influence pollen potency; (b) its variation through time, between taxa and by location; and (c) the implications for pollen monitoring practice. Our synthesis found that pollen potency is highly variable within and between seasons, and between locations; however, much of this variability remains unexplained and has not been deeply investigated. We found no predictable pollen potency patterns relating to taxon, geography or time, and inconclusive evidence regarding possible driving factors. With respect to human health, the studies in our synthesis generally reported larger associations between atmospheric allergen loads and allergy symptoms than whole pollen counts. This suggests that pollen potency influences public health risk; however, the evidence base remains limited. Further research is needed to better understand both pollen potency variability and its implications for health.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria are widely distributed in many environments and represent the most important trigger to the occupant respiratory health. Health complaints, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis of the workers, were recorded in a mushroom compost facility (MCF). The studies on the airborne bacteria were carried out to find a possible microbiological source of these symptoms. Culture analysis of compost bioaerosols collected in different location of the MCF was performed. An assessment of the indoor microbial exposure revealed bacterial flora of bioaerosol in the mushroom compost facility represented by Bacillus, Geobacillus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus spp., and actinobacterial strain with white aerial mycelium. The thermotolerant actinobacterial strain of the same morphology was repeatedly isolated from many locations in MCF: air, compost sample, and solid surface in production hall. On the base of complex morphological, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic characteristics, the isolate has been classified as Nocardiopsis alba. Dominant position of N. alba in microbial environment of the mushroom compost facility may represent an indicator microorganism in compost bioaerosol. The bioavailability of N. alba in mushroom compost facility creates potential risk for the health of workers, and the protection of respiratory tract and/or skin is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "The ambient atmosphere is dominated with pollen and spores, which trigger allergic reactions and diseases and impact negatively on human health. A survey of pollen and fungal spores constituents of the atmosphere of Garki, Abuja (North-Central Nigeria) was carried out for 1 year (June 1, 2011–May 31, 2012). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and abundance of pollen and fungal spores in the atmosphere and their relationship with meteorological parameters. Airborne samples were trapped using modified Tauber-like pollen trap, and the recipient solutions were subjected to acetolysis. Results revealed the abundance of fungal spores, pollen, fern spores, algal cysts and diatoms in decreasing order of dominance. The atmosphere was qualitatively and quantitatively dominated by pollen during the period of late rainy/harmattan season than the rainy season. Numerous fungal spores were trapped throughout the sampling periods among which Alternaria spp., Fusarium spp., Cladosporium spp. and Curvularia spp. dominated. These fungi have been implicated in allergic diseases and are dermatophytic, causing diverse skin diseases. Other pathogenic fungi found in the studied aeroflora were Dreschlera spp., Helminthosporium spp., Torula spp., Pithomyces spp., Tetraploa spp., Nigrospora ssp., Spadicoides spp., Puccinia spp. and Erysiphe graminis. Total pollen and fungal spores counts do not show significant correlation with meteorological parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioaerosols, including bacteria and fungi, are ubiquitous and have been shown to impact various organisms as well as biogeochemical cycles and human health. However, sample collection poses a challenge for aeromicrobiologists and can determine the success of a study. Establishing a standard collection procedure for bioaerosol sampling could help advance the field. We tested the efficiency (number of organisms collected and DNA yield per unit time) of three sampling devices: a membrane filtration device, a liquid impinger, and a portable electrostatic precipitator bioaerosol collector. We compared the efficiency of these three devices for both culture-dependent studies, by enumerating colony forming units (CFUs), and culture-independent studies, by extracting and quantifying total DNA. Our results show that the electrostatic precipitator collected microorganisms significantly more efficiently than the membrane filtration and liquid impingement in both types of studies over the same time interval. This is due to the high flow rate of the device. This work is important and timely because aeromicrobiology is currently restricted by long sampling times and risk of evaporation, desiccation, or freezing during sample, which increases with sampling times. Fieldwork convenience and portability of instruments are an additional challenge for sampling. Using a sampler that can overcome these technical hurdles can accelerate the advancement of the field, and the use of a lightweight, battery-powered, inexpensive, and portable bioaerosol collection device could address these limitations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Airborne particles, bacteria and fungi consist main determinants of indoor air quality. In this study, these characteristics were investigated in two exhibition halls of the Historical Museum of Crete, in comparison with the outdoor environment. In Zacharias Portalakis (ZP) hall, three air purifiers were operating during museum opening hours, as opposed to El Greco (EG) hall. A significant part of ultrafine (&lt; 1 μm) particles was efficiently removed by the air purifiers in ZP hall. Airborne coarse particles PN 2.5–10 were associated with human occupancy in both halls, indicating transportation from visitors and resuspension as possible sources. Average airborne bacterial concentration was also lower in ZP than in EG hall, assessed by both molecular and culture-dependent methods. The bacterial and fungal communities of both indoor halls were distinct from the outdoor counterpart. Micrococcus and Staphylococcus , in terms of bacteria, and Alternaria and Malassezia , in terms of fungi, were the most abundant genera indoors, most of them being human-related. Hierarchical clustering of indoor samples indicated that EG hall bacteria were similar to ZP hall bacteria collected on the same day, but varied between different sampling dates. This observation, together with the bacterial beta-diversity analysis, implied that both indoor halls probably shared common bacterial source(s), while the respective fungal pattern of the two indoor halls was found significantly separated. The outdoor air contribution in EG and ZP hall bacterial profile presented a comparable fluctuation pattern; this was not observed for fungi, probably indicating the complexity of potential sources for different fungal taxa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During an international campaign organized in Munich (Germany) in 2021 to test the performance of automatic pollen traps, we ran four manual Hirst-type pollen traps in parallel. All 4 Hirst-type pollen traps were set and monitored on a weekly basis for the entire campaign to 10 L/min using the same standard hand-held rotameter. Afterwards, a hand-held heat-wire anemometer (easyFlux®) was used additionally to obtain the correct flow without internal resistance. Uncorrected pollen concentrations were 26.5% (hourly data) and 21.0% (daily data) higher than those obtained after correction with the easyFlux®. After mathematical flow correction, the average coefficient of variation between the four Hirst traps was 42.6% and 16.5% (hourly and daily averages, respectively) for birch and 36.8% and 16.8% (hourly and daily averages, respectively) for grasses. When using the correct flow of each pollen trap (i.e. the resistance free anemometer measured flow), for hourly values, the median standard deviation across the traps for the eight pollen types was reduced by 28.2% ( p &lt; 0.001) compared to the uncorrected data. For daily values, a significant decrease in the median standard deviation (21.6%) between traps was observed for 7 out of 8 of the pollen types, ( p &lt; 0.05 or lower). We therefore recommend continuing to calibrate Hirst-type pollen traps with standard hand-held rotameters to avoid changing the impacting characteristics of the instruments, but simultaneously also measure with resistance-free flow meters to be able to apply flow corrections to the final pollen concentrations reported. This method improved the accuracy of the final results.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of 15 taxa pollen seasons in Kraków, in 1991-2008 was monitored using a Burkard volumetric spore trap of the Hirst design. The highest daily pollen concentrations were achieved in the first half of May, and they were caused mainly by Betula and Pinus pollen. The second period of the high concentrations took place from the middle of July to the end of August (mainly Urtica pollen). Tree pollen seasons were shorter (18-24 days) in comparison with the most herbaceous pollen seasons (73-89 days), except at Artemisia and Ambrosia seasons (30 and 24 days, respectively). The season phases (percentyles) of the spring and late-summer taxa were the most variable in the consecutive years. The highest annual sums were noted for Urtica, Poaceae (herbaceous pollen seasons) and for Betula, Pinus, Alnus (tree pollen seasons), and the highest variability of annual totals was stated for Urtica, Populus, Fraxinus and the lowest for Ambrosia, Corylus, Poaceae. For the plants that pollinate in the middle of the pollen season (Quercus, Pinus and Rumex), the date of the season start seems not to be related to the season end, while for late pollen seasons, especially for Ambrosia and Artemisia, the statistically negative correlation between the start and the end season dates was found. Additionally, for the most studied taxa, the increase in annual pollen totals was observed. The presented results could be useful for the allergological practice and general botanical knowledge.",

The study was performed using the volumetric method (Lanzoni/Burkard trap). The 98/95 % method was used to calculate the pollen season. The Spearman's correlation test was applied to find the relationship between the meteorological parameters and pollen season characteristics. To construct the predictive model, the backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was used including the multi-collinearity of variables. The predictive models best fitted the pollen season start and end, especially models containing two independent variables. The peak concentration value was predicted with the higher prediction error. Also the accuracy of the models predicting the pollen season characteristics in 2009 was higher in comparison with 2010. Both, the multi-variable model and one-variable model for the beginning of the pollen season included air temperature during the last 10 days of February, while the multi-variable model also included humidity at the beginning of April. The models forecasting the end of the pollen season were based on temperature in March–April, while the peak day was predicted using the temperature during the last 10 days of March.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and Staphylococcus aureus are important swine pathogens capable of being transmitted via aerosols. The electrostatic particle ionization system (EPI) consists of a conductive line that emits negative ions that charge particles electrically resulting in the settling of airborne particles onto surfaces and potentially decreasing the risk of pathogen dissemination. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of the EPI system on the quantity and viability of IAV, PRRSV, PEDV and S. aureus in experimentally generated aerosols and in aerosols generated by infected animals. Efficiency at removing airborne particles was evaluated as a function of particle size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 µm), distance from the source of ions (1, 2 and 3 m) and relative air humidity (RH 30 vs. 70 %). Aerosols were sampled with the EPI system \"off\" and \"on.\" Removal efficiency was significantly greater for all pathogens when the EPI line was the closest to the source of aerosols. There was a greater reduction for larger particles ranging between 3.3 and 9 µm, which varied by pathogen. Overall airborne pathogen reduction ranged between 0.5 and 1.9 logs. Viable pathogens were detected with the EPI system \"on,\" but there was a trend to reducing the quantity of viable PRRSV and IAV. There was not a significant effect on the pathogens removal efficiency based on the RH conditions tested. In summary, distance to the source of ions, type of pathogen and particle size influenced the removal efficiency of the EPI system. The reduction in infectious agents in the air by the EPI technology could potentially decrease the microbial exposure for pigs and people in confinement livestock facilities.",

A growing number of people participate in sports to improve their overall health. However, the conditions in which people exercise are seldom examined. It is obvious that the air in buildings, including sports facilities, can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms, causing infections and allergies. Our study was aimed at assessing microbial air quality inside several sports facilities (fitness room, martial arts room, swimming pool, sports hall, gym) and at a sports field. Another objective was to evaluate the antibiotic resistance of isolated Staphylococcus strains. Air samples were collected with MAS-100 sampler, using selective substrates. Antibiotic resistance of mannitol-positive staphylococci was assessed using a disk diffusion method in accordance with EUCAST recommendations. The results indicated large fluctuations in average concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria, ranging from 38 CFU m −3 (swimming pool) to 1036 CFU m −3 (sports hall). Generally, bacteria were more abundant inside the buildings, while fungi in the sports field (658 CFU m −3 on average). In all facilities, airborne fungal communities were dominated by the genus Cladosporium , followed by Penicillium , Fusarium and Acremonium . Alternaria and Aureobasidium constituted only a small percentage of isolated molds. We recorded only low concentrations of mannitol-positive staphylococci (on average ranging from 1 CFU m −3 at the swimming pool and sports field to 9 CFU m −3 in the martial arts room). Of all isolated Staphylococcus strains, 73% were resistant to benzopenicillin, while more than 90% were sensitive to gentamycin, levofloxacin and rifampicin.",

The aim was to identify the best recognition algorithms for pollen classification based on the scattering images. A series of laboratory experiments with a Rapid-E device of Plair S.A. was conducted collecting scattering images and fluorescence spectra from pollen of 15 plant genera. The collected scattering data were supplied to 32 different setups of 8 computer vision models based on deep neural networks. The models were trained to classify the pollen types, and their performance was compared for the test sub-samples withheld from the training. Evaluation showed that most of the tested computer vision models convincingly outperform the basic convolutional neural network used in our previous studies: the accuracy gain was approaching 10% for best setups. The models of the Weakly Supervised Object Detection approach turned out to be the most accurate, but also slow. However, even the best setups still did not provide sufficient recognition accuracy barely reaching 65%–70% in the repeated tests. They also showed many false positives when applied to real-life time series collected by Rapid-E. Similar to the previous studies, fusion of the new scattering models with the fluorescence-based identification demonstrated almost 15% higher skills than either of the approaches alone reaching 77–83% of the overall classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Hirst-type pollen trap (1952) is the most common device for aerobiological measurements of pollen and fungal spores in ambient air. In the 1960s the in-line flowmeter was removed and studies since then showed considerable variability in the airflow pumped through the instrument when using hand-held rotameters with an internal airflow resistance to adjust flowrates. To avoid this problem, our study compared the variability of airflow rates of Hirst-type traps when using commercially-available low-resistance airflow meters (heat anemometers) at various timescales. Experiments were conducted in Munich (Germany) and Payerne (Switzerland), using 4 different easyFlux® instruments and 6 Hirst-type pollen traps. Measurements were taken on an hourly basis from dawn to dusk at both locations, and in addition at Payerne, weekly observations over a period of one year. When using the common hand-held rotameters (with airflow resistance) the flow was 28.3% lower than with resistance-free flowmeter (i.e., measured 10 L/min which was in reality 12.8 L/min). The coefficient of variation between the four easyFlux® devices ranged from 0.32% to 1.55% over one day and from 2.88% to 8.17% over an entire year. Some of the traps showed surprising flow variations during the day. Furthermore, flowrates deviated more when measurements were made at the point where the double-sided tape is behind the orifice than elsewhere on the drum. The measurements away from this point are representative of the flow rates for most of the period of operation and flow calibration should thus be carried out away from this point, contrary to the current procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Airborne fungal spores and pollen (aerospora), synergistic with air pollution, are key triggers of allergic respiratory diseases. Effective diagnosis and treatment requires up-to-date location-specific knowledge on the temporal variability of aerospora types and levels. Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and has grown substantially in three decades, with changes in ground cover, population density and air pollution, yet until now, no continuous aerospora sampling has occurred. We present a daily two-year (August 2019–July 2021) aerospora assemblage for Johannesburg and explore temporal characteristics of 13 dominant aerospora in relation to daily meteorological variables (pressure, rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and wind characteristics). February–July, July–September and January-July represent high-risk periods for fungal spores [( Alternaria alternata (Fries. ex Keissler), Ascospores, Aspergillus niger (Van Tieghem) , Penicillium chrysogenum (Thom), Cladosporium graminum (Corda), Epicoccum nigrum (Link), Helminthosporium solani (Durieu and Montagne) Nigrospora sphaerica (Saccardo ex. Mason), Smuts Ustilago nuda ( Jensen ex. Rostrup) and Torula herbarum (Link)], trees ( Cupressus , Morus and Platanus ) and grass (Poaceae), respectively. Using a generalised additive model, results show that daily meteorological characteristics explained 7–32% of daily aerospora variability, with the largest effect on tree pollen. Rainfall, relative humidity and temperature influenced daily fungal spore and Poaceae counts, with moderate/low rainfall (&lt; 20 mm), higher/mid-ranging relative humidity (~ 40–60%) and temperatures of ~ 15–20 °C associated with higher counts during high-risk periods. Rainfall predominantly influenced tree counts during high-risk periods, with higher counts occurring on low rainfall (&lt;10 mm) days. These results update the aerospora profile of Johannesburg, South Africa, providing important information to inform allergy care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Seasonal pollen allergy is a major public health concern, with many different pollen aeroallergens being present in the atmosphere at varying levels during the season. In Norway, information about spatiotemporal variation of pollen aeroallergens is currently lacking, leading to reduced ability to manage and treat seasonal allergies. Seven pollen aeroallergens (alder, hazel, willow, birch, pine, grass and mugwort) were monitored daily for 16 years from 12 regions and coalesced to create regional pollen calendars. Seasonal statistics, such as seasonal pollen integral (SPIn), onset, duration and periods of high and very high concentrations, were calculated for all pollen types and regions. High days were further modelled with SPIn in a linear regression framework to investigate the connection between the strength of the season and number of days above high pollen thresholds. The tree pollen season occurred between January and mid-July, with the pollen aeroallergens birch and pine being the most prominent in all regions. The herb pollen season was observed to occur between June and mid-August, although mugwort was almost completely absent. The grass pollen season was mostly mild on average but more severe in some regions, primarily Kristiansand. South-east regions of Oslo, Kristiansand and Lillehammer had the overall highest pollen load, while northern regions of Bodø, Tromsø and Kirkenes had the overall lowest pollen loads. SPIn and days above high pollen thresholds had positive highly significant relationships ( R 2 &gt; 0.85) for all pollen types, bar mugwort. Regional pollen calendars and seasonal statistics contribute to reliable information that can be used by medical professionals to effectively and timely manage and treat seasonal pollen allergies in Norway. Further research is needed to determine sensitization profiles of pine and willow.",

    "abstract": "Bioaerosols are useful indicators of plant phenology and can demonstrate the impacts of climate change on both local and regional scales (e.g. pollen monitoring/flowering phenology). Analysing bioaerosols with eDNA approaches are becoming more popular to quantify the diversity of airborne plant environmental DNA (eDNA) and flowering season of plants and trees. Leaf abscission from broadleaved trees and other perennial species can also indicate the status of plant health in response to climate. This happens primarily during autumn in response to seasonal growth conditions and environmental factors, such as changing photoperiod and reduced temperatures. During this period biological material is released in larger quantities to the environment. Here, rural bioaerosol composition during late summer and autumn was captured by MiSEQ sequencing of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, a common marker for taxonomic variation. Meteorological parameters were recorded from a proximal weather station. The composition of atmospheric taxa demonstrated that deciduous tree DNA forms part of the bioaerosol community during autumn and, for several common broadleaved tree species, atmospheric DNA abundance correlated to high wind events. This suggests that both flowering and autumn storms cause bioaerosols from deciduous trees that can be detected with eDNA approaches. This is an aspect that must be considered when eDNA methods are used to analyse either pollen or other fragments from trees.",

Consecutive phases during the pollen season were defined for each taxon (1, 2.5, 5, 25, 50, 75, 95, 97.5, 99% of annual total), and duration of the season was determined using the 98% method. On the basis of this analysis, the temporary differences in the dynamics of the seasons were most evident for Secale in 2005 and 2006 with the longest main pollen season (90% total pollen). The pollen season of Poaceae started the earliest in 2007, when thermal conditions were the most favourable. Correlation analysis with meteorological factors demonstrated that the relative humidity, mean and maximum air temperature, and rainfall were the factors influencing the average daily pollen concentrations in the atmosphere; also, the presence of air pollutants such as ozone, PM(10) and SO(2) was statistically related to the pollen count in the air. However, multiple regression models explained little part of the total variance. Atmospheric pollution induces aggravation of symptoms of grass pollen allergy.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, an inhalation of naturally generated aerosols has again become a widely practiced method of balneological treatment of various respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbial aerosol of subterraneotherapy chambers at the Bochnia Salt Mine Health Resort in southern Poland. The measurements were carried out using a 6-stage Andersen impactor over a period of 1 year in both indoor (i.e., two subterranean chambers, where curative treatments took place) and outdoor air. The maximum bacterial aerosol concentrations in the chambers reached 11,688 cfu/m3. In such interiors, a high-performance method of microbial contaminant reduction need be introduced, especially when large groups of young patients are medically cured. Respecting fungal aerosol, its average indoor concentration (88 cfu/m3) was significantly lower than outdoor level (538 cfu/m3). It confirms that ventilation system provides efficient barrier against this type of biologically active propagules. Among identified micro-organisms, the most prevalent indoors were Gram-positive cocci, which constituted up to 80 % of airborne microflora. As highly adapted to the diverse environments of its human host (skin, respiratory tract), they can be easily released in high quantities into the air. The number of people introduced into such subterranean chambers should be in some way limited. The analysis of microclimate parameters revealed that temperature and relative humidity influenced significantly the level of bacterial aerosol only. Hence, a constant control of these parameters should be scrupulously superintended at this type of subterranean premises.",

    "abstract": "This paper is the first aero-mycological report from Demänovská Ice Cave. Fungal spores were sampled from the internal and external air of the cave in June, 2014, using the impact method with a microbiological air sampler. Airborne fungi cultured on PDA medium were identified using a combination of classical phenotypic and molecular methods. Altogether, the presence of 18 different fungal spores, belonging to 3 phyla, 9 orders and 14 genera, was detected in the air of the cave. All of them were isolated from the indoor samples, and only 9 were obtained from the outdoor samples. Overall, airborne fungal spores belonging to the genus Cladosporium dominated in this study. However, the spores of Trametes hirsuta were most commonly found in the indoor air samples of the cave and the spores of C. herbarum in the outdoor air samples. On the other hand, the spores of Alternaria abundans, Arthrinium kogelbergense, Cryptococcus curvatus, Discosia sp., Fomes fomentarius, Microdochium seminicola and T. hirsuta were discovered for the first time in the air of natural and artificial underground sites. The external air of the cave contains more culturable airborne fungal spores (755 colony-forming units (CFU) per 1 m3 of air) than the internal air (from 47 to 273 CFU in 1 m3), and these levels of airborne spore concentration do not pose a threat to the health of tourists. Probably, the specific microclimate in the cave, including the constant presence of ice caps and low temperature, as well as the location and surrounding environment, contributes to the unique species composition of aeromycota and their spores in the cave. Thus, aero-mycological monitoring of underground sites seems to be very important for their ecosystems, and it may help reduce the risk of fungal infections in humans and other mammals that may arise in particular due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Artemisia pollen is an important allergen in Europe. In Poznań (Western Poland), three Artemisia species, A. vulgaris, A. campestris and A. absinthium, are widely distributed. However, the contributions of these species to the total airborne pollen are unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the flowering phenology and pollen production of the three abovementioned species and to construct a model of potential Artemisia pollen emission in the study area. Phenological observations were conducted in 2012 at six sites in Poznań using a BBCH phenological scale. Pollen production was estimated by counting the pollen grains per flower and recalculating the totals per inflorescence, plant and population in the study area. Airborne pollen concentrations were obtained using a Hirst-type volumetric trap located in the study area. Artemisia vulgaris began to flower the earliest, followed by A. absinthium and then A. campestris. The flowering of A. vulgaris corresponded to the first peak in the airborne pollen level, and the flowering of A. campestris coincided with the second pollen peak. The highest amounts of pollen per single plant were produced by A. vulgaris and A. absinthium. A. campestris produced considerably less pollen, however, due to its common occurrence, it contributed markedly (30 %) to the summation of total of recorded pollen. A. vulgaris is the most important pollen source in Poznań, but the roles of two other Artemisia species cannot be ignored. In particular, A. campestris should be considered as an important pollen contributor and likely might be one of the main causes of allergic reactions during late summer.",

Pollen concentration was analysed separately for twenty circulation types that were determined using objective classification. The results indicate the atmospheric circulation conditions favourable for both low and high pollen concentrations over Central Europe. Pollen concentrations vary significantly according to circulation types. The highest pollen concentrations for both taxons are typical for warm, sunny, and dry anticyclonic circulation types with anticyclone in the lower and upper troposphere, especially for types with advection from the SW. The lowest pollen concentrations are observed for cold, wet, and cloudy cyclonic types with advection from the northern sectors. There is also a positive and statistically significant trend in the frequency of circulation types favourable for high concentrations of Betula and Alnus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Airborne allergenic pollen impact the health of a great part of the global population. Under climate change conditions, the abundance of airborne pollen has been rising dramatically and so is the effect on sensitized individuals. The first line of allergy management is allergen avoidance, which, to date, is by rule achieved via forecasting of daily pollen concentrations. The aim of this study was to elaborate on 3-hourly predictive models, one of the very few to the best of our knowledge, attempting to forecast pollen concentration based on near-real-time automatic pollen measurements. The study was conducted in Augsburg, Germany, during four years (2016–2019) focusing on Betula and Poaceae pollen, the most abundant and allergenic in temperate climates. ARIMA and dynamic regression models were employed, as well as machine learning techniques, viz. artificial neural networks and neural network autoregression models. Air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, air pressure, sunshine duration, diffuse radiation, and wind speed were additionally considered for the development of the models. It was found that air temperature and precipitation were the most significant variables for the prediction of airborne pollen concentrations. At such fine temporal resolution, our forecasting models performed well showing their ability to explain most of the variability of pollen concentrations for both taxa. However, predictive power of Betula forecasting model was higher achieving R 2 up to 0.62, whereas Poaceae up to 0.55. Neural autoregression was superior in forecasting Betula pollen concentrations, whereas, for Poaceae, seasonal ARIMA performed best. The good performance of seasonal ARIMA in describing variability of pollen concentrations of both examined taxa suggests an important role of plants’ phenology in observed pollen abundance. The present study provides novel insight on per-hour forecasts to be used in real-time mobile apps by pollen allergic patients. Despite the huge need for real-time, short-term predictions for everyday clinical practice, extreme weather events, like in the year 2019 in our case, still comprise an obstacle toward highly performing forecasts at such fine timescales, highlighting that there is still a way to go to this direction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 2016, the highest birch ( Betula spp.) pollen concentrations were recorded in Kraków (Poland) since the beginning of pollen observations in 1991. The aim of this study was to ascertain the reason for this phenomenon, taking the local sources of pollen in Poland and long-range transport (LRT) episodes associated with the pollen influx from other European countries into account. Three periods of higher pollen concentrations in Kraków in 2016 were investigated with the use of pollen data, phenological data, meteorological data and the HYSPLIT numerical model to calculate trajectories up to 4 days back (96 h) at the selected Polish sites. From 5 to 8 April, the birch pollen concentrations increased in Kraków up to 4000 Pollen/m 3 , although no full flowering of birch trees in the city was observed. The synoptic situation with air masses advection from the South as well as backward trajectories and the general birch pollen occurrence in Europe confirm that pollen was transported mainly from Serbia, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, into Poland. The second analyzed period (13–14 April) was related largely to the local flowering of birches, while the third one in May (6–7 May) mostly resulted from the birch pollen transport from Fennoscandia and the Baltic countries. Unusual high pollen concentrations at the beginning of the pollen season can augment the symptomatic burden of birch pollen allergy sufferers and should be considered during therapy. Such incidents also affect the estimation of pollen seasons timing and severity. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal aerosols deteriorate library collections and can impact human health, mainly via respiratory diseases. Their spread is influenced by factors such as temperature and relative humidity. This study aims to assess the concentration of fungal aerosols in the interior environment of the Popular Library of Gaira in the District of Santa Marta, Colombia, using a two-stage cascade impactor utilizing Sabouraud dextrose agar on Petri dishes for the collection of samples. The sampler was positioned at 1.5 m above ground level, operated with a flow rate of 28.3 l/min for 4 min and thermo-hygrometric conditions were also recorded. Concentrations in the air of up to 1197.0 CFU/m 3 were reported, with a mean value close to 150 CFU/m 3 . Higher values during the morning samples were noted. Seven genera of fungi were found, Aspergillus and Curvularia were the most abundant. The temperature was between 30.80 and 33.51 °C, and the relative humidity was between 62.61 and 64.80%. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between the fungal aerosol concentration and relative humidity, where an increase of 10% in moisture could double the fungal aerosol concentration. We concluded that potentially favorable conditions exist indoors for the growth and survival of the following fungi: Aspergillus , Penicillium , Cladosporium , and Curvularia, and to a lesser extent for Chrysonilia , Cunninghamella , and Paecylomices . Relative humidity was seen to be the factor that affects the concentration of aerosols fungal in the library most significantly.",

Both of them are working environments characterized by extreme conditions, and additionally “Wieliczka,” officially placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites’ list, plays a role of tourist attraction. There are also some curative chambers located in this mine. Air samples were taken once in December 2015, between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. There were nine measurement points located about 200 m underground in “Wieliczka” and six measurement points located in the working shafts about 400 m underground in “Polkowice–Sieroszowice.” The total volume of each air sample was 150 L. Air samples, collected in individual measurement points of both salt mines, were inoculated on two microbiological media: potato dextrose agar and tryptic soy agar using the impact method. We identified 10 and 3 fungal genera in the “Wieliczka” Salt Mine and in “Polkowice–Sieroszowice,” respectively. The most common were fungi of the Penicillium genus. In both mines, the Gram-positive bacteria of genus Micrococcus were detected most frequently. Among identified microorganisms, there were neither pathogenic fungi nor bacteria. The most prevalent microorganisms detected in indoor air were Gram-positive cocci, which constituted up to 80% of airborne microflora. Our results showed that microorganisms recorded in the air samples are not a threat to workers, tourists or patients. Neither pathogens nor potentially pathogenic microorganisms, listed as BSL-2, BSL-3 or BSL-4, were detected. The microbes identified during our analysis commonly occur in such environments as the soil, water and air. Some of the detected bacteria are component of natural microflora of human skin and mucous membranes, and they can cause only opportunistic infections in individuals depending on their health condition.",

Daily average pollen concentrations were monitored over 8 years (2001-2005 and 2009-2011) using Hirst-designed volumetric spore traps. The spatial and temporal coherence of data was investigated using the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. The calculation and mathematical modelling of 61 correlograms were performed for up to 25 days back. The study revealed an association between temporal variations in Alnus, Betula, and Corylus pollen counts in Poland and three main groups of factors such as: (1) air mass exchange after the passage of a single weather front (30-40 % of pollen count variation); (2) long-lasting factors (50-60 %); and (3) random factors, including diurnal variations and measurements errors (10 %). These results can help to improve the quality of forecasting models.",

Evaluation of the level of mould contamination of the air in various places using culture method and ergosterol determination was also performed. The analysis of ergosterol was carried out by gas chromatography equipped with flame ionisation detector. For evaluation of the results, analysis of variance and multiple comparison test were used. The quantity of ergosterol in the spores of various species of mould was in the range 1.9–9.4 pg/spore. The presence of yeasts and bacteria in the air does not significantly affect ergosterol concentration, in view of the low content of that sterol in their cells (max. 0.009 pg/cell for bacteria and 0.39 pg/cell for yeast). An ergosterol concentration above 1 ng per m3 can be considered an indicator of excessive mould contamination of indoor air. Based on determination of ergosterol in the air of mouldy rooms the result obtained may be compared with the culture method, due to the 1,000 times higher concentration of ergosterol in the mycelium compared with spores. However, in the analysis of outdoor air, in view of the presence of mould mainly in the form of spores and the degradation of ergosterol by UV radiation, analysis of that compound may indicate a lower level of contamination compared with the culture method.",

The measurements of pollen concentration were taken with the volumetric method using Burkard's apparatus. The impact of atmospheric conditions on the daily alder pollen grain concentration, the annual totals, and the duration of pollen seasons were studied. The dependency between each meteorological condition and different features of the alder pollen season was determined by using Pearson's correlation coefficients, variance analysis with multiple comparison tests, and the linear regression model using backward elimination. It was proven that the temperatures directly preceding the pollination, i.e. the January and February temperatures as well as those from the period from 210 to 180 days preceding the beginning of the season, have the greatest impact on the beginning of the alder pollen season. The value of the daily alder pollen concentration in Sosnowiec showed a positive statistically significant correlation with the air temperature and sunshine duration and a negative correlation with the thickness of the snow cover and air relative humidity. The daily concentration also depended on the type of the weather front, direction of air mass inflow, and the type of the inflowing air mass. The season temperatures and the thermal conditions which were present in the summer of the preceding year impacted the annual totals (SPI) of the alder pollen grains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Historical facilities such as churches, crypts, libraries and museums are crucial for preserving cultural heritage but at the same time, they are frequently visited tourist objects and working environment. The aim of this study was to assess whether there are differences in the concentration and size distribution of bacterial and fungal aerosol in the mentioned groups of historical objects in Kraków, as well as to determine if there is tendency for seasonal fluctuations of bioaerosol concentrations, and what environmental parameters affect them most significantly. The concentrations of bacterial and fungal aerosol were measured in ten historical objects—churches, crypts, libraries and museums—using a six-stage Andersen impactor. Microbiological analyses were accompanied by measurements of particulate matter (PM 10 , PM 4 , PM 2.5 and PM 1 ) and microclimatic parameters. The results showed that the studied objects differ in terms of bioaerosol levels, but the differences were not drastic and in terms of bacterial aerosol concentrations the objects can be arranged as follows: churches &gt; libraries &gt; museums &gt; crypts, while for fungal aerosol the order would be: churches &gt; museums &gt; crypts &gt; libraries. The concentrations of bioaerosol did not exceed the safety levels for human exposure, but the levels suggesting possible threat of biodeterioration and the presence of internal source of contamination were exceeded in nearly all sites. The share of respirable fraction of bioaerosol was high (42.1–90.5% for bacteria and 80.7–94.7% for fungi). Bioaerosol concentration was most significantly associated with indoor temperature, and the impact of particulate matter was only moderate.",

    "abstract": "Pets are an important source of indoor allergens. The aim of the study was to compare cat and dog allergen levels in cars, schools and homes. The study was carried out in 17 cars, 14 classrooms and 19 dwellings located in the highly industrialized and urbanized region of Poland. Dust and air samples were analyzed for Fel d 1 and Can f 1 using a double monoclonal ELISA assay. The highest amounts of cat and dog allergens (Fel d 1: 1169 μg/g; Can f 1: 277 μg/g) were found in dwellings with pets. Allergen concentrations were correlated with the number of animals kept at home. Although concentrations on automobile seats were lower, Fel d 1 levels exceeded 8 μg/g in 23.5 % of cars and high levels of Can f 1 (>10 μg/g) were found in 17.6 % of cars. The study revealed that cars of pet owners may be reservoirs of cat and dog allergens even when animals are not transported in them. In schools, concentrations of pet allergens did not reach high levels, but the moderate levels of Fel d 1 (≥1–8 μg/g) and Can f 1 (≥2–10 μg/g) were detected in 42.9 and 7.1 % of the investigated classrooms. Concentrations of cat and dog allergen in schools were higher than in homes without pets. While airborne Fel d 1 and Can f 1 levels were found low, residential allergen concentrations in settled dust and air were correlated. The study results suggest that classrooms and cars of pet owners may be important sites of exposure to cat and dog allergens, though the highest concentrations of Fel d 1 and Can f 1 are found in homes of pet owners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The adverse impact of sewage treatment plants on the environment, resulting from the emission of harmful biological agents to the atmosphere, depends mainly on the size of the facility, the quantity and composition of treated sewage as well as the technologies and equipment used. The aim of the conducted research was to determine the microbiological quality of atmospheric air at Municipal-Industrial Sewage Treatment Plant in Oświęcim, which is one of the largest treatment plants in Lesser Poland. Bioaerosol measurements were made at four points (raw sewage inlet, aeration chamber, purified sewage outlet and 150 m from the treatment plant, at the background point) in the period from January to December 2018. Bioaerosol samples were collected using Microbiological Air Sampler MAS-100 by Merck. The tested atmospheric air was characterized by a qualitatively and quantitatively diverse microflora. The largest source of emission of microorganisms to the atmosphere was the mechanical part of the sewage treatment plant (raw sewage inlet) and the biological reactor. The highest number of mesophilic bacteria was observed near the biological reactor (in the summer), the least at the control point. During the research, the least β-hemolytic bacteria was isolated at the purified sewage outlet—on average 3 CFU m −3 , the highest at the biological reactor 16 CFU m −3 . Most of α-hemolytic bacteria was observed near the raw sewage inlet and was not found at the control point. Actinomycetes also occurred in a small amount (0–40 CFU m −3 ). A high concentration of mildew fungi occurred in summer when the air temperature was highest, the smallest quantities of these microorganisms were found in January and February.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Information on the allergenic pollen season provides insight on the state of the environment of a region and facilitates allergy symptom management. We present a retrospective analysis of the duration and severity of the allergenic pollen season and the role of meteorological factors in Istanbul, Turkey. Aerobiological sampling from January 2013 to June 2016, pollen identification and counting followed current standard methodology. Pollen seasons were defined according to 95% of the Annual Pollen Integral (APIn) and the season start date was compared with the first day of 5 day consecutive non-zero records. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were created to study the effect of meteorological factors on flowering. The main pollen contributors were taxa of temperate and Mediterranean climates, and neophytic Ambrosia . Cupressaceae, Poaceae, Pinaceae, Quercus and Ambrosia had the greatest relative abundance. The pollen season defined on 95% of the APIn was adequate for our location with total APIns around 10.000 pollen*day*m −3 . Woody taxa had generally shorter seasons than herbaceous taxa. In trees, we see precipitation as the main limiting factor for assimilate production prior to anthesis. A severe tree pollen season in 2016 suggests intense synchronous flowering across taxa and populations triggered by favourable water supply in the preceding year. GAM models can explain the effect of weather on pollen concentrations during anthesis. Under the climatic conditions over the study period, temperature had a negative effect on spring flowering trees, and a positive one on summer flowering weeds. Humidity, atmospheric pressure and precipitation had a negative effect on weeds. Our findings contribute to environmental and allergological knowledge in southern Europe and Turkey with relevancy in the assessment of impacts of climate change and the management of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory allergies triggered by pollen allergens represent a significant health concern to the Irish public. Up to now, Ireland has largely refrained from participating in long-term aerobiological studies. Recently, pollen monitoring has commenced in several sampling locations around Ireland. The first results of the pollen monitoring campaigns for Dublin (urban) and Carlow (rural) concerning the period 2017-2019 and 2018-2019, respectively, are presented herein. Additional unpublished pollen data from 1978-1980 and, 2010-2011 were also incorporated in creating the first pollen calendar for Dublin. During the monitoring period over 60 pollen types were identified with an average Annual Pollen Integral (APIn) of 32,217 Pollen × day/m3 for Dublin and 78,411 Pollen × day/m3 for Carlow. The most prevalent pollen types in Dublin were: Poaceae (32%), Urticaceae (29%), Cupressaceae/Taxaceae (11%), Betula (10%), Quercus (4%), Pinus (3%), Fraxinus (2%), Alnus (2%) and Platanus (1%). The predominant pollen types in Carlow were identified as Poaceae (70%), Urticaceae (12%), Betula (10%), Quercus (2%), Fraxinus (1%) and Pinus (1%). These prevalent pollen types increased in annual pollen concentration in both locations from 2018 to 2019 except for Fraxinus. Although higher pollen concentrations were observed for the Carlow (rural) site a greater variety of pollen types were identified for the Dublin (urban) site. The general annual trend in the pollen season began with the release of tree pollen in early spring, followed by the release of grass and herbaceous pollen which dominated the summer months with the annual pollen season coming to an end in October. This behaviour was illustrated for 21 different pollen types in the Dublin pollen calendar. The correlation between ambient pollen concentration and meteorological parameters was also examined and differed greatly depending on the location and study year. A striking feature was a substantial fraction of the recorded pollen sampled in Dublin did not correlate with the prevailing wind directions. However, using non-parametric wind regression, specific source regions could be determined such as Alnus originating from the Southeast, Betula originating from the East and Poaceae originating from the Southwest.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10453-022-09751-w.",

This study aimed at assessing the diversity of Alternaria species in airborne samples collected from closely located (7 km apart) and heterogeneous sites (rural, urban and unmanaged grassland) in Worcester and Lakeside, the UK. A secondary objective was to examine how the ITS1 subregion varies from ITS2 in Alternaria species diversity and composition. Airborne spores were collected using Burkard 7-day and multi-vial Cyclone samplers for the period 5 July 2016–9 October 2019. Air samples from the Cyclone were amplified using the ITS1and ITS2 subregions and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform whereas those from the Burkard sampler were identified and quantified using optical microscopy. Optical microscopy and eDNA revealed a high abundance of Alternaria in the rural, urban and unmanaged sites. ITS1 and ITS2 detected five and seven different Alternaria species at the three sampling sites, respectively. A. dactylidicola, A. metachromatica and A. infectoria were the most abundant. The rural, urban and unmanaged grassland sites had similar diversity (PERMANOVA) of the species due to similarity in land use and proximity of the sites. Overall, the study showed that heterogeneous and neighbouring sites with similar land uses can have similar Alternaria species. It also demonstrated that an eDNA approach can complement the classical optical microscopy method in providing more precise information on fungal species diversity in an environment for targeted management. Similar studies can be replicated for other allergenic and pathogenic fungi.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to characterise Artemisia pollen season types according to weather conditions in Wrocław (south-western Poland) in the years 2002-2011. Over the period analysed, the start date of the pollen season (determined by the 95 % method) ranged from 10 July 2002 to 28 July 2010. The start date of the pollen season can be determined by using Crop Heat Units (CHUs). During the period 2002-2011, the Artemisia pollen season started after the cumulative value of CHUs had reached 2,000-2,100 °C. The three distinguished types of Artemisia pollen season are best described by the frequency of weather types defined by the type of circulation, mean daily air temperature, and the occurrence of rain. The variation in these factors affected the dynamics of the pollen season. The noteworthy frequency of days with rain and high seasonal sum of precipitation totals as well as the dominance of cyclonic weather from the westerly direction had an impact on the extension of the pollen season. The meteorological factors that directly affect pollen release and transport primarily include air humidity, expressed as vapour pressure (r > 0.3, p < 0.01), temperature(r from 0.2 to 0.4, p < 0.01). The relationships between averaged meteorological data and daily pollen concentration were stronger (r > 0.5, p < 0.01). Based on the correlation analysis, the meteorological variables were selected and regression equations were established using stepwise backward regression analysis.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of a pollen season, such as timing and magnitude, depend on a number of factors such as the biology of the plant and environmental conditions. The main aim of this study was to develop mathematical models that explain dynamics in atmospheric concentrations of pollen and fungal spores recorded in Rzeszów (SE Poland) in 2000-2002. Plant taxa with different characteristics in the timing, duration and curve of their pollen seasons, as well as several fungal taxa were selected for this analysis. Gaussian, gamma and logistic distribution models were examined, and their effectiveness in describing the occurrence of airborne pollen and fungal spores was compared. The Gaussian and differential logistic models were very good at describing pollen seasons with just one peak. These are typically for pollen types with just one dominant species in the flora and when the weather, in particular temperature, is stable during the pollination period. Based on s parameter of the Gaussian function, the dates of the main pollen season can be defined. In spite of the fact that seasonal curves are often characterised by positive skewness, the model based on the gamma distribution proved not to be very effective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artemisia pollen is an important aeroallergen in late summer, especially in central and eastern Europe where distinct anemophilous Artemisia spp . produce high amounts of pollen grains. The study aims at: (i) analyzing the temporal pattern of and changes in the Artemisia spp. pollen season; (ii) identifying the Artemisia species responsible for the local airborne pollen load. Daily pollen concentration of Artemisia spp. was analyzed at two sites (BZ and SM) in Trentino-Alto Adige, North Italy, from 1995 to 2019 . The analysis of airborne Artemisia pollen concentrations evidences the presence of a bimodal curve, with two peaks, in August and September, respectively. The magnitude of peak concentrations varies across the studied time span for both sites: the maximum concentration at the September peak increases significantly for both the BZ ( p &lt; 0.05) and SM ( p &lt; 0.001) site. The first peak in the pollen calendar is attributable to native Artemisia species, with A. vulgaris as the most abundant; the second peak is mostly represented by the invasive species A. annua and A. verlotiorum (in constant proportion along the years), which are causing a considerable increase in pollen concentration in the late pollen season in recent years. . The spread of these species can affect human health, increasing the length and severity of allergenic pollen exposure in autumn, as well as plant biodiversity in both natural and cultivated areas, with negative impacts on, e.g., Natura 2000 protected sites and crops.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ramularia leaf spot is a major economic disease of barley caused by the dothidiomycete fungus Ramularia collo-cygni. The fungus has a complex life cycle which includes extensive late season spore release events and a seed-borne phase. Predicting disease epidemics during the growing season remains a difficult challenge. To better understand the interaction between spore movement and disease epidemics, spore samplers were set up in Germany (two sites over 4 years), Poland (seven sites over 2 years) and the UK (two sites over 9 years), where the disease has been observed. Spore concentrations were determined using a real time PCR assay, and meteorological data were obtained from co-located automatic stations. Spore release events were seen to peak in June on mainland Europe and July in the UK. The pattern of spore release was broadly similar across countries with earlier peaks in mainland Europe. A relationship was observed in the UK between July spore levels and disease in following winter barley crops. Rainfall and temperature were proposed as significant drivers of spore release in these months. The major environmental parameter associated with spore release across the two UK sites was crop surface wetness, although some site-specific interactions were noted for rainfall and wind movement. Regression analysis of spore patterns and disease epidemics indicates a relationship between spore levels 75–105 days pre harvest and final disease levels in UK winter barley crops. This relationship was not observed in spring barley. The implications on risk forecasts are discussed.",

In total, 55 strains belonging to the genus Staphylococcus were isolated from 45 sites, and 13 species of coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified. The species composition of studied airborne microbiota contains Staphylococcus species that are rarely infectious to humans. Most commonly isolated species comprised S. hominis and S. warneri. The disk-diffusion tests showed that the collected isolates were most frequently resistant to erythromycin. The PCR technique was employed to search for genes conferring the resistance in staphylococci to antibiotics from the group of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins. The analyzed Staphylococcus isolates possessed simultaneously 4 different resistance genes. The molecular analysis with the use of specific primers allowed to determine the most prevalent gene which is mphC, responsible for the resistance to macrolides and for the enzymatic inactivation of the drug by phosphotransferase. The second most often detected gene was msrA1, which confers the resistance of staphylococci to macrolides and is responsible for active pumping of antimicrobial particles out of bacterial cells.",

    "abstract": "Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) are highly allergenic Asteraceae. They often cause pollen allergies in late summer and fall. While mugwort is native to Europe, ragweed reached Europe as a neophyte from North America about 150 years ago and continued spreading ever since. To understand possible relationships between the spread of ragweed, its abundance in air, and to judge possible health risks for the public, we quantified ragweed DNA in inhalable fine as well as in coarse air particulate matter. Mugwort was chosen for comparison, as it is closely related to ragweed and grows in similar, though mainly not identical, habitats but is native to Germany. The DNA quantification was performed on atmospheric aerosol samples collected over a period of 5 years in central Europe. The DNA concentrations were highest during the characteristic pollination periods but varied greatly between different years. In the inhalable fine particle fraction, ragweed exceeds the mugwort DNA concentration fivefold, while the coarse particle fraction, bearing intact pollen grains, contains more mugwort than ragweed DNA. The higher allergenic potential of ragweed might be linked to the humidity or long-range transport-induced bursting of ragweed pollen into smaller allergenic particles, which may reach the lower airways and cause more intense allergic reactions. Airborne ragweed DNA was detected also outside the local pollination periods, which can be explained by atmospheric long-range transport. Back-trajectory analyses indicate that the air masses containing ragweed DNA during winter had originated in regions with milder climate and large ragweed populations (Southern France, Carpathian Basin).",

Twenty measurements were taken quarterly in 2012–2016, in four salt chambers. The volumetric and impact methods were used to measure microbiological contamination, while the mite and cat allergens were measured using FEIA assay. The statistically significant differences among the study sites and time of measurements, treated as the following seasons, for spores and bacteria were found. Pollen grains were observed in the underground chambers rarely and in significantly lower quantities than outdoors. No statistically significant differences between the content of Der p1 and Fel d1 allergens among the study locations, seasons and patient presence/absence were found. The qualitative content of micro-organisms in the air of salt chambers seems to be related to the biological material carrying in by patients and staff.",

Our goal was to compare measurements from these stations in relation to meteorology and land cover. We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient to investigate any dependence between meteorological factors and pollen concentration. Additionally, to check the relation between the direction of inflow of air masses and pollen concentration, we calculated the backward trajectories using the HYSPLIT model. The results have shown that despite the short distance between the stations, the characteristic of the pollen season is different for both stations (i.a. date of start and end of pollen season, duration of the season). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient between relative humidity and air temperature and pollen concentration was found to be statistically significant. The backward trajectories calculated with HYSPLIT suggested a different origin of air masses between stations for high-concentration episodes in the case of Alnus. Our study has shown that analysis of meteorological conditions and influence of air transport into pollen concentration makes it possible to ascertain the reasons for differences in pollen level at these two stations, both of which are located in the same climatological domain. The study also shows that the aerobiological condition may change significantly over a short distance, which is a major challenge, for example, for pollen emission, transport, and concentration modelling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ragweed Pollen Alarm System (R-PAS) has been running since 2014 to provide pollen information for countries in the Pannonian biogeographical region (PBR). The aim of this study was to develop forecast models of the representative aerobiological monitoring stations, identified by analysis based on a neural network computation. Monitoring stations with 7-day Hirst-type pollen trap having 10-year long validated data set of ragweed pollen were selected for the study from the PBR. Variables including forecasted meteorological data, pollen data of the previous days and nearby monitoring stations were used as input of the model. We used the multilayer perceptron model to forecast the pollen concentration. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network. MLP is a data-driven method to forecast the behaviour of complex systems. In our case, it has three layers, one of which is hidden. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training to get better performance. By testing the neural network, we selected different sets of variables to predict pollen levels for the next 3 days in each of the monitoring stations. The predicted pollen level categories (low–medium–high–very high) are shown on isarithmic map. We used the mean square error, mean absolute error and correlation coefficient metrics to show the forecasting system’s performance. The average of the Pearson correlations is around 0.6 but shows big variability (0.13–0.88) among different locations. Model uncertainty is mainly caused by the limitation of the available input data and the variability in ragweed season patterns. Visualization of the results of the neural network forecast on isarithmic maps is a good tool to communicate pollen information to general public in the PBR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Grass pollen constitutes a significant public health concern in Australia, particularly for individuals with seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma, due to its strong association with epidemic thunderstorm asthma (ETSA) events, which are getting more frequent due to climate change. The combined effects of humidity and lightning during ETSA events cause intact grass pollen to rupture and release small particles that can trigger severe asthma attacks, leading to increased hospital admissions. To help prevent this, researchers began collecting and monitoring local pollen data that contribute to ETSA warning systems. In Australia, expert pollen counters rely on Hirst-type traps, but these machines take 24 h to operate. Some modern machines have been designed to monitor pollen faster, but they are not able to determine the state of the pollen (i.e., intact or ruptured). The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents an opportunity to enhance pollen monitoring by accurately identifying not only pollen taxa but also the state of the pollen. Using AI to monitor ruptured pollen could improve the accuracy and efficiency of warning systems, thereby helping to prevent the severe outcomes associated with ETSA events.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of airborne pollen transportation is crucial for the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment. Under favorable conditions, a considerable amount of long-distance-transported pollen can be deposited far from its place of origin. In extreme arid regions, in most cases, such situations occur and increase the difficulty to interpret fossil pollen records. In this study, three sets of Cour airborne pollen trap were installed on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountains to collect airborne Picea schrenkiana (spruce) pollen grains from July 2001 to July 2006. The results indicate that Picea pollen disperses extensively and transports widely in the lower atmosphere far away from spruce forest. The airborne Picea pollen dispersal period is mainly concentrated between mid-May and July. In desert area, weekly Picea pollen began to increase and peaked suddenly in concentration. Also, annual pollen indices do not decline even when the distance increased was probably related to the strong wind may pick up the deposited pollen grains from the topsoil into the air stream, leading to an increase of pollen concentration in the air that is irrelevant to the normal and natural course of pollen transport and deposition. This, in turn, may lead to erroneous interpretations of the pollen data in the arid region. This study provided insight into the shift in the Picea pollen season regarding climate change in arid areas. It is recorded that the pollen pollination period starts earlier and the duration became longer. The results also showed that the temperature of May and June was positively correlated with the Picea pollen production. Furthermore, the transport of airborne Picea pollen data is useful for interpreting fossil pollen records from extreme arid regions.",

The aerobiological monitoring of fungal spores was performed by means of two Lanzoni volumetric spore traps. The high Didymella spore numbers were observed at both cities in June, July and August. Statistically significant correlations have been found mainly between the Didymella spore concentrations in the air and the minimum air temperature and relative air humidity. The spore count of Didymella is determined by the diversity of local flora and weather conditions, especially by the relative air humidity. The identification of factors that influence and shape spore concentrations may significantly improve the current methods of allergy prevention.",

    "abstract": "The airborne dissemination of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) endospores (spores) in healthcare environments is documented in multiple studies. Once airborne, spores have the potential for transport on air currents to other areas. This study compared the methods in the collection of C. difficile spore aerosol. This study determined the relative efficiency of commonly used bioaerosol air sampling methods when characterizing airborne C. difficile spore concentrations. Air samplers evaluated in this study were the AirTrace slit-to-agar impactor, AGI-30 impinger, SKC BioSampler impinger, and a 47-mm mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter cassette. Non-toxigenic C. difficile spores were nebulized into an enclosure contained in a biological safety cabinet. Side-by-side air samples were drawn from the enclosure. The slit-to-agar impactor, successfully used in previous studies to collect airborne spores, served as the reference method. Relative efficiency for the 47-mm MCE filter cartridge was higher than the slit-to-agar impactor (mean 136.6%, 95% CI 124.7–148.5%). Efficiencies of the impingers were similar and were low (mean 4.13%, 95% CI 2.27–5.99%). Impingers failed to maintain culturability of C. difficile spores during sampling. This study is the first to compare the efficiencies of commonly used bioaerosol sampling methods to collect airborne C. difficile spores. Filter air sampling provided the greatest collection of airborne spores. Slit-to-agar air sampling may underestimate the number of airborne spores present. Impinger air sampling could significantly underestimate the actual number of airborne C. difficile spores present or fail to detect airborne spores.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 lockdown has not only helped in combating the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but also improved air quality in a very emphatic manner in most of the countries. In India, the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown came into force on March 25, 2020, which was later continued in the next phases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the result of lockdown on air quality of major metropolitan cities-Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Lucknow-from March 25 to May 3, 2020. For this study, the concentration of six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3) and air quality index during the COVID-19 lockdown period was compared with the same period of the previous year 2019. The results indicate a substantial improvement in air quality with a drastic decrease in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, while there is a moderate reduction in SO2 and O3 concentration. During the lockdown period, the maximum reduction in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 was observed to be - 49% (Lucknow), - 57% (Delhi), - 75% (Mumbai), - 68% (Kolkata), - 48% (Mumbai), and - 29% (Hyderabad), respectively. The value of the air quality index (AQI) also dwindled significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The maximum decline in AQI was observed - 52% in Bengaluru and Lucknow. The order of AQI was satisfactory > moderate > good > poor and the frequency order of prominent pollutants was O3 > PM10 > PM2.5 > CO > NO2 > SO2 during the lockdown period in all the aforementioned metropolitan cities.",

Our main objective is to study a model based on 3D trajectories at a local scale, focusing on urban trees geolocated using KML maps and LiDAR data. The study tracks pollen particles (Pinaceae) from trees to pollen samplers, considering meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, as well as the influence of buildings. Four simulations were conducted using annual episode criteria, based on representative days from a five-day intradiurnal pollen pattern at both ground and terrace levels. One simulation represented the interannual average, while the others were based on annual averages. The BIM methodology was employed to analyze air quality and particle dispersion. The results from air trajectory simulations and the potential impact of vegetation on buildings (including façade and street canyon effects) could be extrapolated to inform new building designs.",

    "abstract": "Airborne bioparticles, including fungal spores, are of major concern for human and plant health, necessitating precise monitoring systems. While a European norm exists for manual volumetric monitoring, there's a growing interest in automated real-time methods. However, these methods rely heavily on machine learning, facing challenges due to diverse particle characteristics and limited training data availability, especially for fungal spores. This study aims to address this gap by outlining best practices for collecting reference material and creating tailored datasets for training algorithms. Using 17 fungal species from the Belgian fungi collection BCCM/IHEM, including five Alternaria species, key aspects such as in vitro cultivation, dry spore harvest, and aerosolization were addressed. Simple classification models were developed, achieving varying accuracies on different monitors. The Plair Rapid-E+ demonstrated accuracies ranging from 83.4% to 95.1% (macro average F1-score 0.61), with better recognition for Cladosporium spp. and Curvularia caricae-papayae. The SwisensPoleno Jupiter, initially achieving a macro average F1-score of 0.77 with holographic images of eight genera, improved to 0.83 when combined with fluorescence data. Accuracies ranged from 55 to 95%, with notable performance for Alternaria spp. and Curvularia caricae-papayae. Species differentiation was also shown to be possible for Cladosporium, but was more difficult for some Alternaria species, while the macro average F1-score remained good (0.72). Overall, this protocol paves the way for more efficient, standard, and accurate automatic identification of airborne fungal spores.

    "abstract": "Abstract The air in public facilities contains microorganisms which may cause a wide variety of clinical syndromes in humans. This is particularly important in primary healthcare units, where patients with reduced immunity and staff are directly exposed to microbial pathogens. Air samples were collected from dispensing areas (customer areas) of five pharmacies using MAS-100 air sampler. The concentration of particular groups of microorganisms was determined with the use of selective media. The taxonomic analysis of mannitol-positive bacteria was conducted using the BIOLOG ® method, based on metabolic characteristics of analyzed strains. The isolated molds were identified based on their macroscopic and microscopic features according to available keys. The antimicrobial susceptibility of identified staphylococci was tested using the disk diffusion method in accordance with The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations. The highest average concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria and staphylococci were recorded in two hospital pharmacies. The highest average concentrations of molds were recorded in the pharmacies located in shopping centers. Taxonomic analysis indicated that Cladosporium and Penicillium spp. predominated among the isolated molds while Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus , among mannitol-positive bacteria. Antibiograms showed that the majority of Staphylococcus strains (68.2%) were resistant to erythromycin. There was a statistically significant correlation between the concentration of investigated bacteria and the season of the year as well as the size and location of the pharmacies. The results demonstrate that there is a range of factors affecting air quality in public spaces and emphasize the fact that pharmacies can be a source of potentially pathogenic, drug-resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inhalation of grass pollen can result in acute exacerbation of asthma, prompting questions about how grass pollen reaches metropolitan areas. We establish typical atmospheric Poaceae (grass) pollen concentrations recorded at two pollen samplers within the Sydney basin in eastern Australia and analyse their correlation with each other and meteorological variables. We determine the effect of synoptic and regional airflow on Poaceae pollen transport during a period of extreme (≥ 100 grains m −3 air) concentration and characterise the meteorology. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that most Poaceae pollen captured by the pollen samplers originated from local sources. Fifteen months of daily pollen data, three days of hourly atmospheric Poaceae pollen concentrations and fifteen months of hourly meteorology from two locations within the Sydney basin were used. Weather Research Forecasting (WRF), Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) modelling and conditional bivariate probability functions (CBPF) were used to assess Poaceae pollen transport. Most Poaceae pollen collected was estimated to be from local sources under low wind speeds. Extreme daily Poaceae pollen concentrations were rare, and there was no strong evidence to support long-distance Poaceae pollen transport into the Sydney basin or across the greater Sydney metropolitan area. Daily average pollen concentrations mask sudden increases in atmospheric Poaceae pollen, which may put a significant and sudden strain on the healthcare system. Mapping of Poaceae pollen sources within Sydney and accurate prediction of pollen concentrations are the first steps to an advanced warning system necessary to pre-empt the healthcare resources needed during pollen season.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There are limited studies that established significant relationships between meteorological variables and COVID-19 spread in Malaysia. Although knowledge from studies conducted in other countries can be utilised as a basis for the policy formulation in general, country-specific studies are necessary as meteorological parameters and COVID-19 spread vary from country to country. This study investigated the potential roles of five meteorological parameters (average relative humidity, maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and average wind speed) on COVID-19 spread in each of the 13 states and the entire Malaysia. The state-wise daily COVID-19-confirmed cases and daily meteorological parameters from 1 August 2020 to 31 March 2021 were acquired from Ministry of Health Malaysia and Malaysia Meteorological Department, respectively. The correlations between state-wise daily COVID-19-confirmed cases and daily meteorological parameters were ascertained via Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation tests at 5% significance level. Overall, significant correlations exist between all meteorological parameters considered in this study and daily COVID-19-confirmed cases throughout Malaysia. Average wind speed was positively correlated with COVID-19-confirmed cases, whereas average relative humidity, maximum temperature, average temperature, and minimum temperature were negatively associated with COVID-19-confirmed cases. These study findings build up knowledge pertaining the association between important meteorological factors and COVID-19 spread in various regions with different climates. The research outcomes could be helpful in understanding, bringing awareness, and educating Malaysian citizens through communication between citizens and governmental as well as non-governmental agencies via official portals to develop a better response mechanism for the Malaysian perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Deposited dust represents a nutritional niche for microflora. Inhibiting microflora-associated deposited dust is a critical approach to manage cultural heritage buildings. Knowledge on the effectiveness of commercial disinfection on microflora in a real field environment is limited. The present study aims to: (1) characterize deposited dust composition, and (2) assess the effectiveness of several commercial biocides/and an air ionizer on microflora-associated floor surface and air before and after treatment. Deposited dust was collected using a dust collector and microbial air sampling was conducted via a volumetric impactor sampler. Susceptibility of microorganisms to biocide/ionizer was performed in a naturally ventilated unoccupied room with a floor area of 18 m 2 . One-treatment protocol, a daily disinfection mode, was applied to each biocide/ionizer. The surface floor was adjacently sprayed by a biocide, and the ionizer was turned on for 30 min. Indoor deposited dust rates varied between 0.75 and 8.7 mg/m 2 /day with indoor/outdoor ratio of ~ 1:100. Ion concentrations of NH 4 + , Cl − , SO 4 2− and NO 3 − were higher indoor than outdoor. The concentration of microorganisms-associated deposited dust averaged 10 6 CFU/g; 10 5 CFU/g and 10 4 CFU/g for bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes, respectively. A total of 23 fungal taxa were identified, with Aspergillus flavus , Asp. fumigatus and Asp. niger were the predominant taxa. Biocides quickly reduced floor surface and airborne microbial loads. The biocidal effect was time limited, as microflora loads increased again after ~ 4 days of the treatment protocol. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) out-performed other biocides, showed a relatively permanent microbial inhibiting effect. The air ionizer reduced airborne microorganisms and increased surface floor ones. Characterizing of deposited dust (rate and composition) and choice an appropriate biocide may effectively reduce biodeterioration. Further real field treatment trials under various microenvironmental conditions are needed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection treatment.",

This review delves into the global background of Ambrosia , focusing on its origins, invasive potential, and spread to South America. The ecological niche for Ambrosia species is explored, emphasizing its stability globally but exhibiting unique and dynamic features in South America. Information on Ambrosia pollen concentration in South America is summarized, revealing varying levels across countries. The establishment of new aerobiology stations, as highlighted in the latest findings, contributes valuable data for understanding allergen risk management in the region. The health perspective addresses the rise in allergic diseases due to climate change, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring, especially in South America. Agricultural damage inflicted by Ambrosia is discussed, emphasizing its invasive potential, high seed production, and negative impact on crops, forage quality, and livestock. The review also positions Ambrosia as a marker of climate change, discussing the effects of global warming on pollen seasons, concentrations, and allergenic characteristics. The importance of expanding aerobiology stations in South America is underscored, requiring collaborative efforts from government, scientific societies, and academic institutions. The review concludes by advocating for increased monitoring to address potential challenges posed by Ambrosia , offering a basis for tailored interventions and future research in South American regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution, aeroallergens, and weather conditions can worsen health symptoms such as asthma. While studying the impact of these factors, the use of weather types (WTs) rather than individual meteorological variables (such as temperature, relative humidity, wind, cloudiness, or precipitation) is more appropriate since it is holistic and integrative. Moreover, several studies have shown that the human body responds to WTs, rather than to individual meteorological variables. In this study, the use of Sheridan’s WTs is adopted and compared with a so-called “In-House” WTs. The analysis presented here deals with the links between asthma hospitalization and the synergy among air pollution, birch tree pollen and WTs. Knowing the daily WT in a region can provide valuable information for health planning and management of asthma hospitalization, emergency visits and sub-clinical symptoms in the population. This is because air pollution and birch pollen both occur within only a few specific WTs, such as the TROWAL (trough of warm air aloft) or tropical airmasses. These specific WTs need to be more scrutinized since, in Montreal, these are often linked with higher daily mean hospitalization. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of specific WTs in determining the maximum daily concentrations of ozone, fine particles, Betula pollen concentrations and health effects such as asthma hospitalization. Moreover, the use of data filters in the analysis (for temperature and total count of hospitalization) also reveals new insights in the complex nature of asthma disease and its relationship with environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The exposure to airborne dusts and microorganisms is associated with respiratory diseases and other health effects. Currently, research concerning fungal aerosol and particulate matter levels in animal enclosures of zoological gardens is very scarce. Such premises are characterized by numerous sources of air contamination, and they are both working environment and popular tourist attractions. This study aimed to assess the levels of fungal aerosol in animal premises (tapirs, giraffes, pygmy hippos, monkeys, meerkats, pheasants, ostriches, exotarium) of the Kraków Zoo. The bioaerosol samples were collected using a six-stage Andersen impactor to assess the concentrations and size distribution of airborne fungi. Particulate matter (PM 10 , PM 4 , PM 2.5 and PM 1 ) concentration was assessed using DustTrak Aerosol Monitor. PM concentrations were relatively low (0.048–0.204 mg/m 3 ) and did not exceed the limit values for occupational exposure. Also, the levels of fungal aerosol in almost all cases did not exceed the limit values. The smallest concentration of the total fungal aerosol was observed in the rooms for hippos (approx. 970 CFU/m 3 ) while the highest—in exotarium (16,800 CFU/m 3 ). The share of respirable fraction of bioaerosol was quite high—from 62.6% in monkey houses to 89.2% in exotarium. Having in mind that bioaerosol-forming fungi may contain allergenic species, attention should be paid to thorough cleaning of animals and their premises, and maintaining appropriate levels of microclimatic parameters in the rooms.",

For each taxon, a high pollen count level was established according to the first allergy symptoms during exposure. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set, using a stratified random split. For each taxon and city, the model was built using a random forest method. Corylus models performed poorly. However, the study revealed the possibility of predicting with substantial accuracy the occurrence of days with high pollen concentrations of Alnus and Betula using past pollen count data from monitoring sites. These results can be used for building (1) simpler models, which require data only from aerobiological monitoring sites, and (2) combined meteorological and aerobiological models for predicting high levels of pollen concentration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to characterize the occupational exposure to inhalable dust and airborne fungi among archive and library workers based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of stationary and personal filter samples as well as nasal swabs. The study was carried out in 3 archives and 2 libraries and involved 9 workers of these institutions. Airborne fungi and inhalable dust samples were collected by stationary and personal measurements using filter samplers. Additionally, the nasal swabs from workers were taken after work-shift and microbiologically analysed. The average concentrations of inhalable dust and airborne fungi were 49 µg/m 3 (SD = 91) and 299 CFU/m 3 (SD = 579), respectively. Both dust and bioaerosol concentrations obtained using personal measurements were significantly higher than that measured by stationary sampling. The correlation analysis showed strong relationships between the concentrations of inhalable dust and airborne fungi (R = 0.57; p &lt; 0.001). The fungal concentrations in swab samples from archive workers (median: 104 CFU/ml) were significantly higher than that in swabs from librarians (median: 1.4 CFU/ml). Among the airborne fungi, the widest spectrum of species was found among Penicillium and Aspergillus (including pathogenic A. fumigatus ) genera. However, in samples from archives, yeast-like fungi from Sporidiobolus and Candida (including pathogenic C. albicans ) genera predominated among isolated mycobiota. The results of this study revealed that airborne fungi were able to efficiently contaminate the nasal cavity of archive and library employees. The analysis of nasal swabs can be considered as an important analytical tool supporting the assessment of workers’ exposure to bioaerosols.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Allergen-containing subpollen particles (SPPs) are micrometric or sub-micrometric particles (0.12–5 µm) released from pollen. They are able to reach the lower airways, causing allergenic reactions. SPP release occurs through the pore of intact grains or by rupture of the whole grain. In this paper the results of two laboratory experiments investigating the dynamics of SPP release for three alien species of Ambrosia genus are shown. Rainwater composition and wind speed were considered, by simulating different conditions, in accordance with a fully orthogonal experimental design. The principle response variable was the total percentage of SPPs-releasing pollen grains; also the percentage of intact grains releasing SPPs through the pore and of broken SPPs-releasing grains were considered. Both osmotic and mechanical shock caused the discharge of SPPs but different results were observed. The highest number of releasing grains was recorded in case of acid solution and 20 knots wind speed. Moreover, wind and rainfalls caused SPPs release through different mechanisms. Wind mainly provoked a mechanical shock leading to grain rupture, whereas rainfall caused mainly SPPs release through the pore of intact grains. Comparing species, the effect of wind and at least in some cases also that of rainwater appeared to be less relevant for Ambrosia trifida than for Ambrosia psilostachya and Ambrosia artemisiifolia . The obtained results suggest a species-specific response of Ambrosia species to wind speed and rainwater that lead to a different release of SPPs and then to a species-specific impact on allergy according to the characteristics of their growth environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, the HYSPLIT model was used to reproduce birch pollen concentrations in Poland for the years 2015 and 2016, where there was significant variation in terms of pollen concentrations and start/end dates of the pollen season. The analysis of pollen observations showed that the seasonal pollen integral (SPIn) was low in 2015 with a shorter season compared to 2016. In 2016, SPIn was unusually high. The HYSPLIT model simulation, with a one-hour temporal resolution, was conducted during the birch pollen season (from March to May) for 2015 and 2016. Meteorological data were obtained from the WRF model. The birch coverage map of the European Forest Institute was used. The emission, introduced to the model, covered Central Europe with a resolution of 0.3° × 0.3°. The results were compared to data from 11 observation stations in Poland. The measured birch pollen concentrations for 2015 were overestimated by HYSPLIT at 8 of the 11 stations (normalized mean bias/NMB from 0.13 to 2.53) and underestimated for three stations (NMB from − 0.44 to − 0.15). For 2016, the model highly underestimated the pollen concentrations, with NMB ranging from − 0.45 to − 0.93. In general, the results show that the model can resolve the main peaks of pollen concentrations, which is a step forward in the application of the HYSPLIT model for birch pollen forecasting over Poland. We suggest the application of methods that can reduce the bias of temperature such as meteorological data assimilation or bias correction, which could improve calculation of the start of emissions and consequently the start of the pollen season as well as pollen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the characteristics and distribution of hospital environmental microbiome associated with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Environmental samples with varying degrees of contamination which were associated with confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected, including 13 aerosol samples collected near eight patients in different wards, five swabs from one patient's skin and his personal belongings, and two swabs from the surface of positive pressure respiratory protective hood and the face shield from a physician who had close contact with one patient. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was used to analyze the composition of the microbiome. One of the aerosol samples (near patient 4) was detected positive for COVID-19, and others were all negative. The environmental samples collected in different wards possessed protean compositions and community structures, the dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, and Cutibacterium. Top 10 of genera accounted for more than 76.72%. Genera abundance and proportion of human microbes and pathogens radiated outward from the patient, while the percentage of environmental microbes increased. The abundance of the pathogenic microorganism of medical supplies is significantly higher than other surface samples. The microbial compositions of the aerosol collected samples nearby the patients were mostly similar to those from the surfaces of the patient's skin and personal belongings, but the abundance varied greatly. The positive rate of COVID-19 RNA detected from aerosol around patients in general wards was quite low. The ward environment was predominantly inhabited by species closely related to admitted patients. The spread of hospital microorganisms via aerosol was influenced by the patients' activity.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10453-021-09708-5.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Daily monitoring of airborne fungal spores was carried out for the first time in Al Khor city, Qatar, using a Hirst type 7-day recording volumetric spore trap, from May 2017 to May 2019. During the sampling period, the annual and monthly fluctuations, as well as intradiurnal variations of airborne fungal spore concentrations, were evaluated. Cladosporium, followed by Alternaria, were the spore types most abundant in the atmosphere of the city, with a strong interannual variability in the atmospheric concentrations being observed. The Annual Spore Integrals (ASIns) were 3334 and 1172 spore * day/m 3 (2017–2018), and 6796 and 1538 spore * day/m 3 (2018–2019) for Cladosporium and Alternaria , respectively. Total daily spore concentrations showed significantly positive correlations with mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures but significantly negative correlations with relative humidity. However, due to the scarce rainfalls’ days, we did not find a statistically significant correlations between Cladosporium and Alternaria spore concentrations and this parameter. Despite this, the spore peaks were strongly related to precipitations that occurred during the previous month. In general, no significant correlations were found with wind speed but, regarding wind direction, the higher percentage of spores were collected when wind blows from the 4th quadrant (NW). According to the intradiurnal pattern, Cladosporium fungal spores displayed their maximum daily concentration during 8:00–10:00 h in the morning, with a second peak in the afternoon, while for Alternaria , the maximum peaks were observed between 08:00 and 14:00 h. Because no consistent previous aerobiological studies exist from Qatar, the aim of this study is to define the seasonality and intradiurnal behaviour of these two airborne fungal spore and the role that, in such arid scene, the meteorological parameters play on the spore concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Abundance and diversity of airborne pollen are important to human health and biodiversity. The UK operational network collects airborne pollen from 8 flowering trees, grasses and three weeds using Hirst traps and microscopic identification from urban areas. Knowledge of total pollen diversity and differences between rural and urban zones is limited. We collect environmental DNA (eDNA) from air during summer and autumn over 3 years with mini cyclones from one urban and one rural site. Data are analysed using next generation sequencing and metabarcoding. We find the most common genus, Urtica (57%), is also identified by the national network. The grasses Lolium (10%), Agrostis (2%) and Holcus (1%) are in the national network grouped at family level, while Brassica (2%), Chenopodium (1%), Impatiens (2%), Plantago (4%) and Tilia (7%) are not part of the UK operational network. DNA from 138 genera was identified, where 2% of the sample could not be associated with specific genera. 40% of the sample was classified better using eDNA methods at the genus level, than by optical methods. We calculate Bray–Curtis dissimilarity for the rural and urban zones and find a systematic difference in biodiversity. Overall, this shows airborne DNA reveals more information than methods based on morphological differences. The results also suggest data from sites located in large urban areas will be less representative for less populated rural areas. This presents a dilemma in balancing a network and the associated costs delivering health relevant information to the most populated areas vs. a nation-wide approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a need for information on pollen exposure to assess allergy risk. Monitoring of aeroallergens in a city is usually limited to the use of a single trap for the whole area. While a single trap provides enough information on background pollen concentration for the area, varying pollen exposure across different urban environments, however, is not considered. In this study, we analysed aerobiological data of three pollen seasons (2017–2020) recorded with a volumetric pollen trap in Sydney, Australia. In order to assess spatial differences in pollen exposure across the city, we installed ten gravimetric traps recording pollen deposition for eight weeks during the summer of 2019/2020. We considered the influence of meteorological variables, land use, urbanisation and distance to the sea. Our results showed differences in pollen season characteristics across the three analysed seasons and correlations with meteorological parameters. Considering all years, we found for Poaceae and Alternaria the strongest positive correlation with mean temperature and for Myrtaceae and Cupressaceae with maximum temperature. Likewise, there were negative correlations with humidity (Myrtaceae, Cupressaceae, Alternaria ) and precipitation (Myrtaceae, Cupressaceae). Days with medically relevant pollen and spore concentrations varied between years and we recorded the highest amount in 2017/2018 for Poaceae and Alternaria and in 2019/2020 for Myrtaceae. In addition, we found spatial and temporal variations of pollen deposition. However, we did not detect significant correlations between pollen deposition and land use, which can be attributable to drought conditions prior to the sampling campaign and the temporal setting in the pollen season. This study highlights the importance of continuous volumetric aerobiological monitoring as well as the assessment of pollen exposure at several locations across a large urban area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The investigation of bioaerosols in the recent years has become more important both indoors and outdoors. Due to expanding of livestock farm capacity, raising attention is paid to this source of emissions. The objective of the present study was to estimate the distribution of bioaerosols in the animal husbandry and its surroundings. Over 2 fattening periods with different animal ages and weights, the main emphasis was put on the total concentrations of mesophilic bacteria and Staphylococcus spp., especially the species S. aureus . The bioaerosols were sucked in with an AGI-30 Impinger, and nasal and neck skinfold swab samples were collected supplementary from randomly selected pigs. From the first series of measurements, the total concentration of mesophilic bacteria was 6.2 × 10 5 cfu/m 3 and dropped to 2.6 × 10 5 cfu/m 3 with increasing growth of the swine. The concentration of Staphylococcus spp. was 8.8 × 10 4 cfu/m 3 and decreased to 9.4 × 10 3 cfu/m 3 by the end. In the empty barn, the total concentration of mesophilic bacteria was 9.1 × 10 4 cfu/m 3 and for Staphylococcus spp., 1.1 × 10 4 cfu/m 3 . At the beginning of the second series of measurements, the total concentration of mesophilic bacteria was 6.6 × 10 4 cfu/m 3 and dropped to 4.4 × 10 4 cfu/m 3 with the increasing growth of the piglets. The concentrations of Staphylococcus spp. fluctuated along the second measurement series. The species Staphylococcus aureus was detected in nasal swabs of selected swine including MRSA. Temperature and humidity had no influence on the concentrations of mesophilic bacteria in the swine barn.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we have compared time series of pollen concentration originating from two Hirst-type volumetric samplers that were equipped with different sampling heads. To collect airborne pollen, we have used classic sampler with mobile sampling head including wind vane and adapted sampler with fixed sampling head having two-layered inlet, like in Sigma-2 passive sampler. The devices were placed at the roof level, on the top of the building of the Faculty of Sciences located in Novi Sad, Serbia. The sampling of airborne pollen was performed from February until October 2019. Along with the pollen data, meteorological conditions were recorded with an automated weather station measuring solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation. Time series of daily pollen concentrations expressed high correlations, although there were large differences on the hourly basis. Absolute difference between hourly values showed very weak correlation with relevant meteorological parameters: temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy, leading to the conclusion that sampling with both heads was not affected by meteorological conditions. Counting the pollen grains from the whole sample and not just from 10% of the area, which is the minimum requirement, was done for the six days in the season and proved that error introduced by subsampling during analysis was the main reason for differences in time series. To conclude, replacing mobile sampling head with fixed sampling head having two-layered inlet does not notably affect the quantity of pollen recorded by the Hirst-type volumetric method.",

    "abstract": "Greenhouses are a well-accepted containment strategy to grow and study genetically modified plants (GM) before release into the environment. Various containment levels are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, which can be used for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the roof windows, since the turbulent airflow around the mesh wiring could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Loliummultiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod(®) pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse' roof windows. A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through roof windows. Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to determine if the annual pollen integral (APIn) for the top tree allergens in the City of Albuquerque is correlated with meteorological variables. This analysis would be the first of its kind for this area. We used 17 consecutive years from 2004 to 2020 and data collected by the city of Albuquerque using a Spore Trap (Burkard) volumetric air sampler in a location designed to represent a typical desert environment. The pollen studied include Juniper, Elm, Ash, Cottonwood, and Mulberry. We found a negative linear correlation with early summer temperatures of the previous year and APIn for Elm, Cottonwood, and Mulberry, and early fall temperatures for Juniper. Linear regression models developed for Elm, Cottonwood, and Mulberry used the monthly mean maximum temperature for the month of June of the prior year as the independent variable to yield a R squared statistic (R2) of 0.88, 0.91 and 0.78, respectively. For Juniper, the average monthly mean minimum temperature for the previous September and October served as the independent variable and yielded the R2 value of 0.80. We also observed a positive trend for the annual maximum temperature over time and a negative trend for the total APIn. Summers in New Mexico are hot and dry, and they may be getting hotter and drier because of climate change. Our analysis predicts that climate change in this area may lead to reduced allergies if temperatures continue to increase and if precipitation patterns remain the same.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerobiology could be used as complementary data or proxy for studying phenology, especially in species which usually are not long-distance transported, such as grasses. This 21-year aerobiological study took place in Évora (South Portugal), using a seven-day recording volumetric pollen trap with the aim of analysing the temporal trends of grass pollen seasons. To this end, data were statistically tested for correlation and regression to determine the features and temporal trends of pollen seasons. Main results show that Poaceae pollen has a high representation in pollen spectrum, 20% (min: 7%; max: 44%), with a long season starting in March and lasting till August/September or October. There was an overall, but not statistically significant trend, towards an increase in the annual pollen integral and peak values, and also an overall non-statistically significant trend towards an earlier start and later end of the pollen season. Main and high pollen seasons have been lasting longer, and the days with allergenic potential have been rising in line with the local temperature rising trend. It seems that grass pollen production is being aided by warmer temperatures and increased grassland areas in Alentejo region. This could promote the increase in annual pollen levels and in the number of high pollen days over the years. In clinical terms, it means that grass allergic patients are exposed to longer periods of airborne pollen and to higher counts over a longer time. The climate conditions projected for Alentejo region, including rising temperature, and the changes in local grassland areas may help to clarify the trends of grass pollen seasons in the next decades.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the relationship between flowering patterns and pollen dispersal is important in climate change modelling, pollen forecasting, forestry and agriculture. Enhanced understanding of this connection can be gained through detailed spatial and temporal flowering observations on a population level, combined with modelling simulating the dynamics. Species with large distribution ranges, long flowering seasons, high pollen production and naturally large populations can be used to illustrate these dynamics. Revealing and simulating species-specific demographic and stochastic elements in the flowering process will likely be important in determining when pollen release is likely to happen in flowering plants. Spatial and temporal dynamics of eight populations of Dactylis glomerata were collected over the course of two years to determine high-resolution demographic elements. Stochastic elements were accounted for using Markov chain approaches in order to evaluate tiller-specific contribution to overall population dynamics. Tiller-specific developmental dynamics were evaluated using three different RV matrix correlation coefficients. We found that the demographic patterns in population development were the same for all populations with key phenological events differing only by a few days over the course of the seasons. Many tillers transitioned very quickly from non-flowering to full flowering, a process that can be replicated with Markov chain modelling. Our novel approach demonstrates the identification and quantification of stochastic elements in the flowering process of D. glomerata , an element likely to be found in many flowering plants. The stochastic modelling approach can be used to develop detailed pollen release models for Dactylis , other grass species and probably other flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The conservation actions towards artworks holding a common patrimony for the community are of primary importance, but also those related to their \"container\" as museums, libraries or archives are to consider. Fungal spores and bacteria carried by air flows to the artwork surface can colonize it causing biodeterioration through physical and/or chemical alterations of the materials with the irreversible loss of their value. The quality control of the indoor air surrounding the historic building is essential, as well as for the protection and conservation of the artwork, also for the protection of the health of operators and visitors. The aim of this study was to monitor airborne fungal particles, through volumetric spore traps, for improving the knowledge about the conservation and protection of artworks in the museum environment analysing the principal relationships between indoor environmental conditions and potentially biodeteriogen fungal spore growth. The evidence of no significant relationships between spore concentrations and environmental conditions recorded inside the different expositive rooms testified the regular and correct maintenance of the air conditioning system inside the considered building (National Gallery of Umbria, central Italy). Moreover, in a specific museum room a significant spore concentration decreasing trend was recorded mainly due to a structural modification in the same building.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Airborne allergenic pollen affects a significant part of the population and the information on pollen load is a valuable tool for public health prevention. The messages should be provided in a form easily understandable for the population. The study provides new insight for the categorisation of pollen load by defining thresholds solely from aerobiological data. Using the long-term airborne pollen data of Corylus , Alnus , Betula , Poaceae, and Artemisia have been evaluated the regionality of pollen concentrations in Lithuania. SPIn and peak values of the main pollen season highlighted as regionality indicators. The largest differences between stations were found in the cases of Corylus and Artemisia . The principle enabling a group of pollen concentrations into levels has been analysed based on retrospective aerobiological data of five pollen types. Thresholds were determined by employing the lowest peak value of the pollen season and applying the 25% principle for selected pollen types. The results were verified by performing associations of defined thresholds with retrospective morbidity data of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma in Lithuania. Determined pollen thresholds can be used in epidemiological studies requiring associations with pollen concentration. Thresholds could also complement air quality information by integrating pollen load data into public messages or contribute to the development of mHealth systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study's main objective was to specify the extent to which weather conditions were related to the course of birch pollen seasons in the years 1997–2020. The impact of atmospheric conditions on the daily concentrations of birch pollen grains, the Annual pollen integral (APIn), and the length of pollen seasons were studied. The dependency between each meteorological condition and various features of the birch pollen season was determined using Spearman’s rho correlation, the Kruskal–Wallis test, and cluster analysis with the k-means method. It has been shown that the duration of sunshine and average air temperature occurring within 14 days preceding the season has the most significant influence on the beginning of a birch pollen season. The value of daily birch pollen concentrations in Sosnowiec showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the duration of sunlight and the average and maximum wind speed. The daily concentration also depended on the synoptic situation: the mass airflow direction, the type of air mass inflow, and the type of weather front. The near-ground temperature influenced the APIn of birch pollen grains during the period of 14 days before the beginning of the season and the meteorological conditions occurring in the summer of the preceding year such as the maximum temperature, duration of sunlight, the maximum and average wind speed, and the relative air humidity. It was concluded that the length of birch pollen seasons decreased year by year.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Honeydew extracted by aphids serves as nutrient for the development of sooty moulds. Hypothetically, population dynamics of aphids should therefore have an effect on the airborne levels of the spores of fungi colonizing honeydew. In this study, the effects of seven aphid taxa on Alternaria and Cladosporium spore seasons (both pathogenic and allergenic fungi) were analysed on a total of 20-year-long dataset in Kecskemét (Hungary), Leicester (UK) and Poznań (Poland). Meteorological factors strongly effected both aphid and fungal populations. In most cases, a direct effect of weather on fungal levels were found. Direct effect of two aphid species, Acyrthosiphon pisum and Euceraphis punctipennis, on the atmospheric concentration of Alternaria spores was identified in Leicester and Poznań in June and July respectively. Other aphid species had secondary, but significant effects during other time periods. This suggests aphid population data can be informative in predicting airborne concentrations of Alternaria and Cladosporium spores. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of this study was to compare hazel pollen seasons in Sosnowiec in 1997–2019 and to analyse the impact of weather conditions on these seasons. The measurements were conducted using a volumetric method with a Burkard spore trap. The duration of pollen seasons was determined using the 98% method. SPI (Seasonal Pollen Index) was calculated as the sum of daily pollen concentrations in a given season. The measurements showed that high temperatures in January and February had an impact on the beginning of the hazel pollen season. They revealed that there are positive correlations with temperatures and sunshine hours long before the season, i.e. 210–180 days before. The daily hazel pollen concentration in Sosnowiec showed a positive and statistically significant correlation with air temperature, sunshine hours, and average and maximum wind speed. Negative correlation was demonstrated for snow cover depth and relative humidity of the air. Daily concentration levels depend also on the type of weather front as well as direction of air mass flow and its type. Variance analysis showed that the highest concentrations of hazel pollen grains were recorded when warm air moves from the south and south–western direction, whereas the lowest ones were noted for air moving from the east, south–east, north and north–east directions. Atmospheric precipitation, snow cover depth, and average, maximum, minimum and near-the-ground temperatures in the season also had an impact on the SPI of hazel pollen grains. High positive correlation coefficients were also observed in the case of thermal conditions, sunshine hours, relative humidity and precipitation from July to September in the year preceding a given pollen season. The duration of the hazel pollen season depends on precipitation, snow cover depth and temperature during a given season.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 presence and the bacterial community profile in air samples collected at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Operational Unit of Infectious Diseases of Santa Caterina Novella Hospital in Galatina (Lecce, Italy) have been evaluated in this study. Air samplings were performed in different rooms of the ICU ward with and without COVID-19 patients. No sample was found positive to SARS-CoV-2, according to Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay. The airborne bacterial community profiles determined by the 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach up to the species level were characterized by richness and biodiversity indices, Spearman correlation coefficients, and Principal Coordinate Analysis. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species, also detected in outdoor air samples, were found in all collected indoor samples. Staphylococcus pettenkoferi, Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, and others coagulase-negative staphylococci, detected at high relative abundances in all the patients' rooms, were the most abundant pathogenic species. The highest mean relative abundance of S. pettenkoferi and C. tuberculostearicum suggested that they were likely the main pathogens of COVID-19 patients at the ICU ward of this study. The identification of nosocomial pathogens representing potential patients' risks in ICU COVID-19 rooms and the still controversial airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 are the main contributions of this study.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10453-022-09754-7.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ramularia leaf spot is a major economic disease of barley caused by the dothidiomycete fungus Ramularia collo-cygni. The fungus has a complex life cycle which includes extensive late season spore release events and a seed-borne phase. Predicting disease epidemics during the growing season remains a difficult challenge. To better understand the interaction between spore movement and disease epidemics, spore samplers were set up in Germany (2 sites over 4 years), Poland (7 sites over 2 years) and the UK (2 sites over 9 years), where the disease has been observed. Spore concentrations were determined using a real-time PCR assay, and meteorological data were obtained from co-located automatic stations. Spore release events were seen to peak in June on mainland Europe and July in the UK. The pattern of spore release was broadly similar across countries with earlier peaks in mainland Europe. A relationship was observed in the UK between July spore levels and disease in following winter barley crops. Rainfall and temperature were proposed as significant drivers of spore release in these months. The major environmental parameter associated with spore release across the two UK sites was crop surface wetness, although some site-specific interactions were noted for rainfall and wind movement. Regression analysis of spore patterns and disease epidemics indicates a relationship between spore levels 75 and 105 days pre-harvest and final disease levels in UK winter barley crops. This relationship was not observed in spring barley. The implications on risk forecasts are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last decade, a great deal of research has focused on the determination of potential toxic elements by total concentration and identification the microorganisms in dust. However, determining bio-relevant (e.g., inhalable) forms of elements instead of total contents in acids is necessary for human health. Moreover, examination of the behavior of microorganism under these bio-relevant conditions and revealing the interaction between elements and pathogens is vital and necessary for deeper understanding. However, previous studies have ignored these topics. Therefore, the present study aimed to (i) investigate elements in household dusts extracted in simulated lung fluids, (ii) examine the total concentration of culturable bacteria and their biochemical responses with exposure to bio-fractions of household dusts, and (iii) assess their relations and risks using the model approaches by inhalation. Here, settled dusts were collected in 25 houses, and extracted in four simulated body fluids to determine bio-fractions of elements. Moreover, total count of potentially pathogenic and heterotrophic bacteria, and four clinically important culturable pathogens were incubated in the presence of household-dusts extracted in simulated body fluids. The activity, biofilm, biochemical and oxidative responses of pathogens were measured following household-dust exposures. Afterward, the relationship between elements and pathogen responses were evaluated, and model and derived approaches were used for risk assessments of elements and pathogens. The higher daily intake of elements obtained in artificial lysosomal fluid fraction of household dust mimicking the inflammatory condition compared to other body fluids. Moreover, bacterial responses were mainly influenced from bio-fractions of household dusts and their elemental contents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The allergenic nature of ash ( Fraxinus sp.), an important element of the dehesas, has been poorly studied in meridional Europe owing to the low concentrations of this pollen type in the atmosphere. However, it has cross-reactivity with Olea L. and other homologous allergens of trees and herbaceous species, leading to earlier and more prolonged respiratory allergenic symptoms. The main aims of this work were to characterize the main pollen season (MPS) of ash from 2011 to 2022, to evaluate the influence of meteorological variables on airborne concentrations of this pollen type and to elaborate a pollen calendar for Fraxinus in Salamanca. The aeropalynological analysis for the eleven years of the study shows that the MPS for Fraxinus begins on 27 th December until 4 th April with an average duration of 100 days, a mean peak value of 57 grains/m 3 reached on 22 nd February and a mean annual pollen integral of 567 grains/m 3 , observing an earlier onset of MPS, an increase in its duration and a decrease in its concentrations, presumably linked to climate change. Regarding the influence of meteorological parameters on pollen concentrations, positive correlations were found for maximum and mean temperatures and insolation, as well as southeast winds and frequency of calms, while negative correlations were reported for precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed. The analyze of Fraxinus pollen could be used to predict seasonal behavior and warn people who may suffer pollinosis either from ash pollen or from cross-reactivity events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inhalation of olive pollen ( Olea europaea L.) is one of the main causes of allergy in Mediterranean countries and some areas of North America. The response to allergens consists in the production of inflammatory cytokines which is mediated by the deregulation of Ca 2+ signals. In this study, the biological activity of the material released in olive pollen hydration (PMR) was tested on Ca 2+ cytosolic of PE/CA-PJ15 cells (PJ-15). Ca 2+ cytosolic was determined by fluorometric assay with the cell line PE/CA-PJ15 (PJ-15) labeled with the fluorescent probe FURA 2 AM. The material released in olive pollen hydration (PMR) was analyzed by HPLC for the determination of phenolic acids. PMR was subjected to fractionation by gel filtration, and the fractions with Ca 2+ -chelating activity were tested with SDS-PAGE and the single bands characterized by proteomic analysis. PMR showed high Ca 2+ -chelating activity and is able of blocking the increase Ca 2+ -cytosolic produced by thapsigargin (TG). PMR then restored Ca 2+ homeostasis in PJ-15 cells deregulated by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPases inhibitor. It is therefore possible that PMR can antagonize the effects of allergens on Ca 2+ cytosolic. The analytical characterization of the material released by the pollen highlighted in the pollen allergen Ole e 3 and in the p-coumaric acid the possible culprits of the Ca 2+ -antagonist activity of PMR. Furthermore, the sequence of Ole e 3 could provide information for the possible construction of a synthetic peptide to be used in an allergy-targeted Ca 2+ -antagonist therapy.",
