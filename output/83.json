    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years response surface analysis has been increasingly used to optimise membrane separation. It has many advantages, such as reducing the number of experiments to be performed, which requires lower energy consumption and significantly less laboratory work. For more accurate data analysis and forecasting, mathematical models are used that analyse the relevance of the factors examined and the interaction effects between the factors. In this research, two experimental designs that use response surface methodology are presented, namely, the central composite design and the Box–Behnken design. After the general characterisation of the experimental designs, their application in membrane technology is presented.",

    "abstract": "Vegetables are the major source of dietary nitrate, with wide variations in nitrate content. The presence of nitrate in vegetables is often associated with harmful effects on human health, i.e. with toxic effects of methaemoglobinaemia and the possibility of causing an endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. However, it is also associated with beneficial health effects, since nitrate represent an important alternative pathway to bioactive NO and its important physiological roles in vascular and immune function. In this review the concentrations of nitrate in different vegetables from different countries are given. Furthermore, the reasons for the different contents of nitrate in vegetables, the daily intakes and comparisons to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values, legislation, metabolism and toxicology of nitrate are described as well as harmful and beneficial effects of nitrate on human health.",

    "abstract": "In present study, water extract of cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) (WECM) was studied for antioxidant properties. The antioxidant properties of WECM were evaluated using different antioxidant tests, including reducing power, free radical scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and metal chelating activities. These properties may be the major reason for the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The concentration of 20, 40 and 60 µg ml-1 of WECM showed 75.8, 93.4 and 97.5% inhibition on peroxidation of linoleic acid emulsion, respectively. On the other hand, 60 µg ml-1 of standard antioxidants such as BHA, BHT and a-tocopherol exhibited 96.5, 99.2 and 61.1% inhibition on peroxidation of linoleic acid emulsion, respectively. In addition, the WECM had effective reducing power, free radical scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and metal chelating activities at the same concentrations (20, 40, and 60 µg ml-1). Those various antioxidant activities were compared to reference antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and a -tocopherol. In addition, total phenolic compounds in the WECM were determinedas gallic acid equivalent.",

A shift has recently been observed in the presence of aflatoxin producer Aspergillus spp. in Europe, with consequent aflatoxin contamination in agricultural commodities including maize in several European countries that have not faced with this problem before, including, e.g. Northern Italy, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia and Romania. Although aflatoxin contamination of agricultural products including maize is not treated as a serious threat to Hungarian agriculture due to climatic conditions, these observations led us to examine the mycobiota of maize kernels collected from Hungarian maize fields. Using a calmodulin sequence-based approach, A. flavus isolates have been identified in 63.5% of the maize fields examined in 2009 and 2010, and 18.8% of these isolates were found to be able to produce aflatoxins above 5 μg kg−1 on maize kernels as determined by ELISA, HPLC-FL, HPLC-MS analyses and SOS-Chromotest. These data indicate that aflatoxin producing Aspergilli are present in Hungarian agricultural fields, consequently climate change with elevated temperatures could lead to aflatoxin contamination of Hungarian agricultural products, too.",

Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined using Rel Assay kits. Antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were determined against the test microorganisms using the agar dilution method. Antiproliferative activity was tested on the lung cancer cell line A549. As a result of the studies, it has been determined that the plant species have high antioxidant potential. In addition, it was observed that the antifungal potentials of plant extracts are high. Antiproliferative activity was determined to be at high level in both plant species. As a result, it has been determined that A. acutifolius and A. officinalis have medical potential and can be used as natural agents in pharmacological designs.",

Earliness, total yield, fruit weight and number of each graft combination were recorded. Moreover, the main fruit components such as Brix°, carbohydrate, acid and the carbohydrate/acid ratio were analysed. We harvested more yield from the grafted plants. The increase of yield was mainly caused by higher average fruit weight. Brix° and carbohydrate content were lower in the fruits on grafted plants than on ungrafted ones but there was no significant difference in acid content.",

In order to explore the nutritional potential, major nutrient composition, mineral composition, antioxidant capacity, total phenols content (related to the antioxidant capacity) and dietary fibre content were determined. The effects of decortication on these components were examined. In addition, protein profile of the varieties and amylose/amylopectin ratio of the starch were examined. The range of the values measured for major nutrient composition corresponds with data of other millet species published in earlier studies. Remarkable differences were found among the protein contents of the varieties (11.58–14.80%). Although the concentration of minerals was low in the varieties examined, in comparison with other cereals wholegrain millet seems to be nutritionally valuable because of their high dietary fibre content. Decortication had no effect on the protein and fat content of millets, however, it significantly decreased the content of crude fibre, dietary fibre, minerals, total phenols content and antioxidant capacity. Consequently the applicability of millets as functional food decreases. Decortication had no effect on the amylose/amylopectin ratio of millet. No varietal differences were found in terms of protein characteristics.",

Fermentation and germination are deemed simple, accessible, and sustainable ways to improve the nutritional composition of legumes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of spontaneous fermentation and germination on the antinutrients and iron levels of several legumes, consisting of soybean, kidney bean, and mung bean. Each legume type underwent spontaneous fermentation through soaking for 72 h and germination for 72 h, followed by milling to obtain their flours. The results indicated that spontaneous fermentation and germination could effectively reduce all legumes' tannin and phytic acid contents. However, while spontaneous fermentation increased iron content in all legume types, germination decreased iron content in soybean and kidney bean flours. This study has revealed that spontaneous fermentation served as the most effective method to reduce antinutrients and enhance iron levels in legumes. Therefore, this study is expected to support the fulfilment of the body's iron needs through legume's simple processing methods, such as spontaneous fermentation.",

Media containing different mixtures of carbohydrates were chosen as model fermenting media for monitoring lactic acid concentration by infrared spectroscopy, due to the fact that vegetable and animal food matrices could contain different carbohydrates as carbon sources. Three different types of media were obtained by adding different carbohydrates to a basic MRS medium. HPLC was used as reference method for lactic acid quantification. The calibration set (n=36) was used for building model, while a validation set (n=13) for testing the robustness of the developed model.

Except for a recent EFSA opinion on the safety of insects as food, the European law is not conclusive regarding using insects as food products. Insects may be associated with microorganisms, but the prevalence of pathogens is usually lower than in case of other animal proteins. Insect proteins can induce allergic reactions, but only few studies are available on allergic reactions due to insect ingestion, and direct hypersensitivity to insect protein has not been proven. Some insect species are considered toxic, because some toxic substances are accumulated from toxic plants or are synthesized by the insects. However, there are few reports available about adverse reactions caused by insect consumption. Insects and insect derived food products may contain hazardous chemicals such as heavy metals, dioxins, mycotoxins, plant toxins, biocides, and veterinary drugs. However, data on hazardous chemicals in reared insects and accumulation of chemical contaminants from the substrates are limited. This review is not demonstrating the safety of insects as a food category, but the possibility of insects for human consumption with no more hazards than other animal products.",

    "abstract": "Cultivated mushrooms are not only valuable foods of our age (functional foods) but contain certain beneficial chemical components (high level of K and P, very low content of Na, considerable quantities of some microelements, high and valuable protein but low fat contents). Some cultivated mushrooms have anti-carcinogenic effects caused first of all by polysaccharides (Lentinan: Lentinula edodes ) and by triterpenoids (ganoderic acids: Ganoderma lucidum or unsaturated fatty acids: linoleic, linolenic acids); antidiabetic effects, which can improve the sugar metabolism of patients ( Coprinus comatus, Ganoderma lucidum, Agaricus bisporus ); anti-microbial effects, caused partly by smaller triterpenoids or by higher molecules, i.e. by direct or indirect effects: via stimulation of the immune system. Certain mushrooms have antioxidant effects, provided mostly by higher radical scavenging activity of phenolic (flavonoid) components. The chemical composition and its biological effects form together the biological values of the cultivated mushrooms. The following review would like to summarize the most important facts of this topic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, and less known, canihua are the most important pseudocereals. Their high nutritional value is well recognized and they are increasingly used for the development of a wide range of starch-based foods, which has been fostered by intensified research data performed in recent years. In addition to health driven motivations, also environmental aspects like the ongoing climate change are an important stimulus to increase agricultural biodiversity again. As pseudocereals are botanically classified as dicotyledonous plants their chemical, physical and processing properties differ significantly from the monocotyledonous cereals. Most important factors that need to be addressed for processing is their smaller seed kernel size, their specific starch structure and granule architecture, their gluten-free protein, but also their dietary fibre and secondary plant metabolites composition. This review gives a condensed overview of the recent developments and gained knowledge with special attention to the technological and food processing aspects of these pseudocereals.",

    "abstract": "Screening of microorganisms capable of producing the enzyme fructosyltransferase (FTase) that could be used for the production of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) led to the isolation of a strain of Aspergillus niger. The fungus produced extracellular FTase in both submerged fermentation (SmF) using chemically-defined medium, and solid state fermentation (SSF) using agricultural by-products such as kola nut pod and ripe plantain peel. Maximum enzyme activity of 24.49 Uml−1 was obtained in SmF after 48 h of fermentation, while maximum enzyme activities of 20.77 and 27.77 U g−1 were obtained in SSF using ripe plantain peel and kola nut pod, respectively. The enzyme was used to prepare fructooligosaccharides (FOS), with the maximum yield of 33.24% FOS, consisting of kestose and nystose produced by FTase of kola nut pod fermentation.The safety of prepared FOS was investigated using albino rats. The rats were grouped and fed orally with 2500 mg kg−1 bw/day of FOS, 5000 mg kg−1 bw/day FOS, 2500 mg kg−1 bw/day of honey and 2500 mg kg−1 bw/day of 60% sucrose, respectively, for a period of 30 days. Their effects on haemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, differential count, blood glucose, protein, albumin, cholesterol, and histopathology of some organs were studied. The mean body weight (male rat) ranged between 161.80±22.37 to 196.00±16.50 g, while for female it ranged between 130.80±8.64 to 176.00±4.36 g. All haematological and blood chemistry parameters examined were normal, except for blood glucose which was higher in male/female rats fed with 60% sucrose. No histopathology changes were observed.From this study, it can be concluded that the studied strain of A. niger can utilize agro wastes, such as kola nut pod and ripe plantain peel for the production of FTase. The prepared FOS may be considered safe for consumption as alternative sweetener to sucrose, as it does not produce any pathological effect in the animals. It promoted good health in the experimental albino rat as seen in the haematology, blood chemistry and histopathology reports.",

The oxidative stress was generated by 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) or CuSO4; the increase of the concentration of peroxidation products was monitored using fluorescence probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The antioxidant activity of tested substances depends on the form of the antioxidant (aglycone, glycoside), its concentration, localization in the emulsion, and the factors generating oxidative stress. The synergistic effect occurred when the effectiveness of individual antioxidant was relatively weak and mainly when the concentration of antioxidants was in the physiologically significant range of 1 μM. We suggest that tocotrienols were regenerated by flavonoids. The synergism benefitted from the proximity of the localization of interacting antioxidants (e.g. the presence of one of the antioxidants at the oil-water interface).",

The consumption of foodstuffs, daily energy- and nutrient intakes, nutritional habits and dietary supplement usage of Hungarian population was assessed. The complex system has included three-day dietary record and a food consumption frequency questionnaire. Some anthropometric parameters were also self-recorded. According to the body mass index, a considerable proportion of both the 31–60 years old males (69%) and females (46%) were overweight or obese. The energy intake of the Hungarian adult population is slightly exceeds the recommendation. The intake of proteins is satisfactory in general. The average intake of total fats is very high (36.1–38.9 energy percent), and the fatty acid composition — mostly the ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids — is unfavourable, but the fatty acid pattern regarding saturated- (SFA), mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acid ratio shows favourable tendency. The proportion of complex carbohydrates within the intake of energy providing macronutrients is far lower than the optimal level, but it is a positive finding that added sugar intake is below the outmost recommendation. The average daily cholesterol intake is high (males: 469 mg, females: 335 mg), whilst the dietary fibre intake is lower than the recommended. The article provides data on alcohol, caffeine and fibre consumption, too.",

    "abstract": "For prevention of non-infectious diseases such as cancer, and cardiovascular disorders consumption of more and more fruits and vegetables is highly advised. Fruits of Ribes and Rubus species are very popular in Hungary. Antioxidant properties of these fruits are well known, but the values of the characteristics depend on several factors including species, cultivars, soil and climate conditions, water and nutrition supply, and so on. Phenolics in several cultivars of raspberry, blackberry and currants grown in Hungary were measured. Total polyphenols and anthocyanins were detected by spectrophotometric methods while flavonoids including apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and also ellagic acid were quantified by RP-HPLC technique. Total polyphenol contents of raspberry (yellow and red cultivars), blackberry and currants (white, red and black cultivars) were 219, 244, 379, 333, 192 and 533 mg/100 g, respectively. The concentrations of anthocyanins in the same order were 1.0, 41.9, 145, 0.2, 46 and 354 mg/100 g. Apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol could not been detected in any of the samples. Ellagic acid (2.0 to 23.7 mg/100 g) could be measured in white and red raspberries, in blackberries, and in some red and white currant cultivars. Quercetin could be detected in all berry species ranging from 0.1 to 14.4 mg/100 g. Measurable amount of myricetin was observed only in black currant cultivars between 1.5 and 7.7 mg/100 g. Polyphenols including flavonoids and anthocyanins in berry fruits are important forms of natural antioxidants. These molecules play essential role in the prevention of diseases in the pathomechanism of which free radicals are involved. Berry fruits are good sources of antioxidants consumed either in fresh or in processed forms because of great susceptibility of polyphenols to heat and other physicochemical processes.",

Extraction yield, total phenolic content (TPC), total concentrated tannin (TCT), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were determined at experimental points. As a result of the optimisation process, optimum parameter values were found at 34.8 °C temperature, 6.5 min time and 116.3 W ultrasonic power. Under optimum conditions, the extraction efficiency was 13.16%, TPC 103.09 mg GAE/g, TCT 13.29 mg CE/g, FRAP 602.14 mg TEAC/g, and ABTS 624.51 mg TEAC/g activity results were obtained. The extracts obtained showed low in vitro toxicity against healthy cell lines (HEK-293, human embryonic kidney), proliferation of CaCo-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) and MIA PaCa-2 (human pancreatic adenocarcinoma) cancer cells was significantly reduced. It was also determined that this extract has lower activity against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated AChE (acetylcholinesterase)-BChE (butyrylcholinesterase) than diabetes disease associated ɑ-glucosidase and ɑ-amylase. The extracts also showed significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus , Listeria monocytogenes , Salmonella Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are the most significant disinfectants utilised to control the contamination of Staphylococcus aureus in food establishments. S. aureus is a significant pathogen that carries genes responsible for resistance to QACs, which pose a risk to public health and food safety. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of QAC genes (qac A/B, qac C, qac G, qac H, qac J, and smr ) and benzalkonium minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in S. aureus strains isolated from food products and food production facilities ( n = 200). The analysis results indicated that the qac C gene was the most frequently detected, with a prevalence of 12%. The qac A/B, qac G, qac H, qac J, and smr genes were identified at frequencies of 2%, 3%, 1%, 4.5%, and 5%, respectively. The highest MIC level was identified in the surface sample, which carried the qac G gene, at a concentration of 6.25 μg mL −1 . The study's results highlight the potential risks associated with disinfectant resistance in food establishments. To prevent the transfer of disinfectant resistance genes, which have become a global risk, it is imperative that the rules of disinfectant usage are observed rigorously and that scientific research in this field is diversified.",

To overcome its hydrophobic nature, insolubility in water, and degradation of free essential oils, liposomal encapsulation can be applied. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of free as well as liposomal rosemary essential oils (REO) were measured using disk diffusion and serial dilution method for Escherichia ( E. ) coli, Staphylococcus ( S. ) aureus, Salmonella ( S. ) enterica, Lactiplantibacillus ( L. ) plantarum, Aspergillus ( A. ) niger, and Saccharomyces ( S. ) cerevisiae . The antimicrobial properties of free and encapsulated essential oils were compared with sodium benzoate during thirty days of storage. Also, the release pattern of REO from liposomes was studied using dialysis membranes during the 30 days of storage. The results showed that the MIC of free and encapsulated REO is in the range of 3.5–5% and 5–6.5%, respectively. Gram+ Staphylococcus aureus was identified as the most sensitive, while Escherichia coli was the most resistant among the tested microorganisms to the essential oils. During refrigerated storage, free REO and sodium benzoate did not show any significant difference in antimicrobial properties ( P &gt; 0.05), while encapsulated REO significantly reduced the number of microorganisms in stored salad dressing ( P ≤ 0.05).",

Recurrent infections frequently arise from biofilm-forming bacteria. This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oak honey, honeycomb capping, and propolis against certain biofilm-associated and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The total phenolic content (TPC) values for propolis, honeycomb capping, and oak honey samples were 298, 128, and 72 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g, respectively. Oak honey showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value (&lt;0.08%) against the strong biofilm of non- bla CTX-M Serratia fonticola -1. Propolis had the lowest MIC value (&lt;0.03%) against the weak biofilm of bla CTX-M positive Citrobacter braakii , and the moderate biofilm of non- bla CTX-M S. fonticola -2. The MIC values of all bee products showed a significant decrease upon interaction with 1% boric acid for all strains. Moreover, propolis has shown the ability to reduce 96% of the biofilm biomass of Citrobacter braaki after 24 h. The results show that bee products, used for medicinal purposes since ancient times, have emerged as a viable alternative against environmental pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oleogels are semi-solid systems formed by different gelators through gelation processes to reduce fat content and saturated fatty acids of structured oil types. The objective is to assess the effect of hydrocolloids' type (xanthan, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, locust bean gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, guar, gum arabic, and carrageenan) on corn oil organogels' properties. Hydrocolloid solutions had non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behaviour. The locust bean gum had the lowest (0.02 Pa s) and the guar had the highest (264.8 Pa s) consistency coefficient. Hydrocolloids exhibited one endothermic transition peak within 88.7–114.5 °C. The highest (2813.4 J g −1 ) and lowest (1082.0 J g −1 ) melting enthalpies were measured for carboxymethyl cellulose and guar, respectively. Corn oil oleogel with arabic gum had the strongest viscoelastic properties. The yielded locust bean gum oleogel was of the lowest gel firmness (0.08 N) and highest oil release (88.7%). The oleogel produced with arabic gum required higher melting enthalpy (79.2 J g −1 ). The FTIR spectra revealed that the gel network formed due to the physical entanglements was stabilised by non-covalent interactions. The diffraction patterns of XRD indicate that using guar, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, xanthan, and carrageenan were more practical in producing oleogel with β′ polymorph crystals compared to gum arabic and locust bean gum. A change in the microstructure and appearance of the oleogels was observed when different hydrocolloids were used. The characterisation of oleogels demonstrated that the type of hydrocolloids had a key role in the oil–polymer interactions, and consequently in the network features and oleogel properties. Locust bean gum as a gelator with the weakest viscoelastic properties and melting temperature was not appropriate for oleogelation. Prepared oleogels with gum arabic and xanthan had suitable oil-binding capacity, firmness, and viscoelastic properties for pioneering applications in food products, where low saturated and trans fatty acids are sought.",

In addition to the reduction of blood cholesterol by soluble viscous dietary fibre, this risk is also reduced by antioxidative and fibrinolytic effects. Attenuating levels and fluctuations of blood glucose and insulin have interest not only for diabetic people, but also for improving endurance in sports or physical work, and because of the multitude of physiological effects of insulin as well. Dietary fibre is also in a key position in weight control due to its effect on satiety. New data on the effects of fibre on the intestinal function have shown advantages of soluble fibre sources, partly due to their ability to support selectively the growth of beneficial bacteria, and partly by alleviating constipation. Both soluble and insoluble fibres have effects which reduce risks of cancers, not only colorectal cancer. In applications, the trend is now towards a more specific use of the different types and sources of dietary fibre.",

A two-step protocol was followed: the tomato peels were first treated with enzymes and then extracted by the use of acetone as a solvent for 30 min at 20±1 °C and solid/liquid ratio of 1:30. The total carotenoid, lycopene, and β-carotene extraction yields were increased by the use of pectinase, cellulase, endo-xylanase, and proteinase enzymes in comparison with the non-enzyme-treated samples. The increase in the extraction yield was affected by the enzymes used, the enzyme concentration, the pretreatment time and temperature. Maximum total carotenoid (55.15 mg/100 g d.w.), β-carotene (35.85 mg/100 g d.w.), and lycopene (15.44 mg/100 g d.w.) extraction yields were obtained in peels pretreated with mixed cellulase (100 U g −1 ) and endo-xylanase (400 U g −1 ) for 4 h at 50 °C.

Total phenolic content ranged between 20.00–124.10 mg GAE/100 g and 103–232 mg GAE/g for honey and raw propolis samples, respectively. Pine and oak honeydew honeys had higher antimicrobial activity than four diﬀerent grades of Manuka Honeys up to 18 mm minimum inhibition zone diameters. The ethanolic propolis extracts showed much higher antimicrobial activity than the honey samples. Fungi species were inhibited by the propolis samples. Helicobacter pylorii ( H. pylorii ) was the most sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae was the most resistant bacteria among the studied microorganisms. Brazilian and Zonguldak propolis had the closest antimicrobial activity to ampicillin, streptomycin, and ﬂuconazole. It can be concluded that both honey and propolis could be used in preservative and complementary medicine.",

The possibility of constructing oleogel material in a manner similar to hydrocolloid gel has now been gradually becoming a reality. In this regard, this review provides coverage of the latest developments and applications of oleogels in terms of preparation strategies, physicochemical properties, health aspects, and potential food applications. Both solid fat content and crystallisation behaviour are discussed for oleogels fabricated by gelators and under different conditions. Oleogels could replace hydrogenated vegetable oils in food product, reduce the fatty acid content, and be used to prepare food products such as meat, ice-cream, chocolate, bread, and biscuits with desirable properties. The aims were to assess the formation mechanism, construction methods of oleogels and the advance on the application of oleogel structures in the food field, as well as the further exploration of oleogels and in complex food systems in the future.",

Also rosemary and Turkish sage essential oils showed strong inhibitory effects, then marjoram and Greek oregano. The extracts exhibited high antioxidant activity compared with the essential oils. It appears that there was a relationship between the effect and the chemical composition of both extracts and essential oils, suggesting mainly their phenolic compounds. Sumac, due to its great activity competitive with rosemary and sage, had certainly potential as a new source of antioxidant substance.",

In mature green stage the lowest acid content was detected but in subsequent stages it did not change significantly. Polyphenol content remained almost the same during ripening, thus there were not significant differences found among ripening stages. In case of lycopene content, there were great differences among maturity stages. Lycopene accumulated mainly during deep red stage. The antioxidant characteristic of tomato fruit expressed as total antioxidant status (TAS) showed significant linear correlation with lycopene, polyphenol and hydroxymethylfurfural content and increased continuously during ripening period. Marked correlation was observed between lycopene content and formation of hydroxymethylfurfural, as well.",

This mycotoxin is a common contaminant of various food products including cereal products, spices, dried fruits, coffee, beer and wine. Besides cereal products, beer and wine contribute significantly to ochratoxin exposure of humans. We examined the ochratoxin content of Hungarian wines and beers using an immunochemical technique. The detection limit of this technique is 0.01mg l-1. Altogether 65 wine and 25 beer samples were analysed. The presence of ochratoxin A was confirmed by HPLC in positive samples. Ochratoxin A was detected in 97.7% of wines, with ochratoxin concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.533mg l-1. The mean ochratoxin A concentration in wines was 0.110mg l-1. Only one of the Hungarian wines examined contained more than 0.5mg l-1ochratoxin A, the previously suggested EU limit for wine. Our data indicate that red wines are more frequently contaminated, and have higher mean ochratoxin contamination (0.117mg ml-1) than white wines (0.0967mg ml-1), in accordance with previous observations. A North-South gradient in wine ochratoxin concentrations is not evident from our data. For beers, all but one of the samples was found to be contaminated with small amounts of ochratoxin A with a mean concentration of 0.127mg l-1(range: 0.030-0.250mg l-1). Only one of the beers contained ochratoxin A above 0.2mg l-1, the anticipated European Community maximum allowable limit in beer. We could not detect correlation between the type and origin of beer and ochratoxin contamination.",

Near infrared spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance) measurement was performed on replicate meat samples in the wavelength range of 1000–1800 nm. Second derivative and multiplicative scatter correction were performed on the spectra as data pre-treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) were used for observation of discrimination of the samples due to loss of freshness and onset of bacterial spoilage as a function of the storage time. The percentage of correctly classified samples decreased somewhat by increasing the storage temperature. Partial least squares (PLS) chemometric model was developed to predict and quantify bacterial loads from the scatter corrected 2nd derivative spectra. PLS evaluation (predicted versus measured TAPC values) — when bacterial counts at all sampling days and storage temperatures were taken into account — resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.977, and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) 0.438 log colony forming units/g. These preliminary results indicate the potential of utilising near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical methods to monitor loss of freshness and detect bacterial spoilage of meat samples rapidly before deleterious microbial changes become apparent. However, much larger number of samples should be studied to ascertain properly the prediction power of the spectroscopic method.",

It was stated that incubation of the samples under static conditions is more effective than incubation with shaking. The releasing from 11 to 22% of initially binding toxin after three washing of biomass indicates the reversibility of bond between cells and toxins. The complex of killed cells-ochratoxin A is less firm than it is in case of viable biomass. Adsorption of toxin is closely related to the components of yeast’s cell wall.

    "abstract": "β-mannanases can degrade galactomannans to mannose and it has been used in various application areas. The aim of this study was to produce the β-mannanase from carob pod extract including different nitrogen sources. The best operation values for fermentation were determined to be 8% initial sugar concentration with 0.5% yeast extract, 100 r.p.m., and 7% inoculation rate, which yielded the maximum β-mannanase activity as 423.60 U ml –1 . Effects of nitrogen sources on β-mannanase activity were also studied and it reached 695.6 U ml −1 by using 0.5% of ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source at the determined optimum conditions. Results also showed that meat bone meal and soybean meal could be used as cost effective nitrogen sources based on achieved β-mannanase activity.",

    "abstract": "Skin-contact fermented white wines, the so-called orange or qvevri wines, have been gaining international attention from winemakers, importers, sommeliers, consumers, and journalists over the last 10 years. Sommeliers are now regularly pairing orange wines with fine cuisine. This new culinary trend is part of a general move by the consumer wishing to respect the existence of traditions and innovation, combined with a growing interest in environmental awareness and healthy options. Orange wines are made from white grapes using ancient Georgian techniques. The essence of this method is the long skin-contact fermentation in amphorae without any chemicals or specific yeast. In our work, the polyphenol content of orange wines, in particular total polyphenol and catechin content, as well as colour intensity were measured to ensure safe winemaking technology without oxidized components.",

Fresh and dried fruits were purchased in the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Total flavonoid content of fruits varied between 0–1000 mg kg –1, the average concentration was about 30 mg kg –1 fresh weight. Quercetin could be detected in most fruits, namely in apples, pear, plums, sweet and sour cherry and berries between 10–53 mg kg –1. Luteolin at a concentration of 20 mg kg –1 was found in melons, apples, kiwi and lemon. Myricetin was in detectable amount in redcurrant, and at very high concentration in some berry fruits (mulberry 453 mg kg –1, raspberry 540 mg kg –1, blackberry 636 mg kg –1, strawberry 994 mg kg –1), and in walnut (4565 mg kg –1). Kaempferol and apigenin were not found in the fruits investigated. None of the five flavonoids was found in some variety of grapes, in peach, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit and tangerine, in nuts such as almond, pistachio, nuts, and in dried fruits such as raisin, date, fig and prunes. These data provide a basis for the evaluation of the average daily intake of Hungarian population and for an epidemiological evaluation of health-promoting effects of flavonoids. __",

    "abstract": "The objectives of the study were twofold, i.e. to evaluate methodological approaches of analyzed papers and to identify, cluster, and classify barriers to HACCP system implementation using meta-analysis as methodological tool. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a science-based system of risk management designed to control food safety. HACCP is based on seven basic principles, which present an important tool in combating food borne disease. Articles for analysis were initially selected in the major on-line database for the field, namely \"Food Science and Technology Abstract\". Other databases were also used, including Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau and Co-operative Online Bibliographic System and Services. Selection was based on scientific excellence of the journal as well as on the method applied within the study. Main keywords to select appropriate scientific and technical articles were \"HACCP\", \"barrier\" and \"implementation\". Main results of methodological inquiry revealed that the most frequent methods used in scientific articles were quantitative ones. Among qualitative methods, the \"narrative interview\" was used most often, while among quantitative methods survey was used most frequently. Whereas narrative interview enables in-depth analysis of implicit role of individual actor in HACCP system, survey methods estimate frequency distributions of particular behaviours or attitudes in observed population. Lately, when analyzing implicit role of an individual in ensuring food safety, a psychological approach became important. The main goal of methodological analysis is to propose advances in research models that would tackle both qualitative and quantitative issues at the same time and offer new insights into barriers in HACCP system implementation. After analyzing the barriers to efficiency of the system, we identified elements that enabled us to cluster barriers into groups and identify the influence of specific elements on HACCP system efficiency. This paper is offering a novel approach to terminological classification of identified barriers, which will open new dimensions in assuring common language among food safety professionals in the future.",

Investigations were carried out on samples harvested in December 2004 and stored until the end of March 2005 under natural climate in prism, in cold store and also after over-wintering in the soil. Investigations were repeated in 2005 and 2006. According to the results of storage outdoors in prism and in cold store, the total-and soluble solid content, the total carbohydrate and inulin content (w/w) did not change significantly as a function of storage time. Changes in sucrose-and reducing sugar content and that of glucose/fructose ratio were also insignificant. There was no significant difference in the ratio of carbohydrates of the tubers stored under those two above-mentioned conditions, however, there was a significant difference in the carbohydrate composition of the tubers harvested in winter or in spring.Compared to the majority of vegetables, the main nutrient of Jerusalem artichoke tubers is inulin, instead of starch. Total carbohydrate content of the tubers is divided into 80–90% inulin, 7–14% sucrose and 3–6% reducing sugars, on average. Because of its high average yield and outstanding inulin content, this is a plant of great interest as raw material for inulin and fructose processing, as well.The cultivar \"Ceglédi\" is, first of all, suggested for industrial processing. The present research data verified its outstanding inulin content and a high fructose/glucose ratio, too.",

Measurements were carried out to determine enzymatic digestibility, water absorption, thermogravimetric parameters (DSC), and viscometric characteristics (RVA) of resistant and native starches and their mixtures. Enzymatic digestibility and water absorption were reduced linearly by adding resistant starches into the mixtures. RVA parameters have shown non-proportional character in the stoichiometric mixtures. The results of DSC measurements proved that the gelatinisation of resistant starches is quite different and only chemically modified resistant starch was heat-sensitive. Results indicated that circumspect evaluation is needed in the selection of resistant starch products for the development and innovation of food products with reduced glycaemic response.",

This review aims to collect data from molecular genetic studies on the structural and regulatory genes in grape, berries, citrus, pomes and stone fruits to get impression on the state of the art of this field of science. Results indicate that the expression of flavonoid genes is a genotype-dependent and developmentally regulated process. In addition, genetic alterations resulting in specific changes in flavonoid composition are also highlighted. Analysis of colour mutants of grape, bilberry and orange identified the genes responsible for the altered phenotype, and this strategy might offer valuable tools to identify several other candidate genes in different fruits. The application of such data is also discussed in relation with the development of molecular markers.",

Usually Aspergillus niger is cited as the causative agent based on morphological criteria. In this study, the mycobiota and fumonisin contamination of mouldy onion bulbs purchased in Hungary were examined. All except one of the examined mouldy samples were found to be contaminated with black Aspergilli, which could be isolated both from the outer dry and the inner fleshy scales of onion bulbs. Species assignment of the isolates was carried out using sequence analysis of part of the calmodulin gene. Sequence data revealed that all 35 black Aspergilli isolated from onions belong to the Aspergillus awamori species. The range of fumonisin isomers present in the onion samples was also examined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry. Two of the examined onion samples were found to be contaminated with fumonisins at a rate of about 0.3 mg kg−1. This is the first report on fumonisin contamination of onion bulbs. The fumonisin isomers observed include fumonisins B2–4, 3-epi-FB4, iso-FB1 (FB6) and an iso-FB2,3 form. The range of fumonisin isomers detected in the onion bulbs indicates that probably A. awamori is responsible both for mould rot and fumonisin contamination of onions in Hungary.",

It was observed that increasing the level of grapefruit powder in dough increased water absorption and dough development time, while dough stability and mixing tolerance index decreased. Physical characteristics of biscuits (specific volume, volume index, width, thickness, and spread ratio) significantly decreased with the increasing level of grapefruit powder in biscuits. Biscuits containing 5% of grapefruit powder were the most acceptable for assessors, higher levels of grapefruit powder in biscuits negatively affected overall acceptance presumably due to the high intensity of bitter taste and increased hardness of biscuits.",

    "abstract": "Jackfruit seed starch was annealed by single stage and double stage processes and characterised for changes in properties. Single-stage annealing gave higher crystalline order than double-stage annealed starch. No major change in the granular morphology was observed. Annealing resulted in notably altered pasting properties. Increased peak viscosity was indicative of molecular rigidity developed in the granules due to annealing. The increased thermal stability in DSC and specific peak sharpening in the XRD patterns of single-stage annealed starches indicated development of ‘site specific’ crystallinity. The new crystallites formed during the first stage of double-stage annealing were heat labile as crystallinity lowered after the second stage. Single stage annealed jackfruit seed starch can be used for noodle making.",

In the present study, an accelerated shelf-life testing by means of elevated temperatures 62, 72, and 82 °C was conducted to predict the oxidation stability of walnuts over a long-term storage. Peroxide value (PV) was employed to monitor the lipid oxidation progression in the walnuts. A range of 74.01–79.57 kJ mol−1 K−1 energy was required for formation of primary oxidation products. The reaction changes followed an apparent first-order kinetic. Formation of hydroperoxides in walnut kernels was found to be a temperature-dependent reaction with Q10 of 2.1. Walnut kernels were also kept in normal condition (temp: 20–30 °C; relative humidity (RH): 35–45%) for 12 months to validate the shelf-life estimation approach. The results showed that PV could provide a proper estimation for oxidative stability of the walnuts stored in ordinary condition.",

Significant differences were observed between the control and lactose-free milks with respect to coagulation time and texture profile. The first rupture time, the hardness, and the adhesion force of the lactose-free yoghurt were higher compared to the control product. We observed remarkable difference between the whey leakage of control and lactose free yoghurt samples (21.47% and 14.63%). Results coming from instrumental texture profile analyses showed that the preliminary lactose hydrolysis of milk resulted a firmer texture. It was confirmed by the results of sensory evaluation, and considering the texture and taste, there was significant difference between the control and lactose-free yoghurts.",

Pressurized Hot Water Extraction (PHWE) was first optimized with Response Surface Methodology in terms of maximized rebaudioside-A yield and minimized colour components. PHWE was then combined with pressing in a wine-press, resulting higher efficiency for extracting both steviol glycosides in comparison to the reported methods in the literature.

The most important factor in pasta processing is the quality of the flour. Millet ( Panicum miliaceum ) flour has high nutritional value, enriching it with cricket ( Gryllus bimaculatus) flour is good choice to increase the quality of protein composition and antioxidant properties of products. Flour mixtures of millet and insect flours (5% and 10%) were analysed after mixing and pasta processing. Addition of wheat gluten improved both texture and nutrition value of pasta products. Total polyphenol content, antioxidant capacity, total protein content, free and total amino acid composition were studied. Quality analysis of dried pasta products were carried out according to Hungarian standards. Data was analysed with Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's pair-wise post hoc test was used with Bonferroni correction. The correlation was determined by Spearman's rank. Addition of cricket flour modified the pH, acid value, moisture content, and colour of the samples, these changes lasted during storage. Enrichment could increase the total phenol content significantly even at the low level of 10%. Heat treatment during pasta processing had negative effect on the antioxidant capacity except at higher cricket flour contents. Cricket flour's high protein content proportionately increased millet flour's, thus pasta products'. Dried pasta products passed all quality norms. Enrichment of millet flour with cricket flour is favourable from both nutritional and quality aspects.",

Wild mustard ( Sinapis arvensis L.) collected from different regions was analysed for its phenolic, flavonoid, protein, and biological activity levels. In this case, the plant ethanol extract was obtained using a soxhlet apparatus. Rel assay kits and the DPPH test were used to assess the plant's antioxidant activity. The agar dilution test was used to determine antimicrobial efficacy. A549 lung cancer cells were used in an MTT assay to measure antiproliferative activity. The Folin−Ciocalteu reagent was used to quantify the total phenolic content of the sample. The amount of flavonoids was determined using an aluminium chloride test. The amount of protein was calculated using the AOAC's standard technique. Based on the research conducted, it was shown that the maximum total antioxidant status (TAS) value for the ethanol extract of wild mustard from various places was 5.232 ± 0.047 mmol L −1 . At a concentration of 2 mg mL −1 , DPPH activity was measured to be 82.06 ± 1.01. The maximum levels of total phenolic, flavonoid, and protein were 80.57 ± 2.19 mg g −1 , 154.07 ± 2.79 mg g −1 , and 7.75 ± 0.24%, respectively. Doses of 25–100 μg mL −1 of plant extracts were effective against fungal strains, whereas doses of 50–200 μg mL −1 were beneficial against bacterial strains. The plant extracts were shown to have potent antiproliferative properties. It was found that wild mustard's phenolic, flavonoid, protein, and biological activity levels varied according to the location from which it was gathered. It was also concluded that wild mustard had significant biological activity.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of EVA/LLDPE films containing 1, 2 and 5% (w/w) K-sorbate to inhibit microbial growth and as a consequence prolong shelf-life of foods was investigated. Based on weight loss experiments it was shown that K-sorbate is very suitable for incorporation in LLDPE because of its heat stability during extrusion. After 3 weeks, resp. 6.4, 2.8 and 5.7% of the incorporated sorbic acid was released into distilled water from films containing resp. 1, 2 and 5% (w/w) K-sorbate. The very limited migration of K-sorbate may be explained by the incompatibility of the polar salt with the apolar LLDPE. This limited migration could explain the very small inhibitory effect of the K-sorbate films on the growth of Candida spp., Pichia spp., Trichosporon spp. and Penicillium spp. During storage at 7 °C of cheese packaged in a 5% (w/w) K-sorbate film, no significant differences could be observed for yeast and mould growth on the cheese cubes compared to a reference film. The concentration of sorbic acid in the cheese did not exceed 14 ppm. This is much lower than the 1000 ppm K-sorbate needed to inhibit microbial growth. The results of this study confirm that the K-sorbate incorporated LLDPE film is not able to inhibit microbial growth in vitro on inoculated media and in vivo on cheese due to the insufficient release of K-sorbate from the film.",

To determine the antioxidant activities of the extracts, several complementary tests were used: ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay. The phenolic concentration was 15.98±0.09 and 9.42±0.06 mg GAE g−1 DW for 70 and 85% ethanol extracts, respectively. Of all the performed methods, the highest antioxidant activity values were measured by the ORAC assay — 224.6±6.6 and 154.0±9.9 μM TE g−1 DW for 70 and 85% ethanol extracts, respectively. Results also showed that both extracts exhibited very weak antimicrobial activity against the examined microorganisms. However, the 70% ethanol extract possessed higher inhibition ability, which correlated with higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "The milk thistle plant grows in many regions in Tunisia; however, there is no literature regarding their oil composition. In this study, oil content, fatty acids and triacylglycerols compositions of milk thistle seeds growing wild in Tunisia were determined. The oil content was 30.5%, thus milk thistle seeds could be exploited as natural new source of oil. Among the fatty acids, linoleic acid had the highest percentage (59.98%) followed by oleic acid (21.26%) and palmitic acid (12.74%). The extracted oil from milk thistle seeds is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (60.37%). Various molecular species of TAGs were detected and the major forms were LLL (22.30%), OLL (20.40%), PLL (17.31%), POL (14.30%), and OOL (7.90%). It can be concluded that milk thistle seed oil has a characteristic TAG pattern as compared with these elucidated for olive oil and soybean oil.",

    "abstract": "In the dairy industry different types of prebiotics, such galacto-oligosaccharide, lactulose, lactosucrose, tagatose, lactitol, lactobiono- and glucono-δ-lactone are synthesized through different chemical and biochemical reactions (hydrolysis, transgalactosylation, isomerization, fructosyl-transfer, reduction, and oxidation) as well as microbial fermentation processes using raw whey or isolated lactose as feedstock. Lactose-derived prebiotics have several functional and nutritional values. The biochemical activities of lactose-based prebiotics are expressed in the presence of probiotics (lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, Bacillus spp.). Galacto-oligosaccharide and lactosucrose reduce the risk of bowel disorder (diarrhea), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease), and colon cancer. Galacto-oligosaccharide helps colonic absorption of minerals (iron, magnesium and calcium) and prevents osteoporosis. Lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharide, and lactitol promote laxative activity. Furthermore, lactulose may decrease the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Prebiotics have low calorific value and glycemic index. Galacto-oligosaccharide and tagatose reduce the risks of hyperglycemia (Type 2 diabetes) and low density lipid (lipoprotein) accumulation in blood stream. Moreover, prebiotics improve immunomodulation, which reduces the risk of respiratory infection and allergies. This review describes unique biochemical mechanisms of several types of lactose-derived prebiotics.",

Gala and Sığırcı Lakes, which are known as significant lakes in Turkey in terms of especial biodiversity, are located in the Meriç River Delta and they are the main lentic factors of the system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the essential and toxic element bioaccumulation levels in fishes of Gala and Sığırcı Lakes from a statistical perspective by investigating a total of 25 macro- and micro-element bioaccumulations. One-Way ANOVA Test (OWAT) was applied to detected data in order to determine the statistical differences of element bioaccumulations among the fish species. Cluster analysis (CA) was also applied to detected data in order to classify the investigated elements in terms of bioaccumulation levels in fish tissues. According to the results of OWAT, although statistical differences were not recorded among the fish species in terms of essential element levels, significant statistical differences were recorded in terms of toxic element levels (P&lt;0.05). According to the results of CA, 5 statistically significant clusters were formed, which were named as “Most intense elements”, “Second most intense elements”, “Moderate intense elements”, “Second rarest elements”, and “Rarest elements”. It was also found that toxic element bioaccumulation rates in fishes of Gala Lake were significantly higher than in fishes of Sığırcı Lake (P&lt;0.05).",

The addition of essential oil had no significant effect on the sausage texture and colour parameters. A high rosemary leaves level resulted in an increase in sausage hardness and chewiness and a decrease in lightness (L*) with respect to the control sausage. Sensory evaluation indicated that rosemary essential oil and its leaves increased the taste and the aroma scores of turkey sausage depending on the concentration. The obtained results also showed that rosemary leaves (0.5%) were more effective than essential oil in reducing total plate counts, TBARS, K 232 , and K 270 values during chill storage, in comparison with the control product. This will contribute to reducing the use of chemical additives, which are badly perceived by consumers, while increasing the sensory properties of such products.",

It is noteworthy that it took 44 min to extract oil by UAE method, while alike yield was obtained from SE in 6 hours. Oil extracted by UAE exhibited significantly higher peroxide and ester values. The functional groups of apricot kernel oil were analysed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Untreated and treated kernel powders were studied by scanning electron microscopy, and the development of microstructures and disruption of cell walls were evaluated.

A field experiment was conducted at the experimental plot of the Department of Agronomy, The Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Hungary, to investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilisation on the yield and quality of maize. The experimental site included four observation plots with a net of 2 × 5 m size. Four N levels of T1, T2, T3, and T4 were sprayed at indicated plants in four replications according to treatment viz. 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha −1 . Nitrogen application in general does not significantly affect maize yield, its components, or grain quality. However, out of the four N treatments, the optimal N application between 50–100 kg N ha −1 potentially increased the yield, also the total expression of protein and starch contents in maize can be achieved with the right amount of N fertiliser, indicating that the treatment could produce a high grain yield as well as high protein and starch contents. Good N fertilising practice will boost the maize's nutritional value and make it more significant in the agriculture in the future. In addition, more research and assessment are essential to acquire the most benefit from the effect of optimal N application on maize yield and quality, and the findings could be beneficial to researchers and growers.",

The high and remarkable K (and partly P) contents are postulated, first of all to Agaricus bisporus. The Ca and Mg contents are in general relative stable and balanced. Copper and Mn as valuable microelements required to the normal human biochemical processes have important quantities. Low sodium levels are characteristic to all examined mushrooms, the lowest values were found for Pleurotus ostreatus.

Selenium level of Agaricus bisporus (2.3-2.7 mg kg-1, d.m.) may improve the Se-supply of the customers. Our data demonstrate clearly that the Cd and As levels of three species are reassuringly low and do not present toxicological risk. Some elements have higher contents in pileus than in stipes (16 elements in Agaricus, 14 in Lentinula, and only 10 elements in Pleurotus), while other ones have an opposite distribution (7, 9 and 13, respectively).

    "abstract": "Interest is increasing in the content of toxic metals in cigarette smoke for both their harmful health effects and the possible antagonistic influence with the essential microelements. Numerous factors influence the metal concentration found in tobacco, including soil type and pH, genotype, stalk position, application of metal-containing pesticides to leaves. The rate of transfer to the smoke is dependent on the volatility, the temperature and the filter-type. In cigarette smoke element concentrations vary among brands and even within the same brand. No comprehensive information is yet available on the toxic heavy metal content of the major Hungarian cigarette-brands. The purpose of the study was to obtain current information on the metal contents of selected brands of cigarettes being sold in Hungary. The work described in this paper had two objectives: firstly to determine the cadmium, lead, zinc and iron content of raw materials (tobacco-cut, cigarette paper, filter-rod) and secondly to measure the amount of these metals in the combustion products (cigarette smoke, ash, filter-rod). Non-negligible part of the toxic metal content of the tobacco cut gets into the mainstream smoke, but the measured values are not higher than the similar data published in the international literature. Filters are not really efficient to decrease the toxic metal content of the mainstream smoke. The toxic metal concentration in the sidestream smoke is higher than in the mainstream smoke.",

    "abstract": "Discrepancies between food content and label can lead to adverse reaction in people with hypersensitivity to particular food ingredients. Over a period of more than 10 years, 171 cases of adverse reaction to food have been registered. In all cases the offending foods were compound products where the ingredients were either hidden to the consumer as a cause of inadequate labelling (73 cases) or because the food was contaminated with the ingredient (64 cases). In 34 of the cases, the ingredient was inadvertently consumed. The largest number of cases is caused by milk, followed by tree nuts, peanuts and egg. However, the most severe reactions were caused by peanuts and soy, followed by hazelnuts and milk. Soy has caused severe anaphylactic reactions leading to death in peanut allergic individuals consuming meatballs, hamburgers and kebab containing high amounts of soy protein. The presence of the offending ingredient was confirmed by analysis of the food item by immunological and DNA-based methods. In some of the cases we were able not only to detect the causative protein, but also to estimate the dose causing the allergic reaction. The doses range from less than 1 mg, causing emergency treatment, to several hundreds of mg causing stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A dose equivalent to 60 mg of casein in a sausage caused fatal anaphylaxis in a 15-year-old girl and a dose equivalent to 5.6 mg of peanut protein caused fatal anaphylaxis in a 22-year-old man.",

The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of different types of varieties and cultivation technologies (forcing, open-field with supporting system, open-field with processing varieties) on the ingredient content of tomato fruit. The soluble solids (°Brix), carbohydrate, organic acid, lycopene and ascorbic acid contents were measured. Average soluble solids content ranged from 5.2 to 8.7%. The highest °Brix was observed in the fruits of a cherry type tomato, namely Favorita (8.7%). Carbohydrate content constitutes nearly 50% of the °Brix. The highest carbohydrate content was observed for Favorita and Cheresita (both cherry type tomatoes), whereas the lowest was detected in Falcorosso, a processing variety. Low acid content was found in Nívó and Delphine F 1 cultivars (processing and eating variety, respectively). The sugar-acid ratio was 40% higher in the case of cherry type tomatoes than in the other varieties. Average lycopene content of examined tomato varieties turned out to be extremely diverse (48–134 mg kg −1 ). Ascorbic acid levels did not differ so much, ranging from 226 to 381 mg kg −1 . In case of open-field cultivation with supporting system, cherry type varieties showed significantly higher °Brix and carbohydrate content than those of round tomato type with average fruit weight of 100∓130 g. All varieties examined produced significantly higher organic acid content in forcing as compared to the values of round tomato varieties cultivated in open-field with supporting system and processing varieties. Lycopene content of tomato fruits from greenhouse was higher than that of fruits from field. Processing varieties yielded significantly higher lycopene content than the others.",

The number of branches per plant increased with the nitrogen doses (10.62–12.41–15.38). The N2 and N3 rates (4.91 g and 4.79 g, respectively) significantly increased the seed yields (g/plant) as compared to N1 (3.77 g). Straw yields (g/plant) and thousand-seed weight (g) increased significantly only with the highest level of nitrogen N3 (18.23 and 1.17, respectively) compared to N1 (16.52 and 1.06, respectively). Increasing levels of nitrogen (N1–N2–N3) reduced the oil content of seeds (40.79–38.40–37.66%), but increased the protein content (23.93–25.63–28.19%). The level of sulphur S2 significantly stimulated only the oil content to 39.36% compared to 38.54% with S1. At the same time a negative correlation was discovered between the oil and protein content in the seeds (r= −0.8164).

    "abstract": "The important glycoalkaloids in potatoes are α-solanine and α-chaconine. Their natural function is probably to serve as stress metabolites or phytoalexins for the protection of the potato when attacked by insects, fungi, etc. They contribute flavour to potatoes but at higher concentrations cause bitterness and are toxic to humans. α-Solanine and α-chaconine appear to have two main toxic actions, one on cell membranes and another one on acetylcholinesterase. Symptoms of α-solanine/α-chaconine poisoning involve an acute gastrointestinal upset with diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. An instrumental high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was applied for the quantification of α-solanine and α-chaconine in peeled potato skin, raw potato pulp and cooked peeled potato tubers. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for α-solanine and α-chaconine was found to be 5.0 mg kg −1 for each glycoalkaloid. In this study the factors of potential loss of α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato tubers during peeling (factor=0.8) and cooking into edible stage in salted water (factor=0.8) were examined. The combined loss factor of peeling and cooking for sum of both glycoalkaloids in potato tubers was 0.64. These factors were practically used for the probabilistic exposure assessment of the intake of potato glycoalkaloids in the Czech Republic.",

The influence of rootstocks on most of the analysed quality attributes was variable because strong and complex interactions, rootstock×cultivar, rootstock×year and cultivar×year, were observed. Several traits, such as yield, soluble solids/acid content ratio and total sugars/acid content ratio, seem to be harder conditioned in rootstocks. In addition, Stanley had a greater positive effect on the fruit quality than Myrobalan, whereas Čačanska lepotica had better quality attributes than Čačanska najbolja on both rootstocks, except total sugars/acid content ratio.

This study focused on determination of the FA composition of eight different vegetable oils, which are commonly used in nutrition, as well as the dietary habits in oil consumption in Serbia. The results showed high contents of n-6 linoleic acid (LA) and total polyunsaturated FA in sunflower and grapeseed oil (62.5 and 70.0%, respectively), while the highest content of oleic acid and total monounsaturated FA was found in canola oil (64.4%) and olive oil (67.0%). Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, n-3) was found in linseed oil (53.6%) and to a lesser extent in canola oil (7%). The results of the survey showed that processed sunflower oil is the most often consumed oil in Serbia. Therefore there is a high daily intake of LA, which may have unfavourable impact on human health. Considering our similar dietary habits, it could be proposed that the same situation applies to the whole region. However, changes in dietary habits and proper choice of oils could improve overall health in our region.",

Essential oil is the most important active substance of the drug, which influences the aroma and the effect of the plant. Although the compositions of essential oils vary in different basil cultivars, the main components are oxygenated monoterpenes and phenylpropane derivates. The high chemical variation is most likely caused by interspecific hybridization. Various factors, like genetic background, ontogenesis, morphogenesis, abiotic factors, essential oil extraction method, drying, and storage, are responsible for the variant essential oil composition.",

    "abstract": "Resistant starches (RSs) are broadly investigated as appropriate additives in starch-based products due to their well-known and proved health benefits. However, it was shown in previous studies that these starches are sensitive of the different heat treatments used in the food processing, which can cause changes, especially in the resistance. There is an increasing trend to use microwave (MW) energy in food processing; therefore, our aim was to investigate the changes of RSs compared to native starches caused by MW heating. Maize, wheat, RS2 and RS4 starches were MW-treated according to a 2×2 experimental design (300 and 600 W of power, 30 and 150 s of time). The changes of in vitro digestibility, rheological properties (rapid visco analyser, RVA) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic characteristic were studied. Two spectrophotometers were applied (dispersive and Fourier-transform (FT)) to compare their sensitivity in the analysis of the MW-treated starches.Results showed that the digestibility of starches did not show any tendencies when increasing the microwave energy of treatments, the characteristics of the kinetic curves remained unchanged. The RVA analysis showed that the RSs did not gelatinize after the heat-treatments. The MW heating weakened the rheological properties of all starches. The NIR analysis was the most sensitive device for the detection of the effects of MW treatments. The analysis of the most characteristic carbohydrate regions (2080–2130 and 2270–2290 nm) highlighted structural alterations of the starches; moreover, the dispersive spectrophotometer was found to be more sensitive in the analysis of starches than the FT-one.",

Rancimat and Schaal oven analysis were employed for the assessment of potential consequences of PSO against oxidation in plant based oils. The variation in total phenolic contents (TPC), antioxidant activity, peroxide value (POV), and tocopherol contents during storage were evaluated by Schaal oven test at 62 °C. The substantially (P≤0.05) higher induction period (IP) values were observed for PSO blended oil samples as compared to blank oil samples. The addition of PSO in plant-based oils improved the oxidative stability by enhancing the antioxidant potential and TPC, decreasing POV, and slowing down the degradation of tocopherol contents during storage. The findings of the present study suggest that PSO might be used as an alternative potential antioxidant to synthetic antioxidants.",

At the moment, in gluten analysis there are no reference methods and reference materials which model real food matrices. During the production and experimental utilisation of our previously developed reference material candidate, numerous questions emerged. As our model product is a real food matrix, interactions can be present between gluten proteins and other macro and micro components. Fat content of the baked cookies is almost 20%, which might affect the results of ELISA measurements. The detectable gluten content is significantly increasing after the defatting procedure, as a pre-treatment of samples. Moreover, baking is a common food processing step that might modify the structure of gluten proteins leading to denaturation and aggregation. In the soluble protein fraction the amount of low molecular weight proteins increases, while that of high molecular weight proteins decreases during the baking procedure.",

Regarding the classical protein fractions: albumins are the highest content in both mushrooms, but the quantity and the proportion in P. eryngii is better than in ‘HK-35’ hybrid. Occurrence and proportion of protein fractions is more valuable in P. eryngii , while the NPN contents of both mushrooms are the same. The investigated soluble oligo- and polysaccharides were present in high amounts in both mushrooms, but the free radical scavenging activity seems to be markedly higher in king oyster mushroom, making it more valuable. Mineral compositions of both species are similarly beneficial, but P. eryngii has basically higher P and lower K levels. More intensive cultivation and use of P. eryngii is clearly recommended.",

Probiotic biofilms exhibit the same properties as pathogen microbial biofilms but with higher resistance to low pH values and bile salts. The ability of different probiotic strains ( Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum ) to interact with pre-selected carriers divided into 3 categories (polymers, complex food matrices, and inorganic compounds) was tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum combined with inorganic silica carrier exhibited the interaction leading to biofilm formation only. Prepared biofilm ( Lactobacillus acidophilus ) was then subjected to comparative study with planktonic bacterial culture. The ability to survive in the presence of low pH value (pH 1–3) and bile salts (0.3% solution) was evaluated. Low pH value (pH 1) had a harsh effect on free cell culture causing decreased cell viability (71.9±3.2% of viable cells). Biofilm culture exhibited higher resistance to low pH value, the viability exceeded 90%. The exposure of free cell probiotic culture to porcine bile resulted in an almost constant decrease in viability during the study period (68.2±1.1% of viable cells, after 240 min incubation). Viability of biofilm after the exposition to bile was almost constant with a slight decrease of no more than 5% during the study.",

Thus, horticultural products and derived fruit drinks or commercial vitamin C products are considered to be important sources for the ascorbic acid intake in the human diet. These facts underline the importance of analytical methods for ascorbic acid determination in different food products. In our study two spectrophotometric and a fluorometric ascorbic acid determination methods have been compared with each other and with the so-called etalon HPLC method to find the best for small or middle sized food analytic laboratories with a sample number of up to several hundreds. As a result of our experiments we could establish that the OPDA-fluorometric method can be suggested for the determination of samples containing ascorbate at low concentrations. Unfortunately, the analytical properties of the OPDA method with spectrophotometric detection have been lagging far behind the others. The 2,2′-bipyridyl method could give a balanced performance for all tests. Furthermore, the results gained by this method are the closest to the results of the reference HPLC method in the case of fruit and vegetable samples.",

While such regulations are available worldwide, most of them are not taking into account inadvertent allergen cross-contamination and they usually do not define threshold doses that could support the industry in their endeavour to provide reliable food labels for allergic consumers. This resulted in the proliferation of the “may contain” type precautionary allergen labelling (PAL), which is voluntary and is intended to warn consumers for potential unintended contamination with an otherwise undeclared allergen. As this kind of labelling is hardly ever based on actual risk assessment, it puts both the industry and the consumer into a difficult position. A promising tool towards the solution of this problem could be allergen threshold doses based on clinical data, which are becoming increasingly available. This review intends to present this process, the new ways of improved risk assessment it opens, and its implications for food analysis.",

    "abstract": "Oregano is used worldwide both as spice and crude drug, which is mainly provided by species of Origanum genus. The quality of the product is usually determined by chemical analysis, whereas in food industrial applications sensory tests are also practised. The aim of the present study was a comparison of parallel quality investigations of oregano samples by a new and effective instrumental sensory evaluation method, the “electronic nose”, and by gas-chromatographic and human sensory analysis. The GC analysis of essential oil components revealed mainly differences between plant species (Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum and Origanum majorana). Main components of the oil of the former taxon are carvacrol and thymol, while those of marjoram are terpinene-4-ol, ?-terpinene and terpinolene. A wholesale oregano sample showing considerable divergence from the other ones with respect to ratios of carvacrol, ß-caryophyllene ß-cubebene and thymol. It was assumed not to belong to ssp. hirtum. The electronic nose analysis, evaluated by PCA, proved to be an appropriate, rapid, non-destructive, reagent-less method for the reliable separation of all of the oregano samples based on their complex aroma features. Assumptions could be made about correlations between separation of samples by the instrumental sensors and proportions of terpenoid compounds of the oil established by GC in some cases only. The varying essential oil content of the samples did not influence the success of instrumental evaluation. The instrumental and human sensory analysis showed similar results: varieties of O. majorana could be well distinguished on the basis of their complex aroma, while their gas-chromatograms did not show characteristic differences. The results call the attention that quality evaluation of drug items of aromatic plants should be oriented in different directions, considering the current utilisation area of the items.",

More than one hundred proteins included in the BIOPEP database were analyzed and classified according to the frequency of the occurrence of antihypertensive fragments. As the example of detailed profile of potential biological activity, the bovine beta-globulin A is presented. It was found that apart from the dominant antihypertensive activity, other effects (opioid, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory, immunomodulative, antioxidative) may be present. It can be concluded that this method may be a useful tool in this field. The antihypertensive activity was the most dominant because fragments with such activity were present in all of the examined proteins. It encouraged us to classify proteins into families, which may be better or the worse source of antihypertensive fragments. We found statistically significant differences between the values of parameter A (P<0.001) among the all five families we obtained. We found that in silico analysis can be useful in the analysis of the large quantities of data in the field of proteins as the source of biologically active peptides.",

The non-thermal pasteurization treatments were also assessed in relation to loss of carotenoid content, and lipid- and cholesterol oxidation of liquid egg yolk. Unlike radiation pasteurization, high pressure processing caused protein denaturation in egg white, which manifested in changes of its DSC-thermogram and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Electronic nose testing showed changes of the head-space volatile composition of egg albumen, particularly as a function of radiation treatment. Both treatments caused changes in the NIR-spectrometric \"fingerprint\" of the liquid egg white. Various chemometric analyses of the results of the latter instrumental methods, particularly statistical techniques developed by the group of one of the co-authors of this article, demonstrated the potential for detection and characterization of the applied non-thermal processing techniques on liquid egg white.

The DON and NIV concentrations in wheat grain, flour, and bread were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with UV-detection methods. The 2 500 kg lot of wheat grain containing 1 400–1 900 μg kg −1 deoxynivalenol and 130–200 μg kg −1 nivalenol was divided into sub-lots which were processed to get three types of flour (F1: industrial bread flour, F2: industrial wholegrain flour and F3: traditional wholegrain flour).

After applying MT2 to the grain (yielding F2), the DON and NIV levels were measured to be 1 060–1 400 μg kg −1 and 60–87 μg kg −1 , respectively. Applying MT3 (yielding F3) produced a DON level of 1 100–1 770 μg kg − 1 and a NIV level of 80–95 μg kg −1 .

    "abstract": "In animals and man, molybdenum has been recognized as an essential component of the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase and sulphite oxidase. Nutritional molybdenum deficiencies in animals have been produced in experiments with goats and a molybdenum-poor diet (growth depression, decrease in conception rate, poor foetal survival rate). In practice, the molybdenum supply to animals and humans meets the requirements (animals < 100 μg kg −1 /feed dry matter, man 25 μg/day). The essentiality of molybdenum and sulphite oxidase in man was documented by more than 100 patients who lacked the enzyme function, either as the result of a defect in genetic coding, or of a genetic deficiency in the molybdenum cofactor and a molybdenum deficiency during parenteral nutrition.Molybdenum toxicity (molybdenosis) in animals primarily affects ruminants (cattle). It is manifested by diarrhea, anorexia, depigmentation of hair, neurological disturbances and premature death. Molybdenum interacts with copper, and some symptoms of molybdenum toxicity are similar to those of copper deficiency. Only few data are available concerning toxicity to humans.",

    "abstract": "The lycopene content in pulp and peel of five fresh tomato cultivars, most common on Croatian market, was determined by spectrophotometry and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Peels from the raw tomatoes contained more lycopene (expressed on a fresh basis) than the pulps: the ratio was 3.75±1.08 for spectrophotometric and 3.50±0.95 for HPLC measurements. Comparison of the results of lycopene content expressed on a dry weight basis revealed that the peel from raw tomato contains 1.74±0.36 times (spectrophotometry) more lycopene than the pulp as compared to a factor of 1.61±0.24 obtained by HPLC analysis. Fraction of the pulp in a whole tomato was found to vary between 89.9 and 95.2%, while that of tomato peel was between 4.9 and 10.1%. Nutritional habits in Croatia often include tomato-based food, all year around, prepared partlyof whole fresh tomatoes (including peel), partly of industrial tomato products (from which peel is often excluded). This study provides evidence that the peel of one of the most common varieties of tomatoes on Croatian market is richer in lycopene than the pulp and, moreover, that a diet including 100 g of raw tomatoes provides 1.35±0.29 mg lycopene from pulp as compared to 0.35±0.18 mg lycopene from tomato peel. In addition, results of this study will be useful in further attempts to quantify lycopene content of intact, whole tomatoes by means of the nondestructive, photoacoustic method.",

Gross chemical composition, amino acid content and mineral composition of the whole grain were determined. The effect of heat treatment on amino acid content was also investigated. The range of concentration of main constituents of samples studied corresponded to the average data reported by other researchers. However, the relatively big difference between lowest (14.23%) and highest (17.40%) protein content suggests that genetic potential for increasing the protein content may be realized in breeding. Amino acid composition profile is generally closer to Leguminosae than to cereal grains except for sulphur containing amino acids being present in higher amount in amaranth than in legumes. The concentrations of minerals in seeds varied in a relatively wide range, and the micro-components, like Fe, Cu, Zn, were present in higher amount in amaranth seeds compared to the average values found in wheat. It was confirmed that heat treatment of amaranth grain (e.g. popping) might reduce the available lysine content. Contradictory data published in the literature may be explained by differences in initial sugar and moisture content of grain, which influence the rate of potential Maillard-reaction.",

Linoleic acid followed by palmitic and oleic acids were the major fatty acids in the P. incisa. Oleic followed by stearic were the main acids in D. harra, while palmitic followed by oleic were the major fatty acids found in A. marina. Sterol markers of P. incisa were campesterol followed by stigmasterol and β-sitosterol. In D. harra β-sitosterol followed by stigmasterol and Δ5-avensterol were the major sterols, while campesterol followed by β-sitosterol and Δ7-avensterol were main sterols of A. marina. Tocopherols were also estimated in high levels, wherein d-tocopherol was the main tocopherol in all plants. Antioxidant properties of methanolic extracts of the plants were compared with methanolic solution of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid during thiocyanate assay. Moreover, methanolic extracts of the whole plants exhibited strong antiradical potential against DPPH radicals. Information provided by the present study is of importance for further investigations of P. incisa, D. harra and A. marina and utilization of the plants as a raw material of bioactive compounds.",

The OSCs had high protein (34–50%), fat (8–15%), total dietary fibre (23–36%) content and high energy value (383–444 kcal/100 g)). The OSC samples with a minimal exception fulfilled the requirements of feed legislation in force. An increased water absorption, dough development time, and reduced elasticity were observed probably due to the enhanced fiber and protein content. Dough stability increased with WnC, and decreased with PuC or SC addition. Enrichment provided the appearance of a brown bread for WnC, of a half-brown bread for LC. PuC gave an unusual look. The appearance of OSC fortified bread similar to daily bread, was an advantage resulting the 1st rank for 10% WnC bread and the 2nd one for 10% LC bread (P=0.05). The studied OSCs are suitable for food enrichment, however, in case of PuC and SC fortified flour blends, hydrocolloid application is recommended. Our data suggest that the newly developed fortified breads could be a valuable source for healthy nutrition.",

Using different assay systems the modulations in the anti-oxidant profile of Se enriched mushroom was studied in comparison to the mushrooms cultivated on normal straw. The oyster mushrooms were observed to potentially mobilize Se from Se-rich substrates to fruiting bodies, resulting in significantly high uptake (37.2±0.6 μg g−1) as compared to control (3.57±0.53 mg g−1). The antioxidant activity, as determined by various assays, such as reducing power, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging, and metal chelating activity, was higher in the experimental mushrooms when compared to control. The results obtained demonstrate that Se-fortified mushrooms through cultivation on straw containing organic forms of Se can be considered as natural and effective dietary supplements of organic Se for humans.

Food processing environments can be colonized by persistent strains, repeatedly isolated for months or years. This study aimed to investigate the biofilm formation capacity of six strains of L. monocytogenes that persisted for long periods in two cheese processing plants in comparison to seven strains isolated sporadically from the same plants. Persistent strains produced more biofilm than non-persistent strains on stainless steel and silicon rubber surfaces; no significant differences were observed on polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In a polystyrene microtiter plate assay with crystal violet staining, no evidence was found that persistent strains have higher ability to form biofilm than non-persistent strains, and no correlation was identified between biofilm formation in the microtiter plate and on the three other surfaces tested.",

    "abstract": "Sliced ready-to-eat traditional meat products presented in individual packaging with more convenience to the consumer is the way that food industry tries to adapt to the new consumer tendencies. The current work assessed the survival of Listeria monocytogenes in a contaminated sliced vacuum packed chouriço with different sugar concentrations, two salt levels, and presence/absence of Lactobacillus sakei as starter culture along the storage period at two temperatures (8 °C and 22 °C). Neither the inoculation with L. sakei , nor the addition of carbohydrates influenced the survival of the pathogen. Higher amount of salt resulted in a significant reduction of L. monocytogenes , and storage at the higher temperature displayed a safer product. After 7 days, L. monocytogenes was not detected in any samples. The study of the association of the factors contributing for L. monocytogenes survival by logistic regression showed that increasing the level of salt addition from 1.5% to 3% reduces the odds of survival of L. monocytogenes to about one fifth (0.174). Worthy of attention is the significant reduction in the odds (OR=0.028) of finding viable L. monocytogenes when the samples are stored at room temperature (22 °C), when compared to low temperature (8 °C). The general and indiscriminate use of refrigeration for meat products might increase the risk of presence of L. monocytogenes . The competitive advantage that L. monocytogenes has at low temperatures, as the potential inhibition of LAB activity, is probably the reason of the observed behaviour. The amount of salt was an important hurdle to control L. monocytogenes growth, so, manufacturing meat products with lower salt contents to meet the demands of healthy products might represent a risk for safety, since high levels of salt together with low aw are the keys for their conservation.",

The results suggest that a living cell suspension of P. fluorescens significantly inhibited spore germination of B. cinerea , and significantly reduced the incidence of grape gray mould. Moreover, compared with the control, the fruit inoculated with P. fluorescens had elevated activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chitinase (CHI), and β-1,3-glucanase (GLU).

Effectiveness of salt concentration, pH, and temperature on the formation of L. monocytogenes biofilms was evaluated individually and in combinations using microtiter plate assay by measuring the optical density. The tested strains differed in their biofilm formation (low, moderate, and strong) ability. At 37 °C, decreasing amounts of biofilms was observed in almost all L. monocytogenes strains when the NaCl concentration increased from 0.05 to 15%, but all strains were able to form biofilm even at 1 °C. There was no significant difference in biofilm formation between pH 4, 5, and 6, except for some strains. When stress conditions were tested in combination, the addition of 15% NaCl significantly inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes at 1 °C and 4 °C, and the weak biofilm-forming strains were less sensitive to the temperature and to NaCl treatments than the strong biofilm-forming strains. These results enhance our knowledge of the application of NaCl, temperature, and pH stresses in the food industry and provide basis to develop new strategies for control of biofilm formation of this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Consumer trust is essential to any market but particularly relevant to the food sector. Sustainable food systems require integration of small-scale food producers, for them consumer trust is pivotal. However, comprehensive measurement of consumer trust regarding local food is a less explored area. Based on the adjusted version of Benson's trust toolkit, local food trust was measured on four levels. This approach, connecting locality/proximity to food-related trust, was tested with a representative quantitative consumer survey ( n = 1,001) in Hungary. Interpersonal trust, general organisation trust, local food chain trust, and local food product trust were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Correlation and boxplot analysis conducted revealed that trust levels correlate significantly but remain independent from demographic characteristics, indicating that trust in local food is not region-, education-, or income-specific amongst Hungarian consumers. A relatively high level of consumer trust was measured for local food products and producers compared to other stakeholders, strengthening the assumption for the proximity-trust relationship regarding food. This is a key factor for small-scale food producers: only shared values with the local community and earned trust can attract customers despite less flexibility with pricing and limited capacity for advertising.",

The must from the fruits fermented on the skin gave the highest rate of fermentation and ethanol content. The application of various treatments improved the fermentation behaviour of treated strawberry musts compared to the control as revealed by their physico-chemical characteristics. Thermovinified wines had many desirable characteristics such as more total phenols, esters and colour with comparable amount of higher alcohols, volatile acids, ethyl alcohol, sugars and anthocyanin. The carbonic maceration resulted in wines with more alcohol, higher pH, lower acidity, lesser higher alcohol and volatile acids than other wines. Fermented on the skin treated wines were typical for higher amount of anthocyanin, lower reducing sugar and total sugar than the control wines. Thermovinified wines, irrespective of cultivars, scored the highest with respect to most of the sensory quality characteristics. Wines from Camarosa cultivar registered many desirable characteristics such as esters, optimum acidity, more red colour units with comparable contents of alcohol and total phenols, while Chandler cultivar had higher amount of ethyl alcohol, more phenols, anthocyanin than other cultivars. Some of these differences are correlated with their initial characteristics, while others have been influenced by method of vinification.

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate the protective ability of the ethanol extracts of Achillea aleppica D.C. subsp. aleppica (AA), Achillea aleppica D.C. subsp. zederbaueri (Hayek) Hub.-Mor (AZ) and Achillea biebersteinii Afan. (AB) against the lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and DNA damage induced by Fenton system. Ethanol extract of Achillea species were evaluated by quantifying the ability of different concentrations of plant extracts to supress Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenates. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by ethanol extracts of AA, AB and AZ was the result of their scavenging effect on Fe2+/ascorbate generated free radicals.The ability of AA, AZ and AB to prevent oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin (BSA) induced by Fe3+/H2O2 and ascorbic acid was investigated. The ethanol extracts of AA, AB and AZ at different concentrations (50–1000 μg ml−1) efficiently prevented protein oxidation induced by hydroxyl radical as assayed by protein oxidation markers including protein carbonyl formation (PCO). We have also investigated the effect of ethanol extracts of AA, AB and AZ on DNA cleavage induced by UV-photolysis of H2O2 using pBluescript M13+ plasmid DNA. These extracts significantly inhibited DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, Achillea aleppica D.C. subsp. aleppica (AA), Achillea aleppica D.C. subsp. zederbaueri (Hayek) Hub.-Mor (AZ) and Achillea biebersteinii Afan. extracts may be useful in the food industry as effective synthetic antioxidants.",

The applicability of the new method was compared to the standard swab method in the framework of interlaboratory proficiency test aimed to determine the microbial contamination of model surfaces and in the hygienic control of a food manufacturing pilot plant. The comparative evaluation of total counts and Enterobacterium counts obtained by standard plate pouring and by the new method proved that there is no significant difference between the results of the two procedures. The total count determination with the new method lasted only 10–16 h in contrast to 72 h of plate counting. Particular advantages of the new method are that the bacterial count of the swab can be determined directly, without any washing down of the microbes from the swab and due to the different shapes of the redox curves, the total count and enterobacteria could be enumerated simultaneously from the same nonselective nutrient broth.",

The data records were processed and the questionnaires were validated, the results obtained on the micronutrient intakes of the adult population are shown in this article. From fat soluble vitamins, the average daily intakes of vitamins A and D were lower than the national recommendations in case of both genders, meaning low intake for around 60% (in case of retinol) and 80–90% (in case of calciferols) of adults. The intakes of some water soluble vitamins belonging to B group, vitamin C and folates were low as well. Regarding the macroelements, the most important health problem on population level is the extremely high sodium load of the inhabitants, combined with unfavourable sodium/potassium ratio. The average daily calcium intake of every age and gender group was far below the recommended value. The average daily intake of iron was low for the 50% of adult females. The article also provides data on frequency of food supplement taking habits of inhabitants and of self-reported food allergy.",

FT-IR results revealed that increased concentration (0–0.075 % w/w) of pectin substantially improved the purity level of synthesized HA nanoparticles. In addition, higher concentration of pectin also reduced the crystallinity and size of the synthesized HA nanoparticles, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM results, respectively. The synthesized HA nanoparticles at increased pectin concentration (HA 0.075 ) evinced high purity, less crystallinity, and discrete uniform shape.

It became obvious that consumers were looking for information about quality (rating its importance at 4.04) on packages, but information about origin (3.94) and production (3.89) was also important to them. The capability of respondents to spontaneously recall country of origin and quality labels was very limited: 35.5% of all respondents could not name any such labels. The best known label was \"Hungarian Product\" (30.5%), which was recognized by up to 90% of the respondents after they were shown it. Many consumers were ready to pay premium for products bearing this label (31.7%). According to our results, information about quality is important to consumers, but they do not look for it deliberately, and only a few consumers ascribe a higher value to products with labels bearing this information. There is a pressing need to increase consumers' confidence for trademarks through dissemination of reliable information.",

Both H extr and L extr were HPLC analysed for their carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid contents. For the evaluation of TAA, extracts were assayed alone or in combination using in vitro chemical tests (TEAC, FRAP) and cell-based (CAA) assays using human hepatoma (HepG2) and human histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells. The only carotenoid detected in L extr was lycopene, while a mixture of phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin) was identified in H extr . Ascorbic acid was not found either in H extr or in L extr . Upon extract combination (1:1, v/v), the FRAP assay revealed additive action between L extr and H extr , whilst a slight synergistic action was observed in TAA as measured by the TEAC assay. Synergistic action was better revealed when TAA was analysed using either U937 or HepG2 cells. This could be explained by the presence of a multiphase media (cell membrane and extra- and intracellular media) that might facilitate the distribution and interaction of antioxidants with different polarities and different mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports highlighted the onion solid wastes as abundant, residual material that might contain a significant load of antioxidant polyphenols. Although there have been studies pertaining to polyphenol recovery from onion wastes, the effect of temperature has not been adequately addressed. In this line, this study was undertaken with the aim of establishing a correlation between the extraction yield in total polyphenols and the extraction temperature, using acidified aqueous ethanol as the solvent system. Extraction of polyphenols from onion solid wastes was found to obey 2 nd -order kinetics. On such a basis, the yield in total polyphenols at saturation could be very effectively determined and correlated with temperature using non-linear regression. The results indicated that the extraction yield at saturation is highly correlated with temperature, following a quadratic function. The extract obtained at optimal temperature (40 °C) had a total polyphenol yield of 21.10 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of dry weight, and it was further analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy to characterise its major constituents. The polyphenols detected were quercetin glucosides, as well as quercetin oxidation derivatives, including certain degradation products and dimers. The outcome of this study outlined that temperatures above 40 °C are rather not favourable for polyphenol extraction from onion solid wastes, as suggested by the model established through kinetics. The extract obtained under optimal conditions contained peculiar polyphenolic composition, not encountered in any other food processing residue.",

    "abstract": "The oral administration of hyaluronic acid has been shown to improve skin health. This study aimed at utilizing ultrasound treatment to enhance the production of hyaluronic acid by lactobacilli. Among the 16 strains of lactobacilli screened, a higher production of hyaluronic acid (P<0.05) was observed from seven strains namely, Lactobacillus casei BT 2113, Lactobacillus casei BT 1268, Lactobacillus casei BT 8633, Lactobacillus casei FTDC 8033, Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 1231, Lactobacillus gasseri FTDC 8131 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus FTDC 8313. Upon ultrasonic treatment, hyaluronic acid concentration increased significantly (P<0.05) in all the seven strains studied. The use of ultrasonication at 100% amplitude increased the hyaluronic acid content (P<0.05) up to 51.6 % with concentrations ranging from 0.262 mg ml−1 to 0.385 mg ml−1, while an amplitude of 20% yielded a lower increase ranging from 0.227 mg ml−1 to 0.310 mg ml−1. Increasing duration of ultrasonic treatment (from 1 min to 3 min) also significantly (P<0.05) improved the concentration of hyaluronic acid in some strains. Our data demonstrated that a sub-lethal physical treatment, such as ultrasonication, can be applied to increase the membrane permeability of lactobacilli cells and subsequently increase the release of bioactive metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium participates in numerous enzymatic reactions in the human body and it has essential role in the maintenance of the antioxidant system. Since several magnesium compounds have been applied in the food and pharmaceutical industry, our purpose was to investigate the antioxidant/free radical scavenging activity of some magnesium compounds in vitro. The antioxidant/prooxidant effect of inorganic salts (e.g. MgCl2) and organic complexes (e.g. Mg-gluconate) was determined with chemiluminometric method (H2O2/•OH-microperoxidase-luminol) and heme mediated LDL oxidation (LDL-heme-H2O2 ) in vitro. It has been stated that the chemiluminescence method and LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation measurement is applicable in the presence of magnesium salts and complexes. Most of the compounds do not generate free radicals and the antioxidant/prooxidant effect depends on the quality of the ligand and the concentration. In the concentration range used, some representatives of the magnesium compounds (MgO, Mg-gluconate, Mg-polygalacturonate) investigated showed radical generating activity measured with chemiluminescence method, whereas the LDL oxidation has not been affected. Magnesium citrate and malate proved to be antioxidants measured with the chemiluminescence method and they slightly accelerate the LDL oxidation in the system and in the concentration applied. In vitro some of the ligands of magnesium compounds showed antioxidant activities.",

The FRAP solution has been shown to alter absorbance over time by ca 0.0010–0.0020 per hour, under storage conditions. This article intends to show that some substances do not fully or sufficiently react within the common analysis period. It is evident from the results that some substances react more quickly and others very slowly. Absorbance in relation to various phenols was measured. Compared to the levels of absorbance at 10 min, mean absorbance at 48 h was higher by 5,395% for vanillin, 426% for caffeic acid, 170% for sinapinic acid, 67% for gallic acid, 19% for syringic acid, and only by 4% for Trolox.

Present research aimed to investigate the alleviation of DSS-induced acute enteritis by bifidobacteria. In vivo colonoscopy was performed in mice to observe the colorectal mucosa and the pathological damage of colon tissue and the colonic expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1, ZO-1) and inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1b, IL-6). The colon mucosa tissue samples were collected for bacterial 16S DNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. The intervention of bifidobacteria could effectively alleviate the trend of weight loss and colonic trauma in mice with DSS-induced acute enteritis. The bifidobacteria effectively restored expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1) and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1b, IL-6). Bifidobacterium longum proved to be the most effective ( P &lt; 0.05). The altered composition of gut microbiota was reflected in the increase of the relative abundances of Dubosiella spp. in the B. longum treated group. The results suggested that bifidobacteria could repair intestinal barrier function, relieve the colon inflammation, and improve intestinal microbiota disorder; and B. longum demonstrated the best efficacy in mice with DSS-induced acute enteritis.",

The content of estragole (methyl chavicol), a compound associated with a potential risk to human health, was determined in the essential oils of 12 samples of basil herb by gas chromatography with flame ionisation and mass spectrometry detection (GC-FID/MS) using an external standard method. The essential oils contained estragole at various levels, from 1.85 to 561.01 mg mL −1 . Regarding the chemical profile, among the eleven essential oils, the compound with the highest relative proportion was linalool (29.1–70.3%), while estragole dominated in one essential oil with a relative proportion of 45.2%. All essential oils tested correspond to the European chemotype, which is characterised by a high content of linalool or a combination of linalool and estragole. Given the recommendation for limiting human exposure to estragole, the safety of some essential oils may be of concern due to their high levels of estragole content. The results indicate the importance of the chemical analysis of basil herb samples and the selection of chemotypes with low estragole content.",

This research aimed to study the properties of maltodextrin-alginate matrix solution and its encapsulated iron powder. The study was conducted using the variation of iron concentration (8–20 mg g −1 matrix) and ratio of maltodextrin-alginate (10:0; 10:0.5; 10:1; 10:1.5; 10:2; 0:2). The results showed that a higher iron concentration increased the viscosity of the matrix solution, which led to the formation of higher moisture content particles, but reduced the encapsulation efficiency. Meanwhile, an increased ratio of maltodextrin-alginate allowed an increase in the viscosity of the matrix solution, the encapsulation efficiency, and the moisture content of the particles. However, iron loading capacity improved by increasing iron and alginate concentration. All samples appeared to be amorphous materials with a faster iron release at a pH 6.8 than that at a pH 1.2. In addition, incorporation of alginate improved the particle size, thermal stability, and antioxidant activity of the encapsulated iron powder. In brief, the improvement of the encapsulation efficiency, iron release, and thermal stability of spray-dried iron powder are highlighted in this study, which are important in food fortification and processing.",

Among them, 3-deoxyanthocyanin (3-DXA) is a rare subclass of anthocyanins, which has not only antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer functions, but also good thermal stability, colouring effect, as well as unique properties of acid and alkali resistance. In this study, we extracted 3-DXA from sorghum grains and analysed its composition. Component analysis indicated that the purified 3-DXA mainly contained apigenin and luteolin, with the contents of 1.46 μg g −1 and 1.38 μg g −1 , respectively. The antioxidant activity of 3-DXA in vitro was between vitamin C (Vc) and rutin based on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS + ) radical scavenging rate and Fe 3+ reducing power. Different concentrations of purified 3-DXA were applied to pork meat stored at 4 °C. After 11 days of storage, physiological and biochemical indices related to antioxidant and meat quality were determined. The results showed that 0.02% 3-DXA had the best antioxidant effects on pork meat within 11 days of storage at 4 °C based on a* value, pH value, purge loss, TBARS value, and total number of bacteria. The results in this study are helpful for the application of 3-deoxyanthocyanin to maintain the quality of pork meat and prolong the storage time at 4 °C.",

Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) and electronic nose technology were employed to detect and analyse the characteristic flavour of three types of venison prefabricated food samples, which underwent different reheating treatments. During the research, 41 distinct volatile compounds were identified from the venison prefabricated food samples. Following normalisation of ion peaks and three statistical analysis techniques, 21 types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected effectively from dishes reheated by air fryer. According to data analysed by the odour description database, the venison-containing dishes exhibited superior retention of wine and onion aromas upon reheating. The results of electronic nose detection indicated the presence of benzaldehyde, alcohols, aromatics, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and aliphatic aromatic substances in braised venison prefabricated vegetables; especially benzaldehyde and alcohols displayed similar aroma characteristics as detected by GC-IMS. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) identified key variables contributing significantly to the volatile flavour profiles in venison prepared vegetables across different reheating methods: The main odourants were ethanol, undecane D, 1-propanol, ethyl acetate (acetic acid ethyl ester), 3-methylbutan-1-ol, n -pentanal, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 1-butanol, butanal, and other 30 compounds (VIP &gt; 1).",

During the simulated intestinal digestion, free FA was released from FG under the action of pancreatin. Consequently, FA and FG were present in mixed micelles, and the proportion of free FA positively correlated with pancreatin activity, which improved the bioaccessibility of FA. During the colonic fermentation phase, we observed that FA could also be released from FG through the action of gut microbiota, but the content of FG in digestive residue was low, indicating that most of the FG was hydrolysed in the small intestine. This experiment helps to understand the absorption pathways and fate of FG during digestion and provides guidance for the utilisation of insoluble organic phenolic acids.",

In this study, the biological activities of Macrolepiota mastoidea mushroom were investigated. The total carbohydrate and protein contents of the mushroom and its antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, and antiproliferative properties were evaluated. According to the obtained data, the total carbohydrate and total protein contents of M. mastoidea were determined as an important indicator for the biological activities of the mushroom. In addition, the high levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds revealed that the mushroom exhibited strong antioxidant activity. The results obtained in tests such as DPPH and FRAP show that M. mastoidea has a high capacity to neutralise free radicals. In enzyme inhibition tests, significant effects were observed on acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, amylase, and glucosidase, suggesting that the mushroom may provide potential benefits in the treatment of neurological diseases and diabetes. In addition, it was determined that the antiproliferative effect against A549 lung cancer cell line was dose-dependent. These findings indicate that M. mastoidea is a valuable biological resource that can be used in health areas such as antioxidant defense, enzyme modulation, and cancer treatment. Advanced molecular and cellular studies are recommended to better understand the mechanisms of this effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Virgin olive oil is renowned for its high quality, health benefits, and antioxidant properties, primarily attributed to its unique composition of fatty acids, phenolic compounds, and tocopherols. This study aimed to evaluate the quality, physicochemical properties, as well as its application in margarine formulations. The olive oil was analysed for key quality parameters, tocopherols, and phenolic compositions, fatty acid profiles, and antioxidant activity. Margarine samples were prepared with varying levels of olive oil (10, 20, and 30%) and assessed for physicochemical properties and oxidative stability. Margarine samples enriched with olive oil were compared to a standard commercial margarine formulated with synthetic tocopherols. The olive oil used in this study exhibited low acidity (0.2%) and a high oleic acid content (70.94%). Analysis of polyphenols revealed that oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives were the most dominant (93.66 and 33 mg kg −1 , respectively). The olive oil contained 226.03 mg kg −1 of total tocopherols, with alpha-tocopherol being the most prevalent, comprising over 98%. The addition of olive oil did not influence the humidity, peroxide value, or pH of the formulated margarines but improved their spreadability and oxidative stability by increasing the induction time for oxidation. Margarine enriched with 20% olive oil demonstrated the best oxidative stability and desirable physical properties, making this concentration the most suitable for preparing margarine. This study highlights olive oil's potential as a natural antioxidant, enhancing margarine's nutritional and functional qualities, and serving as a healthier alternative to synthetic additives.",

A total of 89 VCs were identified, with concentrations ranging from 4,857 μg L −1 (SJ-6 cm) to 5,251 μg L −1 (SJ-9 cm). Alcohols (2,055–2,427 μg L −1 ) were the most abundant group, followed by terpenes (1,084–1,243 μg L −1 ). Statistical analysis revealed similarities in the alcohol and acid profiles between SJ-6 cm and SJ-L, as well as between SJ-3 cm and SJ-9 cm. Sensory evaluation demonstrated correlations between 58 VCs and panellist perceptions. As a result, it can be said that cutting the carrot in half lengthwise has an effect on the volatile profile and sensory qualities of SJ.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic insomnia, a common sleep disorder characterised by persistent difficulty in falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early, significantly affects cognitive function, mood, and overall health. Emerging research highlights a potential link between dietary habits, particularly the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), and the prevalence of chronic insomnia. Several mechanisms explain how UPFs may impair sleep. First, they are often deficient in key sleep-regulating nutrients like magnesium and tryptophan, essential for melatonin production. Second, their high sugar and refined carbohydrate content leads to blood sugar fluctuations, disrupting hormonal balance and the sleep-wake cycle. Third, chronic UPF consumption is associated with systemic inflammation, evidenced by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which can interfere with central nervous system regulation and sleep quality. Additionally, UPFs negatively alter the gut microbiome, impacting sleep through the gut-brain axis. Epidemiological studies consistently associate high UPF intake with shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality. Clinical trials further confirm that diets rich in added sugars and processed foods increase sleep disturbances compared to whole-food diets. Given the growing evidence, dietary interventions promoting whole, minimally processed foods may serve as an effective strategy for managing chronic insomnia and improving overall sleep health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) is widely favoured by consumers globally due to its delicate flesh, lack of intermuscular spines, and high protein content. Recent studies have shown that faba beans ( Vicia faba L.) can enhance the crisping characteristics of Nile tilapia muscle, a trait likely linked to the abundant antinutritional factors in faba beans. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of tannic acid (TA) at five different concentrations: 0 g kg −1 (TA1), 5 g kg −1 (TA2), 10 g kg −1 (TA3), 15 g kg −1 (TA4), and 20 g kg −1 (TA5) on the histological observation, muscle fibre structure, texture, proximate composition, and amino acid and fatty acid contents of Nile tilapia. The results indicated that with increasing TA concentration, the area and diameter of Nile tilapia muscle fibres significantly decreased, while fibre density significantly increased. TA significantly enhanced muscle hardness, and both adhesiveness and chewiness increased with higher concentrations. Additionally, TA treatment reduced protein content, while fat content significantly increased in the TA2, TA4, and TA5 groups. TA significantly reduced the content of total essential amino acids, total non-essential amino acids, and total umami amino acids. Among the total saturated fatty acids, the content in TA1 was similar to TA5, both significantly lower than in TA3 and TA4. These results demonstrate that inclusion of TA in tilapia diets modifies muscle fibre architecture and enhances textural properties, but at the cost of reduced protein and amino acid retention. Optimal TA supplementation must therefore strike a balance between textural benefits and nutritional quality in feed formulations.",

In this study, AgNPs were synthesised using tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) waste extract as a reducing and stabilising agent through a biological synthesis method. The synthesised AgNPs were characterised using several analytical techniques. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy confirmed their formation by detecting a distinct surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identified functional groups responsible for reducing Ag + ions to Ag 0 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the crystalline structure and spherical shape of the nanoparticles, while optical microscope analysis revealed spherical particle sizes smaller than 1 μm. The total flavonoid and phenolic content, along with total antioxidant capacity, demonstrated that the tomato waste extract obtained by maceration (TWEM) acts as a powerful antioxidant and free radical scavenger. The synthesised AgNPs exhibited notable antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus subtilis , and Escherichia coli , as well as antifungal activity against Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus niger . These findings suggest that AgNPs derived from tomato waste extracts can serve as effective, economical, antibacterial, and antifungal agents for diverse applications, including active packaging and environmental protection.",

Vinegars are typically abundant in organic acids and phenolic compounds. Research has established that vinegar possesses a range of health benefits, including antioxidant activity, the ability to regulate blood pressure, and the capacity to lower blood lipid levels, attributed to its bioactive components. In this study, vinegars were produced using a traditional method from two different sources: olive oil mill wastewater (OOW) and jujube fruit. Comparative analyses revealed that both vinegar types exhibited significantly elevated levels of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity when compared with commercial grape vinegar before and after in vitro digestion. The commercial grape vinegar had the highest bioaccessibility of total phenolic substances (85.89%). Grape vinegar showed the highest Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition value (IC 50 ) (9.06 ± 1.36 μL mL −1 ) and OOW vinegar had shown the highest acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) inhibition (11.77 ± 0.39 U/L).

    "abstract": "Abstract Anthropogenic climate change is reshaping fungal dynamics in European agro-ecosystems, favoring thermotolerant and xerotolerant species once restricted to tropical and subtropical zones. Among these, Aspergillus section Flavi poses a major concern due to its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins, particularly aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In this context, Aspergillus nomius , a known producer of both B- and G-series aflatoxins, has gained attention for its growing presence in non-tropical regions. We report the first confirmed isolation of A. nomius from a Hungarian crop, apple, marking its entry into the national food supply. Morphological characteristics aligned with species descriptions, and molecular identification was confirmed via ITS and β-tubulin gene sequencing. The isolate exhibited AFB1 production, highlighting its potential role in mycotoxin contamination in temperate environments. This discovery expands the known ecological range of A. nomius and supports evidence that aflatoxigenic fungi are shifting their distribution due to rising temperatures and altered environmental conditions. The detection of this high-risk species in a Central European crop underscores the urgent need to revise monitoring protocols and develop climate-adaptive mycotoxin management strategies. As fungal biodiversity rapidly adjusts to climatic pressures, integrated surveillance using morphological, molecular, and toxin-based approaches will be critical to ensuring food safety in increasingly vulnerable agro-ecosystems.",

Fresh-cut lettuce was exposed to 1, 5, 10, and 20 ppm of gaseous ozone for 2 min and then stored in clamshells at 4 °C for 15 days. Various physical and biochemical characteristics were monitored throughout the storage period, and the total aerobic count was determined on the final day of the experiment. Ozone demonstrated ameliorative effects on respiration rate and microbial load by suppressing both parameters. However, higher concentrations adversely affected titratable acidity, visual quality, and soluble solids, particularly after 10 days of storage. The study highlights the complex and multi-faceted impact of gaseous ozone on fresh-cut romaine lettuce, demonstrating that depending on the parameter, the effects may be beneficial, negligible, or detrimental.",

While IBS is a functional disorder without structural changes in the digestive tract, IBD is manifested in chronic and immune-mediated intestinal alterations. Globally, IBS is 10 times more prevalent than IBD, with IBS accounting for 11% of the population and contributing to a substantial proportion of gastroenterology consultations. In Hungary, approximately 15–20% of the adult population experiences gastrointestinal symptoms. Dietary approaches, such as the low-FODMAP diet, have been validated to alleviate symptoms in IBS patients and offer potential benefits for IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms. This randomised, single-blind, crossover study evaluated the effects of a low-FODMAP long-fermented yeast spelt bread compared to a gluten-free bread on symptoms and quality of life in individuals with IBS and IBD. The study highlights the potential for low-FODMAP long-fermented yeast spelt bread to serve as a practical and palatable alternative to gluten-free bread, emphasising the importance of preparation methods and ingredient selection. While promising, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to establish the broader applicability of these findings.",

Wa27 strain demonstrated the highest β-glucosidase and esterase activities, while Hu8 strain had better cellulase, protease, and pectinase activities. These five strains have good alcohol tolerance but low tolerance to acid and high temperature. Wa27 strain showed outstanding performance in producing compounds such as ethyl acetate, ethyl esters, and higher alcohols, among other. The Pk2 and Pkl3 strains of two Pichia spp. also showed relatively high content of ethyl acetate in fermented grains, with the latter significantly increasing the levels of acids such as lactic acid and volatile fatty acids. In contrast, Pg6, another Pichia sp., increased the content of benzenoid compounds, such as phenethyl alcohol, likely due to its high level of amino acid nitrogen. Sensory evaluation of Baijiu obtained through distillation verified the ability of several non- Saccharomyces yeasts species to improve the quality of Baijiu, especially Wa27 strain.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cinnamomum cassia (L.) polyphenols (CPs) exhibit diverse pharmacological activities. This study optimised ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of CPs and investigated their potential antidiabetic mechanisms. Response surface methodology identified optimal extraction conditions, yielding 4.093% extraction efficiency. Non-targeted metabolomics identified 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC (16:0)) and 1-oleoyl-glycerophosphocholine as major identified components, accounting for 10.49% and 6.97%, respectively. In an insulin-resistant LO2 cell model, CPs significantly promoted glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis while inhibiting key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Furthermore, CPs upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) production. CP exerts hypoglycaemic effects by activating the 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) axis. These findings reveal the antidiabetic potential of CPs and their underlying molecular mechanisms, providing a theoretical basis for the bioactive role of this traditional Chinese medicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to compare the flavour components of raspberries subjected to different drying methods in order to evaluate their impact on the fruit. By utilising headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in raspberries were detected under fresh, 60 °C drying, 80 °C drying, and freeze drying conditions. The results of the HS-GC-IMS showed that in all raspberry samples, a total of 73 peak signals and 64 VOCs were identified, including 27 aldehydes, 9 ketones, 12 esters, 4 alcohols, 5 alkenes, and 5 other VOCs. In addition, the results of PCA analysis, Euclidean distance analysis, and hierarchical clustering heat map analysis showed that raspberry samples from different conditions can be effectively distinguished based on their VOCs, indicating their consistency and variability. Different drying methods have a significant impact on the flavour profile of raspberries. From the analyses, it can be seen that there was an increase in aldehydes and ketones in freeze-dried raspberry and a decrease in esters in oven-dried raspberries compared to fresh raspberry. This work provides valuable information on understanding the volatile flavour compounds in raspberries and offers some references for future raspberry processing.",

This study investigated the hypolipidaemic and anti-inflammatory effects of wheat bread supplemented with 2% and 4% ethanolic onion ( Allium cepa L.) peel extract (OP) and 4% and 6% onion bulb powder (OB) in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. After 42 days of supplemented bread consumption, diabetic rats demonstrated significant reductions in blood glucose, insulin, and liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Additionally, the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly decreased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels improved. Notably, breads containing 4% OP and 6% OB significantly reduced the levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), indicating anti-inflammatory effect, though reductions in other inflammatory markers were not significant ( P &lt; 0.01). The results suggest that both OP and OB, particularly at 4% and 6% concentrations, respectively, demonstrate strong potential for incorporation into functional foods aimed at managing hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and inflammation in patients with diabetes.",

The study specifically highlights the consortium's potential for simultaneous methane and carbon dioxide utilisation in producing value-added bioproducts, including biofuels, single-cell proteins, single-cell oils, and biodegradable plastics. A comprehensive examination is presented regarding the underlying mechanisms of microbial cross-feeding, critical influencing factors (e.g., nutrient exchange dynamics, redox balance maintenance, and quorum sensing regulation), and system optimisation approaches for enhanced symbiotic efficiency. Current technical bottlenecks in industrial scalability are critically addressed, particularly focusing on reactor type, metabolic flux imbalances, and ecological stability maintenance in open systems. Future research directions are proposed to emphasise multi-omics-guided consortia design, synthetic biology-enabled metabolic pathway engineering, and AI-driven cultivation parameter optimisation. By synthesising cutting-edge findings from recent studies, this review establishes a systematic framework for understanding and engineering symbiotic microbial systems, ultimately contributing to the development of carbon-negative biomanufacturing platforms that align with circular economy principles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are gaining attention due to their enhanced bioavailability and potential use in functional food development. This preliminary study examined the ability of red and grey SeNPs to penetrate the eggshell and enrich internal egg components with selenium through external immersion treatments. Commercial eggs were treated with two concentrations (50 and 100 mg L −1 ) of red and grey SeNPs and analysed for selenium content in raw and boiled albumen and yolk. Results showed increased selenium deposition in SeNP-treated eggs compared to untreated controls, with the highest accumulation observed in the yolk. Red SeNPs, owing to their smaller size and amorphous structure, exhibited greater bioavailability and deposition efficiency than grey SeNPs. Boiling led to variable changes in selenium content, suggesting possible heat-induced structural transformations or retention effects. Due to the limited sample size and uncontrolled egg source, these findings should be interpreted as exploratory. Nonetheless, this study provides initial evidence that SeNPs can cross physical egg barriers and may inform future strategies for egg biofortification and future applications in animal nutrition and food science.",

Samples were stored at 4 °C, and physicochemical properties, microbiological quality, texture, and sensory attributes were monitored during storage. Results showed that the combination of chitosan and PE in edible coatings significantly inhibited lipid oxidation (lower TBARS values, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and microbial growth. While increasing PE concentration in direct addition reduced quality deterioration, the edible coating method produced similar protective effects with lower PE concentrations. Moreover, sensory analysis indicated that the strong odour and flavour of PE were better masked in coated samples. Overall, the chitosan–PE edible coating effectively preserved the quality, extended shelf life, and enhanced the sensory acceptability of chicken meatballs.",

    "abstract": "The near infrared spectra are useful information sources relating to quality (e.g. composition) of a material examined. To obtain and interpret useful information requires in most cases the application of sophisticated methods of mathematical statistics. A method different from those mentioned above, implementing a large scale data reduction based on geometrical consideration is the PQS. According to this method, the quality of a material can be characterised by the centre of its spectrum represented in a polar co-ordinate system. In many cases it is enough to know whether the investigated product deviates in a certain degree from a given \"standard product\" or not. This can be decided by determining special \"distances\" between the two (investigated and standard) products using their near infrared spectra. Besides the successfully used Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances a new one, the \"polar distance\" was introduced giving the distance between the two centres (quality points) of the spectra of the two products examined. A method was elaborated to select the optimal wavelength range giving the maximum normalised distance between the two quality points of the investigated products. The so called \"wavelength range optimisation\" can not be used to work with non spectral data sets. While in case of NIR spectra the sequence of the data are determined by nature, in several cases the order of the data can be freely varied and the goal is the determination of the optimal data sequence. By introducing the \"sequence optimisation\" PQS could be generalised and used from the field of near infrared spectroscopy to solve any kind of multivariate tasks. The advantage of the PQS optimisation method is its simplicity. Since PQS was developed to extract the needed information from NIR spectra, the basic principles of the technique are introduced with the help of near infrared spectra of some milk powder samples of different fat content. The sequence optimisation is demonstrated with the sensor signal responses of an electronic nose (chemosensor array) instrument measuring different steam distilled volatile oil samples.",

Antioxidant activities of different concentrations of native Croatian red and white wines are analysed by the inhibition of BR reaction and determination of total phenols using gallic acid as the calibration standard is also carried out. Using mathematical models, relative antioxidant activities of antioxidants and amounts of total phenols are estimated.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) served as basic frame of reference for the analysis of consumer's decisions towards fresh vegetables. Benefit beliefs were investigated through principal component analysis and used for belief-based market segmentation. Health and prevention, hedonism, and nutrition are found to be the main beliefs associated with eating fresh vegetables. Three distinct clusters with different socio-demographic composition, attitudes and behaviour emerged. The findings point towards a need for greater attention to young males in future health communication, irrespective of nationality. Polish consumers claim lower fresh vegetable intake, despite stronger health benefit beliefs as compared to Belgians. Potential explanations for cross-national differences may pertain to the availability and variety of fresh vegetables, particularly during winter time. Investigation of the TPB confirms a strong positive predictive link between attitude and behavioural intention of eating fresh vegetables, as well as between intention and behaviour in the strict sense. Perceived behavioural control and subjective norm were insignificant as determinants of behavioural intention in the TPB model.",

    "abstract": "The antioxidant activity of five phenols, i.e. catechol, homovanillyl alcohol, homovanillic acid, gallic acid and syringic acid, present in all olive oils has been investigated. For gallic acid and syringic acid the Bond Dissociation Enthalpy BDE(O-H) has been determined through the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy) based on radical equilibration technique as 81.0 and 82.1 kcal mol −1 , respectively. For both homovanillyl alcohol and homovanillic acid the BDE(O-H) values were assumed to be identical to that of the similar 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (82.8 kcal mol −1 ). The inhibition rate constants of the above compounds and of catechol in the autoxidation of cumene (or styrene) were also determined in acetonitrile/chlorobenzene solution and corrected for hydrogen bonding by acetonitrile. The results indicate that in organic solvents gallic acid and catechol are fairly good antioxidants, while homovanillyl alcohol, homovanillic acid and syringic acid, i.e. the three 2-methoxy substituted derivatives, are much less efficient antioxidants.",

Compounds favouring spirit quality are found in the first half of the distillate. Some compounds imparting aromatic defects could be eliminated by removing a percentage of heads during distillation. In contrast, when distilling ciders without defects, removing heads would not be justified, as their incorporation in the final distillate should lead to obtaining spirits with higher aromatic riches. Tails, however, which are mainly constituted by unpleasant aromas, must be rigorously removed to avoid incorporating compounds that could reduce the quality of the final product.",

Sensory acceptance tests were performed after 7 and 14 days of storage at 4±1 °C, using a 9-point hedonic scale to evaluate flavour, texture and overall acceptability. The population of La-5 and BL04 remained at 7.0 log CFU g −1 and at 8.0 log CFU g-1, respectively, during storage for up to 28 days. After 7 and 14 days of storage, cheese T4 presented the highest sensory acceptance for all attributes evaluated and differed significantly from the other cheeses (P<0.05). After 14 days of storage, cheese T3 presented the lowest acceptance and differed significantly from the other cheeses (P<0.05). The supplementation of petit-suisse cheese T4 with both La-5 and BL04 in coculture with a starter culture resulted in a product with high probiotic populations during storage and excellent sensory acceptance. The results also showed that, when added separately, La-5 and BL04 did not affect the sensory acceptability of petit-suisse cheese.",

This work mainly focused on the immobilization of polygalacturonase from Aspergillus niger Van Tieghem (MTCC 3323) on Nylon-6 by covalent binding, keeping in view its applicability in apple juice clarification. The immobilized enzyme was characterized in terms of kinetic parameters, thermal stability and reusability. The enzyme was immobilized onto glutaraldehyde-activated Nylon-6 by covalent binding and the efficiency of immobilization was found to be 40%. The immobilization yielded a protein loading of 70 μg g −1 of Nylon-6. Immobilized enzyme showed maximum activity at a temperature of 50 °C and pH 5.0. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0–5.5. The immobilized enzyme could be reused through 4 cycles with almost 50% retention of its original activity. It had increased thermostability over its soluble form at 25 °C and 45 °C. Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were found to be 7.6 mg ml −1 and 41.66 μmol of galacturonic acid/ml/min, respectively. The immobilized enzyme when used for apple juice clarification showed about 50% increase in transmittance of apple juice at 650 nm. This increase was observed at enzyme concentration of 20 U ml −1 apple juice, temperature 50 °C and incubation time of one hour. The optimization of these factors, which affect the stability and productivity of the immobilized system, resulted in an increase in enzyme stability and the possibility of economic application of immobilized enzyme at large scale apple juice clarification.",

The most important active agent of the drug is the essential oil which influences both the aroma and the effect of the tea. Most frequent monoterpene components of the oil are 1,8-cineole, camphor, borneol and α- and β-pinenes. Among sesquiterpene compounds, chamazulene, caryophyllene and oxides, as well as germacrene are to mention. Intrageneric and intraspecific chemical variability is a characteristic feature. Composition of the oil is highly variable, data on heritability are scarce. Differences in the oil composition have been detected in consequence of ontogenesis and organic differentiation. The influence of ecological factors (altitude, association, nutrients, etc.) seems to be an indirect one. Oils produced by different extraction methods, may show diverse composition.In the practice, variability of essential oil content and composition often degrades the quality of the raw materials for herbal teas. Solution may be development of agrotechnology and utilisation of standard cultivars.",

The results showed that the significant variable for the acceptance of breaded fish was age. According to the linear model and the descriptive statistics, an inverse relationship exists between the acceptance of breaded fish in school meals and the age of the children, possibly a consequence of the children being more critical in their food preference with the rising age, making the insertion of a new food that is not part of their eating behaviour more difficult.",

The PEF treatment was carried out using a laboratory unit set with a bipolar pulse (4 μs wide), an intensity of 35 kV cm−1, and a frequency of 1200 pulses per second (pps). Enzyme inactivation and colour changes of the treated juices were compared, using a non-treated sample as control. Enzyme residual activities of pectinmethylesterase (PME) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO), as well as the chroma index for colour, showed statistical difference between treatments. No statistical significant difference was observed for the hue colour index. PEF could be considered a feasible alternative for producing pasteurised and stable apple juice.",

    "abstract": "Rheum ribes L. (Polygonaceae) is a common species of rhubarb in Turkey, which is also found in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Russia. The antioxidant potency of stems was investigated employing various in vitro systems, such as lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide anion radical scavenging, ferric reducing power, metal chelation activity. R. ribes stem parts showed strong inhibitory activity toward lipid peroxidation of rat brain homogenate induced by the FeCl3-ascorbic acid system. R. ribes extract was able to reduce the stable free radical DPPH 83.9±1.90% at 150 μg ml−1. The reducing power of the extract was 0.46±0.074 at 250 μg ml−1. The effect of extract of R. ribes on DNA cleavage induced by UV-photolysis of H2O2 using pBluescript M13+ plasmid DNA was also investigated. This extract significantly inhibited DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These findings demonstrate that aqueous extract from fresh stems of R. ribes has antioxidant activity and thus have great potential as a source for natural health products.",

Additionally, 79 volunteers participated in sorting sushi among other 14 popular meals in the Czech Republic, according to their assumed situations. The results indicate that sushi is highly accepted among Czech consumers (more than 80% of respondents consume sushi) due to sensory characteristics and health benefit claims of sushi. The main barrier for sushi acceptance is sushi being a cold meal. The study emphasized that sushi price highly influences not only consumption frequency but also acceptance of sushi among respondents who declared not consuming this type of meal.",

    "abstract": "The positive nutritional impact of dietary fibres (DF) gives growing interest to their role in the formation of wheat product quality. Although we are getting closer to characterize the effect of DF on the end use quality, the roles of individual components are not well described yet. Arabinoxylans (AX) are the main compounds of wheat DF, therefore getting more knowledge about its behaviour in wheat based food systems, like dough or end products, could be useful from both theoretical and practical points of view. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the AX content on wheat flour quality using a dough model system provided by blends of flour and AX isolate. Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) and recently developed micro Zeleny test were used for characterization of mixtures. We found that although Zeleny values are basically related to protein-dependent quality, the addition of AX isolate has major impact on the sedimentation volume of flour. In the RVA studies we demonstrated that AX has influence not only on the viscosity values but also on the rate of viscosity change. The effect of AX addition was compared to that of starch addition and was corrected by the rate of dilution. The model system and the experimental method applied here can be suitable to separate the individual effects of non-starchy carbohydrates.",

Olive oils showed strong relations among oxidation stability, tocopherol content, total phenols content, and antiradical actvity of phenol extracts and these parameters decreased with maturation. Nevertheless, higher amounts of trans-2-hexenal were found in the oil from ripe olives than from unripe and overripe olives.

Under optimal conditions, the specific growth rate is µ opt = 2.84 ± 0.08 h −1 .

In this review, their role in high carbohydrate-containing, starchy foods are reviewed and discussed. Both the effects as functional ingredients affecting the structural properties of starch and as active ingredients slowing down starch digestion and, as a consequence, decreasing the glycaemic index of starchy foods are overviewed without considering the traditional applications as carriers and stabilisers of aroma and flavour, essential oils, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and other bioactive components to enrich foods, even if they are carbohydrate foods. The effect on starch metabolism is explained by the structural transformations caused by cyclodextrins on starch amylose and amylopectin. Several examples are shown how the technological and sensorial properties of bread, rice products, pasta, and other starchy foods are modified by cyclodextrin supplementation, and how the digestibility is changed resulting in reduced glycaemic and insulinaemic effects.",

Flavonoid compounds were more abundant than phenol carboxylic acids in the leaves; however, their proportion was equal in the case of the roots. Nettle leaf extracts had remarkable antimicrobial activity, the spring extracts were more efficient than the autumn ones. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to every leaf extract, while Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had reduced but remarkable sensitivity patterns. Among the yeasts, Candida glabrata was strongly inhibited by the aqueous leaf extracts. Most of the strains were insensitive to the root extracts, although Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by the root and not the leaf extracts.",

The aim of this study was to describe the use of smartphone, tablet, and television (TV) during breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a sample of Spanish children from three months up to five years. A cross-sectional study was performed using a convenience sample, with 410 parents of Spanish children aged three months to five years. Data were collected from March 2021 to March 2022 using an ad hoc , self-administered, online questionnaire. Prevalence of use of smartphone, tablet, and TV during meals were calculated overall and according to characteristics of the child (i.e., sex and age of the child, having siblings, having older siblings) and characteristics of the respondent (i.e., relationship with the child, age, educational level). Chi-squared tests of independence were carried out to explore the association between smartphone, tablet, and TV usage and independent variables. The prevalence of use of any screen device was 18.3% during breakfast, 18.5% during lunch, and 19.0% during dinner. The percentage of smartphone, tablet, and TV use was higher in children aged two to five years compared to those from three months to two years, with statistically significant differences in the percentage of TV use during lunch and dinner between the two age groups and in the percentage of tablet use during dinner. In addition, the probability of using each of the devices at each of the meals was lower for children of parents with university educational level than for children of parents with non-university educational level. Overall, the use of screen devices during the mealtimes in this sample of children in Spain is high. Screen time should be avoided during mealtimes to encourage healthier behaviours, such as family communication and learning proper eating habits.",

These compounds are integral to energy metabolism, facilitating mitochondrial transport of long-chain fatty acids, cytosolic export of short-chain fatty acids, stabilisation of the mitochondrial coenzyme A to acetyl-CoA ratio, preservation of membrane integrity, and reduction of lactate production. While carnitine profiles in various fruits and vegetables have been extensively studied, data on its presence in pomegranates remains limited. This study aims to elucidate the carnitine composition in five pomegranate cultivars using LC-MS/MS analysis. Results indicate significantly higher concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine in the Suruç variety, alongside other notable acylcarnitines, including propionylcarnitine, hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine, adipoylcarnitine, and oleylcarnitine. These findings position pomegranate as a promising dietary component with potential health benefits attributed to its carnitine content.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dry heat treatment (roasting) conditions on the physicochemical and sensory properties of crispy pork lard, contributing to the sustainable valorisation of pork by-products. Pork lards were roasted at various temperatures (150–200 °C) for durations of 90–180 min, using response surface methodology design to develop, improve, and optimise the process. The roasted pork lards were evaluated for moisture, lipid, colour, and sensory properties using standard methods. Effect of roasting conditions on properties were modelled and optimised. The roasting conditions significantly influenced the chemical, colour, and sensory properties of the final product. Roasting at 184 °C for 146 min was the optimal condition, achieving a desirability of 78.8%. This work demonstrates the utility of controlled roasting processes to sustainably fractionate underutilised pork by-products into food ingredients with commercial value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pepper is one of the most economically important vegetable crops grown and consumed in Tunisia. Interest in assessing bioactive compounds with antioxidant capacity and potential health benefits in pepper and pepper-based products is increasing. There is limited information undertaking the chemical properties and quality of commercial red-hot pepper pastes (harissa) in Tunisia compared to traditionally prepared varieties. The variability in ascorbic acid, phenolic, and carotenoid contents and antioxidant activity of ten red-hot pepper pastes covering almost the commercial types available in Tunisian hypermarkets were determined and compared with traditionally processed harissa. Ascorbic acid, phenolic, and carotenoid contents and antioxidant activity varied significantly between different red-hot pepper paste. Traditional home-processed harissa outperformed different commercial pepper pastes in terms of bioactive compounds. Ascorbic acid varied from 57.33 to 210.41 mg/100 g FW. The levels of phenolics in different studied red-hot pepper paste varied from 207.34 to 317.24 mg GAE/100 g FW. Significant differences were found also in carotenoids content between different red-hot pepper pastes (coded as CH1-10) ranging from 284.78 mg β-CaE/kg FW in ‘CH2’ to 761.69 mg β-CaE/kg FW in ‘CH8’. ‘CH9’ showed the highest antioxidant activity attaining 2,812 μmol TE/100 g FW. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity was negatively and significantly correlated with ascorbic acid content ( r = −0.700; P &lt; 0.05) and carotenoids content ( r = −0.674; P &lt; 0.05). This study highlighted the variability in different commercial hot pepper pastes consumed in Tunisia, with respect to quality attributes, and showed the importance of optimising a traditional-like process to create new labels and quality suitable for new consumer demands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study characterises sugars extracted from Pachyrhizus erosus (L.) Urb. using hot water extraction at 80 °C. The extract was analysed for total sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar, total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoid content (TFC), and DPPH radical-scavenging activity. Structural analysis confirmed the core inulin structure and identified sucrose, glucose, and fructose via gel permeation chromatography and 1 H NMR. FT-IR spectroscopy verified characteristic sugar functional groups, and scanning electron microscopy revealed a flat-flake morphology. The extract exhibited high levels of bioactive compounds, with TPC and TFC measured at 859.6 ± 2.6 mg GAE/g and 106.5 ± 2.0 mg QE/g, respectively. Antioxidant activity showed an IC 50 of 228.7 ± 6.3 μg mL −1 . Enzyme inhibition assays yielded IC 50 values of 374.1 ± 2.9 μg mL −1 for α-glucosidase and 79.5 ± 1.3 μg mL −1 for α-amylase. The total sugar content was 84.6 ± 0.0%, comprising 21.5 ± 0.2% reducing sugars and 63.0 ± 0.2% non-reducing sugars. These findings indicate that P. erosus extract is a rich source of natural antioxidants with potential applications in the food industry, particularly for the prevention and management of diabetes.",

This mycotoxin is a common contaminant of various foods including cereal products, spices, dried vine fruits, coffee, cocoa, beer and wine. Apart from cereal products, beer and wine contribute significantly to ochratoxin exposure of humans. In the Mediterranean region of Europe, the black Aspergillus species are the sources of ochratoxin contamination of grape products. In this study, we examined the source of ochratoxin contamination of grapes in Hungary and the Czech Republic. The mycobiota of grape berries from 25 Hungarian and Czech vineyards was examined. Potential ochratoxin producing fungi were only identified in grapes from Southern Hungary. Among the 16 black Aspergillus strains isolated, 12 belong to the A. niger species, and 10 produced small amounts (1.5–10 μg kg −1 ) of ochratoxin A in a liquid medium. We could also identify an A. tubingensis isolate which produced 3.5 μg kg −1 ochratoxin A in a liquid medium at pH 6.0. However, the amount of ochratoxin A produced was very low even in a medium which is favourable for mycotoxin production, and ochratoxin A was not detected in any of the grape juice, must and wine samples examined, indicating the absence of health hazard to costumers. Other potentially toxigenic fungi including Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium expansum and Alternaria species were also isolated. Further studies are in progress to evaluate the importance of these fungi in food safety.",

The hyperlipidemic rat model is suitable to study the physiological effect of table beet on the metabolic alterations and the redox homeostasis in the liver. In fatty liver, as a consequence of hyperlipidemy, the redox homeostasis is strongly injured. General biologically active compounds of table beet have indirect lipid lowering effect and antioxidant properties. Therefore, the effect of lyophilised table beet powder was studied on altered lipid metabolism and redox parameters in hyperlipidemic rats. Hyperlipidemy was induced by a fat-rich diet, and both in the control group and in the hyperlipidemic group, animals were treated with the lyophilised table beet powder (2 g bwkg −1 ) added into rat chow for 10 days parallel with the feeding. Significant antioxidant activity of table beet was recorded in the hyperlipidemic liver. This phenomenon was expected because of the significant amount of betanin and the high total polyphenol content of the beet. Significant beneficial changes were also observed in the serum cholesterol level, alkaline phosphatase and alanine-aminotransferase activities, although a non-expected elevation was observed in the serum bilirubin level in hyperlipidemy. Non-specific H-donor activity was not changed, but protein related free SH-group concentration was decreased in the plasma. Serum triglyceride level was better after table beet treatment in normolipidemy, only. Change of redox-homeostasis was more favourable in the liver during the treatment. Diene conjugate content and the level of induced free radicals decreased during the table beet treatment in case of fatty liver. These changes were due to the bioactive components of the commercially available table beet. Consequently, table beet due to its specific qualities beneficially influences several metabolic pathways, therefore it can be considered as a functional food.",

    "abstract": "In our investigations the membrane filtration of quality wines (Tokaji Hárslevelű and Egri Bikavér) — based on diafiltration principles, applying nanofiltration membranes — has been studied. For the diafiltration experiments a relatively dense nanofiltration membrane NF 45 has been used, while for simple wine concentrations a membrane developed for organic components rejection NF200 has been investigated. The mixture of the retarded wine compounds was considered the main product of the process. The permeate that crossed the membrane was handled as the by product. Separated wine samples and the original wines have been subjected to gas chromatographic analysis: according to the results the partition of the main components and aroma compounds of the samples was approximately equal between the main and by-product. Membrane separation has been applied in accordance with a \"prelaborated\" experimental plan, when completing it the effect of operational parameters on the effectiveness of the process has been evaluated and analysed. By mathematical modelling of the phenomenon empirical and quasiempirical relations were set up, and solutions for the practical realization of the procedure were searched for. Our new model describes the filtration efficiency with our new index in the function of the operational parameters' influence. The significance of the relation is, that the knowledge of the wine-constants might promote the expedient choice of the membrane, which is a primary aspect in planning and creating the process optimal.",

Our measurements were started by qualification of cereal/pseudo-cereal grains. Next malts were made of them with different steeping, germination and kilning parameters, and their most important quality characteristics were determined. Qualification of grains were done by grading, determination of thousand-kernel and hectolitre weight, and protein content, while malts were examined with congress mashing, Hartong mashing and lauter test, as well. Gelatinization point of the starch found in grains and malts were determined by Brabender amyloviscograph which helped to set the temperature of β-amylase rest in future mashings. The gelatinization points were higher in our samples, than in the barley’s starch.Optimization of mashing was continued with malts that fulfilled requirements needed for brewing. Mashing programs were written for each raw material with the help of our laboratory mashing equipment, and resulting worts were analysed (for extract content), then carbohydrate content was measured by HPLC, α-amylase activity by Phadebas test, and free α-amino nitrogen (FAN) content by the ninhydrin method. Those worts were selected for further fermentation tests that had the highest extract and FAN content, best filtration time and appropriate sensory characteristics. Optimal malting temperatures and time periods, aeration and water uptake were determined, and then the duration and temperature of protein and enzyme rests of mashing were set.The malting process that proved to be the most suitable for brewing requirements (high extract content, good lautering characteristics, high FAN content) has the following parameters: steeping with 25 °C water for 18 h with aeration in every 5 h; germination at 15 °C for 84 h; kilning at 50 °C for 48 h.",

Two monofloral honey types, dark-coloured chestnut and light-coloured acacia honey were added to cow's and goat's milk before fermentation. Different mathematical and statistical models were used to describe the kinetics of fermentation in all analysed samples. The basic hypothesis of this study was that addition of honey could influence fermentation kinetics in both types of milk. Comprehensive kinetic analyses suggested complex interaction between all components in fermented milk samples. The results presented in this paper showed that addition of both types of honey had a stimulatory effect on the growth of Lactobacillus casei Lc-01 in cow's and goat's milk. Addition of acacia honey significantly stimulated (P<0.05) the growth of Lactobacillus casei Lc-01 in cow's and goat's milk. This resulted in higher number of Lactobacillus casei cells, as well as in lower pH values of the samples with addition of acacia honey. Furthermore, goat's milk was fermented faster than cow's milk. Calculated values of selected kinetic parameters showed that the critical period of fermentation kinetics, when influence of honey proved stimulatory, was between 10th and 20th hour of the fermentation.",

However, in the past few decades, importance of triticale is increasing globally. Therefore, the determination of nutritionally important parameters of triticale and study of their genetic and environmental (G×E) variability have essential importance. In this study, ten hexaploid triticales along with reference wheat and rye varieties were grown at two locations in Hungary in a three-year-long experiment. Crude protein (8.6–16.3%), crude fat (0.86–1.98%), starch (57.6–65.0%), and dietary fibre values (7.5–13.7%) showed notable differences, significant genotype control were detected in all tested parameters except ash content (1.42–2.10%). The analysis of variance confirmed that crop year affected all traits, and also location had significant effect on the formation of protein and – to a lesser extent – the fibre levels. Furthermore, interactions between the effects were observed. Generally, nutritional characteristics of triticales were positioned between wheat and rye in this experiment; however, there were notable differences between the genotypes, and also the magnitudes of environmental effects were significant. Nutritional values of triticale provide a prospect for food production and human consumption.",

The dynamics of the extraction process was monitored daily during maceration by analysing the anthocyanins in the must using HPLC. The results showed that the anthocyanin composition of young wines was different from that of the grapes. The proportions of malvidin-3- glucoside and malvidin-acetate were higher in wines than in the grape skins, but this was not the case for malvidin coumarate.

Roseroot is difficult to cultivate and develops very slowly in its natural environment, justifying development of new methods for production of its bioactive compounds. Different methods such as in vitro cell, tissue, and callus culture accompanied by some biotransformation trials have been carried out in the last two decades, but no feasible example has been developed for a large scale and industrial production of roseroot glycosides. To achieve a clear understanding of how to design any of roseroot in vitro culture systems to maximize the content of its specific natural products, the knowledge of a real biosynthetic pathway of these glycosides is necessary and indispensible. In this review article we are going to summarize the attainments and scientific results from molecular genetics of shikimate pathway in higher plants to give further clarification of salidroside and cinnamyl alcohol glycosides biosynthetic pathway.

    "abstract": "Four ecotypes of pomegranate fruits growing in the Salento area were characterized for their content in terms of total phenols, sugars, organic acids, anthocyanins, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. The results showed that in the fruit juice the amount of phenols ranged between 0.8–1.7 g l−1; the content in terms of simple sugars was about 140 g l−1, while the amount of citric and malic acids ranged between 1.4–13.3 and 0.8–7.7 g l−1, respectively. Seven anthocyanin pigments were found; these were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively by HPLC-DAD-MS and identified as delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside, delphinidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-arabinoside. The antioxidant activity, determined as DPPH scavenger and TEAC, ranged between 17.2 and 39.1% and between 9 and 19 μmol Trolox per ml of juice, respectively. All the pomegranate juices showed an anti-inflammatory activity (measured by COX inhibitory assay) which was compared with two commercial anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen and Nimesulide).",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of superficial treatment of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with dihydroquercetin (DHQ) solutions on the hydrolytic and oxidative changes in fish lipids during refrigerated storage. It was found that treatment with DHQ solution (1.0 g l−1) reduced approximately twice the free fatty acids content of chilled stored salmon. After 11 days of storage at 1 °С, the contents of hydroperoxides (HPO) and 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of these samples decreased with 45.00 and 0.91 mg MDA/kg, respectively. The share of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in control and experimental samples did not differ significantly (P>0.05). Results obtained show that the superficial treatment of salmon with DHQ solution (1.0 g l−1) delayed the hydrolytic and oxidative changes in fish lipids significantly, thus preserving the salmon freshness up to 11 days of storage at 1 °С.",

The physical properties of honey make it versatile and applicable to several industries. High consumer demand for honey consequently leads to widespread adulteration. In the present study, fifteen honey samples were collected from various parts of Kerala, India and classified into three categories: market samples, raw/wild samples, and industrial samples. The samples were then analysed for the following parameters: organoleptic features, physicochemical properties, biochemical characteristics, and microbiological state. The values obtained for physicochemical and biochemical analysis were compared to Standard values provided by the Bureau of Indian Standards. It was found that no honey ideally conformed to all parameter standards. Some samples clearly indicated conditions of improper handling. All honey samples showed significant polyphenol content. Although honey samples showed increased microbial growth upon dilution, they were also found to have effective antimicrobial properties. Significant links between moisture content, yeast count, and non-conformity in honey were determined, which highlights the necessity of proper storage conditions.",

The results show how the characteristics of packaging could deeply affect wine quality as a function of the storage conditions used, and suggest that with their rational optimization the quality of red wine during storage can be kept and its shelf life extended. In this context, the kinetic characterization of the time evolution of some chemical compounds that can be assumed as indexes of wine oxidation rate could enhance the consumer’s enjoyment during tasting. Under the adopted experimental conditions, the rate of wine aging was higher when the storage temperature increased. Furthermore, after 12 months of storage at room temperature, the glass bottles generally better preserved red wine from oxidation than multilayer Tetrabriks®.",

Increased concentration of both hydrocolloids redounded to improvements in physical stability, apparent viscosity, flow behaviour, and viscoelastic properties compared to the control sample. Fitting the data to Herschel—Bulkley model showed a decrease in flow behaviour index, while consistency coefficient (k) increased. Furthermore, for samples containing inulin and starch, G ′ was greater than G ″, unlike control sample. Indeed, contribution of long-chain inulin at concentrations above 1.18% and modified starch at above 0.3% promote the formation of gel network structure. The expected viscosity increases in the continuous phase in the presence of starch, and also the interactions established between inulin and yoghurt casein aggregates seem to be responsible in the improvement observed in physical characteristics of the product. Among the concentrations studied here, two samples, containing 2% inulin and 0.5% modified starch and 1.18% inulin and 0.58% modified starch, respectively, were recognized as functional doogh samples presenting premier physicochemical and rheological properties.",

Sensory attributes show distinct patterns for coffees, their blends, and substitutes, but no significant differences between substitutes from different raw materials were found, except for chicory. Although coffees have generally higher antioxidant capacities than their substitutes, these latter, especially chicory-based products, are also valuable antioxidant sources, as only half of them had significantly lower polyphenol and antioxidant contents when compared to coffee.

    "abstract": "The addition of synthetic CLA is a possible way in order to compose foods enriched with conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs). The most environmental friendly methods for CLA synthesis are based on microbial biosynthesis. With homogeneous catalysis using organometallic catalysts (Ru and Rh complexes) high (approximately 80%) yields were obtained with high selectivity related to bioactive isomers. The heterogeneous catalysis has the advantage that at the end of the reaction there is no need for a supplementary separation operation or recycling of the catalyst. In heterogeneous process, the maximum yield may even be higher than 90% and the selectivity remains quite high as the reaction conditions are optimized. The substrates for obtaining CLAs are, in general, linoleic acid or alkyl linoleates and the catalysis is acidic. The yield and the selectivity depend on the strength and the type of acidic sites, as well as on the size distribution of the particles. Beside the existing catalytic methods, a photocatalytic process with UV and visible light irradiation with iodine promoter can be applied.",

The ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) were evaluated for further investigation. The major constituents in EEP were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. All EEP samples were active against Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus), but no activity was found against Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). The mean diameters of growth inhibition of the EEP ranged between 8.05 and 21.4 mm. The propolis extract obtained from Sidi bel Abbés (SFS-SBA) was more active than other samples as well as showed unique HPLC profile. These results support the idea that propolis can be a promising natural food preservative in food industry and alternative candidate for management of bacterial infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms.",

The results of the treatments were compared with respect to alcohol concentration, sugar content, and acidity. The results proved that sugar content of the treated samples rapidly decreased compared to the control sample, and fermentation time was 40% shorter in the fastest case.

To date, phytase has been mostly produced in solid state fermentations with insignificant production volumes. Thus, there is a need to produce phytase in submerged fermentations, which can be scaled-up for commercial productions. Additionally, optimization of fermentation medium has not been studied well in the literature. Therefore, this study has been undertaken to improve Aspergillus ficuum phytase production in submerged fermentations by optimizing important nutrients in the fermentation medium (glucose, Na-phytate, and CaSO 4 ) using Box-Behnken design of Response Surface Methodology. Also, effects of pH and temperature on phytase activity were studied. Optimum glucose, Na-phytate, and CaSO 4 concentrations were determined as 126, 14, and 1.1 g l –1 , respectively. Additionally, pH 5.5 and 55 ºC were determined as optimum for the produced A. ficuum phytase activity. Under these conditions, phytase activity was increased to 3.45 U ml –1 , which is about 50% higher than the previous results. Furthermore, the lowest activity loss was observed under 4 ºC storage conditions during 1 week of storage.",

Aqueous extraction methods were employed to isolate oleosomes from hazelnuts, revealing approximately 83.07% fat and 2.48% protein content in hazelnut oleosomes. The stability of oleosomes at various pH levels (3–10) was examined, showing stability at pH 7 but instability at extreme pH values. Evaluation at pH 7 indicated small particle size (D 3,2 ≈ 3.58 μm) and a ζ-potential of approximately −33.8 mV for isolated oleosomes. Subsequently, double emulsions were formulated by substituting traditional oil with varying oleosome concentrations (0–30%) in liquid margarine. Rheological and oxidative analyses of these margarines demonstrated decreased elastic and viscous moduli, hardness, and spreadability, alongside enhanced oxidative stability with increasing oleosome concentration. These findings suggest hazelnut-derived oleosomes offer significant stability advantages over conventional liquid margarine, presenting a promising avenue for functionally enhanced food products in the food industry.",

The extraction efficiency of SGs depends on several factors, such as solvent type, solid to solvent ratio, centrifugal force, and temperature. This study aimed to compare the effects of different solvents (ethanol and water) and leaf moisture (dry and fresh) on the extraction efficiency of major steviol glycosides (SGs) of rebaudioside A (Reb A), stevioside (ST), and rebaudioside C (Reb C) in stevia (var. Levent 93) plant. A Box–Behnken design was used to optimise the extraction parameters for each extraction type. The results showed that ethanol was a more effective solvent than water, however, aqueous extraction was more environmentally friendly and low-cost, and could also yield high concentrations of SGs when fresh leaves were used. The major SGs had similar concentrations in ethanolic extraction, but Reb A was twice as high as ST in aqueous extraction. Reb C was influenced by the solid to solvent ratio in both extraction types, but more so in water extraction. Temperature had a positive effect on ST and Reb C in water extraction of fresh leaves, but not in water extraction of dry leaves or ethanolic extraction. The results of this study contribute to the optimisation of SGs extraction from stevia leaves and provide insights for future research on the effects of different solvents and extraction parameters on the quality and purity of SGs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel magnetic molecular-imprinted polymer (MMIP) was used to selectively extract folic acid directly from real samples. Folic acid was used as template molecule, Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 -3-triethoxysilyl-propyl-acrylamide as functional monomer, azobisisobutyronitrile as initiation, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker agent, and acrylamide as the secondary monomer in a mixed ethanol-water solvent. The effect of different parameters on the extraction efficiency was studied, and the optimum conditions were established as follows: the concentrations of crosslinking and template were fixed at 0.05 and 0.06 g, absorption percentage was 96.5, pH was adjusted to 8, and extraction time was 8 h with a temperature of 25 °C. By examining the effect of pH, we tried to investigate the effect of the amide groups that present in MMIP and its intermolecular hydrogen interaction with folic acid. After optimising the effective parameters in polymer synthesis and adsorption rate, a magnetic imprinting dispersive solid-phase extraction method combined with fluorescence spectrophotometry at λem = 367 nm (MMIP-DSPE-FL) was constructed for sensitive determination of folic acid in tomato samples. The limit of quantification (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) values were 30.00 ± 0.01 μg L −1 and 10.00 ± 0.03 μg L −1 , respectively, after the MMIP-DSPE preconcentration. Three tomato samples were analysed to give recoveries in the range of 80.2–81.6%, with relative standard deviation values below 0.6% ( n = 3). The prepared MMIP-DSPE showed high selectivity toward folic acid, which could be used six times without changing adsorption capacity. The adsorption isotherm of the folic acid-imprinted polymer pursued the Langmuir model (R L = 0.029), and the kinetics model followed pseudo-first-order ( R 2 = 0.9974).",

Astringency removal treatment caused an immediate increase of acetaldehyde and ethanol, nearly to the same extent as in conventionally ripened or stored fruit.

The results point to a significant (PL0.05) interaction between casing type and raking as regards total bacteria and fluorescent pseudomonads in all three experiments both after the induction of fructification and after the second flush.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the nutritional habits and lifestyle practice of elderly people living in their own home. Altogether 213 subjects (men over 65 years, women over 60 years), were recruited randomly from a primary care office in Budapest. Nearly 60% of people had three meals per day, but the number of meals increased during ageing. The most substantial meal was the lunch. Meals were prepared at home by 90% of the elderly. Lard for cooking was used by 44% of subjects. Additional use of salt was never mentioned by 18% of seniors only. Milk, dairy products, fish, fruits, fresh vegetables and vegetable dish were consumed far below the recommendations. All types of meat were radically decreased, especially beef compared to former Hungarian surveys and the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. Almost one-third of the elderly took some kind of vitamins and/or mineral supplements. The average time spent with outdoor activity was only 12 h per week.In relation to non-infectious diseases connected with nutrition, the irregular consumption of food has to be underlined. The insufficient consumption of milk and dairy products may have an unfavourable effect on the bone status. Deficient consumption of fruits, vegetables and cereals may play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of tumours. The exaggerated salt intake has to be taken into account mainly in hypertension. The inadequate physical activity may be also responsible for decreased longevity of our population.",

During days 1, 3, and 9 of storage the changes in acidity (pH value and lactic acid percent), viable counts of streptococci and lactobacilli and aroma components (acetaldehyde and diacetyl) were determined. Lower pH values and smaller lactic acid concentrations were found in control yoghurt samples. Viable counts of streptococci decreased during storage (from 1.01×10 8 to 3.97×10 7 CFU ml -1), whereas the viable counts of lactobacilli increased in all samples (from 6.95´10 6 to 2.32×10 7 CFU ml -1). The increase in count of lactobacilli was the greatest in goat's milk yoghurt samples. On the ninth day of storage, ?logN between cow's and goat's milk yoghurt samples was 0.2. Acetaldehyde in yoghurts decreased during storage time from 5.47 mg kg -1 (on day 1) to 1.05 mg kg -1 (on day 9). Both control yoghurt samples had lower acetaldehyde concentration than the supplemented samples. During nine days of storage, a significant increase in diacetyl content of yoghurt samples (from 14.20 mg kg -1 on the first day to 18.65 mg kg -1 on day 9) was noticed. goat's milk yoghurts, especially that manufactured without milk powder addition, had very soft consistency, but no syneresis was observed.",

The colour coordinates of the mixture of paprika grist samples can be determined as the averages of the colour coordinates weighted with the mass fractions of the samples contributing in the mixture (basic samples).

In this study, the rheological properties of four varieties of rice flour were studied using a 50 g Farinograph demonstrating the mixing properties of rice flours and the alterations of these properties caused by the supplementation of wheat proteins. The considerable differences identified on the mixing curves of different rice flours indicate that the investigation of mixing properties can be one of the useful approaches for the characterisation of functional properties of rice dough. The large effects of the addition of wheat gluten on the mixing properties of rice flours demonstrate the possibility of using rice flour and dough as a wheat protein free model system for the in vitro investigation of the functional roles of wheat storage proteins.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic weed water hyacinth was evaluated for its potential to be used as feedstock for fermentable sugar production via enzymatic hydrolysis. Critical factors (pretreatment of substrate, concentration of substrate, incubation period, pH, incubation temperature) affecting enzymatic hydrolysis of water hyacinth were optimised for maximum production of fermentable sugars. Enzyme (mainly cellulase) produced by Trichoderma reesei ATCC 26921 in a simple medium containing the plant biomass as the sole carbon source was directly used at a particular concentration for hydrolysis. It was observed that acid-alkali pretreated water hyacinth was far more accessible to cellulolytic enzymes than untreated one and hence was hydrolyzed to a greater extent. Maximum hydrolysis (41.7%) was obtained with 4% (w/v) pretreated water hyacinth after 72 h of incubation at pH 5.2 and at a temperature of 45 °C. With a view to enhance the percentage of enzymatic hydrolysis, culture metabolite (enzyme source) of T. reesei was supplemented with enzyme from a β-glucosidase mutant, Aspergillus phoenicis . This β-glucosidase enriched cellulase preparation facilitated further enhancement (49.7%) of hydrolysis at FPase to β-glucosidase ratio of 1:1.2. Gas-liquid-chromatographic analysis of the hydrolyzed broth, thus obtained under optimal conditions, revealed the presence of glucose (12.5 g l −1 ) as the most predominant fermentable sugar besides having the presence of xylose, arabinose, mannose and galactose. This widens up the feasibility of utilising such hydrolysate as a cheap carbon source (glucose and to some extent xylose) for yeast fermentation to produce fuel ethanol.",

Findings of quota sample show considerable terminological diversity among statements made by respondents regarding a description of the term \"safe food\". Based upon the code assignment, five single-meaning thematic categories were identified: A: Harmless for health, B: Healthy food, C: Production method, D: Technological procedure, E: Surveillance. The answers with extensive content included more onetheme categories and were classified in category F. This category indicates the complex comprehension of the term food safety and the need to understand the relations between the answers. The results show a connection between 38.4% of consumers' statements in category A (harmless for health), and a definition of food safety which mentions the term \"without hazards\".",

Fats were different in principal groups of fatty acid and were of the following composition: SFA (9.3–66.4), TFA (1.2–10.3), PUFA (1.9–53.9%). The taste and aroma of cakes scored lower with increasing content of unsaturated FA, especially PUFA and higher with increasing content of SFA and TFA combined. With respect to taste and aroma, cakes containing LM scored lower in comparison to cakes containing butter, while the texture of such cakes was rated as high as cakes containing butter. Approximately 34–65% of young consumers perceived such cakes as \"like very much\" and \"like moderately\", however, 5% of consumers described them as \"dislike a lot\". The results of this study indicate that liquid margarines could be recommended for cakes in large-scale manufacture. Regarding recommendations of reducing the intake of TFA in processed foods, it is justified to replace hydrogenated vegetable by liquid fats for manufacture of bakery products.",

Two samples were subjected to the microoxygenation process, with one of these derived from a late grape harvest. Wines stored in stainless steel tanks showed a decrease in phenolic content and antioxidant activity, while the bottled wine did not show significant variations. The different degree of microoxygenation caused some significant differences with regard to the decrease in phenolic compounds during the storage, being lower in the sample microoxygenated for a longer time and with more oxygen. Correlation coefficients between anthocyanins and antioxidant activity were high for all the samples analysed. Regarding the colour, percent of blue showed a significant increase in microoxygenated wines. PCA, applied to the data set of phenolic compounds showed that Cannonau wine is different from Cagnulari samples, because of the higher content of cinnamic acids. Cagnulari bottled wine differed from the two Cagnulari stored in steel tanks, in particular for the anthocyanins content, confirming the reducing activity of the bottle.",

Glucose and fructose represent the majority of honey’s carbohydrate profile, while a spectrum of oligosaccharides is in minority, but typical for the honey type regarding its main source nectar or honeydew, respectively. The content of different carbohydrates was determined in 63 samples of four types of Slovenian honey (acacia, spruce, multifloral and forest honey). The honey samples were of different botanical and geographical origin, and were analysed six to ten months after harvest. The type of honey was determined by sensory analysis and electrical conductometry. In order to determine the content of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides high-pressure anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) was used. The applied chromatographic method with pulsed amperometric detection enables reliable and selective detection of carbohydrates, especially oligosaccharides, in honey. Statistical comparison of the results showed that there were statistically significant differences among some parameters, while for others such differences did not exist. The results of our research and available data of other authors propose that the carbohydrate profile (the presence of individual carbohydrates in honey) and the content of carbohydrates in honey may have a potentially valuable role in the assessment of botanical origin of honey and as an indicator of putative adulteration of honey with sugar mixes or syrups, respectively. Nevertheless, analysis on numerous samples and different honey types are needed.",

The increasing complexity of the food chain (e.g. globalization of food trade, expansion of raw materials and additives, technical advancement), the frequent changes in food consumption trends and the phenomenon of food crime belong to the most challenging issues for food chain control institutions. These factors require the re-evaluation of the role of consumers in the food chain. The overall aim of this research was to explore consumers’ risk perception and risk avoidance for a more efficient, targeted risk communication. In the survey 1003, face-to-face interviews were made using questionnaire. The statistical analysis of data was followed by the identification and characterization of 4 relevant target groups with cluster analysis method: disinterested youngsters (17.0%), conscious elders (39.4%), food adepts (27.5%), and soul of the family (16.1%). Results indicated, that the Hungarian society can be segmented regarding to food associated risk perception and avoidance. It has been also proven, that risk perception is influenced by demographic factors. Furthermore, we have also managed to conclude that efficient risk communication would require a well-aimed and focused communication strategy.",

The trained sensory panel evaluated in two years three differently treated watermelon fruit. The studied fruit samples were produced on the same growing-areas in both years but with different growing technologies. The experiment used the non-grafted/self-rooted watermelon as control sample, while the other two treatments were grafting on two rootstock types: a Lagenaria and an interspecific squash hybrid rootstock. The electronic tongue measurement showed that it is the environment/growing technology that mainly determines the characteristics of the fruit quality, not grafting. The two measurement methods can complement each other in a detailed and practical way, as technology and growing area strongly influence the quality of watermelon fruit. The research also showed that it is possible to have similar watermelon fruit quality, independently from the used rootstock type.",

The slaughter value of the mirror strains tended to exceed that of the scaled type carps.

Fillet fat content was significantly (P<0.01) affected by strains/ponds. The pH value of the fillet was significantly influenced by the strain as a fixed factor. Large, strain dependent variability was proven in fat content besides identical fillet dry matter contents.

According to Arrhenius equation significant effect of temperature has been observed on the decrease of oligomer concentration. The oligomers (DP3-DP7) degrade continuously at any pH between 2.7 and 3.3. The lower the pH the higher the change of oligomer and monomer concentration is. The oligomers (DP4-DP7) could give out in 30–40 min below pH 3.0 caused by the high concentration of protons.

Based on their MS peak profiles, the isolates matched the spectra of three S. aureus reference strains in the Bruker MALDI Biotyper database, with identification scores higher than 1.999 in the case of all 46 (100%) isolates. The isolates showed great genetic variability. Twenty spa types were identified, from which most lineages are capable of colonizing humans. Fifty percent of the strains harboured at least one of four enterotoxin genes ( seg , seh , sei , and ser ), but none of the classical enterotoxin genes could be detected.",

    "abstract": "Due to the shift in consumer behaviour, the proportion of well informed, conscious consumers has been growing steadily, and functional foods with their capacity to protect health have been gaining more and more ground. To achieve market success in the field of functional foods, producers should be able to communicate information effectively concerning health issues and their newly developed product should indeed meet consumer expectations. The aim of our study was to identify and define the components of the dimensions of consumer attitudes in Hungary together with the barriers and motivators of health behaviour. Our research also examined how these factors influence consumer willingness to consume functional foods. Our surveys were carried out in focus groups of health-conscious (n=8) and not health-conscious (n=8) consumers. Our findings confirmed the adequacy of the international dual model, regarding the attitudes of Hungarian consumers towards functional food. Moreover, we also explored the most popular health food categories and sources of information on nutrition.",

Composite ﬂour of cassava, sweet potato, and soybean was used for the production of sourdough bread employing autochthonous lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from the composite dough. The ﬂour samples were assessed for functional properties, while the sourdough breads were evaluated for nutritional composition and organoleptic properties. The ﬂour samples possessed good proximate proﬁles and phenolic contents. The lactic acid bacterium and yeast with the most desirable properties were identiﬁed as Lactobacillus plantarum and Pichia kurdriazevii . Fermentation improved the nutritional indices of the composite sourdough bread samples. Lactobacillus plantarum SLC21 and P. kudriavzevii SYD17 bread had a shelf life of 7 days, while the control bread lasted for at least 4 days. Lactobacillus plantarum SLC21 and Pichia kudriavzevii SYD17 bread had the best overall acceptability. Utilisation of these local crops in a composite blend for sourdough will increase commercial proﬁt for local farmers and developing economy. The composite blend will be of great importance in the preparation of pastries that do not require high gluten content. The strains exhibited great potentials for a better nutritional composition of the composite sourdough bread.",

The research was based on face-to-face questionnaire survey, and those who declared to be lactose sensitive were analysed. Among them, only half of the women (49.3%) and one third of the men (34.6%) were medically proven lactose sensitive, so more than half of the respondents declared themselves affected on the basis of self-diagnosis. Our results show that reliably regular customers of lactose-free products are women and persons with medical diagnosis, high educational degree, and under the age of 30. The lactose-free consumer group prefers the following product features: lactose-free label; rich in calcium, vitamins, and fibre, and free of carbohydrate, sugar, and gluten. Only two-thirds of lactose sensitive customers (66.7%) consume lactose-free products regularly, so it can be assumed that the level of knowledge of this disease, its treatment, and the importance of lactose-free dairy products among these persons is insufficient. This could be solved with education, advertisement, and other information opportunities.",

The sensitivities of both anions were improved with the application of the sample stacking method. Separation buffer consisted of 30 mmol L −1 formic acid and 30 mmol L −1 sodium sulfate at a pH of 4.0. The CE technique revealed that 18 honey samples contained nitrate anion ranged between 2.53 and 31.8 mg kg −1 . Nitrite amounts were found in lower amounts in the honey samples as between non-detected and 0.533 mg kg −1 .

Refractive index, free fatty acid content, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, TOTOX, viscosity, specific extinction, polar compounds, food oil sensor value, colour, and polymer content of the oils all increased, whereas iodine value and C18:2/C16:0 ratio decreased as frying progressed. The percentage of linoleic and linolenic acids tended to decrease, whereas the percentages of palmitic and oleic acids increased. Based on the most oxidative stability criteria investigated, PO addition led to a slower deterioration of SFO at frying temperature. Blend PSF2 showed better frying performance compared to PSF1. However, higher amounts of free fatty acids and higher colour units were both detected in the blends compared to pure SFO at the end of frying. It appears that proper blending of highly unsaturated SFO with PO can result in oil blends that could meet nutritional needs with improved stability for domestic cooking and deep-frying.",

Results were collected via Internet simultaneously and a total of 500 valid questionnaires were received in case of pre-packed cheese and 468 regarding chips. In the analysed countries \"preservatives\" had an outstanding importance — mainly in Hungary and Romania —, while \"packaging gases\" got lower importance during the shopping intention. \"Natural preservatives\" very positively contributed to the choosing of both pre-packed sliced cheese and chips. High level of willingness to pay was not observed, as well as the \"price\" was less important factor than the additives.

    "abstract": "Species identification in food has become a prominent issue in recent years as the importance of consumer protection has increased. DNA-based species identification methods were developed by researchers in the last two decades, as these are reliable, accurate, and low-cost techniques for species identification in raw and processed food products as well. In our study, universal primers were designed to conserved regions of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. Amplicons were heat-denatured and a PCR single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method was developed to identify cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat DNA. Sensitivity of this technique was tested on DNA mixtures of cattle-sheep, cattle-goat, and cattle-buffalo and the threshold limit of cattle DNA was 5%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. One hundred and five cheeses were purchased and collected from Bosnian and Hungarian farmers, retails, and supermarkets to reveal fraud, 32 percent of them (34 cheeses) were found to be mislabelled by species.",

Effects of incorporation level of oat flour (OF, 15.86 to 44.14%) and dried green pea flour (DGPF, 7.93 to 22.07%) on the physical and functional characteristics of extruded products based on composite flour were studied using response surface methodology. Second order polynomial equation was used to describe the effect of OF and DGPF on lateral expansion (LE), bulk density (BD), water solubility index (WSI), water absorption index (WAI), and hardness (HD). Results indicated that OF had negative effect on LE, while positive effect on BD, WSI, WAI, and HD. On increasing DGPF, LE and WSI increased, but it had negative effect on BD, WAI, and HD. Numerical optimization resulted in 41.91% OF and 7.93% DGPF to produce acceptable extrudates. The results suggest that oats and dried green pea flour can be extruded with rice flour and corn flour into an acceptable snack food.",

From food safety point of view, the investigation of these microbial communities is inevitable considering their potential hazardous impact on the food production chain. Altogether 235 bacterial isolates were identified with the most frequent genera being Pseudomonas , Bacillus , Acinetobacter and Aeromonas. Our results indicated that MALDI-TOF MS can be used to identify causative agents of foodborne illnesses, food spoilage and common plant pathogens. However, limitations of the rapid identification technique were also encountered as we obtained correct identification at species level for 30.2% and at genus level for 69.8% of the isolates.",

The valorisation of this waste by recovering its bioactive compounds seems interesting. The aim of this study was to find the optimal conditions using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) that yield the highest carotenoid content and better antioxidant activity from Citrus reticulata Blanco peels. Response surface methodology (RSM) through Box–Behnken experimental design was used to optimise the conditions for carotenoid extraction using UAE. Hexane concentration, temperature, and sonication time were selected as the main factors. The results revealed that all independent variables affected the responses. The optimal UAE conditions for hexane concentration, temperature, and sonication time were 60.76%, 36.45 °C, and 37.32 min, respectively. The values of total carotenoid content (TCC) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) obtained by UAE were higher than those obtained by the maceration extraction method. It can be concluded that the medium and extraction parameters, including hexane concentration, temperature, and sonication time, significantly influenced the recovery of carotenoids and antioxidant activity. The optimisation study allowed determining the appropriate conditions to maximise both responses. Compared to conventional maceration, the UAE method was superior and more efficient for extracting carotenoids from C. reticulata Blanco peels.",

These compounds play a crucial role in initiating, shaping, and modulating the gut microbiota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of carob pulp phenolic extracts on nine specific groups of human gut microbiota before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The effects of pure gallic and coumaric acids were also tested. The results showed that the treated phenolic compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of most pathogenic bacteria. Gallic acid, in particular, demonstrated the most potent antimicrobial effect on Listeria monocytogenes , reducing its growth to below 5%. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed a growth reduction of up to 10%. Furthermore, both phenolic acids, before and after digestion, led to a slight reduction in E. coli O157:H7 numbers. Probiotic bacteria experienced minimal decrease following exposure to phenolic extracts. However, the growth of Lactobacillus casei ssp . rhamnosus was significantly inhibited by almost 50%. Interestingly, the in vitro digestion process exhibited a stronger antibacterial effect against pathogenic bacteria compared to probiotic bacteria. These results highlight the potential of carob phenolic extracts in modulating the intestinal microbiota, thereby offering interesting prospects for the development of diet-based health strategies.",

    "abstract": "Different pasta products were prepared using amaranth species with the addition of emulsifiers: mono- and diacyl-glyceride, lecithin, lecithin and lysolecithin and diacetyl-tartaric ester of monoglyceride in an amount of 1.2 g/g flour. For the characterisation of interaction between the emulsifiers and the components of raw material properties the cooking values - water uptake and cooking loss -, sensory assessment of the pasta systems, the amount of albumin and globulin as well as glutelin fractions, the molecular weight distribution of the soluble protein with SDS-PAGE and complexing rate were examined. It was found that amaranth flour is suitable for pasta products with excellent cooking and sensory properties. However, without emulsifier the production of pasta products was not possible. The amount of soluble fraction was reduced by the addition of emulsifiers, this increasing was significant at the glutelin fraction. Emulsifiers to a different degree, depending on the emulsifiers and variety of amaranth, affected the molecular weight distribution of albumin, globulin and glutelin. In the structure an emulsifier-protein-carbohydrate-lipid complex can be expected. In the presence of diacetyl-tartaric ester of monoglyceride, lysolecithin and mono- and diacylglyceride as well as stearoyl lactylate we could detect the protein - emulsifier and emulsifier-carbohydrate interaction - with high complexing rate, 50-90%. In the presence of lecithin the texture was less good and probably only protein-emulsifier interactions occurred. The complexing rate was as low as 5%. The best pasta product was produced from Amaranthus cruentus with diacetyl-tartaric ester of monoglyceride (1,2%).

Coliform bacteria could be eliminated to non-detectable levels by the same treatments. The shelf-life of both untreated and non-thermally pasteurised samples were limited mainly by growth of lactic acid bacteria. At about equal bactericidal effect, more drastic changes of texture and colour occurred in UHP-pasteurized minced beef samples than in the radiation-pasteurized ones. Whereas radiation pasteurisation caused minimal changes in appearance, texture and DSC-thermograms of minced beef, UHP-pasteurisation of the raw samples proved to be strongly discolouring by denaturing the muscle pigments and causing extensive denaturation of the myofibrillar proteins. The water holding capacity of irradiated samples decreased, while that of high pressure treated ones increased as compared to the untreated control. Near infrared spectrometry and electronic nose measurements gave promising results to make distinctions non-destructively on changes of various physical-chemical changes and quality parameters as a function of pasteurising treatments and/or storage.",

    "abstract": "The adaptation to brining conditions of 20 strains of Lactobacilli were tested. At 6% salt all strains reduced the pH to 4 in 72 h. At higher salt concentration, only some of the strains showed this ability. The ability to synthesise lactic acid was tested at different salt concentrations. Lactic acid was quantified by HPLC analyses and at halophilic conditions six strains showed good ability. The glucosidic activity tested on a synthetic compound ( p -nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) screened the best Lactobacillus strains (20205 DSMZ, 20314 DSMZ and 104442 CIP). The ability to hydrolyse the oleuropein molecule was tested and all of the strains selected showed good activity at low salt concentration and low oleuropein content in the medium. This ability decreased drastically when the salt and oleuropein content were higher. The best strain was the 20205 DSMZ, which at low salt concentration hydrolysed more than 95% of oleuropein in 120 h.",

The effects of salt content (6, 8, 10 or 12%) and citric acid concentration (0 or 1%) on the production of biogenic amines in Turkish type pickled cabbage were investigated. Concentrations of putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, spermidine, spermine, tyramine and histamine were determined in 8 pickled cabbage samples, 4 of them contained citric acid and the remaining 4 samples contained no citric acid. Numbers of LAB (lactic acid bacteria), enterobactericeae and halophilic microorganisms of samples were determined during fermentation. Amounts of biogenic amines in samples containing 6, 8 or 10% salt and 1% citric acid were found lower than those in samples without citric acid. On the other hand, the highest concentrations of biogenic amines were observed in the sample containing 10% salt and no citric acid (P<0.05). There was a correlation between amounts of biogenic amines and numbers of LAB. Pickled cabbages supplied from the markets had small amounts of biogenic amines.",

To maintain a similar texture to that of commercial desserts without fibres, the composition of thickening (corn starch, xanthan and guar gums) and gelling (carrageenan) agents in the basic formulation was also studied. Dietary fibres of bamboo, inulin, wheat, apple, Psyllium and chitosan were tested. Sensory characteristics were evaluated by a non-trained panel. Appearance, flavour, texture and preference were scored using an unstructured line scale. Texture and surface colour were analysed by a Texture Analyser-xT2i and a tristimulus colourimeter (Minolta CR 300). Sensory attributes showed significant differences among treatments. The dessert with chitosan gave the lowest sensory scores. For stress at rupture, the dessert with Psyllium fibre showed the highest value, while the one with chitosan gave the lowest. Apple fibre led to a brownish colour. Panellists preferred inulin or bamboo desserts. Addition of inulin or bamboo fibres to dairy desserts is a good alternative to increase the daily intake of dietary fibres.",

Results of the proximate analysis of borak showed that irradiation doses did not have a significant effect on moisture, protein and fat content of borak. Gamma irradiation decreased the total counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, total coliform and yeast and increased the shelf life of borak. The radiation doses required to reduce the microorganisms load by one log cycle (D 10 ) in borak were 456 and 510 Gy for the Salmonella spp. and E. coli , respectively.

The experiments were carried out in the Érd-Elvira orchards of the Research Institute for Fruitgrowing and Ornamentals (cultivars Érdi bőtermő, Kántorjánosi 3) and in orchards of the Agárd Frucht Ltd. in Agárd (cultivars Érdi jubileum, Maliga emléke). Anthocyanin, polyphenol and vitamin C contents as well as the water-soluble dry matter content of fruits were measured.According to the results of quality parameter measurements it can be stated, that in case of the studied cultivars the optimal picking time for industrial processing is the second picking. At this time the anthocyanin, polyphenol and water-soluble dry matter content of the cultivars are optimal. In general, at the end of the ripening period the fruits shrink, fruit weight and juiciness decreases as a consequence of water loss, therefore determining optimal harvest time for the desired utilization purpose is very important. According to our results, out of the four studied cultivars, Érdi jubileum has the highest values regarding anthocyanin and polyphenol contents.",

The goal of our research was to develop brewery products made of domestically grown millet (Alföldi 1) and buckwheat (Oberon) that are similar to traditional beer of barley malt regarding taste, aroma, consistency, colour, foam stability and alcohol content.On a micromalting equipment malts were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with decoction process (mashing program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, FAN, colour, bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a final attenuation of 61.5% and 73.2%.In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC. Data was used to set the rest temperature of the enzyme during mashing. Inhibiting effect of certain substances on proteolytic enzymes was investigated by measuring the extract, FAN, and soluble nitrogen contents. Inhibition was detected in case of both raw materials, although to a different extent. Inhibition is influenced by tannins and polyphenols found in the grain (Chethan et al., 2008).",

The samples were dried, homogenized, sieved and measured in the wavelength range of 780–2500 nm. The calibration was based on partial least squares (PLS) regression with cross-validation. The performance of the final model was evaluated according to root mean square of cross-validation (RMSECV), root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE) and the determination coefficient (R2).The developed models use the ranges of 1100–1245 nm and 1590–2600 nm for protein determination, 1330–1840 nm and 2170–2350 nm for lipid, 1400–1630 nm, 2000–2170 nm and 2230–2570 nm for sugar determination, respectively. Protein, lipid and sugar could be determined directly with R2 values of 98.93, 99.07 and 98.81, and RMSECV values of 0.16 m/m%, 0.79 m/m% and 0.28 m/m%, respectively. It can be concluded that FT-NIR spectroscopy can be used for the routine determination of protein, lipid and sugar content of bakery products and it can contribute to the estimation of calorie content in a fast and non-destructive way.",

In our experiment three authentic lactic acid bacteria strains were investigated: Lactobacillus rhamnosus VT1, L. plantarum 2142, and L. sakei DSM 2001. As data show beside the strain also the growth medium has influence on the MTT reduction activity, this means that for each special case separate calibration curve has to be prepared. Based on MTT reduction we also developed an improved microtiter plate assay which proved to be reliable for a rapid cell count determination. So our methods are only applicable for estimate cell number with fixed parameters, but under given circumstances they are fast and sensitive methods. With the modified methods we can rapidly measure the dehydrogenase enzyme activity of the lactic acid bacteria cells. With the microplate assay we can measure many conditions and strains at the same time.",

Rats of negative control group showed haemorrhaging in gastric mucosa and were markedly alleviated in rats pretreated with soya bean extracts and cimetidine. When ulceration area was analysed, unfermented and fermented soya bean extracts and cimetidine were significantly better in the protection of the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced injury compared to the negative control. However, no significant difference was found between pretreatment of both soya bean extracts and cimetidine. In terms of acidity of gastric mucosa content, rats pretreated with fermented soya beans were significantly acidic; whereas the mucus weight was significantly higher in gastric mucosa of rats pretreated with unfermented soya beans. Histological examination of gastric mucosa walls found that rats of the negative control group showed lesions in the mucosa area, oedema and leukocytes infiltration in the submucosa area, and that these were distinctly decreased in gastric mucosa tissue samples of rats pretreated with soya bean extracts and cimetidine; whereby fermented soya beans had a comparable effect with cimetidine.

One of the most important attributes indicating sweet cherry freshness is stem colour and shape. Fruit post-harvest cool storage retards respiration and colour ripening changes. The common technology of refrigeration is based on active cooling determining high evapotranspiration for the passage of air over the products surface. An innovative preservation system, such as the Passive Refrigeration System (PRS™), could guarantee perfect shelf-life preservation maintaining optimal temperature and relative humidity close to 100%, minimizing colour changes in medium-long storage range. There is the need to numerically quantify cherry stem thickness and colour changes to compare fruit postharvest conditions under the two systems. The use of the Thin-Plate Spline 3D warping (TPS3D) in the 3-dimensional-RGB colour space allowed an efficient colour calibration. Sweet cherry stem images belonging to the two different storage systems (active and passive refrigeration) were acquired before and after 7 days to preservation through a professional high resolution scanner. Thickness and colour (after calibration) were measured. Results indicate, in terms of sweet cherry quality of preservation, that the ones preserved in passive refrigerator after 7 days appears similar to the fruits at the beginning of the experiment.",

The interventions were: dietary (recommendation of low calorie diet) and increasing physical activity.One year later the body mass index decreased significantly by 0.56 kg m−2 average and remained about the same by the end of the second year. There was only a small decrease in waist circumference. The rest systolic blood pressure decreased significantly on average 5.9 mmHg by the end of the first year, while decrease in resting diastolic blood pressure was less. All metabolic parameters, except HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly: total cholesterol: by 0.23 mmol l−1, trigliceride: by 0.18 mmol l−1, blood glucose: by 0.15 mmol l−1.Primary care intervention proved to be effective. Better outcomes would be expected, when more resources, more focus in the media, more support from health authorities and sufficient manpower was available.",

RSM (response surface methodology) was used to determine the optimum conditions for maximum recovery of total phenolic content (TPC) and 2,6-diphenyl picryl hydrazil free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity. The gelatine coating on banana slices before frying significantly reduced (approximately 60%) the fat uptake from oil during frying in comparison to control. The reduction of particle size to the nano range was found to be effective to load the antioxidants effectively. Antioxidant extracted from amla reduced the rate of oxidation of oil during frying and so it may be a better alternative of synthetic antioxidant in food products.",

Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the interactions between catechin, quercetin, and gallic acid in the presence of sugars (sucrose and trehalose) in complex food matrix such as pomegranate juice. Antioxidant activity (AOA) was measured by three different methods, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In this paper, fundamental differences among used AOA measuring methods were confirmed, which can be traced back to interactions occurring between phenols and/or sugars. Even though addition of individual phenols increased AOA of mixtures, in the majority of binary and ternary mixtures antagonistic effects were observed. Positive effect of sugar addition was more pronounced in binary mixtures but the results were highly dependent on used AOA method.",

Artichoke has been used as choleretic, hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial, cholesterol-reducing, and diuretic in traditional medicine. Artichoke has been cultivated worldwide because of its nutritional value and medicinal properties. In this study organically and conventionally grown artichokes were compared in terms of phenolic constituents, antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Artichoke leaves, bracts, and floral receptacles obtained from 2 different sources (organic and conventional) were freeze-dried, powdered, and extracts were prepared with methanol. Phenolic constituents (chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin, and apigenin) were analysed by HPLC-DAD system. It was found that organic farming enhanced cynarin, chlorogenic acid, and luteolin amounts in receptacle (edible part). Organically grown leaves had also higher amounts of cynarin and chlorogenic acid than conventional ones. Cynarin amount was higher by 35% in organic receptacle and 20% in organic leaves. Organic farming also augmented the antioxidant property and flavonoid content of edible parts of the artichoke. Additionally, organically grown leaves had the highest antioxidant activity, total phenol and flavonoid contents. Antibacterial activity was observed with both organic and conventional leaves only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. This comparative study revealed that organic farming enhanced the health-beneficial medicinal values of artichoke's heart and leaves.",

Filamentous fungi have been considered as useful producers of this enzyme from an industrial point of view, due to the fact that they excrete xylanases into the medium. In this study, four fungal species belonging to different genera, i.e. Aspergillus , Cochliobolus , Pyrenophora , and Penicillium were isolated from different sources and compared for their ability to produce xylanase in submerged culture. The fungal species showed enzyme activity as determined by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. It was found that the two saprophytic Aspergillus strains, i.e A. terreus ( Fss 129 ) and A. niger ( SS7 ) had the highest xylanase activity of 474 and 294 U ml –1 at pH 7 and 8, respectively, in the presence of corn cob hulls after 120 h of incubation. The production of xylanase seemed to be strongly influenced by the interactive effect of initial pH on the fungi. Interestingly, xylanase was better produced by the saprophytic fungi of Aspergillus and Penicillium than by the plant pathogenic ones of Cochliobolus and Pyrenophora . This work provides additional information to support future research on fungi with different lifestyles for food industrial production of xylanase.",

Effects of nitrogen (N) application on the performance of grain protein were tested. Five high quality winter wheat varieties were studied regarding grain quality traits affected by applying undivided and split doses of N. The evaluated samples show that increasing doses of N topdressing and increasing time of application have beneficial effects on the yield and the value of protein content. Wheat grain protein value ranged between 9.9% of the untreated Mv Karéj and Alföld, where the 120+40 kg ha -1 N was applied resulting in the highest value of 16.0%. Similarly, the gluten values among untreated and N applied plots were in a wide range. Mv Karéj had the lowest wheat gluten value on untreated plot with 18.4% and Alfold had the highest value with 36.8% on the plot where the 120+40 kg ha -1 N was applied. There were no significant changes recorded on test weight and thousand kernel weight. In the case of baking quality, there were significant differences between varieties.

The mango nectar samples were prepared incorporating different concentrations of inulin and stevia (0, 2 and 4% w/w) and stored for 45 days at 4 °C. The results indicated that the growth of Lactobacillus casei was strongly influenced by the beverage composition. Therefore, the addition of inulin and stevia had a positive effect on the viability of L. casei , especially with 2% w/w inulin or inulin in combination with stevia. However, bacterial viability reduced during storage. According to the results, pH and total soluble solid content of the samples decreased during storage; however, the viscosity values of mango nectars were elevated by the addition of inulin and stevia. Additionally, all beverages were considered a suitable medium to keep the L. casei survival above the minimum recommended value (10 6 –10 7 CFU mL −1 ) during storage. In general, it can be concluded that the sample containing 2% inulin and 2% stevia in combination provided the best viability of L. casei with acceptable physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics that could be introduced as synbiotic and low-calorie mango nectar.",

In addition to providing energy and protein it is a significant source of a number of essential or beneficial components, including B vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre. Cereal fibre has established benefits in reducing the risk of several chronic diseases but the consumption of fibre is below the recommended daily intake in the typical “Western diet”. Improving the content and composition of wheat fibre is therefore an attractive strategy to improve the health of large populations at low cost. The major dietary fibre components of wheat grain are arabinoxylan and β-glucan. Both vary in their amount, composition, and properties in different grain fractions, with white flour being lower in total fibre than bran but having a higher proportion of soluble fibre. There is significant variation in the amounts and structures of arabinoxylan and β-glucan in bread wheat genotypes, including commercial cultivars from different regions of the world, old landraces and exotic lines. This variation is also highly heritable, which should allow plant breeders to develop improved cultivars. Gradients in fibre composition and content within the grain may also allow millers to produce specialist high fibre flours.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive sample of breakfast cereals (a total of 221 breakfast cereals available in the market) were compared according to their nutritional composition, being analysed using three nutrient profiling systems to categorise foods as “healthier” or “less healthy”. Differences were further on investigated focusing on the use of nutrition and health claims on the labelling. The aim was to determine how much the use of such a claim corresponds to the categorisation into “healthier” or “less healthy” group. The sample contained 161 (72.9%) items with claims and 60 (27.1%) items, without claims. The nutrient profiles of the foods were determined by the UK Ofcom model, the FSANZ model and the modified Traffic Light model. All the models use similar but nevertheless different ways of determining the final score of “healthier” or “less healthy”. The percentage of foods classified as “healthier” was well below 72.9% (from 24.8% to 52.2%), indicating that profiling with each model involves stricter criteria for the classifying of foods compared to the permission to carry a nutrition and/or health claim. The difference is the most pronounced for the modified Traffic Light system, while the UK Ofcom and FSANZ systems give results closer to the use of claims.",

In addition to the composition of input mixtures, process parameters of a single-screw extruder, such as speed of screw and barrel temperatures, were changed. The highest expansion ratio (4.14) was found for temperatures 44 °C, 90 °C, 120 °C, and 140 °C, die diameter 3 mm, compression ratio 3:1, rotation speed 140 r.p.m., and dosing 15 r.p.m. The addition of native wheat starch to corn grits resulted in values of the expansion ratio ranging from 1.17–2.38. A high concentration of RS — 2.4% per starch — was observed for a 20% ratio of Nutriose with a 10% addition of water. The addition of 20–50% of native wheat starch resulted in values ranging from 0.2–0.4% per starch. The highest SDS content (72.5% per starch) in extrudates was obtained for the mixture of corn grits, 20% cross-linked starch, and water (10% addition).",

Only 27.0% of the respondents have a positive attitude toward the new possibility, and they would be glad to use this new service in order to stay healthy. The rate of those who would have a genetic test because they want to follow a diet tailored to their needs is very low (16.0%). Our result suggested that the most important factors in consumer preference on personalised nutrition are positive health message and perceived risk/benefits, gender, and educational level. The most important factors regarding the attitude toward genetic testing are easy usage, benefits, the agreement among experts, and educational level.",

    "abstract": "Winery wastewater treatment plants generally face severe nutrient deficiency, and therefore conventional technologies and supplementary nutrient dosing strategies may fail. The purpose of the paper is to show how traditional way of dosing N-source for marginal availability to nutrient deficient influents results in poorly settling activated sludge regardless of the application of aerated or non-aerated selectors. External N-source calculated for marginal availability resulted in nutrient deficiency due to the relatively high yield experienced (0.7 g biomass COD/g substrate COD). In the fully aerated system with overall N-deficiency, rapidly increasing overproduction of extracellular polysaccharide was experienced, leading to SVI (Sludge Volume Index) values up to 600 cm 3 g −1 . In the system with the non-aerated selector, initial nutrient deficiency could only be detected in the second reactor. Since neither overgrowth of floc-forming GAOs (Glycogen Accumulating Organisms) nor denitrification could be experienced, the non-aerated reactor operated as low-DO (Dissolved Oxygen) basin, attributing to the drastic overgrowth of filamentous bacteria leading to SVI values &gt;1000 cm 3 g −1 . Since dosing external N-source for marginal availability is likely to cause severe biomass separability problems in activated sludge winery wastewater treatment, either pronounced N-overdosing and pre-denitrification or severe nutrient deficiency and GAO cultivation can rather be recommended.",

Although in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycaemic activity of jujube fruit were investigated previously, the bioavailability phenomenon has been disregarded so far. For this study, 80% ethanol extract of Ziziphus jujuba fruit (ZJE) was investigated for its in vitro hypoglycaemic and antioxidant potentials, before and after the interaction with simulated human digestion. DPPH scavenging activity, FRAP, CUPRAC, and TOAC assays were used for this purpose. Moreover, inhibition potentials of α -amylase and α -glucosidase enzymes and advanced glycation end products (AGE) were examined for the hypoglycaemic effect. Results indicated that ZJE showed significant antioxidant and dose dependent enzyme and AGE inhibition activity. Nonetheless, subsequent to simulated human digestion in vitro bioactivities of ZJE were significantly lowered for bioavailable fraction (IN). Protocatechuic acid (PA) (major phenolic compound of the fruit) contents of the extract and fractions were measured via HPTLC for more accurate understanding of the effects of human digestion and bioavailability profile.",

Measurements were made for the following 16 elements: Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sr and Zn. The relative standard deviation of repeatability ranged from 0.41% (potassium) to 27% (cadmium) and that of reproducibility varied between 0.73% (boron) to 52% (cobalt). Recovery of the elements was determined by standard addition with results ranging from 90.6% (phosphorus) to 116.2% (boron). After that, 15 red wine samples were measured. Significant differences were found in the Al, B, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sr and Zn (P<0.001) concentration of wine samples. Correlation studies revealed parallel changes in phosphorus-potassium, phosphorus-magnesium and zinc-manganese concentrations (r=0.857, 0.875, 0.838). According to principal component analysis, measurements of zinc-, sodium-, boron-, copper- and strontium content gave almost the same results as obtained with 16 different elements. According to a two dimensional non-linear map of absolute values of principal component analysis, wines from Szekszárd and Eger could be differentiated, whereas the analysis of wines from Villány, the Mátra Mountains and Lake Balaton showed overlapping results.",

    "abstract": "In case of spices or crude drugs of medicinal- and aromatic plant origin, sensory characteristics, especially odour, has great commercial importance. The instrumental sensory analysis the so-called 'electronic nose' has proved to be a significant, new and quick method in chemometry. The sensor signal responses (data recorded by the electronic nose instrument) of the electronic nose were evaluated by statistical methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and the combination of these methods by applying the discriminant analysis on the first eight principal components. The aim of this paper is the comparative analysis of the above evaluation methods as data processing tools of the sensor signal response of the electronic nose (chemosensor array). The essential oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum) selected line No. 10 was compared to the oil distilled from the selected line No. 11; and dried root samples of lovage (Levisticum officinale) harvested at different times from the two- and three-year-old population, were investigated with electronic nose (NST-3320, AppliedSensor Sweden AB). Principal component analysis, as a first step of the evaluation, did not clearly distinguish either oregano or lovage samples. Further statistical evaluation of the original sensor signal responses of the electronic nose with canonical discriminant analysis improved the separation power of the model. The best separation could be achieved by the combination of the two methods, whereby canonical discriminant analysis was applied to the first eight principal components, which described 99% of the differences. In all cases more than 92%, while in several experiments 100% of cross-validated grouped cases were classified correctly. Based on the results, the application of the electronic nose and the combination of multivariate methods, PCA and CDA, could be an appropriate tool either for identification of cultivar to accelerate selection process or to distinguish crude drugs of different age or different harvesting period.",

The content and composition of carotenoids, sterols, and the content of chlorophylls as well as oxidative stability were investigated. To obtain the data about the acidity and oxidative status of the oil samples, basic quality analyses of free fatty acid content (FFA), peroxide value (PV) and spectrophotometric analyses in UV area (K232, K270 and ?K) were used. The results showed that the predominating carotenoid in sunflower oil is lutein, and that the total amount of carotenoids during refining process was reduced to about 15% of the initial amount. The major sterol in sunflower oil (about 70%), as well as in other vegetable oils, was b-sitosterol. The other important sterols in sunflower oil were ?7-stigmasterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, ?5-avenasterol and ?7-avenasterol. The composition of sterols in non-refined and refined oils was more or less the same, while the content of sterols during refining process decreased by 22%. Among all analysed sunflower oils, the laboratory extracted oil had the best oxidative stability (e.g. the longest induction period, according to Rancimat method), while cold and hot pressed oils were less stable than the fully refined one.",

    "abstract": "Apples were harvested at three different times (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd) then stored at 1-3 °C, 85-90% R.H. for 5 months. Firmness, ethylene productivity, the distribution of calcium and potassium and the ion leakage were measured. The ultrastructure of the cell wall was studied by SEM and TEM and he activity of β-galactosidase and polygalacturonase and pectin content were determined. The ethylene evolution of fruits decreased by the harvest and storage time. At the beginning of storage, the ethylene productivity in the 1 st harvest apple increased up to a maximum value then declined. The 2 nd harvest fruits produced less ethylene than that observed in 1 st harvest fruits. No ethylene production was found in the 3 rd harvest fruits. Firmness was different according to harvest time, but that difference disappeared during storage. The permeability of membranes increased as a function of harvests and storage. The distribution of calcium was typical at the beginning, the highest concentration of calcium being near the core and skin, but by the end of the storage calcium moved from the skin towards the core. Potassium content was the highest near the core and decreased towards the skin, both in the fresh and stored apples. The activities of polygalacturonase and β -galactosidase were not influenced by the harvest time, but changed as a function of storage time. The autolysis of pectin and soluble carbohydrates increased during storage, mostly in the 3 rd harvest. At the beginning of storage, the cell wall and middle lamellae of the 1 st harvest fruits' flesh were not damaged. Large degradation of the middle lamellae was observed in the 2 nd and 3 rd harvest fruits. Lower membrane permeability, pectin degradation and PG enzyme activity were found in the 1 st harvest apples. The Idared apple should be harvested close to the climacteric maximum for better and longer storage.",

They are present in everyday foods and beverages and in this way they are used as an integral part of human diet. Therefore, it seemed interesting to investigate the influence of these valuable natural compounds on corrosion processes of aluminium, an ambalage material often used in food industry (Jovanovic et al., 1994). All the investigations were performed in 3% solution of sodium chloride, in aqueous rutin and quercetin solutions as well as in rutin and quercetin solutions in 3% sodium chloride solution. Concentrations of rutin and quercetin solutions used ranged from 10-2 to 10-5 mol dm-3, and investigations involved electrochemical methods. The results obtained showed that rutin and quercetin previously dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH and added to the 3% sodium chloride solution at concentrations of 10-4 and 10-5 mol dm-3 acted as aluminium corrosion inhibitors, while at higher concentrations (10-2 and 10-3 mol dm-3) their effects were opposite. The efficiency of the corrosion inhibition of aluminium by rutin and quercetin solutions was the result of forming protective film on the metal surface. Therefore, the diluted rutin and quercetin solutions could be used as corrosion inhibitors of aluminium.",

The cell wall of green fruit was intact, but the electron dense cytoplasm concentrated along the cell wall and showed a number of degradation signs. The pit hardening stage (II) resulted in more structural break down in the cytoplasm and in the cell wall. Large numbers of plastoglobuli were in the plastids resulting in chloroplast-gerontoplast conformation. The most striking feature of light red fruits is the dissolution of the walls. Middle lamellae almost completely disappeared. In ripe fruits, the wall degradation was even more prominent. The regular structure of the cytoplasm had almost completely disappeared. The total pectin content between pit hardening and light red stages was the highest. The autolysis of pectin increased between pit hardening (II) and light red-a stage (III), then it slowly decreased. The largest activity of β-galactosidase was in the green (I) stage, and then in the pit hardening stage (II) it suddenly decreased. In light red-a/b (III/IV) stages the activity of β-galactosidase again started to increase. The activity of polygalacturonase did not depend on the grade of ripeness. Storage: In the first period of storage, the activity of β-galactosidase and polygalacturonase of sour cherry decreased, then in the second period of storage increased.",

The optical measurement methods of moisture content promise non-destructive, non-contact and fast solution for quality control, for monitoring quality changes during storage and also for real-time classification tasks.The high absorption coefficient of water makes NIR analysers a commonly used tool for accurate moisture analysis. Hyperspectral system is able to detect the spatial distribution of reflectance spectrum as well. In case of finding correlation between the moisture-content of carrot and the reflectance spectral data, a hyperspectral system would be suitable for testing quality.Experiments were made to investigate spectral changes of different cultivars and different tissues of carrot stored under different conditions. Moisture-decrease of pieces and also the spectral data of carrot slices were recorded. Statistical analysis of the data has shown the optimal intensity function to describe moisture-content. Eliminating homogeneous spectral changes caused by destructed tissues, only a narrow interval of NIR range was sensitive to the moisture-decrease of xylem tissues.The equipment and the measurement procedure were able to identify carrot tissues and detect their changes during drying. For non-destructive applications of the system, further experiments are needed to inspect the behaviour of rhizodermis.",

Samples were vacuum dried at 10 mbar at temperature 40, 50 and 60 °C until a wet content lower than 10% was reached. As control, atmospheric drying at 60 °C was also performed.During the drying processes the amount of total polyphenol, total anthocyanin, catechin and leucoanthocyanin as well as the antioxidant capacity (FRAP) were measured. The drying curves were also determined.The drying temperature affects the duration of the drying, the rate of water loss, and the remaining amount of antioxidant compounds. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased during drying. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased the least of all during atmospheric drying at 60 °C. Among vacuum drying technologies temperature level of 50 °C proved to be the best to preserve antioxidant phenolic compounds. Greater loss was observed when black currant was vacuum dried at higher temperature (60 °C) or at lower temperature (40 °C) for a longer time.",

A total of 80 sighted and 12 blind people participated in the study, in three groups (sighted people without blindfolds, sighted people with blindfolds, blind people). The preference of sensory attributes (size, shape, colour, texture, taste and odour) was evaluated on a six-category scale. The data were analysed using single-factor (ANOVA, LSD95%, 99%) and multi-factor (Cluster analysis, ANOVA, LSD95%, 99%) evaluation. The results showed that blind and sighted assessors made similar judgements on external attributes perceptible by touch (size, shape), but differed in their evaluation of certain quality factors (flavour, taste), resulting in opponent patterns of preference on some apple varieties (Generos, Jonagold Schneica). A further conclusion of the experiment is that there was less deviation between the judgements of sighted assessors when they saw the apples than when they were blindfolded. The background of this phenomenon might be explained by the uncertainty and disturbed perception, which lead to inconsistent judgements.",

In spoiled sausages the water activity (Aw) was higher than in unspoiled sausages (0.94 vs. 0.91). Moreover, the pH of the spoiled tested sausages remained high despite the presence of acidifying bacteria (6.5±0.4 log CFU g−1), such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase negative catalase positive cocci (CNCPC). Conversely, in unspoiled sausages the pH value was 5.5±0.02. For this reason, the spoilage (mephitic type) can be attributed to the high pH (6.3±0.2 units) of the pork meat used, which was classified as a dark, firm, dry type (DFD), to the high Aw, and to the activity of LAB, CNCPC cocci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Because of the high pH and the lack of naturalor added sugars, these bacteria degraded the proteins via amino acid metabolism to produce ammonia, hydrogen sulphur, and methanethiol, which were responsible for the mephitic and putrid odour of the sausages.",

Different optical methods were tested in order to find a model for prediction of the moisture content based on non-contact measurements. Apple discs were dried in a hot air drying chamber for different periods (0–7 hours). The mass of every individual sample was measured before drying (initial mass), after drying (actual mass), and after the optical tests at the end of a 24 h drying process (final mass). Both the wet base and the dry base moisture content were calculated from the actual mass and the final mass of the samples. The optical properties of the samples of different moisture content were measured by two different optical methods. Laser induced backscattering method, applying 3 mW laser modules of different wavelengths, was used to generate the diffuse reflection pattern (halo) on the surface of samples and evaluate the halo properties with a machine vision system. Near Infrared Reflection (NIR) technique was also used to collect/measure the log(1/R) spectra of the samples in the 740–1700 nm range.PLS method with full cross-validation was used to predict the moisture content of the samples based on the backscattering data (quantitative parameters of the halo profile) and on the NIR spectra (raw and transformed log(1/R) data). Effective models (r>0.98, RPD>5) were found for prediction of the dry base moisture content of the samples based on both optical methods.",

There was a close correlation between the mechanical characteristics and the non-ideal storage time. Sensory evaluation showed significant ranking in “bite and chewing”, “sweet taste” and “global impression” attributes according to the Page test. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were determined for the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force and deformation work ratio and these showed that PC1 followed a tendency similar to that of the storage time. PCA plots were determined for the electronic tongue measurements and this PCA separated the sample groups along PC1 and PC2. We used partial least square (PLS) regression to predict “bite and chewing” from the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force, and deformation work ratio with an acceptable correlation. The “sweet taste” was predicted from the electronic tongue measurement results with good correlation. The “global impression” was predicted by the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force and deformation work ratio, and by the electronic tongue measurement results with close correlation.",

Pan-frying caused insignificant changes in proteins and polar lipids, whereas a significant (P<0.05) decrease in moisture and ash content, and a significant (P<0.05) increase in the neutral lipids and total sterol content could be detected after pan frying in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and sunflower oil. The loss of the individual phospholipid content was not significant during the pan-frying process, but its proportion was influenced by the uptake of the culinary fat. The absorption of oil medium in pan-fried, in EVOO, and in sunflower oil samples resulted in an alteration of their fatty acid profiles including a significant (P<0.05) increase of C18:1ω-9 and C18:2ω-6 ratios and a decrease of EPA, DHA percentages as well as of the ω-3/ω-6 ratio. All frying methods affected (P<0.05) lipid quality indices but their values could be considered satisfactory in terms of healthiness. Among the fried samples, the oil free fried samples also presented the poorest triglyceride and cholesterol content, and the greatest ω-3/ω-6 ratio, thus, they were found to present the most appropriate frying method for healthy eating.",

The anthocyanin profile depicted an increase in total anthocyanin concentration in powders developed from all four cultivars with the highest increase in powder from PRO-6 (23.87–27.15 mg kg −1 ), followed by Punjab Naroya (9.97–12.92 mg kg −1 ), commercial (7.15–8.43 mg kg −1 ), and Punjab White cultivar (3.45–4.09 mg kg −1 ).",

    "abstract": "The spoilage of meat products ( N &gt;5×10 6 CFU g −1 ) can be delayed by cooling and low-temperature storage and transport. The highest extent of interruption in the cold chain occurs at the time of delivering the meat product to the individual’s home after purchasing it. Consumer behaviour and the ambient temperature largely influence the shelf life of products. In our research, we examined the buying habits of customers in Hungary. Based on these results, we carried out the cold chain interruption of vacuum-packed sliced ham (1, 2, 3 h) under laboratory conditions, at temperatures of 15, 25, and 35 °C. The microbial count was determined by a quick method based on redox-potential measurement in two-three days until the products were deteriorated. Our experiments resulted in the expected outcomes; however, we concluded that even average customer habits (1 h cold chain interruption) at higher temperature periods ( T &gt;20 °C) decrease the shelf life of ham by 6 days. We set up a mathematical model through which the changes of microbial counts can be determined as a function of product temperature changes, the period of delivery, and the subsequent period of cold storage. R 2 =0.9 correlation was given between predicted and measured microbial counts (logN).",

Unlike benzaldehyde, it has no chemical safety assessment according to its chemical safety sheet, and only one experiment can be found on its effects on vertebrates. This compound can also be found at the group of flavours and fragrances. The aim of this study was to examine the subacute DNA and tissue damaging effects of EBA. The genotoxic effects of EBA in zebrafish were evaluated by using micronucleus assay. Significant increase in the micronucleus frequency had been described for all tested concentrations.

The microdilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Nigella sativa crude oil (CO) and essential oil (EO) against 4 Gram-positive ( Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus , and Listeria monocytogenes ) and 3 Gram-negative ( Salmonella Hartford, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Escherichia coli ) foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria occurring in food products. Total fatty acid composition of CO was analysed by GLC, while the EO was analysed by GC-MS to detect its active compounds. The results showed that the major fatty acid of CO was palmitic acid (C16:0), as saturated fatty acid, however, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the main unsaturated fatty acid. The major compounds of the EO were p -cymene and thymoquinone. The inhibition on all tested bacteria of EO was 10 times higher than of CO, and the lowest concentration value was observed in case of Bacillus subtilis (0.003%).

For this purpose, CLA production was conducted at different temperatures (80–240 °C) and over different time durations (1–10 h). Alkali isomerisation gave a total conversion of 87.8% under the optimal conditions of 240 °C and 8 h (for maximum beneficial isomers), and produced 41.0% trans -10, cis -12, 40.4% cis -9, trans -11, and 6.4% undesirable CLA isomers. The second aim of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and solvents on the purification of CLA isomers. To achieve this, CLA solutions containing different solvents (acetone, methanol, and petroleum ether) were crystallized at several temperatures (0 to –85 °C). It was determined that although the highest CLA purities (94%) were obtained at –55 °C using acetone as the solvent with a yield of 38.1%, the highest yield (89.6%) was determined using petroleum ether at –85 °C with a purity of 88.1%.

Total phenolics, flavonols, and phenolic acid contents in litchi fruit pericarp increased after 49 days following fruit set (DAFS), while proanthocyanins showed a small increment initially and then decreased significantly up to maturity. Polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase activities followed the similar trend as observed in phenolic content at respective developmental stages, while peroxidase activity in pericarp was low at initial stages and increased gradually with fruit development. Higher phenolic content with low polyphenol oxidase activity in pericarp during initial stages of fruit development in ‘Seedless’ as compared to ‘Calcuttia’ cultivar suggests the slow ripening. A negative correlation between anthocyanin content and anthocyanase activity was recorded. Total phenolic constituents, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity showed positive correlation with higher values of these parameters in ‘Seedless’ as compared to ‘Calcuttia’ cultivar.

The analysis proved significant (P&lt;0.05) relationship between nutrient density and WF of the most relevant food items in Hungary. Based on the classification, there are nutrients that are overconsumed among the Hungarian population and positively correlate with WF (e.g., cholesterol) and there are nutrients that are under-consumed among the Hungarian population and negatively correlate with WF (e.g., dietary fibres). In general, it can be concluded that the re-structuration of food consumption patterns in Hungary is an important and urgent task, which serves both the public health and ecologic goals. These efforts should be based on a complex evaluation of the problem. This study was one initial step to analyse SN focused on Hungary and further studies are definitely needed.",

Aeration using a laboratory mixer at 2000 r.p.m. produced stronger aerated gels than using a homogenizer at 8000 r.p.m. The gelation process was monitored using an ultrasound viscometer and a constant increase of dynamic viscosity was noted. A different aerated gel microstructure was observed for magnesium and iron(II) induced gels, which probably resulted in differences in the texture and viscosity, as well. The aeration process decreased hardness. In some cases texture parameters correlated with the viscosity measured using an ultrasound viscometer.

Both for calibration and for fermentation, test runs were carried out on different days and channels. Statistical evaluation was based on the obtained data. According to the t-test (P=0.05) and Grubbs analysis, the calibration method is reliable regardless of the date of calibration. When evaluating the fermentation results by ANCOVA acceptable standard derivations were obtained as impact of channel (58.8 ml), date (82.1 ml) and incorporating all impacts (116.2 ml). The final ethanol concentrations calculated based on the gas volume were compared to ones determined by HPLC and an average difference of 10% was found. Thus, the device proved to be advantageous in monitoring fermentation.",

    "abstract": "From the nineteen-nineties, cobweb disease caused serious losses for the mushroom sector in Europe, in the USA, and in Australia (Fletcher & Gaze, 2008), so it is one of the most notable fungal infections of cultivated white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). The aim of this study was to identify cobweb disease (Cladobortyum dendroides) caused cap spotting and brownish rot on the mushroom sporocarp, and to find a proper discrimination method in the case of this infection.Fruiting body samples were divided into 4 groups, a control one and three others treated with different chemicals that are tested against fungal infections. The groups were subdivided into 2 portions and the first was infected with cobweb disease. Images of the caps were recorded and their hyperspectral images were acquired in the wavelength range of 900–1700 nm.On the hyperspectral images infected and healthy areas were selected, on these average spectra differences were found around the known water peaks (1200 and 1450 nm). The spatial distribution of the water content can be used for the detection of the spoilage, because the infected areas showed different reflection values at these water absorption peaks.Support Vector Machine method was applied successfully to discriminate between the infected and control groups and Monte Carlo cross-validation was carried out.",

The first aim of this work was to characterize the taxonomic and phenotypic diversity of the representative Saccharomyces yeast strains that dominate the spontaneous fermentations in this wine district. The results obtained by molecular ribotyping (ARDRA) revealed a strong dominance of S. cerevisiae, but S. bayanus var. uvarum was also present sporadically. Some of the natural isolates exhibited high volatile acid production or poor fermentation capacity, which imply a quality risk in spontaneous fermentations. Most of the isolates, however, displayed good oenological features during lab scale fermentations. As the second aim of this work, the most promising, selected strains were further tested for oenological properties in microvinification scale and, finally, in large scale fermentations. The analytical and sensory analysis proved that selected strains, including S. bayanus var. uvarum, can be used as local starter cultures, which may contribute to the typicality of the local wines in comparison with commercial starters.",

In the present work, an optical method (vision system) and the application of an electronic tongue is proposed to reveal the addition of barley in different proportion to coffee in ground and brewed forms. In a range of 1 to 80% (w/w) Robusta coffee was blended with roasted barley. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accomplished on vision system image data showed a good discrimination of the adulterated samples. The results of Polar Qualification System (PQS) data reduction method revealed even small differences in the right barley content order by point method approach. With Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression the amount of barley in Robusta was predicted with high R2 (0.996) and relatively low RMSEP (∼2%) values in case of vision system data processing. Considering electronic tongue measurements, PCA results showed a good discrimination of samples with higher barley concentration. Misclassification was found in the low concentrated area by Lienar Discriminant Analgsis (LDA). To obtain an accurate model for barley content prediction in coffee, the most sensitive sensor signals were used to apply PLS regression successfully (R2=0.97, RMSEP=3.99% (w/w)).",

The anthocyanin-monomers are responsible for the development of the red colour, and their acylated derivatives provide stability for the colour of the wines. The anthocyanin profile of wines is affected by several factors: the grape variety, the conditions during wine-making, and also the yeast culture used for the fermentation. In our experiments a self-compiled model solution was fermented by spontaneous fermentation, as well as by four commercial yeasts under laboratory conditions. After fermentation total polyphenolics, anthocyanins, anthocyanin monomer profile, colour intensity, hue, and the ratio of polymeric anthocyanins were studied. Our results show that the spontaneous yeast fermentation resulted in a higher anthocyanin concentration in the fermented model solution, but the commercial yeast strains provided a more advantageous colour characteristic compared to the spontaneous fermentation. After the spontaneous fermentation less sediment was left than in the commercial yeast fermented samples.",

The aims of this study were to find a proper method to collect Yarrowia strains from raw meat, and to assign them to groups based on their physiological and molecular characteristics, followed by sequence-based identification of the selected members of each group to determine the composition of the species. This study revealed three novel Yarrowia species. From 62 samples of different raw meats 291 yeast strains were isolated, from which 118 strains proved to be members of the Yarrowia group. They could be assigned to seven species. Four of them are described species, three of them are novel ones.",

The results show that the combined MSC-CARS + GA-SPA-PLS algorithm can reduce redundant information and improve the computational efficiency, so it is an effective method to predict the SSC of mangoes.",

We measured the gliadin content of wheat varieties, wheat products, and different plant seeds by sandwich ELISA method. The ethanol soluble protein fractions (prolamins) were studied with SDS-PAGE as well. The prolamin concentration of amaranth seed (red and white), buckwheat and millet was under the permitted limit in gluten-free foodstuffs. In our examinations the prolamin content of sorghum reached the permitted limit in gluten-free foodstuffs. The toxic prolamin bands of different plant seeds like amaranth (red and white), millet were diffuse on the gel slab and could be found on the low molecular mass area. The oilseeds (sesame, flax) did not contain any prolamin band and its concentration was not detected by ELISA method. Our examinations revealed that the plant seeds: amaranth (red and white), buckwheat, millet, sesame, flax can be sources of gluten-free foodstuffs. Their prolamin content was low enough that they are sufficient for feeding patients with an injured gut membrane, if their antinutritive effect can be neglected. Analytical results suggest that the mentioned plant grains could be used in coeliac diet after clinical trial and validation.",

    "abstract": "Increasing awareness of the health benefits of n-3 fatty acids has led to studies related to the manipulation of the fatty acid composition of animal products. These fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3), are abundant in foods of marine origin. Fish consumption is, however, limited by seasonal availability, affordability and consumers' preference. Recent studies on the provision of n-3 fatty acid rich foods have therefore centred on the enrichment of products such as poultry meat through feeding fish oil diets. However, decreased quality (storage and flavour) has been associated with products from poultry fed such diets. Other dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids such as fish meal and plant seed oils result in minor improvement of the quality and low levels of EPA and DHA in the enriched product. Supplementation of high levels of vitamin E or other synthetic antibiotics in diets may increase oxidative stability and hence the storage quality of n-3 fatty acid enriched broiler meat. However, their reported influence on off-flavour is conflicting. Other methods of reducing off-flavour in enriched meat involving the use of processed n-3 PUFA sources although may reduce off-flavour, result in reduced deposition of EPA and DPA. Marine algae (MA) is an attractive source of n-3 fatty acids because it is a primary rich source of DHA and contains naturally occurring carotinoids, which are useful for their antioxidant activity. Investigations into the use of MA and identification of cheaper sources of n-3 PUFA for the enrichment of broiler chicken are needed. In addition, the search for viable methods of reducing off-flavour in n-3 enriched broiler meat should continue. The production of high quality and affordable broiler meat is essential for realising the full benefits associated with the consumption of n-3 fatty acid enriched products.",

The increase of extrusion temperature caused a significant effect on protein extractability, while the different initial moisture content did not. The extrusion increased the insolubility of protein, which resulted in a significant decrease in solubility of albumin and globulin fractions, and an increase in the insoluble residue",

    "abstract": "The most sensitive and time-consuming technological step of beer production is the fermentation of wort. Problems during fermentation will not only prolong production time but it will lead to the deterioration of beer quality. Most often it is due to low zinc concentration of the wort or the yeast. Due to lack of zinc the fermentation lasts longer, composition of fermentation by-products changes, maltose intake slows down, sedimentation ability and heat sensitivity of the yeast increase. In Part I of our work, the factors affecting the degree of zinc supply of wort were examined. During the examination of zinc supply of wort two kinds of beer were produced: all-malt beer and beer with adjunct. Change of zinc concentration was followed throughout the brewing process at every technological step. It was found that concentration of zinc gradually decreases during production of wort, and only a small fraction of the calculated amount appears in it. Wort made with adjunct has even lower zinc concentration than all-malt wort. In all malt wort 3.4%, while in wort containing adjunt only 0.4% of the zinc appeared in the wort. Yeast can absorb only the ionic form of zinc during fermentation, thus we had elaborated a method for the separation of the organic and inorganic form of zinc, which was followed by the determination of the concentration of ionic zinc in wort prior to fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Chelidonii herba has long been known in herbal medicine for its choleretic, cholagogue, spasmolytic and antiviral activities. It is important to monitor the amount of mineral elements in Chelidonii herba preparations consumed mainly for their phytotherapeutical effects. In addition to organic compounds, dissoluble mineral elements in the teas and tinctures of herbs may also have a role in therapy. The concentration of 24 elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Ti, V, Zn) in crude drugs (herb and root), in their aqueous solutions (infusion, decoction) and alcoholic extracts were studied by ICP-OES. The difference between the concentration of elements in extracts - except for copper, manganese and sodium - was highly significant. It has been found that the root contains higher concentrations of mineral elements except for boron, copper, phosphorus and sulphur. The infusion contained most elements in the highest concentration and proved to be the best source for obtaining minerals. The same tendency was observed in the case of dissolutions. In aqueous extracts, the dissolution of mineral elements was between 10% and 65% for most elements, especially for potassium (65%) and phosphorus (54%). The dissolution of mineral elements in the case of tinctures decreased with increasing alcohol concentration. It may be stated that the presence of macro- and microelements in extracts greatly contribute to their therapeutical value.",

There are some environmental factors, which can affect nutritional components of plants being the raw materials in the food industry. Plants have developed a number of defense mechanisms to any injuries occurring. Jasmonates — formed from linolenic acid on the allene oxide synthase pathway — are considered to play the key role in plant defense mechanisms. It has been found that there is a relationship between jasmonates and production of new proteins, glucosinolates and polyphenolic compounds. The effect of jasmonates on carbohydrates and other plant metabolites has also been reported. Jasmonates are characterised by olfactory properties and thus can exert an effect on sensory quality of foods and contribute to commercial attractiveness of foods. Moreover, the implications resulting from consumption of jasmonate-affected foods appear to be of high immensity and can have severe adverse effects on human health, and on the other hand, jasmonates appear to be a promising means in directed production of chemical compounds and pharmaceuticals as well as a preservative substance during food storage.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition in Europe is characterised by a positive energy balance, excessive fat and sugar intakes, while consumption of complex carbohydrate sources like bread and potatoes as well as of fruit and vegetables is too low. Together with insufficient physical activity, unhealthy nutrition is considered as the major determinant for the high prevalence of overweight, obesity and related diseases. In addition, current nutrition is often deficient in certain essential micronutrients like folic acid, for instance. Food fortification may help improve the supply, although a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grain cereal and with a moderate fat content is the better option. Fortunately, health awareness of consumers is increasing and this is also mirrored in the popularity of functional food, having beneficial effects on health and wellbeing. While these may contribute to a healthy nutrition, they can only be part of a broad food choice. The requirements of vulnerable population groups are another matter of concern. This is particularly true for the increasing number of elderly that are prone to malnutrition but difficult to reach by new nutrition trends. In conclusion, healthy food choices should be encouraged and special attention be paid to particular risk groups like pregnant women and elderly.",

According to the results obtained in the study, MA-10 strain exhibited non-haemolytic activity and various degrees of sensitivity to most of the tested antibiotics. The strain showed good resistance to the gastrointestinal system and maintained its viability under these conditions. Its antimicrobial activity against human or clinical bacterial and fungal microorganisms and fish bacteria was determined in the range of 2.38–11.22 mm. The MA-10 strain was able to assimilate cholesterol ranging from 31.42 to 82.30%. The strain showed 9.34% ferrous-ion chelating and 32% DPPH free radical scavenging activities.

Newly described species and genera as well as reassignment of former taxa belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are considered. Taxonomic changes are derived from results of 16S rRNA gene analysis confirmed by other molecular techniques and traditional methods. The review is aimed to update relevant taxonomic information for those not directly involved in taxonomy, however, this kind of information will have significance in understanding the microbial ecology of food systems and promote improvement of preservation methods, fermentation technologies as well as enhance the safety of products.",

For this purpose, a total of 353 surveys were carried out to beef buyers who reside in three Spanish cities. To analyse the consumers’ demand information we used Chi-square tests. The results showed that information about sanitary and waste analysis and animal-rearing methods were the most demanded by consumers. Also, we found that there were clear links between the demand for information on the voluntary labelling of fresh beef and sociodemographic variables, such as gender, age, level of education, and the family income of the respondents.",

    "abstract": "Preservative qualities of caraway, known from ancient times, have regained importance as 21st century food safety issues predominate. Essential oil content and its composition of annual caraway varies significantly when row spacing and nutrient supply are manipulated under experimental conditions. During 2006–2007, Carum carvi var. annua cultivar ‘SZK-1’ was sown in small plots in three replications with two factors in split plot design. The row spacings were 24 cm, 36 cm, and 48 cm, and six nutrient application rates were applied (Control, N0K80, N80K0, N80K80, N80+70K0, N80+70K80). The results show that the percentage of essential oil content is influenced by the row space. Furthermore, our data show that increased potassium level enhances the amount of d-carvone in the oil. Every treatment of potassium produced higher d-carvone levels (53.34%) than those found in the control. In 2006, the first year of the two-year study, the highest carvone level (66.25%) was measured in the treatment of N80+70K80, whereas in 2007 the highest level occurred in the N80K80 (49.216%) treatment.",

The obtained data indicate a better dressing percentage for wild boars from the Papuk region, with mean values of 77.35% for piglets, 79.61% for yearlings, 80.1% for subadults and 81.93% for adults. The dressing percentage for wild boars from the Spacva region was on average 75.10% for piglets, 73.68% for yearlings, 74.85% for subadults and 63.24% for adults. Furthermore, the internal organs were divided into eatable (heart, liver and kidneys) and non-eatable viscera. Of the complete viscera weight, the eatable part represented 17.57% in piglets, 17.97% in yearlings, 13.37% in subadults and 15.69% in adult boars from the Papuk region. The same values for the Spacva region were 19.79% in piglets, 14.06% into yearlings, 12.87% in subadults and 8.67% in adults. The results obtained in this study indicate a better growth rate and dressing percentage for wild boars from the Papuk region. When the similar feeding potential and habitat characteristics of both hunting grounds are taken in consideration, the most possible explanation for the observed differences is crossbreeding of wild boars with domestic pigs. The nomadic keeping of domestic pigs in the area of Spacva remains a huge problem for the preservation of the pure, autochthonous wild boar genome.",

A significant increase in foam capacity was recorded at 0.5 g succinic anhydride/g concentrate, and foam stability decreased detrimentally following acylation. Fat absorption capacity was not improved by acylation. At pH 3.5, protein solubility of acylated concentrate was low (<14%). Hydrolysis of protein concentrate with pancreatin resulted in significant increase in protein solubility at neutral pH.

Cryoscopic temperature, onset point, and glass transition temperature (Tg) gradually decreased as the quantity and proportion of acid whey increased in the ice-cream. Rheological results indicated that using HNF, acid whey produced more creamy and smooth ice-cream.

The concentration of esters of methanol and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol decreased during the fermentation/aging process, whereas major alcohols of noni juice, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol, increased their concentration during the process. During the 60 days of the process the volatile composition of the noni juice had reached stability. These chemical changes justify that fermented juice possesses a flavour less pungent than fresh juice due to an important decrease in the hexanoic and octanoic contents, as well as a greater fruity note due to the increment in ester concentrations.",

Results of the four representative, nationwide dietary surveys completed in this period have been analysed for macro-, micronutrient intakes and overweight/obesity. The food consumption-related vital statistics provided by Hungarian Central Statistical Office were also analysed and compared. There are certain signs of favourable improvements: slight decrease of energy intake in females, growing share of plant protein, less saturated, more polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, less sugar. These findings are in parallel with some positive general statistical issues: the extension of life expectancy, lesser acute myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and stomach cancer mortality, more vegetables and fruit, lesser lard, more oil consumption. On the other hand, there are several detrimental nutritional issues that influence the health status of Hungarian population: still high energy, fat and cholesterol intake, low complex carbohydrates, too much sodium (salt), insufficiencies in some vitamin, macro- and microelements intake. The number of overweight/obese people takes up fairly high level. The surveys somewhat revealed the role of nutrition in the health status of population and now a particle of possibility for its improvement is available",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the residue levels of the organochlorine pesticides in cows’ milk from Karlovac County, Croatia. The study included 48 pooled milk samples: 40 pooled samples of non-processed (raw) milk and 8 pooled samples of processed milk collected in the Karlovac County from May 2003 until April 2004. Organochlorine pesticides DDT and derivates, HCH, lindane, heptachlor and endosulfan were determined using the GC-ECD method. The detection limit was 0.01 μg kg −1 . The determined amounts of organochlorine pesticides were predominantly and significantly below the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) set by the European Union and which Croatia has also recently adopted as its standard. The study has confirmed pesticide persistence in milk samples from our country despite the fact that some of them have been banned some thirty years ago, which indicates a high degree of dispersion of this substances in the environment. Taking into account that milk is a foodstuff of high biological value consumed frequently and in large quantities by vulnerable groups of population (children, pregnant women, elderly people), the continued monitoring and control of organochlorine pesticides in milk is therefore of great importance for public health.",

The objective of this paper was to analyse the influence of electrode distance on the heating behaviour of RF on condition that the sample shape, size, and location between the electrodes were defined. Considering peanut butter (PB) and wheat flour (WF) as sample food, a 3D computer simulation model was developed using COMSOL, which was experimentally validated by a RF machine (27.12 MHz, 6 kW). Specifically, the electrode distances were selected as 84, 89, 93, 99 and 89, 93, 98, 103 (mm) for RF heating of PB and WF, respectively. Results showed that the simulated results and experimental data agreed well; the temperature-time histories of the RF heating of PB and WF were approximate straight lines; both the temperature uniformity index and the heating rate decreased with the increase of the electrode distance; the heating rate had a negative logarithmic linear relationship with the electrode distance, which was independent of the types, geometry shapes and sizes of low moisture foods.",

Fatty acid profile analysis showed palmitic acid to be the dominant fatty acid (45.24±1.88%). During lactation C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0 contents decreased, while C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and CLA increased significantly, which can be associated with the change of nutrition from hay to fresh grazing. The cholesterol content of the sheep milk reached 14.88 mg/100 ml milk or 283.43 mg/100 g fat as an average for the whole period of milking.

Pre-smoking usage could reduce the total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB) values better than the post-smoking usage during storage. However, post-smoking application was more effective at preventing the moulds and yeasts (MY) growth. PS in brine at pre-smoking was most efficient, which could keep trout fillets for even four weeks at 6±1°C storage within the range of consumable limits. Additionally, PS usage reduced the contaminated bacterial diversity and especially eliminated the outgrowth of Serratia liquefaciens. As a conclusion, pre-smoking application repressed the contaminated microbial growth during the storage of smoked trout fillets, which may eliminate the microbial risks.",

Nitrogen fertilisation caused significant increase in nitrate, asparagine, and glutamine contents as compared to organic farming. Nitrite content was found to be more independent of farming technologies than nitrate. Tubers of cultivar Rioja had the lowest nitrate content irrespective of season or technology. In conclusion, the absolute amount and changes of different anti-nutritive components of potato tubers were influenced differently by the technology, genotype, and season in a complex manner. Organic farming had no effect on the glycoalkaloid content, but the nitrate levels had a tendency to be lower compared to conventional farming. This can be seen as a positive effect of organic farming.",

Thus, our aim was to develop a coordinated benchmark strategy to increase the trade of organic products. To get more details on the Hungarian organic milk market, we conducted professional deep interviews and simultaneously applied the \"mystery shopping\" method. Nowadays, the market of organic milk and dairy products is slowly increasing in Hungary, however, there is no available statistical data. In the selection there are mostly Hungarian originated products, but some yoghurt, milk, and butter assortments are imported. Partial responsibility belongs to small sale shops' habit of risk-avoidance. Without a proper selection of products, stores are unable to satisfy consumers' needs; thus they focus on pushing certain products to increase demand. According to our results, 'low price category', 'local/regional product', and 'prestige product' strategies with attached in-store marketing elements are able to reverse the effects of an unfavourable marketing process.",

During the rapid growth phase, the main mulberry juice sugars, glucose and fructose, were largely consumed, and the acidic metabolites, lactic acid and acetic acid, were produced accordingly. A slow decrease in the concentration of the main organic acid, citric acid, was also observed during fermentation. After 4 d fermentation, anthocyanin content showed a 44.4% reduction, but the total amount of soluble phenolics and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity showed no significant changes (P>0.05). This suggests that L. mesenteroides fermentation of mulberry juice is a good strategy to enhance its probiotic value and to decrease the sugar content without changing the anti-glucosidase activity, which is required to reduce postprandial rise in blood glucose.",

An open field experiment was conducted to study the effect of irrigation and potassium supplementation on the yield and lycopene content of processed tomato fruit. Three different treatments (regularly irrigated RI, irrigation cut-off 30 days before harvest CO, and rainfed RF unirrigated control) and two different potassium fertilisations (P) were applied. Regular irrigation significantly decreased the lycopene content of tomato fruits. The CO treatment resulted in the highest total lycopene without potassium supplementation. Potassium supplementation, given at the time before fruit maturity, significantly increased the lycopene concentration of cultivar Brigade F1, independently of irrigation. The closest correlation was at 700 nm R2=0.38 and R2=0.45, between reflectance and the (all-E)-lycopene and the (9Z)+(13Z)-lycopene isomers, respectively.",

There were no significant differences in shear force values or organoleptic quality between the cuts, which indicates their similar usefulness as meat for roasting. The content and profile of intramuscular collagen did not influence the organoleptic quality or shear force values of silverside and strip loin.",

In a cross-sectional design, 416 subjects (180 men and 236 women) aged 20 to 50 years were selected by stratified multistage random sampling. Dietary intakes were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Mental health information was collected by depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) questionnaire. Three major dietary patterns were extracted by factor analysis: vegetable, Western, and Mediterraneantype dietary patterns. Regression analysis showed a strong positive association between Western dietary pattern and anxiety (β=0.66; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.28), and stress (β=0.84; 95% CI: 0.1, 1.57). Also, there was an inverse association between Mediterranean-type dietary pattern and anxiety (β= ‒0.81; 95% CI: ‒1.43, ‒0.19). These associations remained statistically significant even after adjustments for demographic characteristics, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, and energy intake. No association was found between vegetable dietary pattern and any of the assessed psychiatric disorders.",

The results showed that marmalades made with healthy sweeteners had a less elastic character and were thinner in consistency than those made with sucrose. Lightness was shown to be highest in mandarin orange marmalades made with tagatose, although colour was stable for 180 days to one year of storage. Tagatose also enhanced the antioxidant activity of these marmalades. All marmalades were microbiologically stable.

In the absence of adequate plant protection and extreme weather conditions such as a predominantly humid, warm year, black rot of grapes can be expected. The pathogen can cause high yield losses due to grape rot and reduce wine quality if the infection is severe. The evolution of certain biogenic amine compounds were investigated under the influence of grape black rot. The results obtained showed that they were present in low concentrations from an oenological point of view. Polyphenol composition was consistent with the literature, blackening affected mainly the concentration of catechin. Black rot fungus does not produce β-glucosidase enzyme. In terms of resveratrol content, black rot has no particular effect. However, like Botrytis cinerea , it produces glycerol and, proportionally, gluconic acid in lower concentrations. It can be concluded that black rot of grapes does not cause health problems when introduced into wine processing.",

With this purpose, a questionnaire was developed in accordance with the Ajzen's Planned Behaviour Theory and was then completed by 784 interviewees to retrieve quantitative and qualitative data. These included demographic, consumption pattern, and behavioural pattern variables collected in a Likert scale. Spearman correlations were performed between ordinal and continuous variables, and chi-squared tests of independency applied to contingency tables between nominal variables. A positive correlation was found between age and frequency of purchasing. Men consume honey more frequently than women. Portuguese honey has a good reputation, and it is preferred in relation to imported honey. The Portuguese consumer is not completely aware of the different floral characteristics of honey, other hive products, and positive externalities associated with beekeeping. By filling the marketing gap identified, production and consumption of honey could be increased in Portugal. Marketing campaigns promoting the health benefits of honey and other hive products, as well as the externalities of beekeeping may be advantageous.",

The effect of the pretreatment methods on the quality of wines was assessed using oenological parameters analysis and volatile compounds analysis. The results indicated that the freezing grape and cold maceration pretreatments improved the colour and increased the contents of phenolic and volatile compounds compared with the control, and freezing was considered to be the most suitable pretreatment method for ‘Zaoheibao’ wine. With respect to ‘Summer Black’ wines, cold maceration and lower maturity were considered to be suitable. Cold maceration enhanced the contents of phenolic and volatile compounds, while lower maturity increased the contents of volatile compounds and total acid.

In this study, this strain was used as adjunct culture in white-brined cheese to improve the physicochemical, textural, and aromatic properties, as well as antimicrobial activity. Cheeses with E. faecium HZ had a higher sensory score, which could be due to the aroma-active compounds produced by this strain.

In thrombotic mice, LPYS1 improved the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), while decreasing the thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen (FIB) content. In thrombotic mouse serum, LPYS1 decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), while also increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Moreover, LPYS1 upregulated the mRNA expression levels of copper/zinc-SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD), manganese-SOD (Mn-SOD), and CAT in the colon tissues of thrombotic mice, while downregulating those of NF-κB p65, IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) mRNA. In tail vein vascular tissues, LPYS1 suppressed the mRNA expression levels of NF-κB p65, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin. The abundances of both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria were altered by LPYS1. These findings show that LPYS1 has the capacity to protect mice from thrombosis, while also revealing some of the underlying mechanisms of this effect.",

For the majority of Hungarian consumers the food safety issue is a top priority problem. Consumers consider the microbial and hygienic quality of food, food processing and catering as the most important threat for food safety. The elder generations and the women respondents were more worried about food safety problems. In general, respondents with lower qualification level underestimate the importance of food safety problems. In most cases there were no significant differences between the opinion of respondents with at least MSc qualification level in field of human or natural sciences, having no relation to food safety, and the opinion of specialists in food safety. Combining factor and cluster analysis, five main consumer types can be separated from each other from viewpoint of evaluation of various risk factors threatening food safety. These groups can be matched with the social status of respondents. Consumers demand a more rigid official control of food safety, even if this could increase the food price. Most of the consumers accept the modern food preservation methods.",

After polar phase capillary gas-chromatography, mass spectrometric identification of as many compounds as possible was carried out to precisely describe the aroma profile of the cultivars. For conceptualizing the results a data evaluation and interpretation method has been elaborated considering the component ratios that are much more characteristic of the cultivars than the absolute amounts themselves. Relative intensity interpretation of the peak areas (y-axis) and Programmed Temperature Retention Index (x-axis) measurement resulted in aromagrams individually characteristic of the cultivated varieties. In an identification experiment the cultivars have been recognized successfully by the graphic visualization of the results called aroma-spectra (by analogy to mass spectrometry) method.",

A series of peach nectar samples (with approximately 65% fruit) was prepared using commercially processed peach purée with sucrose and substituting sugar with low-calorie sweetener aspartame and fructose (alone and in combination in a sweetness ratio of 1:1) taking into account their sweetness. To prevent reduction of viscosity and mouthfeel/body of low-calorie peach nectars, different concentrations of hydrocolloids were added. A control sample was prepared by mixing fruit purée with a sucrose solution (7% mass fraction) to provide a 14% (in total solids) nectar. Rheological measurements were carried out on a rotational viscosimeter Rheotest 3 at 20 C and 5°C. The flow of all peach nectars was characterized as pseudoplastic. Among all used hydrocolloids, addition of only 0.03% of carrageenan to the peach nectar was enough to obtain viscosity similar to the viscosity of the control sample.",

In the present investigation, only ethanol vapour treatment proved to be promising in enhancing the shelf-life of guava fruits, as other treatments showed phytotoxic effect. Ethanol treated fruits showed smaller weight loss and higher flesh firmness during storage. The activities of polygalacturonase, ß-galactosidase and cellulase were decreased by all the vapour treatments, however, ethanol was the most effective. It also reduced ethylene evolution and the contents of total soluble solids and ascorbic acid. All the vapour treatments could effectively decrease the mold colony forming units of surface microflora and eliminate coliforms.

The object of the present study was to investigate glucosinolates distribution as well as their losses during blanching and cooking in edible parts of white cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi and collard. In all vegetable, only indole glucosinolates as precursors of anticarcinogenic compounds were identified, while glucoraphane was not detected. In cauliflower and collard, proportion of indole glucosinolates was more then 90%, followed by kohlrabi (>70%) and white cabbage (>50%). Analysis of glucosinolates losses during blanching and cooking showed substantial decrease in all vegetables. The major losses were observed for cauliflower, around 60%, for cooked vegetable, followed by white cabbage (55%), kohlrabi (53%) and collard (44%). The losses after blanching were approximately 15% less then in cooked vegetables.",

NIR analysis (NIRSystems 6500) was performed on original samples in transflectance mode (400–2500 nm wavelength range, 0.1 mm layer thickness, aluminium-plated reflector). Treatment characteristics (temperature, heat-sum, sampling event) could be estimated effectively. Calibration for AV was robust: R 2 =0.927; 1-VR=0.786. Weak relationship was found for PV (R 2 =0.48) and CON (R 2 =0.109). For pAV, good calibration was gained, expressly below 200 °C, in the 2000–2500 nm wavelength interval (R 2 =0.912; 1-VR=0.772). Based on calibration and cross-validation results, NIR technique may be a rapid, solvent-free alternative for the estimation of acid value and p -anisidine value of lard below 200 °C.",

They are consumed fresh and cooked, in salad mixes, freshly pressed, fermented, minimally processed form, stored under different conditions, etc. Since they are in close contact with the environment, natural or artificial, and have a natural microbiota on their surface highly variable as a function of the surrounding, they are prone to get contaminated with human pathogens, too. More attention is paid to the food-borne outbreaks in the last 10 years related to the consumption of contaminated plant foods, and it is also in the focus of our interest. The main activities of the Unit cover the following areas: microbial contamination of fruits and vegetables, also in relation to the soil, the methods of cell count reduction using also non-thermal methods, the biofilm formation and the response of Bacillus cereus to the technological stresses.",

The autotrophic growth of microalgae is slow, but can be accelerated by optimizing their cultivation conditions. Efficiency optimizations for time and economy should be performed in many parallel experiments. A new high-throughput microalgae cultivation method is presented here, applying 24-low-well microplate with varying illumination, in which the cell growth is followed via evaluation of scanned images. A strain of the genus Nannochloropsis and two Chlorella vulgaris species have been chosen as well described and frequently applied model organisms in order to test the recently developed cultivation system. In these scaled down experiments, the custom design lighting panel was tested by studying the effect of the colour of illumination on cell growth kinetics. RGB LEDs (i.e. light emitting diodes, red: 622 nm, green: 528 nm, and blue: 467 nm) were used individually or together providing red, green, blue, and white colours. While the effect of light’s colour on algae growth was evaluated, also the new system was proven to be suitable for comparing maximal growth rates for different microalgae strains. While the tested two Chlorella isolates reached 1.2–1.4 g l –1 concentrations, the Nannochloropsis strain reached 1.4 g l –1 final cell dry weight, and specific growth rates were observed between 0.58–0.62 day –1 .",

    "abstract": "Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is a type of vitamin K. MK-7 is produced via bacterial fermentation, and in order to reach the desired product purity, several downstream processing steps, including extraction, drying, ultrasonication, must be carried out. These processes, however, need to be carried out in such fashion to ensure the least amount of vitamin K lost and maximum recovery into the end-product. Therefore, in this study, drying, storage at 4 and −20 °C, and ultrasonication steps were evaluated under different conditions. Static liquid fermentations were conducted in McCartney bottles to explore the maximum MK-7 secretion potentials in different glycerol and glucose-based media compositions that were optimized in our previous studies. Maximum 32.5±0.4 mg l −1 and 14.6±0.4 mg l −1 concentrations were achieved in glycerol and glucose-based media, respectively. Concentrations of MK-7 produced under same fermentation conditions in 30 ml McCartney amber bottles with 3 ml of media in them and in 75 ml culture tubes with 20 ml media were compared. Also, ultrasonication, drying, and storage conditions were investigated to ensure the least amount of vitamin K is lost. Results showed that drying under forced air flow was the fastest, thus, demonstrated a better preservation of the vitamin, and should replace vacuum drying. Ultrasonication for 15 min seems to be safe and sufficient for phase transition for analysis. Also, storage at refrigerated temperatures seems to preserve MK-7 at least for one week. Furthermore, fermentations in McCartney bottles indicated how MK-7 concentrations are distributed in different zones of the static liquid broth. Culture tube results provided the conclusion as of how the metabolism of MK-7 changes in static fermentation when the scale-up process begins from McCartney bottle to culture tubes. Results in general showed a clearer road map to ensuring better quality and preservation of the valuable end-product, and illuminated more the path to further scaling up of the fermentation process for commercial production of MK-7.",

Our results showed that all PKHs had anti-ACE activity, and the lowest molecular weight fraction PKH4 had the highest ACE inhibitory activity. Lineweaver–Burk plots illustrated that the inhibition types of PKH3 and PKH4 were non-competitive. The K i of PKH4 was lower than K i of PKH3; suggesting PKH4 had high affinity to ACE. Amino acid composition analysis showed that the best anti-ACE peptide PKH4 possessed high levels of hydrophobic amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids. In summary, our findings demonstrated that high anti-ACE activity is negatively related to the size of the PKHs and possibly the composition of amino acids, and the PKH4 was the best ACE inhibitor. Further, peach kernel peptides can be developed as a functional food for patients with hypertension.",

HPLC analysis showed lowest coumarin content in Ceylon cinnamon bark samples (0.08-0.15 mg g -1 ), whereas other samples contained a significantly higher amounts of coumarin (1.38-5.80 mg g -1 ). Cinnamon based dietary supplements contained 0.007-1.19 mg coumarin/tablet.

A total of 32 volatile constituents were detected, which represented 4.57 mg kg−1 of the fruit. The composition of volatile constituents of the fruit included 9 terpene compounds (49.1% of the total volatile composition), 11 ketones (9%), 5 aldehydes (29.2%), 4 alcohols (3.6%), 2 esters (8.2%) and a paraffin (0.8%). Major compounds were (Z)-b-ocimene (26.6% of the total volatile composition), (E)-cinnamaldehyde (25.5%) and limonene (17.0%). By application of odour activity values, seven constituents were considered as aroma-active volatiles, from which the most important were (E)-cinnamaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, limonene, (Z)-β-ocimene, linalool, methyl (E)-cinnamate, and β-caryophyllene.",

    "abstract": "Three yeasts from the genus Williopsis (W. saturnus var. mrakii NCYC500, W. saturnus var. saturnus CBS254 and W. californica NCYC2590) were examined for their ability to ferment longan juice and to enhance formation of longan wine aroma compounds. The three yeasts showed similar growth kinetics and pH changes during fermentation. W. californica was the least sugar consumer. Many of the naturally occurring volatiles (ethyl esters, fatty acids, aldehydes, and terpenes) in the juice were partially or completely degraded. The three yeasts varied with their ability to produce and utilise volatiles. Esters were the major volatiles produced with some esters being catabolised while other esters remained stable. The amount of most alcohols increased while of aldehydes decreased. W. saturnus CBS254 was the best producer of ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenethyl acetate, whereas W. californica NCYC2590 was the highest producer of butyl acetate. Ethanol was produced in similar amounts by W. mrakii and W. saturnus but at a minimal level by W. californica. W. mrakii formed the highest amount of isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol and 2-phenylethyl alcohol. Although the amounts of most of the major volatiles at the end of fermentation (day 14) differed statistically among the yeasts, it remained to be seen whether the quantitative differences can be detected organoleptically. These fi ndings suggest that yeasts from the genus Williopsis could be exploited for longan wine aroma enhancement either singly or in co-inoculation with Saccharomyces.",

Mandulakajszi was the most acidic (citric acid: 1597.2 mg/100 g). The malic acid content was similar for all three varieties during ripening. In case of Harcot, the β-carotene content was high in 2008 (3.58 mg/100 g in 90% maturity), however in 2010 it was lower due to environmental influences (2.38 mg/100 g). The pH value was similar for all examined varieties in all ripening stages (3.16–3.50), the TSS/TA value was highest in the 100% mature fruit (18.41) of Gönci magyar kajszi.",

The losses of ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total carotenoids, and antioxidant activity were determined as 11.54%, 7.56%, 29.08% and 17.36%, respectively. Generally, greater reductions occurred in blank samples which were not treated with any chemicals, but were packed under modified atmosphere conditions. A little weight loss, total dry matter loss, and polyphenol oxidase activity increase was found in samples packaged in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere and treated with Ca-ascorbate + citric acid. This condition was also found to be more effective in limiting the quality losses and preventing organoleptic degradation. On the contrary, control samples were generally rejected by the panelists at the 95% probability level because of their deleterious odour and colour.",

Significant differences were observed in the saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acid content. The presence of lauric, myristic and palmitic acids in the flesh of sea bream in quantities far exceeding those in sea bass make sea bream less suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases. The poly-unsaturated n-3 fatty acids with both anti-atherogenetic and anti-inflammatory action in sea bass surpass those of sea bream by a total of 30%. Sea bass also contains 60% more C22:6n-3.

Therefore, Trappist cheese samples were produced from cow milk of 2.8%, 3.5%, and 5% milk fat. The effect of ripening was evaluated with Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and sensory evaluation (scoring test, 10 trained panellists). Springiness and cohesiveness values were significantly higher by enzyme-treated semi-hard cheese samples at lower milk fat levels. Sensory evaluation showed that the enzyme-treatment led to higher scores by cheese samples made from cow milk of 3.5% and 5% milk fat. Frankfurter was made with 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.7% tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and partly enzyme-treated with 0.2% commercial mTG enzyme preparation. Our results showed that mTG is able to significantly improve hardness and crunchiness by frankfurters made with 0.1% phosphate addition.

    "abstract": "Microwave vacuum drying is a novel and mild food preserving technology. Beside its basic preserving function, it can be combined with other technologies, like hot-air drying. As a result of this combination, special snack can be produced from apple. The product is characterized by its unique consistency, high nutritional value, and consumer preference. In this work physical (dry mass content, hardness, bulk density, and colour), sensory (appearance, colour, odour, taste, texture) and nutritional (antioxidant activity and total phenolics) properties of dried apple snack were investigated as a function of pre-drying, microwave energy input, and batch weight. For evaluation of data, central composite experimental design was applied. According to the results, the physical properties of products produced by microwave vacuum drying combined with hot-air pre-drying (CMVD) mainly depend on the specific energy input. Higher specific energy input results higher dry mass content, which is associated with harder consistency, lower bulk density, and positive consumer perception as well. Bulk density had an optimum point of batch weight at 336 g. Higher value of pre-dried dry mass content resulted lighter colour but less antioxidant activity and less total phenolics, therefore shorter hot-air drying and prolonged microwave vacuum drying is recommended.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of temperature and different compression/ decompression rates on the efficiency of Listeria inactivation by HPP. Stationary phase cultures of Listeria innocua were subjected to 300 MPa for 5 min at 4, 10, and 20 °C using different compression and decompression rates. Inactivation was more efficient at low temperature and with lowest compression and decompression rates (1.5 MPa s –1 and 3.2 MPa s –1 , respectively). Kinetics of pressure building up and decompression, as well as temperature, have a significant impact on the outcome of Listeria inactivation by HPP. The results may contribute to the design of HPP protocols that ensure food safety, while preserving nutritional and organoleptic properties better.",

The Thermobifida genus includes four species: T. fusca , T. alba , T. cellulosilytica , and T. halotolerans . T. fusca YX is the far best characterized strain of this taxon and several cellulases and hemicellulases have been cloned from it for industrial purposes targeting paper industry, biofuel, and feed applications. Unfortunately, sequence data of such enzymes are almost exclusively restricted to this single species; however, we demonstrated earlier by zymography that other T. alba and T. cellulosilytica strains encode the same enzyme sets. Recently, the advances in whole genome sequencing by the use of next generation genomics platforms accelerated the selection process of valuable hydrolases from uncharacterized bacterial species for cloning purposes. For this purpose T. cellulosilytica TB100 T type strain was chosen for de novo genome sequencing. We have assembled the genome of T. cellulosilytica strain TB100 T into 168 contigs and 19 scaffolds, with reference length of 4 327 869 bps, 3 589 putative coding sequences, 53 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. The analysis of the annotated genome revealed the existence of 27 putative hydrolases belonging to 14 different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. The investigation of identified, cloned, and heterologously multiple cellulases, mannanases, xylanases, and amylases may result in industrial applications beside gaining useful basic research related information.",

    "abstract": "Selenium is an essential trace element for both man and animals whose dietary intake is not sufficient in many parts of the world. Some countries with an originally low dietary selenium intake have instituted fertilisation programmes in order to raise cereal selenium concentrations and thus boost dietary intakes. An altemative approach to improve the daily dietary selenium intake would be to increase the selenium concentration of carcass meat by supplementation of meat animals for a limited period prior to slaughter. Thus, animal diseases related to selenium deficiency can also be prevented. Sixteen Scottish Blackface lambs were stratified according to liveweight and then randomly allocated to one of four groups: unsupplemented, 3.5, 7.0 or 10.5 mg sodium selenite/head/week. After 14 weeks the lambs were slaughtered and samples of shoulder and thigh muscle, liver and kidney were obtained for analysis. All three treatments caused an increase in whole blood glutathion peroxidase and plasma selenium concentrations over controls. Shoulder, thigh and liver selenium concentration exhibited a dose response relationship to treatment. Kidney selenium concentrations were unaffected by treatment. As it is well documented that selenium and vitamin E play a complementary role as antioxidants, plasma vitamin E concentrations were also determined at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the experiment. They showed a continuous decline probably due to the low dietary vitamin E intake of the lambs during the trial. Tissue vitamin E concentrations were largely unaffected by the dose of selenium supplementation. It can be concluded that supplementation of meat animals with selenium is an effective means to increase human dietary intakes of the element.",

Fatty liver in young male Wistar albino rats was induced by 2% cholesterol, 20% sunflower oil and 0.5% cholic acid added to the normal food and 3% alcoholic water was administered to rats for 9 days. The development of hyperlipidemy was detected by measuring serum parameters and fatty liver was proved by morphological investigations.

The bile fluid samples were digested with a mixture of HNO3 and H2 O2 . The results show that the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in bile juice increased significantly in hyperlipidemic rats compared to the control. Significant concentration changes have also been detected for chromium and manganese. The changes in metal ion metabolism also point to the damage of liver cells owing to metal complex evacuation.",

    "abstract": "Blanching of vegetables before freezing has some advantages as well as a number of disadvantages. Process optimization involves measuring the rate of enzyme destruction, such that the blanching time is just long enough to destroy the indicator enzyme. Eventually, peroxidases were almost universally the enzymes of choice, as they are usually the most heat-stable enzymes found in vegetables and fruits, so by the time they are inactivated no other enzymes or micro-organisms remain. But there is no evidence that peroxidases are involved in deteriorative reactions in the food. The aim of this work was to improve blanching technology in Hungarian frozen food industry with special emphasis on broccoli treatment. Instead of peroxidases, lipoxygenases were chosen to determine the adequate blanching parameters. Usually, lipoxygenases accompany lipases, so lipase activity is measured, too. On the basis of model blanching experiments, the conclusion is that lipoxygenase could be used as indicator enzyme. Being less heat stable than peroxidase, this enzyme requires shorter heat treatment, hence its inactivation should result in minimum quality deterioration and economic loss.",

Zinc supplementation also alleviates hyperglycaemia of the same type of diabetic patients contributing to improved insulin activity. Some Portuguese plants are commonly used as teas, alcoholic extracts or as powders by diabetic people and as medicines. Although their active principle is not yet known, the importance of their chromium and zinc content in the claimed therapeutic properties should not be disregarded. Thus, the determination of chromium and zinc in some Portuguese medicinal plants was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Almost all the analysed plants contain chromium and zinc at the normal level for these elements but many plants, which are used for the preparation of teas or other forms of remedies to help those type of diabetic patients, contain them in higher levels. _",

The paper gives a short review and appraisal of the most frequently used dietary assessment methods: 24-h dietary recall, dietary record, food frequency questionnaire and diet history. The background of useful evaluation seems as follows: the skill of interviewers, the common coding system of foodstuffs, the reliable conversion of food to nutrients (comprehensive food composition tables). On the basis of above mentioned criteria the repeated 24-h recall seems to be the first candidate for the common dietary assessment method.

Thirty of the present compounds were selected to characterise the changes of flavour. Significant differences were found between wines fermented with different yeast strains. Application of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter alone accelerated the fermentation but this caused only little change in the aroma profile and content. Candida stellata contributed weakly to the production of aroma, especially to that of the longer carbon chain ethyl esters. Characteristic compounds of aged wine were detected in bottle aged Tokaji Aszú. The change of aroma profile as a function of bottle storage time was studied. The concentrations of vitispirane, trimethyl dihydronaphtalene, 2-phenylethanol and diethyl succinate increased in the course of ageing time, while those of 3-methyl-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate decreased.",

The processing of wheat into bulgur generally increased the levels of ADF and NDF(+amylase) contents. It can be concluded that bulgur is at least as good as a raw wheat in terms of dietary fibre content. Although there is no essential change in the total protein content, ash and ß-carotene contents of the bulgurs were lower than the ones in the original wheats as a result of debranning.",

The emulsifying salt was added to the cheese blend at a concentration of 0.5% or 1.0%. A control product was also manufactured, which contained monophosphate instead of polyphosphate as emulsifying salt, with all other ingredients being identical to those in the experimental processed cheese spread. Half of the finished products were subjected to accelerated shelf-life testing at 37 °C for 10 days, whereas the other half of them was stored refrigerated at 4 °C for 120 days. Microbiological analyses (enumeration of viable cell counts, mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia, coliforms, yeasts and moulds) and sensory tests were performed at regular intervals. The results showed that polyphosphates had a beneficial effect on the shelf-life of the processed cheese spread tested in that they significantly reduced (P<0.05) the growth or survival rates of spoilage bacteria, especially of mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia. Polyphosphates also beneficially influenced the sensory, including textural properties of the experimental processed cheese spread. All the samples containing less than 1% polyphosphate showed signs of butyric blowing significantly earlier (P<0.05), during both accelerated shelf-life tests and regular refrigerated storage, than did the products fortified with 1% polyphosphate. In conclusion, the suitability of the long-chain polyphosphate formulation tested for shelf life extension of processed cheese spreads was demonstrated.",

Moreover, the pI value shifted to neutral pH and the solubility decreased, especially at the alkaline pH range.ß-Casein modified enzymatically via alkaline phosphatase formed a foam with volume and stability similar to that formed with intact one. In turn, a dramatic decrease in foam stability was found forß-casein modified via acid phosphatase.

    "abstract": "Mycotoxins are natural compounds that may cause various adverse toxicological manifestations in humans and animals. The nature, the severity and scope of their adverse activity are varied and in general, even in small amount they have potent carcinogenic, genotoxic effect and injure the immune system. In order to provide high level of health protection for consumers, the European Union has established strict regulatory limits, whose implementation is enforced.The EC (2001) Commission Regulation sets maximum levels for some mycotoxins in foodstuffs: for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Particular product categories are regulated under specific decisions ordaining control of imported consignments at the point of entry. Due to the fact that only aflatoxins are addressed in the specific decisions, they are the mostly detected and notified mycotoxins in the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The second most frequent group, Ochratoxin A is typically detected during internal EU market controls. Most RASFF notifications concern product categories falling under specific EU decisions, especially the Aflatoxin content of nuts and nut products. Significant amount of aflatoxins can be found also in dried fruits, spices and herbs.The article reviews and analyses the data available in rapid alert system concerning mycotoxins notification, and evaluates the usefulness of this information for risk assessment. The value of RASFF system is unquestionable and it fulfils its intended function included in its name. The system is a significant source of valuable information, but for risk assessment purposes, other additional information is needed. It could be used most effectively for risk assessment, if it was to provide data on the ratio of all/tested/positive lots and if the authorities provided not only the positive results, but also the exact mycotoxins level of every analysed sample.",

To study the effects of storage temperature on growth of spoilage bacteria, numerous samples were kept in successive experiments at 4, 8 or 12 °C. Parameters of the bacterial growth curves were estimated by curve fitting of the colony counts by DMfit programme package of the ComBase softwares, using Baranyi’s dynamic growth model. Linear correlations were found between the respective colony counts and the conductimetric detection times observed in periodic investigations during storage. According to these calibrations, the conductimetric method at 30 °C incubation is able to assess within 8 h whether a sample of pork cutlets contains greater or less than 10 7 CFU g −1 of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria.",

The influence of shortening and milk powder on characteristics of dough enriched with fibres (proving time and dough level) and parameters of bread quality (volume and crumb quality) was traced in two groups of samples: first without and second with 5% of added gluten. Applying regression analysis on measured parameters a mathematical model was defined. Based on presented data and regression analysis concerning samples with and without gluten, it can be stated that fibres enriched bread of the best quality can be made with gluten, shortening and milk powder at the level of 5%, 5% and 2%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Selenium (Se), a main antioxidant component in cereal grain, is essential for animals and human health reducing risk factors of many dangerous diseases. Over the past decades, intake of this trace element had dropped due to low Se content in large areas of European countries including Hungary. Se-rich, high-protein cereal products became a focus for both animal feed and human consumption. In the study, we examined the following: i) grain Se concentration of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale ( Triticosecale Wittm.) intake to detect intra-and inter-genetic variations and ii) possible comparison relationship of this trace element to end product integrity, quality and relevant technological aspects. Se content of the whole meal grain was tested via atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Despite generally poor Se soil content of the experimental area where samples were collected, significant differences were found for both species. In general, triticale contained higher Se concentration than wheat did. Spring type cereals had significantly higher grain Se and protein concentration than those of winter ones. Grain Se content showed positive correlation with magnesium, copper, zinc, manganese, tocopherol and crude protein concentration. Remarkable intra-specific variations were found in Se concentration, however in future, additional studies, methods and resources will be required for identifying ways of increasing Se content in cereal foodstuff and feed.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of soy has long been associated with various health-enhancing effects including hypocholesterolemia, antihypertension, alleviation of post-menopausal symptoms, and reducing risks of ovarian cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Past studies have indicated that these effects are mediated by bioactive components of soy such as isoflavones and bioactive peptides. However, some of these bioactive components could only confer health benefits upon bioconversion by gastrointestinal microorganisms in the intestines. This has led to increased interest to evaluate the possibility of utilizing probiotics to enhance the bioactivities of soyfoods. Probiotics are live microorganisms that could exert health benefits on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Probiotic-fermented soyfoods have been shown to have increased antihypertensive properties and could better alleviate menopausal associated disorders. However, this area is relatively new and although seemed promising, most of the recent findings have emphasized on in vitro evaluations, while the lack of in-vivo evidence and/or incompatible outcomes between in vitro experiments and in-vivo trials has led to the need to better understand the exact mechanisms involved. This present review highlights some of the benefits of soy and addresses the currently investigated bioactivities of probiotic-fermented soyfoods.",

The ice creams contained viable bifidobacteria cells at levels exceeding 10 6 CFU g –1 throughout the storage throughout the storage period. Although the yeast supplement decreased the loss of viability of bifidobacteria during frozen storage of ice creams, it imparted a slightly bitter off-flavour to the samples and it also negatively influenced the original white colour of the product, thereby necessitating further work to develop flavoured varieties of the Saccharomyces cell wall-containing synbiotic ice cream.",

Oligosaccharides consisting of three monomers were detected in the cases of maltose, sucrose, and lactose as monosubstrates, thus this preparation should contain glucosyl-, fructosyl-, and galactosyl-transferase activity.

Use of maltose:sucrose bisubstrate resulted new oligosaccharide(s) (fructosyl-maltose or glucosyl-sucrose). The optimal ratio of substrates in the case of maltose:sucrose was determined to be 1:9. Increase of the dry content of the reaction mixture induced the transfer reaction. The highest oligosaccharide content was obtained at 60% (w/v) substrate concentration.

Changes in the chemical composition of meat of all examined species had the same tendencies. Water and protein content in the meat decreased, while fat content increased. The most frequent fatty acids in the meat of all the examined fish were the following: 18:1 n-9 (oleic), 16:0 (palmitic), 16:1 (palmitoleic), 18:2 n-6 (linoleic), 20:1 (eicosenoic), 20:5 n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20:4 n-6 arachidonic acid and 22:6 n-3 docosahexaeonic acid (DHA). The content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) ranged from 25.03% to 32.43% and displayed a tendency to increase during the observed period. The total content of the n-6 group in the meat of Prussian carp was higher than in other species, which was probably a consequence of specific diet. The total content of n-3 fatty acids in the meat of white bream, bream, vimba and zope was the highest in May, and it declined during July-September. We can conclude that the meat of white bream and vimba contains high nutritional values in terms of EPA and DHA content. The n-3/n-6 ratio was also very favourable: 0.9 to 2.0 in the meat of white bream, bream, vimba and zope, with a clear downward tendency in the observed period.",

The effects of various natural substrates with different phytate contents on secretion of extracellular phytase were investigated and the rice flour with about 5 mg g−1 of phytic acid was found to be the best one. The repression effect of high levels of phytic acid or inorganic phosphorous in fermentation medium (corn flour, wheat grit, soy flour, etc.) on production of phytase was also observed. The optimal concentration of rice flour as main carbon sourc e was determined in combination with sodium nitrate. The maximal activity (≈1500 U l−1, 1.5 times higher than using basal medium) was achieved on the 7th day in media containing 7.12% (w/v) rice flour and 0.86% (w/v) sodium nitrate. Supplementation of fermentation medium with different surfactants such as Tween series (20, 40, 60, 65, 80, 85) and Triton X-100 up to 0.1% (w/v) had no significant effects on the secretion of phytase enzyme, meanwhile at concentrations higher than 0.2% (w/v), decrease in enzyme activity was observed.",

Melting profile and isotherm crystallization were measured by pNMR. Non-isotherm melting and solidification were detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Possible applications of the blends were established. Results show that AMF and coconut oil has limited miscibility, which is dependent on the temperature. Below 22 °C AMF is the softening component, above 22 °C the effect is inverse. Coconut oil accelerates solidification of AMF, however, basic crystal forms of AMF remained.",

The clearest effect of the supplementation was observed in the case of sourdough prepared from starches only. The addition of glucose in the amounts as low as 0.5% has proved to be enough to enhance fermentation effectively. Supplementation of the sourdoughs with peptides was not very effective; however, when used together with glucose, a synergistic effect could be detected. The addition of sprouted seeds allowed to shorten the fermentation process with up to several hours.

Five wine samples of different residual sugar content (2 dry, 2 sweet and one extra fine quality dessert wine) were used from Hungarian wine districts. Due to the lack of certified reference materials method validation and cross-checking was carried out by using two different types of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS), namely a quadrupole based ICP-MS equipped with a collision cell (ICP-CC-MS) and a high resolution sector field ICP-MS (ICP-SF-MS). The measured elements were Li, Mg, B, Al, Cu, Rb, Sr, Zr, Cd, Ba, Tl, Pb, Bi, U, Cr, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Mo and Ga.Sample preparation procedures were based on sample dilution, microwave digestion using nitric acid (in combination with and without evaporation prior to ICP-MS analysis) and a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The investigation resulted that the optimal digestion method for the above-mentioned purpose is microwave digestion using nitric acid without evaporation. The advantages and disadvantages of the investigated methods are critically discussed.",

This is an opportunity to use chemometric strategies that can highlight information in relation to different ingredients and preferable taste attributes. Multivariate exploratory techniques were used in order to detect relationship between the milk toffee ingredients (sugar, water, condensed milk, glucose syrup, fat, salt, sorbitol, and emulsifier E 471) and sensory attributes of taste and texture (sweetness and hardness) chosen for this research.Results showed that the sweetness is a direct outcome of added sugar, glucose syrup, and condensed milk, and the hardness, as the next important sensory attribute of a milk toffee, is positively correlated with the content of fat, glucose syrup, water, salt, and E 471.

Fat blends were developed to find the most appropriate mixture fitting the technological needs. In our work palm mid fraction (PMF) was mixed with anhydrous milk fat (AMF), goose fat (G), and lard (L) in a 1:1 ratio. Anhydrous milk fat represents fat consisting of a wide range of fatty acids. Goose fat is a soft, easily melting fat, and lard is characterized as animal fat with wide melting temperature interval. The measurements aimed to establish the miscibility of the fats and the effect of animal fats on the melting-solidification profile of palm mid fraction. SFC vs temperature curves, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) melting thermograms describe the melting profile of the samples. Isotherm crystallization by SFC vs time curves and DSC cooling thermograms were measured to characterize the solidification of pure fats and the blends. Since the SFC curves did not show crosspoints we concluded that fats blended in a 1:1 ratio were miscible. Anhydrous milk fat strongly modified the properties of palm mid fraction, the blend became similar to anhydrous milk fat. Goose fat had no strong modification effect on palm mid fraction and could be considered as a softening agent. The effect of lard was complex: melting and solidification behaviour of the blend differed from the characteristics of both parent fats.",

To observe the effects of these methods on some cheese properties weight, pH, and dry-matter content were measured, stringiness was examined, and compression test were performed for texture analysis. Thermophysical properties were determined by DSC: unfreezable water content, onset point of melting, and latent heat. Sensory analyses were also carried out by profle analysis. Results of objective and subjective measurements showed similar trends: characteristics of cheese samples frozen in circulated air and thawed in refrigerator resembled the most to the control sample.",

The new method was substantially faster than existing protocols. Up to 98% of bean seed proteins were bound to the white precipitate in the range of 1–4% (w/v) zinc hydroxide, while the amount of bound bean AAI was far less in the range of 1–2%. The AAI-enriched fraction, unbound by zinc hydroxide, was further purified by DEAE-(diethylaminoethyl)chromatography and gel filtration. It was found that zinc hydroxide binds the majority of soluble proteins of bean, while it leaves α-amylase inhibitor in solution. The binding of proteins to zinc-hydroxide occurs in a short time and the change caused in the buffer composition is insignificant, thus it may open new approaches in purification of other proteins, too.",

The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content in hawthorn and agrimony extracts, and their effect on lipid deterioration expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured. The results showed that the herbal extracts of hawthorn and agrimony are effective antioxidants and good sources of total phenols.

The occurrence of perceptible changes in oxidized food provides information that the product is no longer safe and should not be accepted. The present study was aimed to determine the shelf-life of rapeseed and sunflower oils in terms of consumer acceptance. The results of sensory consumer acceptability tests followed by survival analysis were integrated with conventional chemical marker of oils’ quality and shelf-life (peroxide value).The important finding is that consumers sometimes do not recognize the advanced oxidative processes in food. This may increase the safety risk because of the harmful effect of oxidative processes on human health. Consumers differentiated quality of oils with similar state of oxidation: the rapeseed oil with peroxide value on the level 5 meq O2 kg−1 was rejected by three quarters of consumers, sunflower — by only 3%. It proves that the consumer perception of oxidative changes is specific to the product and does not coincide with the accepted chemical criterion of shelf-life.",

Antimicrobial activities were tested on Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including probiotic bacteria. Generally, only weak activities were obtained, which was attributed to the natural sugar content of the samples, depending on the type of the vinegar and the fruit. Similar results, but more pronounced bacterial growth inhibitions were obtained for probiotic strains, however, some probiotic strains were resistant to at least two of the vinegars. Based on these, balsamic apple, raspberry, rosehip, quince, and sea buckthorn may qualify as potential functional components of probiotic preparations containing some of the strains tested.",

The pH, turbidity, colour (L*, a*, b*, and ∆E*), gas concentrations in the package, relative foaming capacity (RFC), and foaming stability were analysed during storage at 4 °C. The protease (1,000 ± 60.82) and lipase (790 ± 41.63) increased RFC values significantly (control: 616 ± 36.05) on the initial day. The enzymes significantly decreased ( P &lt; 0.05) the turbidity values from 0.46 ± 0.10 (control) to –0.30 ± 0.05 (lipase) and –0.35 ± 0.03 (protease), whereas it was increased by phospholipase-A 2 (0.53 ± 0.06). This research points out the efficacy of the enzymes in improving functionality of EWP. In conclusion, treatment with protease enzyme provided the best RFC values at day 27. However, utilisation of protease led to decrease in L* and b* values.",

Compared with other cultivated mushrooms, very little is known about the nature of the lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by the edible fungus Calocybe indica , its enzymatic activity profiles during submerged and solid state fermentation. The intracellular activity of laccase (7.67 U mg −1 ), manganese peroxidase (7.48 U mg −1 ), cellobiohydrolase (5.46 U mg −1 ), and endoxylanase (4.21 U mg −1 ) was best obtained in C. indica on 14th and 21st day of incubation. The extracellular activity of laccase (11.57 U mL −1 ), lignin peroxidase (8.45 U mL −1 ), and endoxylanases (6.22 U mL −1 ) were found to be highest on the 14th day. Ligninolytic enzyme activity was substantial during substrate colonisation but quickly dropped during fruiting body development. C. indica , on the other hand, showed relatively modest hydrolase activity during substrate colonisation. The activity of hydrolytic enzymes increased dramatically when primordia formed and peaked at the mature fruiting body stage. The yield of the crude enzyme-treated wheat straw utilised for mushroom production was 52.47%. These findings showed that the activities of lignocellulolytic enzymes were regulated in line with developmental phase of growth of C. indica .",

After that, samples were kept at 0, 10, and 15 °C for 2 weeks. Stiffness, chlorophyll fluorescence, ethylene and CO 2 production of fruit were investigated during 2 weeks. Application of ethylene resumed the ripening of pear after long term storage. The results showed that fruit treated with ethylene achieved more homogeneous surface colour in comparison with non ethylene treated pears. In addition, the ethylene and carbon dioxide production of ethylene treated pears had higher values than that of control. The ethylene treatment could accelerate the softening of pear. Temperature also has significant effect on ripening during storage. This study found that ethylene treatment could accelerate the normal ripening of 1-MCP treated pears.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human milk (HM) of healthy, well-nourished, lactating mothers is a unique and ideal source of nutritive factors, like hormones, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors that ensures the proper growth and development of infants. Among the main components of HM, fat is an important energy source and a regulatory factor. The quality of milk fat depends on its fatty acid (FA) composition. Gas chromatography coupled with flame ionisation detection is one of the most common methods for analysis of the FA profile of HM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the FA composition of HM, collected from mothers with different health conditions (normal Body Mass Index (nBMI); overweight and obese) using GC-FID method. The results showed that saturated FAs were present in the highest amount in the HM samples, of which palmitic acid was the main representative. The major monounsaturated FA was oleic acid, while linoleic acid was the most abundant of the polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA). Overweight and obese women have lower levels of PUFA in their breast milk. The data were subjected to principal component and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). QDA classified nBMI and overweight and obese mother milk samples with 88.24% accuracy. Significant differences were found between normal and overweight and obese HM samples in case of C10:0 and C18:3 FAs. Higher maternal BMI was associated with a higher n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio.",

Their relative contents showed various accumulation tendencies in different growth months by GC-MS, with the relative content of menthone gradually increasing, pulegone content decreasing, as well as estragole content climbing initially before declining. This tendency was supported by quantitative experiments using samples from various habitats, which also revealed that the full-bloom stages exhibited the highest total concentrations of menthone and pulegone. The volatile composition of SHX in various plant organs differed, with palmitic acid being the main volatile component of stems, while menthone and pulegone being the core volatile components of leaves and spikes, implying that leaves and spikes should be separated from the stem to obtain higher drug contents. The current findings provide new information for SHX cultivation and applications.",

Phenolic substances in leaf ethanol (L-EtOH), leaf pure water (L-PW), root ethanol (R-EtOH), and root pure water (R-PW) extracts of I. helenium subsp. pseudohelenium plant were investigated by HPLC. Also, the antimicrobial (hollow agar), antioxidant, antiproliferative, and DNA protective activities of the samples were examined in vitro . Gallic acid was not detected in the extracts, the presence of curcumin was detected only in EtOH extracts. L-EtOH exhibited the best antimicrobial activity. According to the antioxidant results, the L-EtOH extract had an activity profile close to the standard antioxidants in general. It was also found that the L-EtOH extract stabilised the DNA by disrupting the scavenging effect of H 2 O 2 +DMSO. According to the antiproliferative activity results, EtOH extracts exhibited the strongest effect, especially against MCF7 cancer cell lines. When evaluated in general terms, it was found that L-EtOH extract showed better activity than other extracts. It is important to conduct more in vivo and in vitro studies after isolating the active components of extracts e.g. L-EtOH, which have good effects in terms of biological activity.",

The results showed that by increasing SPI and OGP levels, ash, white index value, elastic modulus, and complex viscosity decreased, while pH, fat in dry matter, Chroma, and total colour (ΔE) increased. Also, syneresis was only observed in the control sample and was not observed in other samples. Control sample together with sample containing 10% of OGP showed the highest microbial count (i.e., mesophilic bacteria and yeasts-moulds), while samples containing 10% of SPI showed the lowest microbial count. Furthermore, the growth of both coliform and psychrophilic bacteria in all samples was negligible. Based on the results of sensory evaluation, with increasing SPI and OGP, the sensory evaluation score of samples decreased but they were within the acceptable range. According to the results obtained in this study, the combinations of 5% SPI and 5% OGP or 3.7% SPI and 6.3% OGP are recommended to be used in wheyless cheese production.",

The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) and the Turkish version of the Healthy Lifestyle-Diet (HLD-TR) index were used. Participants were divided into two groups according to their scores on the diet quality index using the 50th percentile. Group 1 consisted of participants with a score of 25 points or less, and Group 2 consisted of participants with a score above 25 points. Waist circumference (72.0 (66–83), 65.0 (60–77)) was significantly higher in Group 1 ( P &lt; 0.05).

Results showed that myricetin could reduce the harm caused by oxidative stress, decrease thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value, and decrease total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels of hyperlipidaemic rats. Quantitative analysis of gene expression showed that myricetin's lipid-lowering activity can be activated by downregulating gene expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) with upregulation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA level. Thus, myricetin had significant health benefits and could be explored as a potentially promising dietary supplement for treating hyperlipidaemia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aims of this study were to prepare butter and honey flavoured tiger nut oil oleogels with beeswax oleogelator and to compare them with the unflavoured control sample. The oleogels prepared with 10 wt% beeswax and 0.5 wt% of each flavour addition were analysed for main physicochemical, thermal, and structural properties. In addition, a trained panel described the samples with 11 sensory descriptive (hardness, spreadability, roasted, liquefaction, rancid, waxy, nutty, butter, honey, cooling, and mouth coating) terms. It was found that the oleogels melt around 52 °C and included β′ type polymorphs. The sensory data proved that the samples were quite well spreadable and had enough hardness to stay as solid-fat samples at room temperature. Further, addition of butter and honey flavours masked the waxy attribute. In conclusion, flavoured tiger nut oil-beeswax oleogels were new and successful products, and future studies with food applications are suggested.",

Among numerous preservation technologies, ultrasound is one of the most available and pollution-free methods that improve the storage quality of fruits and vegetables. The paper summarises the application of ultrasound and its combined treatment in fruit and vegetable storage in recent years, including the cleaning effect, passivation of enzymes, sterilisation, and the impact on quality indicators. In addition, the limitations of ultrasound technology in fruit and vegetable preservation are also detailed. Only under the appropriate conditions can ultrasound treatment extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. However, ultrasound combined with other technologies usually can get better preservation effects, providing a broader application prospect for ultrasound technology.",

Authors investigated this problem within the scope of OTKA T 014965 research project (K örmendy et al., 1998, 1999a, 1999b; P átkai , 1998). Instead of separate case studies on different types of fruit juices and technologies, authors analysed the vitamin C content of model solutions with similar composition to real citrus juices as a function of temperature and duration of heat treatment and that of initial oxygen and ascorbic acid concentration. Based on the measured data, they elaborated kinetic relations and determined the reaction rate constants of vitamin C decomposition under the experimental conditions. By means of the calculated kinetic relations and reaction rate constants one can estimate the losses of vitamin C in the case of known parameters of the heat treatment, packaging material, oxygen and vitamin C concentration within the investigated domain. Results may promote technology and product development in the field of citrus fruit juices.",

    "abstract": "In the past years several methods have been developed for the determination of the proportion of the nitrogen-containing substances of microbial origin passed from the rumen into the abomasum or the small intestine. Recently, on examining the D-amino acid content of foodstuffs, particularly milk and milk products, it has been observed that, in addition to D-Ala, D- glutamic acid (D-Glu) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) can also be detected in similar quantities, primarily in products which have links with bacterial activity. This gave rise to the idea of examining the diaminopimelic acid (DAPA), D-Glu and D-Asp content of bacteria extracted from the rumen of cattle and that of chyme from the same cattle, in order to determine the type of relation existing among these three components, and to establish whether D-Asp and D-Glu can be used in the estimation of protein of bacterial origin. On determination of the DAPA, D-Asp and D-Glu content by means of amino acid analyser and high performance liquid chromatography of duodenal chyme from five growing bulls and of ruminal bacteria from the same bulls, the following values were established. For chyme (and, in brackets, for ruminal bacteria) r value calculated by means of linear regression was 0.78 (0.76) between DAPA and D-Asp, and 0.70 (0.81) between DAPA and D-Glu. The r values between the crude protein content of ruminal bacteria and the markers examined were found to be the following: DAPA, 0.74; D-Asp, 0.73; D- Glu, 0.61. In the model experiment performed for the re-obtaining of values for protein of bacterial origin the theoretical values were determined on the basis of D-Asp and D-Glu and values approximately 10% higher than the theoretical value on the basis of DAPA. It is therefore recommended that in addition to DAPA these other two amino acids be included among the bacterial protein markers.",

The acid concentration, barrel temperature and moisture content showed that all the variables were significant. Increasing acid concentration or barrel temperature induced starch depolymerisation with a higher water solubility index and lower water absorption index. At 20 and 24% moisture contents the cold paste viscosity decreased. As a result of the addition of acid during extrusion cooking the degree of starch hydrolysis resulted in low hot paste viscosity. Acid concentration was significant in the production of reducing sugars. At concentrations above 0.024 N, as the temperature increased, the reducing sugar content also increased. Nevertheless, at concentrations below 0.024 N, the reducing sugar content showed the opposite result. The best yield of alcohol obtained from the extruded starch was 98.7% (0.56 g of ethanol/g starch), which, on average, was 5.7% and 6.8% higher than that obtained from starch extruded without acid and from starch gelatinized by the conventional method, respectively.",

In the experiment the changes of quantity and baking quality of the yield were analysed. Differences in rainfall during the vegetation period - especially in April and May - had a strong effect on wheat yield. In drought periods N top-dressing had a great importance. In the dry 2001-2003 years, the 80 and 120 kg ha-1 fertilizer doses were the most effective. The increasing dose of N top-dressing and its division resulted in this trial in an outstanding quality improvement in spite of the unfavourable ecological circumstances. Especially, great improvement was seen in case of foreign varieties that were of lower quality compared to the Hungarian ones. The top-dressing stabilized the falling number values in the 250-350 top range.",

For the major fatty acids (oleic, palmitic and stearic acid, 51.4, 25.8 and 15.5% of total) the R² values were 0.94, 0.93 and 0.16. The estimation of the total saturated fatty acid (SAT) proportion and the so-called unsaturation index (UI) value was effective (R 2 =0.81 and 0.79, respectively). The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the NIRS method as a fast and solvent free alternative of liver qualification. For practical purposes a larger number of fatty liver samples are needed.",

    "abstract": "Olive fruit dehydration is always done locally in non-industrial ovens. This technology poses concern about the quality and safety of the end product. Most of the problems involved in this empirical technology may be solved by a proper control of process parameters. Olive fruits of fourteen Italian cultivars underwent hot air dehydration in mild conditions in a tangential airflow cabinet dryer. At the start, at regular intervals and at the end of the process, sampling was performed to calculate dehydration curves and quality loss. Pre-treatments such as blanching in hot brine, piercing of the skin and salting after blanching were applied. The drying kinetic is strongly affected by pre-treatments and olive characteristics: fruit size, flesh to pit ratio, dry matter. Results showed that mild drying temperature led to slow drying kinetics, even if pre-treatments reduced drying timeto a certain extent. Blanched olives showed, in general, the highest polyphenols content. The fastest drying was measured in the pierced olives, but the best taste was achieved for the salted product.",

However, their strong smell and taste are not desirable in the food industry. From this point of view, self-heal ( Prunella vulgaris L.) can be considered as one of the most perspective plants, since it is almost taste-and odourless, and it is rich in phenolic compounds. Taking into account its advantageous characteristics, in 2005, we were the first who examined the morphological and chemical diversity of seven populations of self-heal collected from different natural habitats in Hungary. Our results were compared to a cultivated population, too. The total phenolic compounds (measured by modified method of Singleton & Rossi , 1965) and the antioxidant powers (measured by the FRAP method), as well as the rosmarinic acid content of the samples were significantly different from each other. The highest total-phenol (0.43±0.01 mg GAE ml −1 ) and rosmarinic acid content (1.84±0.03 mg g −1 ) was observed in the one-year-old population under cultivation, while the strongest antioxidant activity was measured in the samples collected in Mátra Hills (0.35±0.04 mg AAE ml −1 ). According to our results, in the future, it will probably be possible to optimise the cultivation conditions of Prunella vulgaris providing high quality for the food-industry.",

Two malting barley varieties (one spring and one winter) were studied, applying the same technology. Furthermore, a roasting experiment was carried out at given temperatures for different time periods. The total folate content was determined by microbiological method. The folate content of the barleys was between 10.1 and 23.4 µg/100 g dry matter. For micro- and industrial scale, malting folate content increased 6.5–8-fold and 4–7-fold, respectively, during the malting process. An unexpected result was observed during industrial malting: the folate content increased during kilning by 18–35%, unlike micro scale malting, where a 15–20% decrease was observed. Results obtained during roasting showed that folic acid content did not decrease when roasted for 20 min at 100 °C, but it decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Folate is completely degraded in 20 min at 200 °C. It can be stated that barley malt can serve as a relatively good source of folate, but barley variety and malting technology have significant impact on it.",

Peel and pulp of eggplants were evaluated separately. Organic cultivation enhanced trans -ferulic acid in the peels of both eggplant cultivars and the pulp of Pala-49. Organic Pala-49 had also higher amounts of cyanidin and caffeic acid in the peel, and only caffeic acid in the pulp. Chlorogenic acid was found in higher quantities in organic Rio Grande tomato and bell pepper. All organically grown vegetables in our study had significantly higher total phenol and flavonoid contents than conventional ones except Pink tomato. Organic farming significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both eggplant cultivars. Only organic peel of Pala-49 eggplant cultivar had antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis . Organic cultivation has an advantage in terms of antioxidant potential and phenolic constituents, and it enhanced the nutraceutical potential of both cultivars of eggplant, Rio Grande tomato, and bell pepper.",

The balance studies were carried out with 8 test populations (women and men) with mixed and ovolactovegetarian diets. People with mixed diet in Germany consumed, on average, 89 (women) and 100 μg Mo/day (men), whereas in Mexico they took in 160 and 210 μg Mo/day, respectively. German ovolactovegetarians consumed ∼175 μg Mo/day. Male adults of Germany consumed 21% more molybdenum than women. This difference is the result of a 24% higher dry matter intake by males. The residence place, its geological origin and time of examination influenced the molybdenum intake significantly (60–115 μg Mo/day). The normative molybdenum requirement of adults amounts to 25 μg/day, with women needing 20 and men 25 μg/day. As a rule approximately only one-third of the absorbed molybdenum is excreted renally, the rest faecally. Breast feeding mothers excreted 11% via milk, 56% faecally and 33% renally. The apparent absorption rate of molybdenum amounted to 37% in humans with mixed and vegetarian diets, whereas it reached 44% in breast-feeding mothers.

Dietary intake was assessed based on 3-day food record. In males, daily energy intake was 3513±1143 kcal and 2965±551 kcal for PA and NA, respectively (P<0.001). In females, there were no significant differences between PA and NA concerning the intake of energy. Athletes reported insufficient energy intake in both genders. Similarly to NA, PA failed to meet the adequate rate for macronutrients. Energy intake from carbohydrates was lower (47.3±6.6% in male and 49.2±7.3% in female) and from lipids higher (36.8±6% in male and 35.2±6.7% in female) than recommended. Athletes reported higher intakes of vitamins C and E, potassium and calcium than NA. Sodium and cholesterol intake was highly above the RDA in every group. Surprisingly, sodium intake of NA was even higher than PA in females (5535±1282 mg/day vs. 5068±2028 mg/day; P<0.05). In addition, iron intake of women was less than two-third of RDA in both groups. In summary, the dietary habits of elite athletes showed many misconceptions and lack of proper nutrition in terms of quality.

Substantial variation was noticed in pigment composition between raw material, oleoresin and residues (powders after extraction). Chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a and the Mg-free derivatives were the dominant pigments in the raw material with other derivatives being minor constituents. After extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide at 35 °C and pressures higher than 200 bar, epimerisation and oxidation of chlorophylls lead to marked accumulation of artefacts in the residues. The content of oxidized chlorophylls was increased proportionally to the increase of the extraction pressure. The brownish green coloured-oleoresins contained only pheophytins indicating that rapid substitution of Mg with hydrogen atoms on the molecules takes place during extraction of such pigment by supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane.

That is why exact and accurate tools for assessing the oils’ quality and purity (adulteration) are needed. One of the tools is registering certain names and foodstuffs in National registers and the Register of European Union. Another tool is the analysis which can help to assess the characteristics of the oil and to classify it in categories. In the field of olive oils, this has been done excellently with the European Commission regulations. In the present work we tried to test few pumpkin seed oils for fatty acids content, trans isomers of fatty acids, composition of sterols and tocopherols. The main goal was to check the purity of the oils and understand the present situation in the field. The analytical results show that some samples are adulterated with seed oils. What can consumers benefit? From the Slovenian olive oil experience it can be concluded that the path towards better quality oils does not strictly follow analytical methods but tries to track well-established rules and definitions of quality and purity. The consumers must learn and be aware that the quality and purity can be analytically proven.",

These reactions were characterized by lowered nutritional performance, reduced growth, pure digestion and absorption, changes in gut motility, structural damage in small intestine and diarrhoea. A lot of efforts were made for gathering data on heat stability and resistance to chemical or enzyme treatments of these compounds to reduce or eliminate these harmful effects.A novel research approach has described that these compounds have a special regulatory role in the gut metabolism and modulate hormone and immune responses which resulted in a novel concept of “nonnutritive biologically active compound”. These studies revealed that the chemical structure of these compounds was responsible for the induction of such physiological reactions as increased endogen N-loss, change in the plasma amino acid concentration or plasma lipid composition with reduction of total cholesterol level or developing of harmful immune responses to luminal antigens resistant to the gut digestion. Resent studies were therefore related to the description of their interaction with the gut metabolism and understanding of the modulation of gut immune responses to luminal antigens.This review was inspired to summarise the research efforts on the above field performed by the Nutritional and Biological Units of the Central Food Research Institute.",

Results of quantitative descriptive analysis of modified frequency (MF) showed that HT causes both in red wine and white wine a decrease of fruity and floral characters, an unbalance of taste, and a shortness of aftertaste length. CV wine showed very close sensory characters to control in most terms evaluated. Seventy-four volatile compounds were quantitative analysed by solid phase microextractiongas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the 23 volatiles of highest odour activity value (OAV). The concentrations of potential fruity and floral aroma attributors like isoamyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, β-damascenone, and linalool were lower in HT wine than that in original wine and CV wine.",

The radical-scavenging capacity was evaluated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using galvinoxyl free radical and the DPPH test. Results revealed a high level of total TOC in VOOs of Buža Puntoža (243 mg kg−1) and Porečka Rosulja (325 mg kg−1). VOOs contained in 100 g from 79% (Istarska Bjelica) to 261% (Porečka Rosulja) of recommended daily allowance of α-tocopherol. The mass fraction of ORT in Istarska Bjelica and Rosinjola was >250 mg kg−1 (on average 30–40% higher in comparison to other studied cultivars). Istarska Bjelica and Porečka Rosulja showed the highest antioxidant capacity in both methods of measurement. The highest capacity to inhibit protein carbonylation (PC) in response to oxidative stress (54–56%) was displayed by Buža Puntoža, Leccino, and Buža. High level of positive linear correlation between ORT mass fraction and radical-scavenging capacity measured by DPPH test (r=0.768), as well as strong negative correlation between PC inhibition and mass fraction of ORT (r= −0.697), were observed.",

This study intends to evaluate the microbiological quality of oysters produced and traded in Paraná, directly examining the localities of cultivation and trading of the product. The major sites for the trading of oysters in the state were identified and 52 dozen oysters (624 animals) were collected from these places, between April and December, 2013. The samples were subjected to analyses for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus , and Salmonella spp. No samples had results of microbial contamination above the limits established by Brazilian legislation. This study indicated that the microbiological quality of the oysters produced and traded in the state of Paraná is acceptable.",

Round roll quality was evaluated by determining total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, antioxidative capacity, the content of lipid hydroperoxides (primary oxidation products), and sensory profiling. Moreover, the stability of the phenolic compounds and antioxidant behaviour throughout processing was studied. Technological processing does not cause any significant loss of phenolics (less than 5%). A significant increase in antioxidants and phenolics of the flour mixtures and final products were observed compared to those of white wheat round rolls (as control). Buckwheat and barley round roll crumbs contained the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and were the most effective in enhancing antioxidant activity, which increased 15-fold and 8-fold, respectively, when compared to the control roll. The tested cereals effectively retarded formation of lipid hydroperoxides (from over 50% to control), which are undesirable from both a nutrition and storage/shelf life perspective. The results of sensory analyses showed that such bakery products are accepted by consumers with the exception of the product made with oat flour, where a reduction in the oat content would be preferable.",

The rate of the change of ‘Conference’ pears’ Fv/Fm chlorophyll fluorescence parameter was lower than for ‘Bosc kobak’, referring to the cultivar characteristic and photosynthetically active chlorophyll content related maturity and colour change. Acoustic and impact stiffness decreased during shelf-life, referring clearly to temperature related textural change. Taking into account the seven different measuring wavelengths (650–1064 nm), laser scattering parameters showed significant and cultivar dependent changes versus time during cold storage and shelf-life. The used non-destructive methods were found to be suitable for objective sweet pepper quality determination. Cold storage combined shelf-life resulted in a relatively longer shelf-life, with a lower intensity and rate of quality decrease in time, based upon mass loss, stiffness, surface colour, and chlorophyll fluorescence changes. ‘Gigant’, ‘Carma’, and ‘Kárpia’ cultivars were found to be favourable, but ‘Kais’ and ‘Kun’ hot pepper samples were really sensitive to quality degradation.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fibres (DFs) are essential components of the balanced diet. Even though the adequate level of their consumption can be ensured from several natural (e.g. fruit, vegetables, legumes) and ‘artificial’ sources (e.g. functional foods), the consumed levels are below the recommendations. To analyse the Hungarian and Romanian consumers’ knowledge level, their perceptions of the health benefits associated with fibre, as well as the recognition of the potential information sources, a survey questionnaire was conducted with the total of 713 consumers. Results showed that the level of knowledge about DFs was not adequate. Internet was found to be widely used and identified as one of the most appropriate information sources to encourage the consumption of DF. It was a favourable result that three-quarter of the respondents was interested in the topic of healthy food consumption; however, just less than half of them took into consideration the label information during their shopping decisions. To increase the consumption of DF and to support the responsibility and conscious consumer decisions steps must to be done (e.g. education of children, pointing out of the sources). For this purpose, modern information technology and communication channels fitting to the consumers’ cultural and personal particularities can be utilized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Proper gluten quantitation is essential for providing safe gluten-free food for patients living with celiac disease (CD). However, gluten quantitation faces several challenges: the lack of a reference method and certified reference materials, the variability of methods and the effects of genetic and environmental factors on gluten. Among all these challenges our research group focuses on gluten reference material development. Gluten content is determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to obtain comparable data for the selection of cultivars used in our reference material development efforts. As ELISA methods are developed for determining low gluten concentrations, application for these special research purposes requires a 10,000-fold dilution. The formerly performed process was a post-extraction liquid dilution that proved to be sufficient for wheat samples. However, gluten contents of rye and barley samples were found to be overestimated by ELISA methods. One of the suggested reasons is the structural and solubility changes of gluten proteins during the dilution process. Therefore, our present study focuses on the comparison of the original dilution method and a revised version using solid-phase dilution in a gluten-free matrix.",

Recent studies have shown that IF attenuates neurodegeneration and improves cognitive decline, enhances functional recovery after stroke as well as attenuates the pathological and clinical features of epilepsy in animal models. Furthermore, IF induced several molecular and cellular adaptations in neurons that overall enhanced cellular stress resistance, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis. In this review, the beneficial effects of IF on central neurological disorders are discussed. The information summarised in this review can be used to help contextualise existing research and better guide the development of future IF interventions.",

Phenotypic identification of ESBL and AmpC was performed by the combined disk test (CDT). The specific genes of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases were detected using two multiplex PCR (m-PCR) assays. According to our results, 116 out of 150 chicken samples were contaminated with E. coli . Moreover, the highest resistance of E. coli isolates was observed to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (46%), ampicillin (40%), and amoxicillin (29.33%). In the molecular confirmation step, among 17 (11.33%) beta-lactamase producers, five samples contained the bla CTX-M14 gene (3.33%), two samples contained bla DHA (1.33%) and bla CTX-M3 gene (1.33%), and just one sample carried bla CMY-2 gene (0.66%). The bla SHV and bla TEM genes were not detected in any strains isolated from the chicken samples. This study showed the contamination of chicken with antibiotic-resistant E. coli .

Wines produced from sedimented, inoculated must with active dry yeast without malolactic fermentation were compared with wine produced from nonsedimented must spontaneously fermented with malolactic fermentation. Histamine and putrescine concentrations were not significantly different in either variant. The highest concentration of histamine was 0.055 mg L −1 , and the highest concentration of putrescine was 1.6 mg L −1 in both variants. Statistically significantly higher values of cadaverine (from 0.06 to 0.07 mg L −1 ), spermidine (from 0.8 to 1.4 mg L −1 ), spermine (from 0.15 to 0.25 mg L −1 ), and isoamylamine (from 0.40 to 0.46 mg L −1 ) were found in the variant made from nonsedimented must, in which spontaneous malolactic fermentation was performed. The higher concentration of biogenic amines in this variant may be due to the different composition of lactic bacteria during the spontaneous malolactic fermentation. A simplified, unpublished HILIC method of chromatographic separation of biogenic amines without prior deprivation with MS-MS detection was used to determine individual biogenic amines.",

Despite the beneficial fibre composition, a special group of short-chain carbohydrates, the so called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols) may cause problems for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of our work was to investigate the non-starch carbohydrate (dietary fibre compounds, short-chain carbohydrates) composition of rye varieties, and of their novel milling fractions obtained from industrial milling trials and test loaves made from them. Regarding fibre and short chain carbohydrate composition, rye varieties did not show significant differences. In new subfractions, fibre and FODMAP composition were described, among profiles most of them differ from commonly used flours, independently from variety. The yeast fermentation and baking caused a decrease in water-extractable arabinoxylan content, at the same time increased the substitution pattern of water-extractable arabinoxylans. Furthermore, breadmaking process decreased the fructan content, and therefore increased the fructose level, thus modifying the short-chain carbohydrate composition. Based on our knowledge, this research is among the first ones investigating the fibre and short-chain composition of rye from the seeds to the consumable final products.",

The aim of this study was to quantify dissolved oxygen in filtered wines trained on fine lees during different technological operations such as racking, coarse filtration, stabilisation of thermolabile proteins, and sterile filtration and bottling. The most significant oxygenation of wine occurs during filtration (1.9–3.57 mg L −1 ) and during bottling (2.99–4.12 mg L −1 ). At the same time, oxygen affects the phenolic composition, antioxidant activity and sulphur dioxide. Understanding and being able to use oxygen correctly during wine production can lead to a reduction in the doses of sulphur dioxide used. It has been shown that wines trained on fine lees are more able to withstand oxygen and, therefore, the sulphur dioxide doses can be reduced substantially. The experiment, in which two different winemaking technologies were observed, was carried out on the Welschriesling variety using both stainless steel tanks and oak barrels.",

Chitosan-based nano-silver films were first made using chitosan with three degrees of deacetylation of 70, 80, and 90%. The films were then used for coating the mango fruits. All coated mangoes and the control samples were stored at 12 °C in a cooling room. The respiration rate, ethylene production rate, weight loss, firmness, total soluble solids, total acid, vitamin C, total sugar, and change of peel colour were evaluated once every 5 days during the storage period. As observed, the coating using the chitosan-based nano-silver films did not induce significant negative alterations on most of the physical characteristics and chemical constituents of the fruits. In addition, the coating using those materials helped reduce the respiration and the ethylene gas production and retard the ripening process of mango fruits. The chitosan-based films with higher deacetylation degrees (CN80 and CN90) better moderated the respiration of mangoes. The coating using chitosan-based nano-silver films prolonged the shelf-life of mangoes (up to 35 days) compared to the control (less than 10 days).",

The degree of hydrolysis was measured to verify the degradation of proteins. The in vitro anti-obesity activity was evaluated using the pancreatic lipase inhibitory assay. Camel colostrum and milk protein hydrolysates exhibited different degrees of hydrolysis ranging from 17.69 to 43.97%. The protein content varied between 56.08–61.95% and 37.39–41.72% for camel colostrum and milk protein hydrolysates, respectively. The hydrolysates displayed significantly higher anti-obesity activity than the undigested proteins at all tested concentrations ( P &lt; 0.05). Colostrum protein hydrolysate generated with pancreatin had the highest anti-obesity potential (59.92%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermobifida alba is the mesophilic member of the Thermobifida genus, the genome and enzyme sets of which have not been described and published yet. Thermobifida strains are thermotolerant actinomycete, which possess wide sets of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysing enzymes. Previously, three endomannanases (Man5ATh, Man5ATc, and Man5AThf) of thermobifidas were cloned and investigated, and hereby the endomannanase of T. alba DSM 43795 is described. All four endomannanases belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 5, their sizes are around 50–55 kDa. Their structure consists of a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate binding module, while there is an interdomain linker region in-between consisting repetitive tetrapeptide motifs (eg.: PPTEPTD-Ta, PTDP-Tc, TEEP-Tf, DPGT-Th). The pH optima of Man5A enzymes from T. alba , Thermobifida halotolerans , Thermobifida cellulosilytica , and Thermobifida fusca are slightly different (6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0, respectively), however, the temperature optima of the enzymes were detected within a wider range of 65–75 °C. In this research, Man5ATa exhibited the lowest Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) (0.13 mM) on LBG-mannan substrate, while others shared similar kinetic parameters: 0.9–1.7 mM of KM. Despite the high sequence similarity of the investigated mannanases, they exhibit different temperature stability parameters. These different functional characteristics can be advantageous for industrial applications producing biologically active, oligomannan prebiotics under different conditions.",

    "abstract": "Rats were fed for 6 weeks with diets containing seeds or their fractions (cotyledons and hulls) of two types of faba bean: colour-flowered varieties (dark seeds) and white-flowered strain (light seeds). Compared to dark seeds, the light seeds contained more crude protein (29.68% vs. 26.96) and less fibre (CF: 7.79 vs. 8.54% and DF: 24.74 vs. 28.93%). The light seeds contained also more a-galactosides (3.88%) than the dark seeds (3.37%). Amino acid composition, e.g. the content of lysine, methionine and cystine in the seeds and cotyledons of different types of faba bean was similar. The content of total polyphenols in light seeds of white flowered faba bean (2.79 g kg -1) was about five times lower than in dark seeds of colour-flowered varieties (10.95 g kg -1). Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) consist about 65% of the content of total polyphenols in dark seeds and about 1% of polyphenols in light seeds. The content of proanthocyanidins in the diet (about 2.7 g kg -1) significantly lowered the body weight gain of rats and protein efficiency ratio (PER). Proanthocyanidins decreased also the activity of ß-glucuronidase in the caecal digesta, without affecting the activity of a- and ß-glucosidase and a- and ß-galactosidase. Different proanthocyanidin content in the diet had no effect on the content of glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol in the serum and activity of selected enzymes: aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase.",

The activity of b-galactosidase enzyme increased significantly during storage except for cv. Pinova and that of polygalacturonase enzyme also increased significantly. The difference in the activity of polygalacturonase became significant between the cultivars during storage except for cv. Jonica and Pinova. The firmness decreased significantly during storage, with the least change in case of cv. Liberty. It can be established that there is, in general, neither a considerable difference between the growing systems nor between varieties at harvest. The differences became higher during storage.

The yeast cells were permeabilised to overcome the problem of enzyme extraction and poor permeability of cell membrane to lactose. To analyse and optimise the process variables for lactose hydrolysis, the experiments were conducted according to the Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) using response surface methodology. The independent process variables for lactose hydrolysis were biomass concentration, temperature, agitation and incubation time. Statistical analysis of the results showed that, in the range studied, linear terms of biomass concentration, incubation time and process temperature had a significant effect (P<0.01) on lactose hydrolysis, however, the effect of agitation on lactose hydrolysis was significant when compared with stationery conditions. Numerical optimisation technique was applied to achieve the maximum possible lactose hydrolysis value. The optimum process conditions for lactose hydrolysis were 120 mg biomass (dry wt), 33.6 °C temperature, 105 r.p.m. agitation and 147 min of incubation time. Corresponding to these optimum conditions, the predicted value of lactose hydrolysis was found to be 88.6%, which was experimentally verified.",

As a part of this research, several different wheat cultivars and their isolated gluten proteins were characterized by different methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, we need to know the performance of the ELISA methods used for this special area of research. During the present work we investigated the accuracy and precision of two different ELISA methods for our own laboratory conditions and special sample matrices (wheat flours and gliadin isolate). We have found that the tested performance characteristics of the methods seem to be appropriate on a case-by-case basis, but the long-term measurement uncertainty is higher, which makes it difficult to evaluate the results obtained with the ELISA method for these types of samples.",

It was proven with in vitro OPLC analytical study that resveratrol reacted with methyl groups, and resveratrol was demonstrated to influence transmethylation processes as well as redox homeostasis. Red wine compounds do not protect from the harmful effects of alcohol, and even by high doses of resveratrol, the liver further deteriorates and the negative effect of alcohol increases.

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of onion skin powder (OSP) (0, 1.5, 3.0, and 6%) on some chemical and physical properties of cooked chicken meat patties during refrigerated storage (30 days, 4±1 °C) were investigated. For this purpose, moisture, fat, pH, free fatty acid (FFA), and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) analyses in the raw meat patties were also carried out. In addition, the chemical (moisture, fat), technological (diameter reduction, cooking yield), and sensory properties of cooked chicken patties were examined on the first day of storage. During storage, pH, colour, FFA, and TBA analyses were performed. There were significant changes in the physical, chemical, technological, and sensory properties of chicken patties with OSP addition. The moisture, pH, and TBA values of samples decreased by incorporated OSP. Moreover, the use of OSP improved technological parameters of patties. However, the addition of OSP resulted in a darker colour in patties. In conclusion, OSP could be used in chicken meat patties to improve their quality properties.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to assess the effects of 2,4-epibrassionolide (EBR) on mold decay caused by Rhizopus stolonifer and its capability to activate biochemical defense reactions in postharvest peaches. The treatment of EBR at 5 μM possessed the optimum effectiveness on inhibiting the Rhizopus rot in peach fruit among all treatments. The EBR treatment significantly up-regulated the expression levels of a set of defense-related enzymes and PR genes that included PpCHI , PpGns1 , PpPAL , PpNPR1 , PpPR1 and PpPR4 as well as led to an enhancement for biosynthesis of phenolics and lignins in peaches during the incubation at 20 °C. Interestingly, the EBR-treated peaches exhibited more striking expressions of PR genes and accumulation of antifungal compounds upon inoculation with the pathogen, indicating a priming defense could be activated by EBR. On the other hand, 5 μM EBR exhibited direct toxicity on fungal proliferation of R. stolonifer in vitro. Thus, we concluded that 5 μM EBR inhibited the Rhizopus rot in peach fruit probably by a direct inhibitory effect on pathogen growth and an indirect induction of a priming resistance. These findings provided a potential alternative for control of fungal infection in peaches during the postharvest storage.",

Samples were submitted to freezing as fresh fruit or following the first stage of air drying. The quality was evaluated along a freezing storage period of 18 months under -18 °C. Thaw exudate water (TEW), total colour difference (TCD), and total polyphenol content (TPC) of dehydrofrozen/thawed samples were assessed regarding the water content (W) versus the frozen storage time (FST) (0-18 months). Dehydrofreezing exhibited significant effects on TEW and TCD of dehydrofrozen/thawed apples. Indeed, the lower the W, the lower the TEW content and TCD of partially dried frozen/thawed samples. TPC losses were significant for samples without any pre-dehydration stage and decreased when initial water content decreased. The 18-month frozen storage at -18 °C had the most insignificant effects on all quality response variables for the previously most dried samples. Thus, adequate drying of fruit before freezing is a relevant way to maintain the stability of fruit quality during long-term storage.",

GC-MS analysis of the volatile constituents from the aroma distillate allowed the identification of 100 compounds, most of them esters followed by aldehydes, alcohols, terpenes, ketones, and acids. Encapsulation process of the aroma distillate by spray drying was optimised using response surface methodology. Independent variables were inlet air temperature (150-200 °C) and carrier (maltodextrin 10 DE and gum arabic in 2:1 ratio) content (10-20% wb), while response variables were powder moisture and volatiles retention. Moisture content of the powder varied inversely proportional to the air temperature, while the volatile retention was directly related. Retention of volatiles in the powder increased when the carrier content increased, while this factor negatively affected moisture content. Based on the optimisation model of the response variables, the powder with the highest flavour quality was obtained with an air inlet temperature of 200 °C and 20% wb carrier content, with 4% moisture content and 88.6% volatiles retention.",

During storage, the main goal is to prevent further mould infection and mycotoxin contamination. In that period, the moisture content of feedstuffs and the mould contamination of storage spaces, which can be minimised by the use of fungicidal products, are the most critical factors. Feed manufacturing processes do not substantially decrease the mycotoxin content of feedstuffs, and the efficiency of the recommended chemical and/or heat treatment procedures is also questionable as they are expensive and may reduce the nutrient content. To minimise the adverse effects of mycotoxins on animals, the use of products capable of binding and biologically transforming mycotoxins is also recommended; however, such products have varying efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The effect of moderate alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity is actually a topic of intense research nowadays. In this study we investigated the effect of moderate consumption of white wine in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Thirty-two patients with metabolic syndrome participated in this prospective, randomised, double-blind study.

In the Pintes group we found no significant difference either in total cholesterol (5.1±0.6 vs. 5.0±0.7 mmol l−1; P=0.25) or LDL-cholesterol (3.6±0.6 vs. 3.6±0.6 mmol l−1; P=0.5) concentrations. The results of our study confirm that moderate consumption of white wine increases insulin sensitivity and EGF levels in persons with metabolic syndrome.",

With increasing crop load, yield and the proportion of small fruits increased, but mean fruit weight decreased. However, the increase of TCSA and the number of flower clusters at return bloom were the lowest in high cropping trees. The highest percentage of total soluble solids was measured in the lightest cropping trees, which could be in correlation with the highest content levels of the sum of the analysed sugars, sucrose, sorbitol, malic and citric acids in the treatments with lowest crop load in the second year. The most intensive red colour of the fruit and the highest concentration of cyanidin-3-galactoside was observed in the treatment with eight fruit per cm2 TCSA. Different cropping of trees had no influence on phenolic compounds, such as the concentrations of catechin, epicatechin and chlorogenic acid. On the basis of yield efficiency, return bloom and detected fruit quality parameters cv. ‘Fuji’ apple has high yield potential.",

    "abstract": "Mycoviruses are known to infect fungi of different habitats and life style. Some of them, like the Mushroom Virus X (MVX) complex, cause abnormal development of fruiting bodies and severe yield losses in mushroom cultivation. Most mycoviruses have a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome, therefore dsRNA-detection is frequently used as a first step to identify virus infection. In relation with MVX 23 dsRNAs species have been described, occurring in variable number and combination in diseased mushrooms. The aim of our experiments was to find out whether dsRNA-immunoblotting can be used to detect dsRNA in small samples of cultivated A. bisporus varieties and of wild growing Agaricus species. We found that by immunoblotting, the same dsRNA species were detected in apparently healthy cultivated champignon fruiting bodies and in MVX-infected reference samples, respectively, as by conventional CF11 chromatography, but for immunoblotting a much smaller sample size was needed. In two out of three deformed fruit bodies of cultivated A. bisporus from Hungary we detected a 4.1 kbp dsRNA species which was also present in the MVX infected reference samples. Diverse and variable dsRNA patterns were observed in apparently healthy samples of 12 wild growing Agaricus species, indicating that extreme care should be taken when non-cultivated Agaricus is used for breeding new varieties. Non-sterile cultures and environmental mushroom specimens are fairly often mixed with parasitic and endofungal organisms, therefore, we also tested fungi isolated from mushroom cultures. Here again, 1–7 dsRNA species were found in extracts of Trichoderma and Dactylium isolates and of Mycogone-infected sporophores. Our results demonstrate clearly that dsRNAs from very different origins can be present in cultivated champignon and support the view that the MVX symptom-associated dsRNAs are probably of polyphyletic origin and do not represent one defined virus.",

The levels of phenolic compounds were the highest in black raspberry wine (P<0.05). In contrast, the antioxidant capacities according to ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) were not significantly different among the wines (P>0.05). The addition of 5% and 10% wine influenced the quality of ground pork by decreasing pH, inhibiting the progression of lipid oxidation and the formation of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and stabilizing the red colour of the ground pork compared to control samples to which no wine was added. In ground pork, addition of red grape wine led to lower concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, 0.19–0.39 mg kg−1) and TVB-N values (69.1–119.9 mg kg−1) than wild grape (0.16–0.43 mg kg−1 and 72.0–194.1 mg kg−1, respectively) or black raspberry wine (0.33–0.58 mg kg−1 and 81.7–225.4 mg kg−1, respectively) up to 10 days of storage. Results from the present study suggested that the quality of ground pork was affected by wine type and storage period. These effects could be due to phenolic compounds as well as other chemical components of the wines.",

Rheological testing included two empirical rheological methods, alveograph and extensograph. Principal component analysis on the studied rheological parameters showed that the alveograph and extensograph parameters are influenced by entirely different factors. The first component was responsible solely for the extensograph parameters, primarily for the resistance properties of dough samples. The second component affected the extensograph extensibility (E) and alveograph tenacity (P) parameters as well, in spite of the fact that these parameters refer to different properties of dough. The third component explained only alveograph parameters, such as P, L and G values. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients showed that the extensograph area parameter primarily depends on the maximum resistance to extension of dough (r=0.91). The extensibility and resistance at a constant extension of 5 cm properties did not show such strong relationship with the area parameter (r=0.56 and 0.65, respectively). The relationship between the extensograph maximum resistance and extensibility parameters was positive (r=0.20), while the correlation coefficient between alveograph P and L value was negative (r=0.34).",

Extracts from the fruits of black chokeberry, American blueberry, and bilberry had different stability, microbiological quality, content of polyphenols, and ACY/TP ratio. The highest stability of anthocyanins and the highest ACY/TP ratio were determined in the extracts from bilberry, and the lowest ones appeared in the extracts from American blueberry.

The accumulation of endogenous ABA appeared at the onset of ripening and peaked at two weeks before harvest. Fruit firmness decreased, while ethylene release and SSC/TA increased sharply after a maximum peak of ABA, which have triggered the initiation of the fruit ripening. The fruits, harvested at 170 d when fruits have ripened and stored at 20 °C, showed an ethylene climacteric peak, and the pulp started softening normally, and the SSC/TA value increased. Compared with them, the immature green fruits harvested at other dates, could not mature normally due to the lack of normal reciprocity between ABA and ethylene. The ethylene release was promoted by the treatment of exogenous ABA and ethephon during ripening until the endogenous ABA reached a maximum value. However, fluridone treatment showed an inhibitory effect. The above-mentioned changes occurred again in the peach fruits after harvest. The results indicated that both ABA and ethylene play important roles in peach ripening, and their action depended on the ripening stage of peach.",

The respondents connected the concept of health consciousness to the conscious way of life, nutrition and active physical exercises as well. Most of them are interested in the possibilities of healthy nutrition, they consider themselves capable of controlling their state of health, but only few of them take particular steps. The difference is caused by the lack of time and financial background, but the low level of motivations also plays a significant role. The consumers accept the presence of functional foods, which is interpreted as a long run innovation trend. They have limited information about functional ingredients; they do not know nutritional benefits and most of them are mistrustful of this product category. The organisations that are mainly responsible for information are not authentic for the consumers, but the authentic ones do not reach their stimulus threshold. Beliefs, attitudes, subjective norms do not exert enough influence on the consumers and perceived behavioural control does not reach that critical level at which these factors can motivate them to take particular steps.",

The RSD of the measurements was 5%, limit of detection was found to be 0.1 mg l−1 cholesterol, and limit of quantification was 0.47 mg l−1. For the determination of egg content a reference chart was created with the use of control materials containing exactly 1, 4 and 8 eggs in 1 kg of dried pasta, respectively. The reference chart was verified with a control sample of 4.4 eggs, proving the table to be fit for purpose. The method was also tested on commercially available unknown pasta samples and it was found that not all samples contained the declared amount of eggs.",

Brazil nuts stored in air presented increasing acid values up to 2 mg KOH/g and peroxide values that in the third month reached and kept values up to 19 meq O 2 /1000 g till the end of the experiment. The presence of oxygen absorbers in the cans prevented oxidative deterioration, and kept the peroxide values lower than the nitrogen atmosphere (11 and 14 meq O 2 /1000 g, respectively).

Browning, loss of ascorbic acid, dissolved oxygen and absorbed d-limonene into packs or retained in juice were used as indicators for juice quality. The extent of browning and loss of ascorbic acid were found to be higher in HDPE packs than in cartons and lowest in PET and glass. The ascorbic acid content and rate of browning were significantly affected by the level of dissolved oxygen in the juice. The content of d-limonene in juice stored in HDPE packs and cartons was reduced by 33.6% and 21%, respectively, compared with 11% and 9.1% for PET and glass after 15 days of storage at 24 °C. The reduction of d-limonene content in juice was related to the absorption rate of each type of package. Absorption of d-limonene was greater in HDPE packs (5.3 mg dm -2 ) and cartons (4.2 mg dm -2 ) than in PET (0.26 mg dm -2 ). The conditions which lead to the change in the quality of juice are discussed.",

By means of high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC), the degradation of specific entities induced by γ-irradiation and the formation of new compounds were monitored. The LMw fragments of PGA, pectin and alginates showed an increasing reduction in the degree of polymerisation upon exposure to increasing irradiation doses. An alginate with a high mannuronic to guluronic acid ratio appeared to be more sensitive towards irradiation than an alginate having a low ratio. Degradation of the PGA fragments by irradiation can be ascribed to hydrolytic cleavage of glycosydic bonds, although HPAEC analysis revealed that also other, unknown products were released during the irradiation process. Storage of various irradiated PGA fractions at -20 °C did not affect significantly their average molecular weight and had no effect on their HPAEC elution pattern.",

The initial concentration of the active ingredient did not always influence the residual contamination level.

The results of variance analysis showed that all investigated sources of variation (model solution composition, type of hydrocolloids and freezing process) had a significant influence on the rheological parameter (consistency coefficient). Due to the interaction of hydrocolloid and whey proteins or minerals the viscosity of the model solutions prepared with ultrafiltrated whey dropped substantially. Freezing process increased the viscosity of whey solutions, while the viscosity of solutions prepared with water did not change significantly.",

'Granny Smith™ were treated with ethanol, methanol and »apple aroma« vapours. The influence of these treatments on scald susceptibility and sensorial quality of apples was examined. The ethanol treatments were effective in superficial scald prevention but they caused a high incidence of internal browning after two months of storage. The 10 day treatments at 20 °C developed very pronounced internal browning after storage. The aroma treatment was the least effective in apple scald prevention but no internal disorders appeared after storage. Apples treated with methanol at 20 °C retain a great deal of their initial green colour. Vapour treatments demonstrated to be potential methods for scald prevention. Additional research is needed to minimise the internal disorders of treated fruit.",

    "abstract": "Flavour profiling by descriptive analysis of apple wines fermented with different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and natural sources of fermentation with or without nitrogen source addition was carried out. Out of 45 attributes used, 38 were found significant and were employed for further evaluation. Generally, the intensities of many of the descriptors in the apple wines were low. Both the natural sources of fermentation (NSF) imparted different flavours notes like lactic, sharp, acetic and fruity to the wine. “W” strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave wines with higher astringency and phenolic flavours, ethyl acetate like, acetaldehyde like flavour, UCD 505 and UCD 522 fermentated wines were peculiar for more ethanolic, sweety and bitter taste, whereas UCD 595 imparted more phenolic, astringent, sour, and ethanolic flavour notes to the wines. The addition of nitrogen source (irrespective of source of fermentation) reduced the development of some flavours considered undesirable (acetic, amyl alcoholic, fusel alcoholic, vegetative). Addition of nitrogen source enhanced the intensity of some other flavour attributes like ethanolic and phenolic in the wines. Due to the same vinification practices (except for the source of fermentation) some modifications in the flavour attributes of apple wines fermented by natural source of fermentation were recorded. The flavour profile of wines fermented by different sources of fermentation, was also reflected in the chemical characteristics examined. Besides higher fermentability, the addition of nitrogen source also affected the physico-chemical characteristics of the wines and consequently, their flavour profile. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the means of flavour scores generated from flavour profiling, weakly separated and characterized the wines fermented by different sources of fermentation but did not differentiate the wines fermented with or without nitrogen source. It is concluded that the descriptors described here can characterize apple wine of different quality attributes. The list of descriptors, concentration of standards and details of the technique have also been described.",

Enzymatic peptide modification (EPM) was carried out by using L-methionine ethyl ester in the reaction mixture. As catalyst, á -chymotrypsin or pepsin was used. The incorporation of methionine in to the peptide chains in the presence of á -chymotrypsin showed an optimum value at 0.14 g Met added to the reaction mixture/1 g hydrolysate in both cases. In the case of pepsin used as catalyst, the optimal Met-enrichment was at 0.14 g Met added to the reaction mixture/1 g buffalo casein hydrolysate and at 0.34 g Met/1 g cow casein hydrolysate. The covalent nature of the amino acid incorporation was confirmed by SDS - polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea. Electrophoretic patterns of the products indicate that transpeptidation plays an essential role in the EPM reaction. Antigenic character of the EPM- products was investigated in vitro by competitive indirect ELISA. Enzymatic peptide modification with methionine enrichment seems to be an efficient method for the reduction of the antigenic/potential allergenic character and for the improvement of the nutritive value of buffalo and cow milk caseins.",

A great emphasis is put on research to develop new methods to prevent enzymatic browning especially in fresh-cut (minimally processed) fruits and vegetables. The inhibition effect of crown compounds, macrocyclic ethers, benzo-18-crown-6 with sorbic acid and benzo-18-crown-6 with potassium sorbate, on polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity was studied. The effectiveness of these compounds was evaluated by using 3,4-dihydroxy phenylalanine (L-DOPA), and chlorogenic acid (3-o-caffeoyl-D-quinic acid), the most widespread natural PPO substrates in fruits and vegetables, as well as browning inhibition substances on the cut surface of apples. Results showed that crown compounds used in this study were effective, both as inhibitors of the oxidation of phenolic compounds (PPO substrates) in model solutions and as inhibitors of enzyme discolorations of real systems (fresh-cut apples).

The extract produced from coarse particles of ground roots had lower total and inorganic dissolved solids, mineral ions (Ca++ and K+), pH and EC values compared with those produced from fine particular ones. All sizes of licorice roots treated with gamma irradiation had significantly (P<0.05) lower microorganism counts than untreated (control) ones. The dose needed to reduce the microbial load to less than 10 bacteria per gram was 15 kGy for the fine particle and 10 kGy for the coarse ground root. Gamma irradiation decreased glycyrrhizinic acid concentrations in the extracts produced from coarse particle licorice roots.",

    "abstract": "The produced sugar, as the final product in sugar production technology, has to contain as low non-sucrose compounds with coloured matters as possible. Ultrafiltration and nanofiltration could be one of the solutions for a more effective separation of non-sucrose compounds from intermediate products from which sucrose directly crystallises. The separation of non-sucrose compounds by ultra- and nanofiltration is investigated on syrup solution with 40% d.m. content, which is an intermediate product in the phase of sucrose crystallisation. Further, this paper investigates variables in the ultrafiltration and nanofiltration of syrup solutions, such as variations in pore sizes of the polymer membranes, syrup temperatures, syrup flow rates and transmembrane pressures. During ultrafiltration, under the investigated conditions; permeate flux is about 10 times less than water flux (150 m-2h-1) on the first membrane and 8 times less than water flux (285 m-2h-1) on the second membrane, while the nanofiltration permeate flux is 15 times less than water flux (320 m-2h-1). The permeate flux decreases due to the adsorption of non-sucrose compounds by the filter membranes and the resultant increase in resistance to mass transfer. The colour content is about 58% lower by ultrafiltration using membranes. There is no great difference in colour separation between the used ultrafiltration membranes with different pore sizes. Nanofiltration was shown to separate 76% of coloured matter from syrup. In all the examined cases, permeate turbidity could be reduced by 75-80%, according to feed.",

In the present study, the effect of two rootstocks (‘Capsifort F1’ and ‘Snooker F1’) on two commercial varieties (‘SV9702 F1’ and ‘Karpex F1’) grown on two media (soil and coconut fibre) was evaluated. During our 2-year study, those instrumental attributes, which have a dominant effect on the chosen chemical components of fruit quality (total soluble solids and titratable acidity) were investigated. Sensory tests were also implemented in order to identify any changes due to the applied technological combinations. Sensory profile analysis was used to identify the descriptive attributes and their perceived intensities. Panellists worked in individual booths with standard lighting, test results were recorded with the Profisens software. In general, it can be concluded that the major instrumental and sensory parameters did not deteriorate as a result of grafting and the application of coconut fibre medium. Some attributes were identified, where the grafted plants on coconut fibre medium showed higher values, namely flesh thickness and shape. Based on our results, grafting and the application of coconut medium is a feasible technological development for growers and agri-business companies.",

Presumptive Staphylococcus isolates were recovered from ovine udder surface (US), individual raw milk, bulk tank milk, and cheese samples and were characterised by conventional phenotypic methods. A total of 69 bacterial isolates were further confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. Forty-two (60.9%) of 69 isolates were successfully identified on genus and species level. Two thirds ( n = 28) of the 42 identified isolates were shown to be Staphylococcus spp. These 28 staphylococcal isolates formed two clusters, one consisting of 22 Staphylococcus aureus strains and the other composed of 6 non- aureus staphylococci, including S. simulans ( n = 3), S. auricularis , S. equorum , and S. haemolyticus . MALDI-TOF MS has proven to be a reliable tool for the identification of staphylococci from raw sheep's milk, especially bulk tank milk; however, currently it appears to be less useful for the identification of bacterial isolates originating from ovine US samples. This is the first study to evaluate the applicability of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of Staphylococcus spp. in ovine raw milk, cheese, and US samples in Hungary.",

In case of sausages, deterioration of pigments of meat and spices cause discolouration, while lipid oxidation leads to the formation of off-odours, and these two processes are connected. Lipid oxidation promotes the conversion of pigments, while the formation of metmyoglobin accelerates lipid oxidation. The scope of the study was to investigate the relationship between the amount of malondialdehyde equivalents (MDA) and CIELAB colour coordinates in a Hungarian sausage with paprika, sliced and stored under refrigerated conditions for 10 weeks. We detected negative correlation ( P &lt; 0.001) between the MDA-level and a* and b*; and positive correlation ( P &lt; 0.001) between the MDA-level and L*. The observed correlation between MDA level and colour coordinates supports the assumption that the oxidation of lipids and pigments are interrelated in the case of sausage with paprika.",

In spite of the advantageous chemical composition and colloid-chemical properties, the use of mustard seed flour is limited in food industry or in animal feeding because of its pungent taste. The pungent taste develops through the action of myrosinase; but it could be eliminated by heat inactivation of the enzyme. In the course of our preliminary experiments, it was observed that heat inactivation of the myrosinase enzyme depended on mustard variety. The heat stability of myrosinase enzyme prepared from different mustard varieties was examined and compared in our research work. Crude myrosinase was prepared from three mustard genotypes (Budakalászi, Tilney, and LM-1 (a low erucic acid content cultivar) and the heat stability was determined at 60, 70 or 80 °C for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min. The semi-logarithmic plots of myrosinase activity as a function of time at different temperatures indicated that heat inactivation of crude myrosinase enzyme follows first-order kinetics. Characterising the rate of inactivation by the slope of the curve, significant differences were established in heat stability between genotypes at 60 °C. There were no significant differences between varieties at higher temperatures (70 and 80 °C). Longer than 10 min heat treatment causes more than 90% inactivation of the enzyme.",

The inorganic iodine contents of different wild growing (n=49) and cultivated (n=30) mushroom samples were analysed. A partly modified spectrophotometric method was used for the iodine determination in triplicate. The average iodine contents of the wild growing and the cultivated species and samples were 284 (±211) and 148 (±86) μg kg−1 d.m., respectively; these data do not differ significantly. The type of nutrition for the mushrooms seems to be the most important factor affecting the iodine level. The lowest values were identified in edible, wood decaying mushrooms. The analysed cultivated taxa (varieties of Agaricus bisporus, Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinula edodes) do not have significantly different iodine level, however, significantly lower iodine contents were found in mushroom samples produced in Germany than in samples cultivated in Hungary. The inorganic iodine level of edible (wild growing and cultivated) mushrooms is low. The lowest concentrations were identified in the wood-decaying species compared to the mycorrhizal ones. The calculated daily iodine intake of humans by mushrooms only accounts for 4–5% of the daily requirement.",

    "abstract": "1. Yeast biomass During the last 40 years considerable interest has been shown in the production of food proteins by microorganisms: bacteria, yeast, fungi and algae. Microorganisms are technologically attractive mainly because they offer the promise of increased food productions without reliance on traditional agricultural methods. Important features of the production of these unconventional proteins (single cell proteins or SCP) are that they are produced under controlled factory conditions, which require very limited space, they are not dependent upon atmospheric conditions and they spare marine fauna and other natural sources. The microorganisms involved continuously propagate in large fermentation vessels and will grow on many different substrates, among others on byproducts of the food industry. Among the other potential sources of SCP for human nutrition yeast protein seems to be the most suitable. In human experiments CALLOWEY (1976) showed that diets containing yeast as the only protein source resulted in a slightly higher level of faecal nitrogen than the control diet of casein, but the difference was not statistically significant. About 8–9 g yeast nitrogen was adequate to maintain the balance in healthy male subjects. Among the advantages to use yeast (yeast protein) the long tradition of yeast production has to be mentioned and commercially well developed, economically applicable technologies are available.

Substantially less 69 kDa protein was detectable in the infested soybean, whereas no 48 kDa protein was present in the control sample; it only appeared in the infested ones. There was a higher amount of 30 kDa protein in the infested stock. In summary, alteration in the protein structure was caused by T. urticae , and changes were triggered in the protein content of the affected soybean plants. The protein structure-change in damaged soybean items caused further decline in the feed consuming capacity of farm animals.",

Mechanical damage of fresh pods and bulk storage increase drastically the microbial load, particularly mouldiness. The processing technology leads to partial inactivation of viable mould without inactivating toxic metabolites eventually present. Although methods for the most important mycotoxins have been worked out (e.g. HPLC in combination with solid phase extraction procedures for aflatoxins, ochratoxin and some trichotecenes) these are too expensive and cumbersome for routine analysis. Thus, rapid screening methods for paprika powder would be useful for detecting both viable and dead fungi to indicate poor pre-processing handling and storage practices. Therefore, the applicability of the direct epifluorescence filter technique (DEFT) and the microcolony epifluorescence microscopy (MEM) were investigated for this purpose. Diluted suspensions of paprika powders were filtered through Nucleopore polycarbonate membrane filters, stained on the membrane either by Acridin Orange or Congo Red, then counted in non-fluorescent immersion oil on a slide and examined by an epifluorescence microscope at 1000X magnification. Due to a more distinct differentiation of mould parts and paprika particles, Congo Red proved to be a more suitable fluorescent stain. Highly contaminated samples could be quickly estimated by this DEFT method, however, more systematic work is required for quantitative classification. For rapid and selective enumeration of viable mould propagula in paprika powder, aliquots of paprika suspensions deposited on the filter membrane were incubated on the surface of a mould selective agar (RBCA) for 24 h at 30 °C prior to staining and epifluoroscence microscopy at 20X magnification detecting the developed mould microcolonies. Linear correlation (R=0.96) was found between the traditional log plate counts of moulds and the log MEM counts. The detection limit was 10 3 CFUg -1 . The time needed for enumeration of viable fungi was reduced to less than 2 days. DEFT-counting of bacterial contamination seemed to be applicable as a screening method for detecting decontaminated or very old samples of various spices.",

In general, Golden Delicious variety, irrespective of any location, yielded good quality osmo-vac dried rings. However, the rings from high hills and cold desert (L 3 ) location were the most acceptable, owing to crunchy texture, good taste/flavour with higher ascorbic acid retention and less browning. Treatment of prepared rings with potassium metabisulphite/ascorbic acid proved essential in checking oxidation during handling and drying, whereas blanching resulted in undesirable penetration of sugars into the rings.",

    "abstract": "According to widespread public opinion, environmental contaminants and food additives are major chemical hazards in food. In contrast, scientific evidence shows that levels of environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals or residues of pesticides, have greatly decreased in the last three decades and are much below the tolerable limits; food additives are strictly regulated and their proper use justifies no food safety concerns. The concept that a “de minimis” value or a Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) can be identified for any chemical is gaining ground in food toxicology. The popular belief that compounds of natural origin are intrinsically safer than synthetic ones is not supported by scientific evidence. - Nutrition oriented cancer research in the past was preoccupied with the idea that food contained man-made carcinogenic substances. Their detection and elimination was thought to reduce and perhaps avoid the risk of cancer. A paradigmatic change has occurred: from the hunt for carcinogenic chemicals in food, research has moved to the study of food constituents preventing cancer and to their mechanism of action. The occurrence of health-promoting food constituents forms the basis of the present interest in “functional foods”. However, criminal actions leading to hazardous contamination of food do occur, the Spanish oil catastrophe of 1981 being an extreme example of this. Continued vigilance will be required to protect consumers from unsafe products.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of harvest time, variety, and application of a biological activity inductor (Ti 4+ -ascorbate) on fruit yield and quality of spice red pepper. The influence of drying and grinding operations on quality parameters and thermo- and photostabilities of ground paprika during storage were also studied. Our results demonstrated that the Spanish cultivar, Albar, is the best of all studied pepper varieties due to the following factors: a) high fruit productivity, b) high fruit quality (total extractable red colour and red/yellow pigments ratio), c) high quality of processed spice red pepper, and d) high thermo- and photostabilities. Besides the cultivar selection, fruits from the first harvest showed the best quality parameters and if possible they should be used for paprika processing. The application of titanium ascorbate significantly improved fruit yield, fruit quality and ground paprika photostability during its storage; this is, therefore, a treatment that could help farmers and paprika manufacturers to improve their benefits, and consumers to find a food colourant of better quality.",

In presence of raffinose, considerable a-galactosidase activity was detected.

The amount of water-soluble, oxalate-soluble and alkali-soluble pectin were extracted and quantitatively determined as galacturonic acid, neutral sugars were determined as glucose. Jams were made with all peach samples as well as gels from extracted fractions. Gel strength of jams and gels was measured. Dry matter, sugar composition (amount of sucrose and reducing sugars) and pH value were determined and very little change was found during the ripening period and storage, too. Alkali-soluble fraction was more abounding than water-soluble fraction. The oxalate-soluble pectic fraction was found to be a minor fraction in all peach samples. The amount of total pectin and the amount of alkali-soluble pectin fraction dropped markedly after the 1st stage of ripening, after the 2 nd day of storage at 22 C and slightly after the 6th day of storage at 4 C. The level of alkali-soluble pectin in total pectin was inversely proportional to the level of water-soluble pectic fraction, and the level of oxalate-soluble pectic fraction in total pectin content was fairly constant during the ripening and storage. Gel strength of jams and gels correlated very well with changes of the amount of alkali-soluble pectic fraction. The extracted alkali-soluble pectic fraction was capable of forming an acidic gel. Extracted oxalate-soluble pectic fraction forms a gel in the presence of calcium and solid matter more than 77%. It seems that the amount of alkali-soluble pectic fraction in peaches is responsible in producing peach jams according to gel strength.",

The prevalence of obesity characterized by body mass index or waist circumference was higher in women than in men. The percentage of pathological levels of lipid parameters was also higher in women. No iron deficient erythropoesis was detected, but high serum ferritin concentration as a marker of body iron store was determined in some cases. General practitioners have possibilities to influence the nutritional habits of elderly, thereby reducing the incidence of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and stroke.

We found that the late application against weeds did not have a total eliminating effect, however reduced the number of weeds, restricted their development and the reproductive organs below and above ground dried. Weed seed infection was slowed down and the dried stems made harvesting easier. In the last three years, we found that fluroxypyr (Starane) and tribenuron-methyl (Granstar) impeded a little the maturing and water extraction in the milk maturation stage of wheat, but this difference was not seen in full maturation. Examinations showed that after late weed control, all of above-mentioned chemicals except bromoxynil (Pardner) was discharged at the time of the harvest and were under the maximum residue tolerance limit. So the experimentally involved herbicides can be used for late weed control - in accordance with international experiences.",

Therefore, reducing the initial cell count is necessary for both extending shelf-life and improving food safety. Physical, chemical and combined treatments serve this purpose. In these experiments, the effect of trisodium phosphate dipping (0-15% solutions) was studied. Chicken wings were used, which after dipping (1 min) in the solution were packed in PE-PA-PE pouches and stored at 4 °C. Aerobic mesophilic (Nutrient Agar, Merck), pseudomonad (Pseudomonas Selective Agar, Oxoid), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (VRBD Agar, Merck) were determined by Spiral Plate Technique at 30 °C incubation temperature. Effect of 3.8, 5.7, 7.6% trisodium phosphate dipping solutions was studied as a function of storage time. Immediately after treatment, total colony count was reduced by maximum 1.5 log cycles. Pseudomonads were the most sensitive. One day after treatment with these low concentration solutions, the colony count was reduced by 2 log cycles. Na3PO4concentration higherthan 7.6% practically did not result in higher effectivity. The growth rate and maximum cell count of surviving fraction were estimated as a function of trisodium phosphate concentration. It can be concluded from fitted survival curves that immediately after treatment the initial viable cell count was reduced and the critical spoilage level (107g-1) has been reached 2-3 days later than in case of the untreated samples, i.e. the shelf-life was extended.",

    "abstract": "Thermal and HHP treatments were compared. We established that the applied HHP treatments reduced the total cell count more significantly than thermal treatments. For example, the 10 min 600 MPa/10 min HHP treatment was equivalent to about 10 min thermal treatment at 70 °C. This combination of temperature and time is not used in the pasteurisation practice of the dairy industry. The various thermal treatments reduce the phosphatase enzyme activity to between one-third and one-hundredth of the original activity. The HHP treatments yielded similar results. Six hundred MPa pressure caused 10 to 70% decrease in the enzyme activity, while 700 MPa pressure led to a decrease of one log cycle.In the second year we tried to investigate the kinetics of the effect of HHP treatment. The 5, 10, 20, 40 min holding times were systematically applied in the range of 400 to 700 MPa. According to the results, 600 and 700 MPa HHP treatments effectively assured a decrease in the total cell count and the alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity. No organoleptic changes occurred.",

Different salt treatments viz. sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate were given which significantly (P<0.05) reduced the cooking time of soybean. The organoleptic evaluation of chapatis was conducted by scoring on a 9-point hedonic scale for various sensory parameters, i.e. colour, appearance, flavour, texture, taste and overall acceptability, which indicated that the developed chapati was acceptable to human palate. The protein and total soluble sugar contents of the developed chapati were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of the unprocessed control. However, fat, ash and crude fiber contents varied nonsignificantly. Processing treatments, i.e. mixing and roasting involved in chapati making reduced the phytic acid (19.1%) and polyphenols (52.92%) contents significantly (P<0.05) over the unprocessed composite flour. As a result, in vitro protein and starch digestibility of chapati also improved significantly to the extent of 6.89 and 26.6 percent, respectively.",

Results indicated that bioactivities were extremely affected by solvent; water extracts contained more phenolics, exhibited strong anti-diabetic effect, but no activity of anti-proliferation, while the ethanolic extracts rich in flavonoids showed profound DPPH radical scavenging and anti-proliferation ability, yet low activity of antidiabetes. Among the drying methods, freeze-drying extracts preserved more flavonoids and exhibited better activity of anti-proliferation, while shade-drying extracts contained higher phenolics and showed stronger activity on antidiabetes, oven-drying gave the lowest content of phenolics. Hence, antioxidant and anti-diabetic effects were positively related to phenolic content, meanwhile an extremely significant correlation coefficient had been found between anti-proliferation activity and flavonoid content, it can be concluded that drying method and extraction solvent affect bioactivities by phenolic and flavonoid contents.",

Nine honey types obtained directly from beekeepers were investigated. Honey was heated at the temperatures 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C for 24 hours and then cooled down to 25–26 °C. At that temperature, dielectric properties of biological material under study were determined. In the frequency range 400 Hz to 4 kHz, the significant influence of thermal treatment temperature on both dielectric parameters was observed. Both dielectric parameters decrease as the heating temperature increases. The statistical analysis suggested that dielectric parameters can be used for distinguishing honey overheated from not overheated. Therefore, they can be potentially useful for honey quality assessment according to its overheating, e.g. in co-packing process. The proper frequency range for these parameters measurement is 1–4 kHz.",

Ascorbic acid values of the samples obtained from the polarographic method were compared with those obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) used as the reference method. The analytical parameters determined showed that the polarographic method was equivalent to the chromatographic method. Validation of the polarographic method of ascorbic acid assay indicates that it can be applied for the analysis of ascorbic acid concentration in food products that do not contain isoascorbic acid.

    "abstract": "Casein peptides with calcium-chelating capacity were rapidly enriched by using a novel ceramic matrix (CM)-based Ti 4+ -IMAC adsorbent. The ability of calcium-chelating peptides (CCPs) to bind calcium and the physical properties of complexes formed between CCPs and calcium were investigated. Results demonstrated that the amount of calcium bound depended on the degree of hydrolysis (DH) of casein hydrolysates. The highest calcium binding capacity (683 mg g −1 ) occurred when bovine casein was hydrolysed by pancreatin at a DH of 0.14%, meanwhile, the calcium content of CCPs-Ca complex exhibited the maximum level (134.96 mg g −1 ). In addition, CCPs showed a higher radical scavenging capacity (50 µg ml −1 ; 99% inhibition, or an equivalent activity of 9.91×10 −3 M Trolox) compared to casein digest. Moreover, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to explore the interaction between CPPs and calcium, and the results demonstrated that phosphoserine residues as well as COO - groups of CCPs were involved in the formation of CCPs-Ca complex.",

    "abstract": "Most of red wine's health benefits are attributed to polyphenols, which can express different biological effects. During ageing process, numerous chemical reactions occur, alternating phenolic composition of wine. Therefore, this paper focused on the influence of ageing on the evolution of wine phenolics (phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and anthocyanins). Wines from 4 local grape varieties (Frankovka, Portugieser, Probus, and Rumenika) were analysed after 1 month and 4 years of ageing. Monomeric anthocyanin and total phenolic contents and antioxidative potential in aged wines were also determined. Among tested phenolics, main components in aged wines remained gallic acid (2.16–19.55 mg l −1 ) and catechin (8.39–37.21 mg l −1 ). The most prominent changes of analysed phenolic compounds during ageing were observed for p -coumaric acid (from +173.3% to +763.1%) and malvidin-3-glucoside (from +173.3% to +763.1%). Wine from Rumenika variety maintained the highest content of individual phenols after ageing. Additionally, aged wines had very low content of monomeric anthocyanins. Significant correlation (r= −0.93, P&lt;0.05) between total phenolic content and IC 50 values in aged wines was also noticed. Obtained results provide useful information about the quality preservation during aging and storage of these products.",

The meat was treated with 500, 1000 ppm of BACs, vacuum packaged and stored at 4 °C for 8 days. Physicochemical characteristics, lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), microbiological status, and sensorial (electronic-nose based) properties were investigated. Both BACs significantly increased the redness ( a *) and chroma ( C *) values in meat compared to increased lightness ( L *) and higher TBARS in control. Although both BACs showed overlapping aroma profile, the E-nose was able to distinguish between the different meat groups. LIN with various dilution ratios, particularly 1:10 (v:v), showed in vitro growth inhibition against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Bacillus cereus , concomitantly Listeria monocytogenes required 1:80 (v:v) to be inhibited, and no inhibition was detected for Pseudomonas lundensis. In contrast, PIP at different dilutions did not exhibit inhibitory activity. Regarding aerobic mesophilic counts (AMC), less than 7 log CFU g −1 were recorded except for control showing higher log. Both BACs have potential to improve quality characteristics and increase the shelf life of meat and meat products.",

To investigate the underlying mechanism of action of the ethanolic extract of propolis, bacteriolysis, bacterial death, leakage of potassium, proteins, nucleic components, and scanning electron microscopic studies were conducted. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethanolic extract of propolis against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was 39 μg ml –1 . The extract displayed signiﬁcant bactericid activity against S. aureus in a time and concentration dependant manner. Its mode of action was evident from the increase of K + eﬄux and nucleotide leakage. These results were conﬁrmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) that showed remarkable morphological and ultrastructural changes in S. aureus after exposure to 1MIC and 2MIC concentrations. The overall study contributed to the understanding of the antistaphylococcal mechanism of ethanolic extract of propolis.

Several channels and practices of direct raw milk sales exist in Hungary. Because short food supply chains in the Hungarian dairy sector have not yet been investigated in detail, we have little or no knowledge on the composition of directly sold raw milk. For this reason, a 9-month study was undertaken from June 2013 through February 2014, wherein directly sold raw bovine milk samples were tested for fat, protein, lactose, and solids-not-fat contents and for freezing point. A total of 21 direct sellers located in Budapest, Hungary were sampled twice a month. The results were compared to the official Hungarian raw milk quality data referring to the same period. The direct milk vendors involved in this study were found to sell raw milk with reduced levels of lactose and solids-not-fat and elevated freezing points, compared to the national raw milk data. The findings of this research underline the need for stricter regulations and control with respect to direct raw milk sales in the country.",

Comparison was done with fillets packed in vacuum (control samples). The obtained results from our research showed that VSP packaging can be recommended, as it showed slightly better stability than vacuum packaging. The initial values of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) content (in mg/100 g) in fish samples were low (vacuum 16.36±0.65; VSP 16.67±0.45) and these values did not change significantly until day 9.

Two years later, information on breastfeeding and allergic outcomes was collected by questionnaires from parents of both groups and district child care nurses. Significantly higher concentrations of LF were found in the breast milk of allergic mothers compared to the healthy controls. At 2 years of age, only those three infants became allergic from the atopic group in whose starting breast milk samples a very high LF level (306 μg mg–1 protein) or simultaneously elevated concentrations of LF and IL-17 were measured.

    "abstract": "Isoflavones are phenolic compounds present in soybean and other legumes, which have attracted considerable attention because of various health effects associated with their bioactive properties. From twelve isoflavones known in soybean, nine are present in a glycoside form, whereas health effects are mainly attributed to the aglycones daidzein, genistein and glycitein. While most analytical methods focus either on total isoflavone content before hydrolysis or on isoflavone aglycones after hydrolysis, a two-step analytical procedure using HPLC separation and UV detection has been applied to detect both the isoflavone glycosides naturally present in soybean as well as their aglycones after acid hydrolysis. Five soybean genotypes of early maturity groups have been grown in the east of Austria in two climatically contrasting seasons, and seed samples were analysed for isoflavones. Total isoflavone concentrations of the soybean samples determined before and after hydrolysis ranged from 258–1137 μg/g and from 140–748 μg/g, respectively. For most isoflavones analysed, differences were statistically significant both for genotypes and growing seasons. The results suggest that the analytical procedure applied is useful both for selection of high isoflavone soybean genotypes as well as in quality control, particularly in view of isoflavone bioavailability.",

The study was undertaken to estimate daily sodium and potassium intake by measuring 24-h urinary electrolyte excretion rate in 200 Hungarian children (age 1–18 years). Daily sodium and potassium intake positively correlated with age, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. As a result of the parallel trend and time course of urinary sodium and potassium excretion the sodium to potassium ratio, the important risk factor for essential hypertension remained practically unchanged with age. We did not find a significant difference in this ratio between hypertensive and normotensive, or obese and non-obese children. Sodium and potassium intake expressed per kilogram body weight decreased steadily with age, but there was no significant difference between boys and girls. When adjustment was made for age and body mass index, using multivariate regression analysis, the systolic blood pressure proved to be independent of urinary sodium excretion and daily potassium intake. Compared with Dietary Reference Intake values, the present study demonstrates that, on average, Hungarian children and adolescents have a diet rich in sodium, and poor in potassium, although during the last 20 years a favourable trend can be detected.",

In this process, the dispersed phase (oil) is pressed through the pores of a microporous membrane directly into the continuous phase (water) flowing tangentially to the membrane surface. The purpose of the emulsification experimentations was to find and model operating conditions of the operation. In laboratory experiments from conventional, commercial grade sunflower oil (dispersed phase) and from distilled water (solid phase), emulsions were prepared. The ceramic tube membrane with nominal pore size of 1.4 μm was used in the experiments (ZrO2). In order to increase the shear-stress near the membrane wall (influence the characteristics of the flow regime of the continuous phase), a kind of self-fabricated helical-shaped-ribbon reducer was installed inside the tube membrane.",

The supplement is promising in reaching the nutritional demands of the elderly, providing high content of protein and fibre and low content of fat. The values found for PER and NPR were shown to be superior to the control group of casein (P<0.05) and the digestibility was higher than 90%, showing that the supplement presented characteristics of a high nutritional value protein source.

Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: group ND received a normal caloric diet, group HRB received a hypercaloric diet with control rye bread, groups HRB0.8% and HRB1.1% received a hypercaloric diet with rye bread enriched with 0.8% and 1.1% GTE, respectively. Higher food intake in the ND group compared with the other groups of rats was noted; however, there was no statistical difference in the energy intake among any of the groups. Consumption of the hypercaloric diet increased the body weight of the rats (in comparison with ND), but rats from HRB1.1% group showed a tendency towards smaller gains in body weight (∼4.0%) when compared to the HRB group. The addition of 1.1% GTE to rye bread resulted in an increase in the energy content of faeces, compared to both HRB and ND groups. No differences were observed in plasma leptin concentrations between the four groups. The insulin level in rats fed a hypercaloric diet was higher in comparison to rats from the ND group. The consumption of rye bread enriched with 1.1% GTE may increase faeces energy excretion, but without significantly suppressing body weight gain, visceral fat accumulation, or changing biochemical parameters related to lipid metabolism.",

B- and T-cell responses to peanut proteins were analysed by determination of the IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody levels in plasma and the concentration of IL-4, IFN-gamma and IL-10 cytokines secreted by isolated splenocytes.Conducted studies have demonstrated that immunotherapy with proteins resulted in the decrease of total IgE and peanut-specific IgG1 levels and significantly enhanced synthesis of peanut-specific IgG2a in plasma (ELISA method) and at the cellular level (ELISPOT type B). A successful and effective immunotherapy is related to the shift in profile of lymphocytes from Th2 subpopulation towards Th1 subpopulation. In our studies significant increase in the activity of Th1 lymphocytes was observed in groups desensitized with pea protein extracts (PE) and pea legumin fraction (PL). In these groups, significant statistic decrease in IL-4 secreted and increase in IL-10 level were found.Desensitization method with the use of pea proteins being suggested in the presented studies can be an alternative method for specific immunotherapy for people, especially with strong allergic reaction to peanuts; however, this method needs further studies with mouse model.",

A self-administered questionnaire was used as a method of data collection. The positive dietary factors were scored on the basis of a self-reported food frequency questionnaire about the past month consumption of foods. In the univariate analysis age, physical activity and smoking was proven to be in relationship with dietary habits, while body mass index or self-rated health not. The health behaviour of sportsmen showed different picture indicating that active sport is not unequivocally resulted in healthier dietary habits.",

However, HHP also influences enzymatic reactions of food.

The aim of this study was to point out some parameters of high hydrostatic pressure technique (pressure, temperature, build-up time, holding time, number of cycles) that can substantially impact the sensory properties of treated products.",

Sensory quality was assessed using a category point scale and the sensory profile was evaluated using a graphical unstructured scale.

All the examined parameters changed during the observed period, with the greatest changes occurring in weight, texture, and taste. There were also differences between the tested cultivars. Statistically significant correlations between sensory and physicochemical data were observed between texture characteristics and weight changes. In case of sweet taste, only a weak correlation between the intensity of sweet flavour and soluble solid content values was found.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of AMFJ on exploratory behaviour and locomotor activity in male Wistar rats.

It was found that the low doses of AMFJ (2.5 and 5 ml kg−1) for all treatment periods did not significantly affect exploratory behaviour and locomotor activity of rats compared to the saline-treated controls. AMFJ at the highest dose of 10 ml kg−1 had no significant effect on exploration and locomotion for the treatment periods of 7 and 14 days, while for the periods of 21 and 30 days it significantly decreased the number of horizontal and vertical movements, which might be the result of a sedative effect. At all the doses and testing periods, AMFJ did not disturb the progressive decrease in motor behaviour, suggesting habituation.",

In contrast to this, the volume of production in Europe and the United States has been growing continuously in the last decade. Although the species have been subjected to some taxonomical investigations, there are still a lot of contradictions in the taxonomic positioning of the P. eryngii species complex. In this study we investigated the genetic variability and taxonomic relationships among P. eryngii strains by using the RAPD-PCR method. Fifteen strains were analysed from our collection that represents mostly the Eastern-Hungarian habitats. Twenty-five random decamer primers were tested in the preliminary experiments and six were chosen that were used for binary coding. A neighbour-joining tree prepared from this matrix shows the coherence among the taxonomic relations and production sites of the potentially cultivable Hungarian strains.",

To understand the nature of protein denaturation processes, experimental but realistic model matrices (corn starch based mixture, hydrated dough, and heat treated cookies) were developed that contain a defined amount of milk, egg, soy, and wheat proteins individually or in combination. The protein subunit composition was investigated in every processing phase, i.e. after mixing, dough formation, and baking. SDS-PAGE measurements were carried out to monitor the protein distribution of sample food matrices in non-reducing and reducing gels. The results clearly show that the highly decreased protein solubility is caused by denaturation, aggregation, or complex formation, which are the most significant factors in poorer analytical performances. Solubility can only partly be improved with the application of reducing agents or surfactants, and the rate of improvement is depending on the proteins and the matrices.",

The lecithin appeared as foreign taste based on the sensory test. The aromatic difference, as assessed with electronic nose, was clearly detectable between Sfland SBL. The increasing supplementation levels were also properly distinguished with discriminant analysis within the SBL and Sflseries. Summarized, Sflwas found to be a better antioxidant, but SBL improved the FA profile into a more favourable state. The lecithin-replacement made unlikeness in the taste compared to the control.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco plant is known to easily absorb heavy metals from soil and accumulate them in leaves. Part of these metals is transferred by the smoke into the human body, where they accumulate, damage the organs (mainly kidney and liver) and act as promoters in conjunction with carcinogens. Application of the essential elements can be effective in the prevention of toxicity and curative manner against the negative effects of toxic heavy metals. Reducing the harmful health effects of tobacco smoke is one of the major tasks of our research. Essential elements, first of all Zn and Fe, were added in an artificial way on tobacco-cut so that these elements should pass by the smoke to the smokers' bodies. The toxic metal content of our tobacco-sample was consistent with other data published in international literature (Cd: 1.55 mg g –1; Pb: 1.51 mg g –1). The transfer rates of these metals from tobacco-cut to smoke were significant (Cd: 15–34%; Pb: 8–20%). Twenty-thirty percent of the artificially added Zn and 10–23% of Fe transfer into the smoke was mainly in total particulate matter (TPM). The transmission of Zn to the smoke seems not to be dependent on temperature of smoke formation. However, higher Fe concentration was detected in smoke forming at 600 °C than at 900 °C. The more considerable part of Zn and Fe can be found in the ash. __",

Proanthocyanidins of faba bean seed coats were extracted with a mixture of acetone and water (70:30) and lyophilized. The amount of proanthocyanidins was two- or fourfold higher in the experimental diets as compared to the control diet. The addition of proanthocyanidin extract had no significant effect on the coefficients of digestibility of crude protein, daily nitrogen retention and the coefficient of biological value of diet protein. In the blood serum of rats fed diets supplemented with proanthocyanidin extract, there was a slightly higher content of vitamin E and alanine aminotransferase activity, while the content of vitamin A and aspartate aminotransferase activity were similar to those of the control group. In the contents of the rat gut (caecum), a lower activity of â -glucuronidase was found as compared to the control group, whereas â -galactosidase was unaffected. The addition of proanthocyanidin extract to diet caused a decrease in the malondialdehyde content in the heart, kidneys, erythrocytes and blood plasma of rats. The results obtained indicate that the amount of proanthocyanidins used did not exert any antinutritional effects, but extended the pool of diet antioxidants and beneficially affected the activity of the large bowel microflora.",

A strong increase in the uptake levels of RE, ROL and especially BC from 1986 to 1993 was observed in East German women, men and children, and was partly dependent on household financial status. This remarkable elevation was most likely caused by alterations in consumed food varieties in East Germany following reunification. Since high dietary intake of VA was shown to be associated with atopy, the observed elevated RE, ROL and especially BC uptake of East Germans might also have affected their prevalence of atopic disease.",

Thermal stability of crude preparations is a remarkable fact, as enzyme activity is high even after 25 min at 65 °C, but decreases in the case of the main purified proteolytic fraction (III). Acetone fractionation followed by ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE- and CM-Sepharose CL-6B) affords four active fractions with closely related molecular sizes (63-71 kD, SDS-PAGE)",

The examinations involved determination of seed germination, enzymatic activities and chemical indicators of grain properties. On the basis of the obtained results it could be concluded that the drying temperature of wheat should not exceed 50 °C in order to preserve biologically undamaged grain. Gluten of lower swelling ability increases sedimentation value at drying temperatures of 60 and 70 °C. For wheat samples with high quality gluten the wheat grain drying process at a temperature of 50 °C improved the wheat quality regarding the increased ability of gluten swelling. An increase in the drying temperature did not influence the characteristics of starch components. Diastatic and proteolytic activities of wheat decreased at a higher drying temperature.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential cytotoxic activity of different concentrations of selected Croatian red and white wines on the growth of human normal and tumour cells in vitro. Effects on growth of cervical carcinoma (HeLa), colon carcinoma (Caco-2, HT-29), poorly differentiated cells from lymph node metastasis of colon carcinoma (SW-620), larynx carcinoma cells (HEp-2) and normal fibroblasts (WI38) were tested by MTT-assay. Radioactive substrate incorporation tests were used for assessing effects on DNA, RNAs and proteins syntheses. Concentration of polyphenols in wines was assessed according to the method of Singleton and Rossi. Ethanol in the wine concentrates was determined by MS-GC method. Results of the cytotoxicity test showed that colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2, HT-29), as well as colon carcinoma metastasis (SW620) were the most affected by dealcoholized red wines in concentrations 25% and 12.5% v/v. Amount of total phenols in the red wines was significantly higher (5-10 times) compared to the white wines. The red wine with the greatest polyphenol content was shown to be the most effective. Red wine samples in concentration 25% v/v statistically significantly inhibited the growth of all tested cell lines, including fibroblasts. Tested white wines showed no or negligible growth inhibitory effect against tumour and normal cells. Tumour cells, HeLa and Hep-2, treated by red wine V3 (12.5% v/v) and Hep-2 cells treated by red wine V4 (12.5% v/v) exhibited slightly growth-stimulatory effects. Biosynthesis assay of DNA, RNA and proteins indicated a standstill in the growth of treated cells. Our results indicate that polyphenol-rich domestic wine might have potential pro-therapeutic effect on transformed colonic cells.",

Table beet (Beta vulgaris L. var. rubra) contains bioactive agents, which have a wide range of different physiologic effects. These agents have beneficial antioxidant properties. The aim in the present study was to determine the gut protecting properties of bioactive substances of table beet in a model of ischaemic-reperfusion injury of the rat liver. Chemiluminescent intensity, H-donating ability, reducing power and free SH-group concentracion were determined by luminometry and spectrophotometry in duodenum and plasma. Lyophilized table beet increased significantly the free radical scavenging property of the plasma measured by chemiluminometry. Other antioxidant parameters of the plasma increased in rats fed table beet diet, and change in reducing power was significant. Beneficial effect of the treatment was found in changes of total scavenger capacity of the duodenum during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. H-donating ability and reducing power of the gut decreased in the table beet-fed group during ischaemia-reperfusion compared to normal group with ischaemia-reperfusion. Based on these data, it can be concluded that table beet can protect the entire body from the oxidative damage caused by ischaemia-reperfusion of the liver, but the effect of table beet treatment on gut mucosa needs further investigation.",

Five different TS were compared in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production on one experimental field (chernosem) located in the Baranya region, north-eastern Croatia from 1998 to 2001. Tillage systems included conventional tillage (CT), disc harrowing, fine till (DHF), soil loosening (SL) + disc harrowing (DH), disc harrowing, coarse till (DHC) and no-tillage (NT). The most stable grain yield was obtained by DHF and CT in all three experimental years. There was no striking regularity with regard to applied TS and hectoliter mass and thousand-kernels weight. The biggest difference of hectoliter mass was determined between CT and NT. TS had significant influence on the flour extraction rate in all three experimental years. The influence of TS on farinographic parameters was significant for all three experimental years for the quality number. Quality number was greater under CT than under other TS. Tillage effect on extensographic and amylographic parameters in the 3-year average did not show statistically significant differences. To sum up, since disc harrowing (DHF) and (DHC) followed by soil loosening with chisel produced equal grain yield and wheat quality parameters were slightly better than conventional tillage, these systems could be presented as an even handed replacement for ploughing.",

For this purpose, longissimus dorsi muscules were used, and three different groups were formed during salting. The first group (control) was salted only with NaCl at 10% proportion of meat weight. In the second and third group, sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate were added to the salt at 0.1% proportion of meat weight, respectively. After production process of about twenty days, pastirama samples were stored at 4±1 °C in vacuum package for 60 days. During the storage period residual nitrate and nitrite contents were examined. Residual nitrate and nitrite contents of pastirma samples were determined to be 51.66-203.08 ppm, 22.13-51.06 ppm on the first day of storage and 25.53-38.80 ppm, 3.20-9.51 ppm on the 60 th day of storage, respectively. Residual nitrate and nitrite contents of the third group cured with potassium nitrate were found to be lower than the second group cured with sodium nitrate. In conclusion, using sodium and potassium nitrate at this level as curing agents in pastirma production had no effect on the acceptable level of nitrate and nitrite contents of pastirma. In addition, potassium nitrate was degraded faster, and it was lower than sodium nitrate during the storage period.",

In this study we tested S-layer isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus PV72 for enzyme (ß-glucosidase, hexokinase and aldolase) immobilization. The carbodiimide method gave yields less than 5%. The yields of co-cross-linking method with glutaraldehyde were enhanced compared to the carbodiimide method, but the yield was higher than 10% only in the case of ß-glucosidase. Because of the fine structure of S-layer, immobilized enzymes could be removed from reaction mixtures only by centrifugation, therefore these preparations were entrapped in calcium alginate gel. The yields of entrapping procedures were between 15% and 37%. It was presumed that the new immobilized ß-glucosidase preparation could be used in a preliminary testing for flavour enrichment of wines. Efficiency of this preparation was compared to that of the immobilized ß-glucosidase on Acrylex C-100 support described earlier. We found that the immobilization of ß-glucosidase on both Acrylex C-100 support and S-layer followed by gel entrapping resulted in active enzyme preparations that could be used for flavour enrichment of wines without enhancing their protein content.",

    "abstract": "Drying yellow-dent field corn from harvest moisture levels to safe storage levels is a major cost for producers. This cost can be minimized by precise control of the final moisture content through feed-forward or feedback control. One of the difficulties in achieving control of corn drying is the inaccuracy of dielectric moisture measurements due to non-uniform moisture distributions within kernels after drying. After dried grain has equilibrated for several hours, moisture measurements are somewhat different than immediately after drying. This research examined these effects for yellow-dent field corn over a range of measurement frequencies and drying conditions. Prediction equations relating dielectric constant to moisture content were developed for a range of radio frequencies. The differences between predicted moisture values for recently dried and equilibrated corn were found to be dependent on the measurement frequency and the final moisture content of the grain. For some conditions, particularly for low measurement frequencies and high final moisture contents, predicted moisture contents increased after equilibration. However, predicted moisture values decreased upon equilibration if the final moisture content was near 15 percent, especially if the measurement frequency was between 500 kHz and 10 MHz. Higher measurement frequencies generally yielded smaller predicted moisture differences than lower frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Sphingophosphonolipids (SPnLs) were isolated from the mantle of 3 kinds of cephalopod molluscs(Eledone moschata, Sepia officinalis, Todarodes sagittatus) of the Aegean Sea. Their structures were confirmed by a series of chemical and analytical methods such as gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and electrospray mass spectrometry. They were identified as ceramide aminoethylphosphonate species. According to the phosphonate-phosphorus determination, ceramide aminoethylphosphonate components were found to represent 15.9, 10.0 and 9.2% of total phospholipids, respectively. The long-chain bases (LCB) are C16-C22 dihydroxy monoenoic and dienoic bases. The component fatty acids are mainly palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1 n-9)) and in smaller quantities eicosaenoic acid (C20:1 n-9), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3). It is of great interest that Sepia officinalis was found to contain ceramide N-methylaminoethylphosphonate as minor phosphonolipid species.",

Samples were taken from commercial meat processing lines, sliced to 1.2 mm thickness and placed overlapped into polypropylene trays sealed with plastic films. The headspace of modified atmosphere packaged formulations consisted of 30% CO2 and 70% N2 or 60% CO2 and 40% N2. The samples thus produced were stored under refrigerated conditions. The values of microbiological, chemical, physical or sensory properties were plotted against storage time, and Gompertz curves were fitted to all time series that changed from an initial to a final value during any period of storage. The influence of headspace CO2 concentration on the properties of sliced cooked meat products varied considerably and, therefore, it was not possible to specify general rules. However, the presence of CO2 in the packaging atmosphere slowed down the rate of microbial growth, thereby delaying the spoilage of meat products. A CO2 level of 60% had beneficial effects on both the microbiological and sensory properties of sliced sausages and cooked ham. It was concluded that cooked meat products packaged under modified atmospheres had a shelf-life of 20 days.",

The control sausage was made from pork backfat. For the studied samples, SBO in native and pre-emulsified forms was used for partial substitution of backfat at 25% (by wt of backfat) to produce sausages with various fat contents (30, 20, and 10%). Discontinuity of protein matrix could be observed with increasing fat content, especially for addition of pork backfat. Improvement on product stability could be achieved using SBO, especially pre-emulsified form, to partially replace animal fat. Better dispersibility of the SBO droplets through the meat matrix compared to backfat globules was suggested by the greater continuity in the microstructure of the sausages with SBO. For the sausages supplemented with pre-emulsified SBO, the non-meat protein used as emulsifier could further strengthen the protein network, thereby resulting in enhanced product stability and retained textural attributes of the sausages. The fish protein isolate presently employed as emulsifier to prepare SBO emulsion could be promisingly used to produce more nutritive sausages by providing adequate stability.",

The Busha cattle breed is known to be highly resistant to various diseases and well-adapted to the extensive breeding conditions of the Balkan Peninsula. Busha cow milk contains an average of 13.47% dry matter, 4.34% fat, 3.72 % protein, and 4.32% lactose. Significant differences were detected ( P &lt; 0.05) in the amino acid compositions of the milk of different Busha cattle strains of Kosovo. Glutamic acid, proline, leucine, aspartic acid, lysine, and valine represented 68% of the total amino acid content. Essential amino acids, branched-chain and sulphur-containing amino acids were found in substantial amounts in the milk samples. Among the biogenic amines, however, spermine (0.16 mg kg −1 ) and cadaverine (0.09 mg kg −1 ) were present in low concentrations. Due to these excellent qualities of the Busha cow milk, preservation of this cattle breed is of great importance. Developing sustainable and secured breeding and feeding programs for this endangered cattle breed of the Balkan Peninsula should also be a high priority.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The presented research aimed to confirm that the differences in the lipid peroxidation of three maize ( Zea mays L.) hybrids with different genotypes and maturity are due to different nitrogen levels, which was observed based on the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) measured in the leaves at the main phenological stages of plants. The experiments were performed in a multi-factorial long term fertilisation field trial. In the study, phosphorus and potassium were constantly provided at the optimal level for the plants. The phosphorus and potassium fertilisation were applied in autumn. However, N levels varied from 0 to 300 kg ha −1 . Sampling was done at different growth stages 5 times during the growing season (4 leaves, 6 leaves, 8 leaves, 14 leaves, silking). The 300 kg ha −1 N (dose 3) resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA level), but not a statistically significant difference between the control (dose 1) and the 120 kg ha −1 (dose 2) N doses. The H1 hybrid had the lowest level of lipid peroxidation at the first sampling date. High volume nitrogen fertilisation (dose 3: 300 kg ha −1 ) increased lipid peroxidation in the hybrids. Averaging the values obtained for the same hybrid at the different sampling times, the medium (dose 2) 120 kg ha −1 N treatment had no significant effect on the lipid peroxidation of the hybrids compared to the values of the control plants. Based on the lipid peroxidation response of the hybrids to N treatment, the exact N dose inflection point can be determined to make the fertiliser utilisation of plants more efficient. Based on our results, we found that inadequate, low (120 kg ha −1 ) or high (300 kg ha −1 ) nitrogen fertilisation could affect the MDA levels of plants, thereby affecting the functioning of the lipid peroxidation mechanism.",

Results showed that increase in germination time and temperature increased in vitro digestibility of starch and protein during germination of brown rice owing to depolymerisation of starch and protein molecules by enzymatic activity. After germination under varying conditions, antioxidant activity increased from 50.19 to 95.58%, total phenolic and flavonoid contents from 0.88 to 2.02 mg GAE/g and 34.06–62.94 mg QE/100g, respectively. Germination at elevated temperature (35 °C) for prolonged time (48 h) also increased the reducing power by 60.49% and metal chelating activity by 114.50% as a result of structural breakdown of bound phenolics. Increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes with progress in the germination time and temperature also results in continuous reduction in the pasting properties and lightness values (L), while increasing a* and b* values of the flour of germinated brown rice. Tailored germination, therefore, can be offered as a tool to increase nutrient digestibility and bioactive potential of brown rice as compared to non-germinated brown rice, thus, producing naturally modified flour with enhanced functionality.",

Carbohydrate value of noodles decreased with the SM fortification level. Cooking quality characteristics of SM added noodles, especially 10S, were better in terms of weight gain, volume increase and cooking loss. The highest L* and b* values, which are expected to be high by the consumers, were reached with 10S and 30S, respectively. The value of a* increased with the addition of SM. Hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness values of the noodles increased with an increase in the level of shrimp content. Addition of SM improved the microstructure of noodles due to enriched protein matrix. Nutritious noodles with high cooking quality and a potential for long shelf life are intended for athletes and individuals with special nutritional needs.",

Biotic and abiotic stresses have negative effect on tomato production. Utilisation of rootstocks conferring resistance to biotic stresses can be considered as the most effective and environment friendly solution in tomato production to overcome this problem. Although wild tomato species is a good rootstock candidate due to its resistance to multiple plant diseases, effects of wild tomato species as rootstock on mineral nutrient composition and fruit quality are not clear. In the present study, effects of interspecific hybrids derived from two wild tomato species ( Solanum habrochaites and Solanum penellii ) as rootstock on tomato fruit mineral nutrient composition (phosphor (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu)) and fruit quality traits (soluble solids content (SSC), pH, percent titratable acidity (TA), and lycopene content) were evaluated. In the study, Amaron, Armstrong, and Arazi commercial rootstocks were used as control and AK0004 F1 (candidate tomato hybrid) was used as a source of scion. As result, only lycopene content was affected by different rootstocks. S. penellii was found to be with more potential for lycopene content. For mineral nutrient composition, all hybrids and controls had similar contents of potassium, phosphor, calcium, and magnesium. Manganese and copper contents decreased in all plants. S. habrochaites had more potential regarding nitrogen, iron, and zinc contens than S. penellii . This is the first study to evaluate two interspecific hybrids derived from S. habrochaites and S. penellii , and the results might be useful to understand effects of rootstocks derived from wild tomato species on mineral nutrient content and fruit quality.",

However, its amicable efficacy is now being doubted considering the recent occurrence of several cases of hepato- and nephrotoxicity, after the ingestion of EGCG-fortified (≥85–90%) nutritional supplements. Therefore, the current study was carried out to ascertain the effect of green tea leaves extract (GTE), having low EGCG content (73.8%), on liver and kidney functions of male Wistar rats using various in vivo experiments and in vitro radical scavenging activity. In terms of acute toxicity, GTE was observed to be safe when delivered at a dosage of 2000 mg kg −1 body weight (BW). Oral delivery of GTE for 28 days at a concentration of 200 mg kg −1 BW/day did not trigger sub-acute toxicity to the liver and kidneys, as per serum biochemical analyses and histopathological examination. In contrast, GTE counteracted the effects of carbon tetrachloride (a potent hepato-degenerative compound) on the liver. Furthermore, increase in high-density lipoprotein―cholesterol with concomitant lowering of serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein―cholesterol were noticed in GTE-treated rats. These findings suggest that low EGCG containing GTE, with appreciable antioxidant activity (IC 50 = 53.18–71.28 μg mL −1 ), can serve as a hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic, and hypocholesterolemic ingredient.",

More utilisation of FA decreased butyric acid and SCFA output in the faeces for diet 5:1 compared with diets 10:1 XOS:FA or XOS alone. Furthermore, compared with 10:1 XOS:FA or XOS alone treatments, the 5:1 XOS:FA diet resulted in increased 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl activity and higher ratios of Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus to Escherichia coli ( P &lt; 0.05), while not increasing the number of probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus .

    "abstract": "Cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) involves replacing an egg’s nucleus with the nucleus of an adult cell (or that derived from an embryo or foetus) to be cloned, and then activating the egg’s further development without fertilisation.Provided that unhealthy clones would be detected at veterinary inspection and quality controls and thus be prevented from entering the food chain, the currently available data indicate that food products from clones of cattle and pigs and their progeny are as safe as food products of livestock derived by conventional breeding. None of the available studies have identified any differences outside the normal variability in the composition of meat (cattle and swine) and milk (cattle) between clones or clone progeny, and their comparators. After years of study and analysis it has been concluded that meat and milk from clones of cattle, swine and goats and the offspring of clones from species traditionally consumed as food, are as safe to eat as food from conventionally bred animals. Doubts have been expressed whether the current situation regarding the welfare and health of animal clones is ethically justified by the existing arguments in support of cloning for food.",

The world production in the crop year 2006/2007 is estimated at 1.8 million tons of table olives and in the last fifteen years it has constantly increased. Most of the Slovenian Istria table olive production is based on a modification of the Spanish style. Results of qualitative and quantitative sensory assessments of two olive cultivars, ‘Storta’ and ‘Istrska belica’, are presented. Sensory characteristics were determined after four and six months of fermentation. Texture differences between the two production systems were revealed. Significant decrease in hardness was determined after six months of fermentation with initial alkaline treatment. The effect of cultivar type was also evident. After four and six months, the bitterness of table olives produced by the traditional technology decreased and the olives were appropriate for consumption.",

The present investigation studies 14 varieties of recently picked beans that were grown in Mexico. The beans were classified by size using K-means multivariate analysis, and three fractions were obtained for each variety: large (L), medium (M) and small (S). These fractions were evaluated for hardness, water absorption rate and total water absorption. It was found that the small bean fraction of the varieties studied had the lowest hardness values in comparison to the medium and large fractions. This same behaviour was observed for the water absorption rate and total water absorption; the smaller beans absorbed water more quickly and had greater total water absorption than the other fractions. One kind of bean (Pinto Villa) proved to be much harder than the other varieties. The total water absorption increased and hardness decreased for beans with greater ash content, but no correlation was found between these two properties (water absorption and hardness) for protein and fiber content.",

Nowadays, new technologies such as genetic-, metabolic engineering and genomics approaches allow further improvement of plants. The nutritional quality of a crop is not only dependent on its energy supply in the form of sugars/starch, but also on the amino acid composition of its storage proteins. Potato, the most important non-cereal food crop, is deficient in the sulphur containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine. The manipulation of the targeted amino acid biosynthesis can be a way to circumvent this problem. Cysteine is synthesised from O -acetyl-L-serine formed by serine acetyltransferase (SAT). The main results and some unpublished ones are summarised here. They present the key role of SAT enzyme in the biosynthesis of cysteine and the biotechnological approaches of nutritive value improvement through elevation of cysteine content.",

ESR signal at g=2.002 was more prominent in seed coat than the cotyledon. Application of ionising radiation (gamma and electron beam, 10 kGy) resulted in enhancement of signal at g=2.002 accompanied by a weak triplet (a H =3mT) in seed coat, which can be used as a suitable method of detection of irradiation. Some of the commonly employed food processing methods also generated free radicals (at g=2.002) more or less comparable to irradiation.

In this study, the effect of various sulphur dioxide levels was monitored in presence of the lees to determine which dose is appropriate to provide the protection of susceptible white wine against oxidation. Without SO 2 protection, the rH and redox potential changed slightly, so the level of dissolved oxygen seemed to be controlled during the ageing period by the lees, though the antioxidant effect of lees in itself was not appropriate to protect the polyphenol content from chemical oxidation, which led to considerable browning. With the addition of a lower amount of SO 2 — 40 mg l 2 , the lees is already able to protect the white wine samples in all aspects.",

A new branch has been created on the borderline of food and pharmaceutical industries. It is a general tendency that the policy and regulation towards the products of this branch are lagging far behind the practice. This is an especially important problem with adolescents. To work out an efficient regulatory framework, we have to have an adequate picture on consumer behaviour and attitudes towards these products. Based on literature analysis of two focus group interviews, we have developed a motivational model on usage of DS, which has been tasted during a direct-question survey involving more than 500 respondents. Our results have proven that the consumption of DS is proliferated among young recreational athletes. One quarter of them consumes proteins, one tenth L-carnitine at least 2–3 times a week. The most important motivational factor is the improvement of sport performance. The level of confidence in these products is considerably influenced by peers and trainers. The propensity to underestimate the potentially adverse consequences of these products is high.",

Beside good growth in milk with numbers as high as 8 log CFU ml –1 , certain enterococci and lactobacilli also reduced pH below 5.0 and showed proteolytic activity. In antistaphylococcal testing, only pure strains of enterococci and lactobacilli were moderately antagonistic, but not in coagulated milks and coagulated milk extracts.

    "abstract": "The enrichment of bread with wheat bran as a source of dietary fibre seems to be necessary for human health, because bread is the most consumed commodity in many countries. However, wheat bran has some adverse effects on the bread quality during storage. The aim of this study was to produce barbari bread with increased nutritional value and improved texture by the addition of coated wheat bran (0.67 and 1.34% based on flour stearic acid or St 1, 2 and beeswax or Bw 1, 2 ). Bread made from uncoated wheat bran was used as control. The least crust to crumb ratio was seen for control and Bw 1 . Water activity and moisture content results showed that the crumb of Bw 1 and control had the better moisture retention during storage. Textural properties of samples showed that there were no significant differences in the hardness of the samples (P&gt;0.05). However, the least increase in hardness during storage was observed for stearic acid coated samples. Other texture profile analysis parameters, such as cohesiveness and springiness, showed that Bw 1 and Bw 2 samples had no significant changes during storage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the least enthalpy for Bw1 after baking (385.21 J g –1 ) and during storage (567.62 J g –1 ). Accordingly, results showed that beeswax, especially at 0.67% (based on flour), is the best shell material for bran coating in order to improve bread texture and shelf life.",

During our experiments, microwave (MW) treatments of different powers (400–1600 W), pressures (1–5 bar), temperatures (120–180 °C), and treatment times (3–30 min) were applied to change the physical condition of vine-branch. After MW, enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) was used (85–100 h, 37 °C). In addition, beside MW, comparisons were made regarding various treatment methods: untreated (UTE), cooking plate (CP), and autoclave (AC), to determine to what extent they affect the final glucose yield. This yield can even further be increased by MW pre-treatment (50 W, 3–30 min, 40 °C) of the enzyme used during the hydrolysis, which reinforces the argument that enzyme activity can be increased by irradiation. A difference of 22.1% was detected among the glucose yield values in untreated and treated enzyme processes.",

    "abstract": "Acidic and enzymatic coagulation of milk are complex processes which proceed in several phases and are dependent upon many different parameters. The formation of coagulum during lactic-acid fermentation is in fact acidic coagulation of milk. It occurs because of an increase in concentration of lactic acid, which causes a decrease in pH. Enzymatic coagulation of milk has been analytically described by means of mathematical models by many authors. Although enzymatic and acidic coagulation of milk do not proceed according to identical physical and chemical rules, it is possible to compare them kinetically. The aim of this paper was to combine the kinetics of enzymatic and acidic coagulation of milk and to mathematically present the changes that develop during lactic-acid fermentation of milk. The models presented in this paper enable a more complex mathematical analysis of the coagulation of the protein content of milk during lactic-acid fermentation. Application of the models enables the analysis and comparison of the kinetics of coagulation in different types of milk and various types of fermented dairy products manufactured with lactic acid bacteria. Mathematical combination of coagulation kinetics of the protein complex in milk with reological characteristics of the obtained fermented dairy products enables easier defining of parameters for lactic acid fermentation.",

The pH values were found between 4.98-5.68. Also, high counts of total mesophilic bacteria and Lactobacilli were recorded throughout the ripening of the cheese. Low pH levels and high NaCl content after 30 days affected the growth of most microbial groups resulting in considerably lower counts at 3 months. Lactobacilli constituted the dominant microflora of the cheese. According to sensory evaluations, the cheese samples were more preferred with aging.

Gingerbreads absorbed higher amount of water (20–25 g/100 g on dry weight basis) at a w >0.70 in comparison to biscuits studied mainly due to higher content of sucrose and/or other simple saccharides. Monolayer moisture content evaluated by BET and GAB models were in general higher for the gingerbreads.

A non-negligible condition for applying the QUID equations is, in principle, the equality of the fat-free protein concentrations of the various tissue types in the raw meat materials. This needs an adjustment of the protein concentrations of the recipes to a reference value (PFFref), which can be achieved by effective or virtual addition of water to the formulation or ‘removal’ of water from it.

The results implied that BABA treatment at an effective concentration of 20 mM significantly inhibited gray mould rot caused by Botrytis cinerea in grape berries by inducing resistance. Accordingly, 20 mM BABA triggered a priming defence in grape suspension cells, since only the BABA-treated cells exhibited an accelerated ability for augmenting defence responses upon the pathogen inoculation. The primed cellular reactions were related to an early H 2 O 2 burst, prompt accumulation of stilbene phytoalexins and activation of PR genes. Thus, we assume that 20 mM BABA can induce resistance to B. cinerea infection in intact grape berries perhaps via intercellular priming defence. Moreover, the BABA-induced priming defence is verified, because no negative effects on cell growth, anthocyanin synthesis, and quality impairment in either grape cells or intact berries were observed under low pathogenic pressure.",

The clarification of the role of the above changes involved in the defence mechanism can significantly contribute to the breeding of plant varieties with natural resistance. Consequently, the amount of chemicals used in food production can be significantly reduced. In the present study some principal physiological parameters, such as the relative chlorophyll content of the host plant, the amount of photosynthetic pigments, changes in photosynthetic efficiency, and the activity of superoxide-dismutase (SOD) in addition to rate of lipid peroxidation (LP) were measured. The experiment was conducted in a humidity tent. Significant decrease in the relative chlorophyll content and in the amount of photosynthetic pigments was measured. At both sampling times, an increase was found in superoxide-dismutase enzyme activity and in rate of lipid peroxidation due to the bean rust infection. Notably, in several cases the differences were significant. The results indicate that the above parameters have important role in the bean-rust interaction, which should be taken into consideration in resistance breeding.",

Four different methods of wheat protein extraction were studied, with emphasis on the glutenin-rich fractions. The final quality of the protein fractions was evaluated in terms of denaturation, indirect yield, molecular weight, secondary structure, and thermal profile. Our results indicate that addition of dithiothreitol improves glutenin extraction without interfering with protein secondary structure and denaturation. Different thermal profiles were evidenced for different extraction methods, indicating the selectivity of the processes. Denaturation temperatures of the samples showed differences within about 3 °C, while denaturation enthalpies (ΔH) differed by about 14 kJ µg −1 . Data in this paper may provide a broader perspective on how wheat proteins are affected by the extraction method.",

Beside direct costs of treatment, indirect costs are also significant on the level of population. Among indirect costs, consumer well-being losses are difficult to be estimated. For this purpose, the willingness to pay (WTP) method is used most frequently that measures the cost an individual would undertake to avoid a certain harm. For the well-being loss estimation, the data of National Food Chain Safety Authority's annual consumer survey was used, in which 323 respondents gave evaluable answer to the open-ended WTP question. Results indicate that an average respondent would pay 18.6 EUR to avoid salmonellosis. Main factors affecting WTP were size of family and number of children. The numbers indicate that the consumer well-being loss could be about 1 786 060 EUR annually, resulting from the multiplication of the estimated number of annual salmonellosis cases and the average WTP value. It can be concluded that consumer well-being losses alone would call for further interventions in Salmonella eradication, not to mention other – more direct – cost elements.",

In vitro cell culture experiments were designed to detect the eﬀects of polysaccharides on cell growth and cellular glucose consumption. We extracted and analysed three polysaccharides from litchi seed. Monosaccharide composition and infrared spectroscopy detection showed that the skeleton structure of polysaccharides consisted of glucose and mannose. Polysaccharides 1 and 2 are similar and have relatively high glucose content (around 70%); polysaccharide 3 has 39.17% glucose only but is rich in arabinose (about 21.03%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Several misconceptions exist about foods and nutrition. Many believe, that the human body can “acidify”, thus, an “alkaline diet” should be followed. The acid-base balance is a characteristic of a normally functioning human body. Throughout our metabolic processes, acids and substances with acidic pH are produced continuously, which, in the case of a healthy person, does not affect the pH of the human body. In those rare cases, when an overall pH imbalance evolves in the human body due to its life-threatening nature, it requires urgent medical intervention. Furthermore, it cannot be influenced by dietary interventions. This paper highlights evidence regarding acidification and the acid-base balance, with special attention to certain food groups. Foodstuffs have different specific pH value (acid-base character), they can be acidic, alkaline, or neutral in elemental state. Beside their chemical nature, the effect they have on the human body depends on the mechanism of their metabolism, as well. Diet and ingredients have direct and indirect effects on the human body's intracellular and extracellular compartments (especially blood and urine), still they do not influence its pH significantly. Alkaline diets were born in the absence of evidence-based information and/or the misunderstanding and wrong interpretation of the available and up-to-date scientific facts. The convictions of consumers and the promotion of the alkaline diet lack the scientific basis, so it can be harmful or even dangerous in the long run. In summary, scientific evidence on the efficacy or prophylactic effects of an alkaline diet is not available.",

Physical activity level decreased (63.8%), sleep (60.9%) and screen (5.64 ± 3.05 h/day) times and food intake (39.8%) increased. 80.6% of parents reported changes in children's diet: increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (32.4%), breakfast (15.5%), water and sugar-free beverages (17.6%), snacks (40.4%), sugary drinks (9.9%) was observed. Body weight increased in 44.4% of children. The results of the survey conducted under GYERE®-Children's Health Program are in line with the international literature findings: body weight change during the quarantine is significantly associated with food intake, snacking, sugary drinks, and we also found association with fruit and vegetable consumption and lack of breakfast. Effective strategies and electronic health interventions are needed to prevent sedentary lifestyle and obesity during lockdown.",

A careful investigation and optimisation revealed that peach peel when hydrolysed with 1.50% (w/w) of SRA containing enzyme formulation at 40 °C and 6.1 pH, for 35 min significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) increased the extraction yield, levels of polyphenol contents (242.89 ± 1.56 mg gallic acid equivalents – GAE), and coumaric, chlorogenic, ferulic acids or their conjugate esters in extracts. Moreover, the extracts produced through SRA-assisted extraction exhibited ample level of free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH IC 50 2.67 ± 0.03 μg mL −1 ), Trolox equivalent (TE) antioxidant capacity (450.52 ± 24.58 µmol of TE g −1 ), inhibition of peroxides in linoleic acid (85.68 ± 0.21%), and ferric reducing power of 3.11 ± 0.20 ppm gallic acid equivalents. The results suggested that the incorporation of SRA containing enzyme formulation may enhance the recovery of peach peel polyphenols while hydrolysing the glycosidic linkages without deteriorating their antioxidant character.",

Therefore, nutritional enrichment of this product is of great importance. In this study, a new functional product was developed by adding carob molasses pulp (CMP) flour obtained from carob fruit, which has unique nutritional and bioactive properties, to wafer cream, increasing its nutritional value and antioxidant activity. When 15% CMP flour was added to the wafer cream formulation, there was an increase of approximately 58.43 and 78.77%, respectively, in total polyphenol and antioxidant levels compared to the control group (without CMP flour). In addition, since the product developed is in cocoa colour, consumer preference has increased. It has been determined that phytochemical and nutritive components of the wafer cream increased as a result of the use of carob flour.",

The texture characteristics, total soluble solids (TSS), ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, relative conductivity, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities in banana peels were detected during storage. A linear model was made by principal component analysis and multiple linear regression between the banana browning area and characteristic indices. The results showed that the changes in the physiological characteristics of bananas were significantly different during different storage periods. The main factors that affected the banana browning area were relative conductivity, PAL, TSS, and MDA, indicating that lipid peroxidation, respiration, and metabolism of phenylpropanoids had significant influence on the banana browning area during storage. Thus, it is feasible to predict banana quality based on changes in browning area, which could be a rapid and non-destructive detection of banana quality during storage.",

The aim of our study was to determine antioxidant properties of watery extracts of blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., bilberry, V. myrtillus L., and lingonberry, V. vitis-idaea L. that may have role in the redox homeostasis of the gastrointestinal region. Data show that these berries notably inhibit the lipid peroxidation, underpinned by reducing power, total polyphenol and ascorbic acid content.

Experiments were carried out in a dead-end ultrafiltration cell, and the changes in filtration parameters and the photocatalytic effects of the UV irradiated TiO2 modified membrane surface on the membrane fouling were examined. Our results showed that the water flux decreased with increasing TiO2 layer thickness, but the retention of turbidity and of COD increased. After separation, the membrane surface was cleaned by UV irradiation by means of photocatalytic oxidation. It was found that the original flux was recoverable, while the retention of the membrane decreased after cleaning.",

The bacterial growth results from interactions when subjected to various temperatures, pH levels, and NaCl concentrations were examined by measurements and predictive modelling. Good correlation across the range of growth conditions was shown among observed and predicted growth values, having similar trends and minimal deflections for pH levels 5.0 and 6.0. The growth condition in the 8% NaCl concentration (pH 7.0, temperature 4 °C) resulted with a growth curve of 1 log interval greater than the fitted curve for all the measurements. In all of the cases, there were consistent increases in the rates and decreases in the lag time when the growth temperature increased. Higher incubation temperatures provided higher growth rates as 30 °C and 35 °C yielded double increase of the fitted rate. Fitted and measured growth rates for salinity conditions were significantly different (P&lt;0.05). Comparison of doubling times showed good compatibility, particularly at lower temperatures. Critical use of a model is suggested, although it may enable microbiologists to limit the need of challenge tests and to make rapid and realistic prediction of the growth of L. monocytogenes under conditions relevant to a range of aquatic and other products examined.",

The silicate minerals were isolated with physical density separation method from two types of non-irradiated freeze-dried fish and shellfish that included Pacific saury ( Cololabis saira ), mackerel ( Scomber japonicus ), shrimp ( Penaeidae metapenaeus ), and mussel ( Mytilus coruscus ). Radiation-specific thermoluminescence (TL) peaks (glow curve 1) were observed between 150–250 °C. The peaks are typical for the irradiated food; despite the samples being not irradiated. Apparently it showed that the isolated minerals were contaminated with organic materials such as bone, etc. Acid-hydrolysis digestion was employed to remove the possible contaminants. The minerals obtained through alternative pre-treatment showed no TL curves in radiation specific temperature range. Moreover, acid hydrolysis extraction resulted in producing higher mineral yields and lower background luminescence. Results were also confirmed by calculating TL ratios (glow curve 1/glow curve 2) to confirm the irradiation history of samples. Furthermore, different time and temperature treatments on TL intensity of irradiated standard quartz (SiO 2 ) minerals showed that the acid-hydrolysis can be adjusted to 50 °C and 3 h for better luminescence determinations.",

Samples were collected before and after heat treatment and characterization of their rheological properties was carried out. The rheological behaviour was obtained at 25 °C, with shear rate ranging from 108 to 500 s−1 (upward curve) and from 500 to 108 s−1 (downward curve) for 1 min with 25 readings for each curve. The Ostwald de Waele model showed to be a good fit for all formulations studied, which showed a non-Newtonian behaviour and a pseudoplastic character. Results of apparent viscosity for the non-heated formulations were well fitted by the linear model and the heat treated formulations by the cubic model. The heat treated formulations had higher (P<0.05) values of consistency index and apparent viscosity, as well as lower (P<0.05) values of flow behaviour index compared to non-heated formulations. The rheological characterization of these formulations is a very useful tool during product development and processing control of mixed nectars of fruit juice.",

According to our survey, the non-appropriate usage and management of knowledge and skills that would be ‘condition sine qua non’ for wine making might be behind that. However, the use and spread of skills is a basic component in explaining the differences among companies, it is not unambiguous in formulating the business success measured by different indicators. At the same time we can conclude that the Hungarian wine enterprises — keeping the idea of generation, as well as its further development, elaboration, and adequate usage within the frame of the company — can achieve market success.",

Applying this unique combination of a comprehensive database and network analysis methods, it is proven that the centrality of the food industry, determined on the basis of these indicators, is much higher than the average of other sectors of the national economies. This fact can be explained by the specific “bridge” role of the food industry between the different sectors of national economy.

Trunk cross-sectional area, main branches, and fruit yield were also determined. In general, 'Myrobalan 29C' rootstock produced fruit slightly larger in size and with a bigger weight. By contrast, apricots on 'Myrobalan 29C' had less firmness and a lower solid soluble concentration than on 'Real Fino'. There was little difference in the colour, acidity, and stone dry weights. Trees on 'Real Fino' had larger areas of trunk and branches but no significant differences were obtained in relation to fruit yields.",

Irrigation did not decrease the dry matter content and the summed concentration of the three measured sugars. Glucose accumulation was not influenced either by irrigation or by year. Low amount of precipitation during the early growing period was detrimental for fructose accumulation. Irrigation enhanced sucrose concentration, presumably by ensuring better photosynthetic activity. However, dry and hot weather during the irrigation cut-off period in 2011 also resulted in increased sucrose accumulation, presumably as a stress effect. It was found that irrigation did not influence the ratio of the three investigated saccharides at all, and even the growing year had just a slight effect on that.",

Because the Bitter fruit ( Bt ) gene contributes to bitter taste but has no obvious effect on the growth and development of cucumber, so the NK-producing cucumber was constructed by replacing the Bt gene with NK by using CRISPR/Cas9. The pZHY988-Cas9-sgRNA and pX6-LHA-U6-NK-T-RHA vectors were constructed and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105, which was transformed into cucumber by floral dip method. The crude extract of NK-producing cucumber had significant thrombolytic activity in vitro . In addition, treatment with the crude extract significantly delayed thrombus tail appearance, and the thrombin time of mice was much longer than that of normal mice. The degrees of coagulation and blood viscosity as well as hemorheological properties improved significantly after crude extract treatment. These findings show that NK-producing cucumber can effectively alleviate thrombosis and improve blood biochemical parameters, providing a new direction for diet therapy against cardiovascular diseases.",

In this study, liquid egg whites (LEW) were separately concentrated by using reverse osmosis (RO) and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques. The first aim of this research was to determine the effects of the concentration pre-treatments on the physico-chemical quality criteria (pH, relative whipping capacity, foaming stability, water holding capacity-WHC, colour) and the rheological behaviour (viscosity, oscillation) of LEW samples. The second aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the membrane pre-treatment on meringue's functional quality attributes such as meringue batter density and meringue batter colour values ( L *, a *, b *). The average dry matter of LEW was increased from 12% to 23% by the concentration pre-treatment process (RO and UF), and water was removed from the LEW. In addition, the batter density of meringue cookie samples was 0.37 ± 0.01 g mL −1 in UF and RO. The differences between the pH and dry matter values of the ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis treated groups were found to be statistically similar, and it was observed that the elastic modulus (G′) increased with the increase in frequency in the rheological measurements. It has been determined that G′ is higher than G″ in all samples. An elastic/solid-like (G′ &gt; G″) structural behaviour was determined while increasing the frequency value. It was determined that the WHC of LEW treated with RO was higher than of the group treated with UF. The results of the study showed that while reducing transportation and storage costs, the water content of &gt;80% of LEW (raw material-the treated liquid egg white) removed by UF and RO applications can be suitable to produce meringue batter cookies (semi-finished product).",

Nevertheless, oxidation of fatty acids in olive oil provides short shelf-life and undesirable organoleptic properties. Thus, microencapsulation of olive oil is a considerable promising approach to maintain its quality and biological activities. The objective of this investigation was to prepare extra virgin olive oil microcapsule by sequential technologies, such as water emulsification of olive oil with wall material (matrix) and freeze drying of emulsion. The effect of wall material composition was examined to prepare microcapsule of extra virgin olive oil. Different ratios of wall materials such as maltodextrin (MD), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and gum arabic (GA) were used. Furthermore, effects of emulsification technologies, such as homogenisation with rotor–stator homogeniser (RSH) and cross-flow membrane emulsification (CFME) were investigated. The stability of emulsion was higher when emulsion was prepared by RSH; however, the droplet mean diameter (D 32 ) was lower in case of RSH compared to CFME. The highest encapsulation efficiency (EE) was found as 68.96 ± 2.6% when CFME was adopted and composition of wall materials was 15 g MD, 15 g GA, and 5 g CMC.",

However, uneven heating is one main problem of RF heating technology that has to be solved. Due to the unclear heating mechanism and the difficulty to measure the three-dimensional temperature distribution in the heated object, computer-aided analysis method was adopted. Based on the RF heating numerical calculation model after experimental verification and the characteristics of polyetherimide (PEI) assisted RF heating of peanut butter (PB), this study proposed an improved method for an existing protocol. Meanwhile, parameters of the new protocol were optimised by the Multi-objective Global Optimisation (MGO) of its surrogate model. Results demonstrated that the best size of PEI block in the new protocol was Φ100 × 9.5 mm and the positional height was 12 mm. When the pasteurisation temperature Tp was set to 70 °C and the control temperature Tc was set to 75 °C, the temperature uniformity evaluation indices, Over-shoot Temperature Control Index (OTCI) and Targeted Penetration Depth (TPD), were 0.920% and 3.975 mm, respectively. Compared with 4.845% and 4.940 mm before improvement, the new protocol achieved significant optimisation and improved the temperature uniformity effectively. This also proved the feasibility of MGO method of surrogate model in relevant studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from artisanal cheeses and evaluate their probiotic potential and antibiotic susceptibility under in vitro conditions. Cheeses obtained at different maturation times were analysed for moisture and lipid contents, as well as for the presence of various microorganisms, including coagulase positive staphylococci, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli , Listeria monocytogenes , filamentous fungi, yeasts, total mesophilic bacteria, and LAB. After identification, the selected LAB were subjected to human gastrointestinal tract (HGT) conditions to evaluate their survival rates. Of the 18 Lactobacillus strains isolated, 11 survived the HGT test and presented γ-haemolysis. No resistance was observed against antibiotics. Lactobacillus fermentum C1a, C1b, C1c, and C1f, as well as Lactobacillus paracasei C1d, C1e, and C1g, were identified as potential starter cultures for the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional quality of homemade beef sausages by examining the amino acid, biogenic amine, and fatty acid composition. The most abundant amino acids were Ala (15.56%), Leu (13.28%), Gly (8.64%), Pro (8.41%), Ser (8.26%), and Val (7.65%). The essential amino acids accounted for 44.30% of total amino acids. Apart from the protein building amino acids, the free amino acid content was relatively high, accounting for 10% of total amino acid content. The average biogenic amine concentration in the sausage samples was low (1.69 mg kg −1 ). Saturated fatty acids accounted for 59.10% of total fatty acids, followed by monounsaturated (38.63%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (2.27%). The fatty acid profile was dominated by oleic (C18:1, 34.37%) and palmitic (C16:0, 30.24%) acids, and short-chain fatty acids were also present, which may have a positive impact on gut health. The results show that beef sausages have a high nutritional value and are a good source of essential amino acids, free amino acids, and fatty acids that are important for human health.",

The optimal extraction conditions resulted in a yield of 10.70% for the crude TPS. The purified TPS exhibited unique physicochemical properties and structural characteristics. It was identified as an acidic polysaccharide with trace binding proteins, with a →4)-α-D-Galp-(1→) residue. The purified TPS had a dense and uneven appearance, potential crystallisation characteristics, and structural stability. Importantly, it demonstrated the ability to inhibit glucose transport in Caco-2 cells by down-regulating the expression of sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), leading to a hypoglycemic effect. These findings highlight the potential of TPS from Liubao tea as a functional food or additive with hypoglycaemic properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synthesis of nanoparticles can be long and costly processes using physical and chemical methods. Biological synthesis of nanoparticles is known to be cheaper and easier than other methods. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) were obtained by biological synthesis, also known as green synthesis, using Sorghum bicolor var. technicum (Körn) Stapf ex Holland seed extract, popularly known as sorghum. AgNPs were characterised by SEM, EDS, TEM, FT-IR, and UV-Vis Spectroscopy. SEM images confirmed that the shape of AgNPs was spherical. TEM analysis showed that the average sizes of AgNPs ranged from 51 to 56 nm. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of AgNPs by detecting a silver ion peak at 3 KeV. UV-Vis spectroscopy analyses indicated that the brown-burgundy colour of AgNPs exhibited maximum absorbance at 450 nm. The biological activities of the extract and AgNPs were investigated through antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, mutagenic, and DNA cleavage activity analyses. The extract exhibited the highest MIC value against Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (0.62 μg mL −1 ), whereas AgNPs demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity specifically against Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (0.31 μg mL −1 ). The antibiofilm results revealed that the extract displayed the highest percentage of biofilm inhibition against B. subtilis , while AgNPs exhibited notable efficacy against both Candida albicans yeast and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium. The antioxidant activities were evaluated using DPPH • and ABTS •+ methods, and it was determined that both samples had high antioxidant activity. Mutagenicity of the extract and AgNPs were evaluated by the Ames/ Salmonella test using two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98 and TA100). The mutagenic activity of the extract increased depending on the concentration for both strains, while AgNP did not show mutagenicity at any concentration. The agarose gel electrophoresis method showed that the extract and AgNPs cleaved DNA in the presence of an oxidising agent.",

However, out of class grade tubers could be marketed in dried, grounded form as sweet potato flour. The aim of this study was to characterise some important nutritional properties of flours of three sweet potato genotypes with different tuber colours (white, purple, and orange) and to investigate how this raw material affects the rheological properties of sweet potato-wheat flour blends. Dietary fibres are present in sweet potatoes in a significant proportion, orange coloured flour showed the highest values. The main free sugars were sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but sucrose was the dominant one. Antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content also varied considerably, the purple flour had the highest values. Mineral composition showed significant variability, the purple flour contained the highest level of minerals. It was confirmed that adding sweet potato flour to wheat flour affected its rheological properties, however in a varied manner. For the orange flour these properties have lightly decreased, though it had no significant effect on dough quality, while the white and purple flours with a dosage of 5, 10 and 15% could improve the dough behaviour. Thus, sweet potato in this form is a valuable raw material.",

In this experiment, eight different non- Saccharomyces strains and Saccharomyces cerevisiae co-fermentation, their aroma composition, and basic physicochemical parameters were investigated. More than 30 compounds with favourable impact were discovered using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Co-fermentation of non- Saccharomyces spp. and S. cerevisiae can affect the concentration of volatile compounds, so that the mead presents different aroma characteristics. Co-fermented meads of Wickerhamomyces anomalus strains and S. cerevisiae (Wa 27-Sc and Wa 5-Sc) had higher alcohol, acids, aldehyde, and ester concentrations than those fermented with S. cerevisiae alone. In terms of taste, Wa 27-Sc was superior to Wa 5-Sc. Overall, the Wa 27-Sc received the highest score for its strong secondary aroma and good mouthfeel. The results show that the W. anomalus Wa 27 strain has a good potential to produce high quality mead.",

The breaking force (N) was determined by compression or Back extrusion tests with an Instron texture tester. Electronmicroscopic studies (SEM) were made to support the interpretation of the results.For each vegetable several sections of changes of the breaking force (lnF) were identified. For potatoes a three phase change of the breaking force by all temperatures (85 °C, 95 °C, 100 °C) was observed. In the first of the 3 different observed stages of potato blanching the breaking forces increased with time (0–40 s). In the second and third stage of the blanching process of potato a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the breaking force and the blanching time. The second phase observed was faster (40–160 s) than the consecutive slower third phase (160–240 s).For green peas the change of the breaking force (lnF) can be described by two consecutive first rate reactions. A faster decreasing period between 0–25 s was followed by a slower decreasing one between 70–140 s. Between the first and second stage of the blanching process there was an initial lag period (25–70 s), which will not be described here. In the period after 140 s, there was not any change, this period is constant.For carrots the fastest change can be observed at 100 °C compared to the results at 85 and 95 °C. A three-phase curve was observed as well. An initial lag period (0–90 s) was followed by a faster (90–190 s) and a slower (190–240 s) decreasing one. In the second and third stage of the blanching process of carrots a linear relationship was found. For the changes of the breaking force (lnF) a kinetical approach was applied, reaction rate constants and apparent activation energies were calculated. The kinetical approach helps to compare and forecast changes at different process conditions.",

To build such systems we prepared complex sterile solution containing sodium-alginate, yeast cells, their additives and various amount of glucose (100-400 g l -1 ). These solutions were dropped in Ca-chloride precipitating solutions. The gel beads were suspended directly in oleic acid. The glucose was uptaken by yeast cells quantitatively during 24-72 h. The uptake rate of glucose is dependent on the concentration of glucose. It was similar to the free cell fermentation: in cases of higher concentrations of glucose the glucose uptake in the second period was stopped. In accordance with changes of the concentration of glucose the concentration of ethanol increased rapidly in the first day of fermentation and thereafter slowed down. We supposed that by co-immobilization of lipase in the same gel particles the inhibitory effect of produced ethanol would be solved. Using of lipase we can transform ethanol to ethyl-oleate, which is soluble in oleic acid. According to our data, at least 4 U ml -1 lipase is needed to increase ethanol production significantly Summarising we can conclude that in our system the maximum ethanol production can be achieved using 100 g l -1 glucose and 4 U ml -1 lipase for 48 h. In this system 50 g l -1 ethanol can be produced by 48 h fermentation and practically a steady state concentration of ethanol is maintained after it.",

This paper reports on the continuous wave nuclear magnetic resonance (CW-NMR) technique applied for determining fat content in fresh meat. The interfering moisture content in meat was removed by microwave drying and the dried residue was transferred quantitatively into the NMR-tubes. The total analysis time was about 35 min. Experiments were performed with pork (with a fat content from 1.7% to 21%), beef (with a fat content from 1.0% to 16.1%), lard (rendered pork fat) and tallow (rendered beef fat) samples and with their combinations: lard-tallow, lard-lean pork, tallow-lean beef and lard-tallow-lean beef-lean pork. The regression (prediction) equations (NMR-signal vs. fat content determined with the Soxhlet reference method) of pork and beef did not differ significantly. However, there was a noticeable difference between the regression lines of pure lard and pure tallow. Moreover, the latter ones differed from the regression equations of pork, beef and of the various meat-fat combinations. The variability of the fatty acid composition of the fat also seems to influence the stability of the calibration curves, because the sensitivity of the CW-NMR signal to the fatty acid composition interferes with the quantitative determination of fat content in meat.",

The interfering moisture content of meat was removed by microwave drying and the dried residue was quantitatively transferred into the P-NMR tubes. The total analysis time was about 50 min.

The regression (prediction) equations (intensity of P-NMR signal vs. fat content determined with the Soxhlet reference method) of the sunflower oil and fat samples did not differ appreciably. Consequently, contrary to the results obtained with the CW-NMR technique, the variability of the fatty acid composition of the examined fats and oil had no substantial effect on the regression (prediction) equations in this case. On the other hand, there was a considerable difference between the regression lines of the lean pork-fat and lean beef-tallow mixtures. Therefore, due to the interfering effect of the non-fat dry matter and the type of meat on the intensity of P-NMR signal, this technique can only have a restricted practical application in the in-line process control of fat content of meats.",

A total of 162 samples were analysed at different stages of the elaboration process. These were grouped in eighteen lots, three for each type of dry-sausages. Throughout the ripening process a decrease in some microbe groups (enterobacteria, coliforms, E. coli) occurred in all cases. Yeasts and enterococci remained the same or even increased in number. We have also confirmed the presence of Salmonella, sulphite-reducing clostridia and Listeria in some samples of unripened product. Consequently, an improvement could be desirable in the hygienic quality of the raw material of dry-sausages.

The diabetics were mainly overweight or obese and educated at lower levels. People with higher BMI (Body Mass Index) have eaten less frequently than people in the normal BMI range. The daily food frequency of diabetics was higher only on weekends and holidays. There were only minimal differences concerning food choices as well. The differences in the diet proved smaller than expected and recommended. The time spent with physical activity was low in general, especially among diabetics. The self-judgement showed that only 49% of diabetics kept their eating habit as healthy, vs. 63% of non-diabetics. The food choices were also modified by the economic situations of patients. It was observed that the majority of elderly diabetics did not pay enough attention to correct diabetic diet, therefore, they should be controlled more effectively by primary care staff.",

We observed that fatty acids prominent in the culture medium were diminished to a much greater extent than fatty acids contained in the medium in marginal amounts. The supplemented fatty acids were incorporated into the cells regardless of the type of fatty acid added. Beyond that, fatty acids from the n3 and the n6 family were metabolized, resulting in an increase of their desaturation and elongation products. The supplementation of the culture medium with a special fatty acid did not affect the incorporation rates of the remaining fatty acids contained in the culture medium. Thus, an increased supply of unsaturated fatty acids is not sufficient to lessen the uptake of saturated fatty acids by cells.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of some food additives used in foods on cold tolerance of Clostridium perfringens at pH close to neutral.Maximal concentrations recommended for foods of sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, sodium nitrite, monosodium glutamate, or mixtures of those were added to cultures and their effects on C. perfringens tolerance to 10 °C were evaluated. The effect of a previous shock at 28 °C was also determined. Growth of C. perfringens was not inhibited by the substances examined. Sodium nitrite, applied at maximal permitted concentrations, increased C. perfringens survival at 10 °C. Mixtures of GRAS compounds had either no clear effect, or increased tolerance to 10 °C. A pre-shock (28 °C) of the cultures treated with sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or monosodium glutamate increased survival and stimulated growth of the cultures treated at 10 °C.We conclude that the addition of these compounds including sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, sodium nitrite and monosodium glutamate to cultures of C. perfringens can influence their cold tolerance. In some cases, the substances that would normally eliminate microorganisms at lower pH, can increase tolerance of this bacterium, permitting survival at low temperatures.",

CD34 positivity is regarded as stem cell (SC) or endothelial progenitor cell (EP) marker. According to literature natural substances could increase the release of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells. In this study we investigated the basic rate of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood of CBA/Ca (H-2k haplotype) and BALB/c inbred mice by flow cytometry. Then we treated the mice with a new mixture of medical herbs, and we measured the level of CD34+ cells at 1, 3, 6, 18 and 24 hours after the treatment. A biological rhythm in the untreated blood was detected. Moreover the used herbal compounds increased the number of CD34+ cells.Although SC number is individually and highly variable in peripheral blood, the fluctuation could be used as a biomarker like the other compounds of peripheral blood in different aspects in risk assessment.",

The aim of the industry is either to eliminate the presence of outer crust, or decrease its occurrence. The thickness of outer crust can be estimated by non-destructive ultrasound technique. As the propagation time and attenuation of ultrasonic waves vary in the materials with different water content, the thickness of outer crust and the normal texture, respectively, can be estimated on the basis of these characteristics. The propagation and attenuation values are typical for the given layers. Thus, by measuring total attenuation and total width of the product, the thickness of outer crust can be calculated by means of the velocity and attenuation coefficients of ultrasonic waves. Results of this non-destructive measurement may support the proper adjustment of ripening and storage parameters such as temperature and humidity.",

To identify the presence of the four allergenic protein-coding genes two primer pairs were chosen. The presence of these allergens in most apple varieties could be confirmed. According to our results two varieties — Jonathan and Granny Smith — were found to contain the lowest amount of the coding genes of the allergenic apple proteins studied by us. Besides this, polymorph pattern was obtained by the use of Mal d 1 primer, which may lead to determine apple varieties with small amount of Mal d 1 allergens.The confirmation study of the presence of potential apple allergens by RNA and protein techniques is our plan in the near future.",

Aseptically collected grape samples were processed by enrichment in a nutritive basal medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) methanol followed by isolation of yeast strains. Sixteen of the 18 grape samples yielded Saccharomyces strain(s). More than 70% of the isolates belonged to the genus Saccharomyces. Based on phenotype and electrophoretic karyotyping, all strains of Saccharomyces were identified as S. cerevisiae. For several grape samples, varying physiological characters, the number of spores per asci, and the observed chromosome length polymorphisms provided evidence for diversity of S. cerevisiae strains obtained by this enrichment in methanol-containing broth. Results indicated that enrichment in methanol-containing broth is an effective alternative method to facilitate isolation of Saccharomyces strains from grapes. The enrichment method described in this work provides a simple and effective tool for isolation of Saccharomyces strains from grapes. The method may be applied in studying wine fermentation ecology, as well as for the isolation of potential starter strains from grapes.",

Relatively high (9% flaxseed oil) substitution decreased this ratio to the optimum (∼4). This modified FA profile was preserved during 32 storage days. Oil addition influenced fresh surface colour: lightness (L*) increased, redness (a*) decreased in parallel with the increasing oil addition, while only soybean oil increased yellowness (b*). Storage altered the colour slightly. The texture was not systematically altered by oil substitution, while during storage in a vapour permeable casing hardness increased. Considering organoleptic properties, soybean oil improved the extent of spiciness, while the general consumer acceptance was the most favourable (within complemented samples) by 3% flaxseed oil. Increasing vegetable oil levels intensified the taste of spice mixture.",

Mixed culture fermentations with four lactic acid bacteria (Lb. bulgaricus, Lb. paracasei SF1, Lb. plantarum 2142, and Lb. casei Shirota) and four yeast strains (S. cerevisiae W66, S. cerevisiae WS34/70, S. cerevisiae W120, and S. carlsbergensis 843) were performed in wort with initial cell ratio of 1:1. It was determined that during fermentations, cell concentration of lactic acid bacteria exceeded that of yeasts by one order of magnitude. Three strain combinations (S. carlsbergensis with Lb. bulgaricus, Lb. 2142, and Lb. Shirota) were chosen for further fermentations. Basic behaviour of them in wort was studied in mono culture, which helped to determine interaction type between bacteria and yeast in mixed culture. It resulted in higher Lactobacillus cell concentration in mono cultural than in mixed culture fermentation, which refers to competition. Cell ratio was changed to 1:10 (lactobacilli:yeasts), to favour growth of yeast and avoid lower pH. Despite the higher initial concentration of yeast, results turned in favour of lactobacillus already at the 24th hour.",

Two ways of inoculation were applied with Lactobacillus plantarum. The addition of Rohament-PL, even at 150 mg kg-1 concentration, simultaneous inoculation with Lactobacillusplantarum (circumstances: 28 °C, 80 r.p.m. shaking) promoted the growth of lactobacilli. By 42 h fermentation time LAB count increased up to 3.2-4.8´109 cm-3. Furthermore the surface colour of the samples was more intensive (higher L-, a- and b-values) than without Lactobacillus plantarum inoculation.

Using API 50CHL and APILAB PLUS software, the species Lactobacillus curvatus was isolated and identified during the second week of the brining process. In the latter phase of the fermentation process, the presence of microorganisms belonging to this genus was not identified, which proves that spontaneous lactic fermentation in the process of preserving green olives of the Oblica cultivar had been incomplete. This was also proved by the values of fundamental physico-chemical features (low pH, high total acidity concentration, inadequate temperature). Presented results show the necessity of applying starter culture in the process of preserving green olives of the Oblica cultivar.",

A cross-sectional survey was distributed to all primary schools (n=18) in Óbuda, Budapest. A total of 3714 students (1860 boys, 1854 girls; age range: 7–15 years) were involved. Height, weight and waist circumference (WC) were measured. Data about obesity-related dietary habits (breakfast skipping, fruit and vegetable intake, number of meals, soft drinks consumption) were collected via self-administered questionnaire. One-fifth (21.3%) of the participants were regularly skipping breakfast. Frequency of regular breakfast decreased with age. Breakfast skipping was predictive for higher body mass index (BMI) and WC in a model that was adjusted for age, gender and all studied nutritional factors. Confirming these results, both BMI (19.3±4.0 vs. 18.1±3.7 kg m −2 ; P<0.001) and WC (67.3±12.0 vs. 63.9±10.8 cm; P<0.001) were higher among breakfast skippers than in breakfast eaters. Odds ratios for breakfast skipping for being obese or abdominal obese were 1.59 (95%CI: 1.12–2.26) and 2.04 (95%CI: 1.57–2.65), respectively. Although prospective studies are needed to verify the causality between breakfast skipping and obesity, our findings support the importance of promoting regular breakfast consumption among school children.",

Spectrophotometric analysis of the globin and the extracted heme group was performed utilizing the Soret band. The influence of the type of final processing of the globins (freeze drying, gel) on the solubility, the emulsification capacity, the emulsifying activity index and the stability of the emulsion was studied at pH 5, 6 and 7. No behavioural differences between freeze-dried and gel globin forms were observed. The best performance for most of the functional properties was achieved at pH 5.0 for the globin obtained by this method.",

IgE binding to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) was ruled out through the use of CCD inhibitor, but non-specific binding of the secondary antibody remained an issue. IgE binding activity of a purified, immunoblot positive protein (band at 40 kDa), and non-specific binding of the secondary antibody to the same protein, was demonstrated with an Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) based immunosensor.

Other Mangalitza specific sequences suitable for the same purpose are also in use (V. Stéger , personal communication). Approaches like real-time monitoring of accumulation of the specific DNA product usually require specialised laboratory equipment. For Mangalitza detection, portable Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) approach has been developed ( Szántó-Egész et al., 2016), which requires a device capable of maintaining 39 °C and a lateral flow strip with easy yes/no indication of the successful amplification.

Eye formation, which is a characteristic feature of Mihaliç cheese, was seen in all cheese samples. Propionic and lactic acids were the most abundant organic acids detected in the cheeses. The most abundant saturated fatty acid was palmitic acid, followed by myristic and stearic acids. Oleic acid content was the highest among total unsaturated fatty acids. The control cheese had lower levels of short-chain fatty acids, which contribute directly to the cheese flavour.",

Human milk (36 samples) were obtained from 13 lactating women, while 12 samples of infant formula and 14 samples of follow-up milk were obtained from the Croatian market and opened prior to analysis. Human breast milk samples showed a much higher diversity than both infant formulae and follow-up milks. These results suggest that breast-fed infants are exposed to a broader sensory experience, while formula fed infants are exposed to less diverse taste. Future studies will probably answer how this influences later food choice, taste preferences, and consequently, risk of obesity and other chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, statistical analysis was performed to investigate the influence of operational parameters based on experimental results. The research aimed to know whether a long-term discontinuous module vibration operation is possible without adversely affecting filtration efficiency. Polymer membranes were compared by surface characteristics with contact angle measurements and selected for further membrane filtration experiments for dairy wastewater treatment. The effect of the main operational parameters, membrane module vibration amplitude ( A vibr . ) and transmembrane pressure ( TMP ), was investigated using a vibratory shear enhanced processing ( VSEP ) module with ultrafiltration ( UF ) and nanofiltration ( NF ) membranes. Components of the permeates, including chemical oxygen demand ( COD ), were measured, and membrane rejections were calculated to compare with threshold limit values. The results suggest that proper combination of A vibr . and TMP could mitigate membrane fouling. However, discontinuous module vibration resulted in more clogged membrane with lower fluxes, but slightly higher rejections. We conclude that investigating the significance of operational parameters is necessary for a wider, more energy and environment-friendly application in wastewater treatment.",

The potential of Testouri sheep cheeses was evaluated by an assessment of gross composition and proteolytic, antibacterial, antidiabetic and antioxidant activities during storage at 4 °C for 28 days. Results highlighted that no significant differences were observed in compositional parameters of the samples at day 0. Probiotic counts in cheeses remained at 8 log CFU g −1 during storage. Probiotic cheeses exhibited measurable antibacterial activities with the maximum value (diameter of 12 ± 0.07 mm) on Staphylococcus aureus strain. Also, α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitions ranged from 42 ± 0.77 to 58 ± 0.88% and 20 ± 0.9 to 47 ± 1.3%, respectively, during storage. Additionally, cheeses inoculated with probiotics exhibited significant increases in proteolytic and antioxidant activities compared to the control sample. Therefore, Testouri cheese can be considered a good carrier of probiotics and can be promoted for commercial uses.",

The scope of this study was to analyse the association between water footprint and healthiness based on dietary records. Furthermore, it was aimed to create a classification of integrative dietary indicators of sustainable nutrition. With these methodological aims, the dietary records of 25 healthy adults were assessed. The dietary quality scores and dietary water footprint were calculated and Spearman's rank correlation was tested between them. The indicator nutrients were classified based on their advantageous or disadvantageous health impact and association with water footprint. There was a significant positive correlation between the meat consumption and water footprint, while significant negative correlations were found between the dietary quality score and water footprint and dietary quality score and meat consumption ( P &lt; 0.05). Protein, energy, sodium, and saturated fatty acids as integrated indicator nutrients could be identified for both dietary quality and water footprint. The improvement in dietary quality could simultaneously decrease the dietary water footprint. The integration of environmental impact into the analysis of diets could be the future direction in the counseling practice of nutritionists.",

First, trypsin, pancreatin, and neutral protease were used to hydrolyse the intact shellfish. The hydrolysates with the greatest effects on osteoblast proliferation and ALP activity were separated and purified. Second, fraction WP2 was isolated and purified using a Sephadex G-25 column. WP2, which had the highest osteogenic activity, increased cell growth by 48.57 ± 0.05% and ALP activity by 6.27 ± 0.07 mU.

There is also evidence of changes in membrane viscosity/fluid. Temperature dependent changes can be observed in membranes. Low temperature (10°C, chilling) have a drastic effect on cellular structure. Mitochondria are swollen, and membranes are disorganized. Irradiation induced membrane permeability (electrolyte leakage), and free radicals were formed as a result of ionizing radiation. The changes noticed in the matrix and cristae of mitochondria occur mainly at radiation doses higher (5 kGy) than practical doses (upto 2.5 kGy). Calcium helped to prevent the increase in microviscosity in membranes, protected cells against free radicals and preserved the ultrastructure of cell compartments.",

Animals were fed with normal (group A) and fat rich diet (group B) for 10 days and then bile samples were collected by the cannulation of the common bile duct in deep anaesthesia. The circulation preserved colons of control rats were treated either with bile from the control or hyperlipidemic rats. The treatment was carried out for 30 minutes. The electronmicroscopic alterations of epithelial cells (both enterocytes and goblet cells) caused by bile from hyperlipidemic rats were significantly greater than that of controls. Unfavourable changes of the redox state of the colonic mucosa were also detected both in the hyperlipidemic and bile treated groups. A significant increase was observed in the free-SH concentration of the two bile treated groups against the untreated animals. The changes could be explained among others by the modified bile fatty acid composition. The present study supports that the alimentary modified bile can influence the structure of the epithelium of colonic mucosa and it can be one of the inducing factor of carcinogenesis.",

For the samples with pure NaCl the largest decrease of Ti was obtained for: a) egg yolk (from O0.59 to O20.77 °C), b) melange (from O0.59 to O8.74 °C), and c) egg white (from O0.50 to O7.37 °C). The results are compared and discussed with Chang-Tao model for prediction of Ti for meat.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a structural model of complex materials that are partly or entirely of cellular structure, and a new model of thermodynamics, which can be applied to the processes taking place in complex materials. Since the complex materials always contain cellular fraction, the supposition of cellular equilibrium is real. The complex materials are characterized by polyagent behaviour. Therefore, new concepts such as principal variables, redundancy, macroscopic/microscopic uncertainty are defined, moreover, the application of chemical thermodynamics is limited to micro processes only, and the free energy (F) and the free enthalpy (G) function cannot be generally applied to calculations concerning the bulk amount. Temperature as only a local intensive variable can be discussed. The first law of thermodynamics is expressed in the traditional way. The second law applied to the processes taking place both in open and in adiabatically closed systems is formulated as in words as an equation of stability, completed by the relations to first and second differential of entropy. In connection with the second law the Damköhler balance equation system, the Rabinowitsch–Mooney equation, and the application of dimensional analysis are presented. Only the apparent thermal capacities can be used for complex materials in general. The data of specific thermal capacity of complex materials in the proximity of absolute zero temperature are not sufficient for drawing conclusions on their entropy. The concept ‘shelf-life’ is essential in food science and practice, a Monte-Carlo method is presented for its calculation.",

This pilot study aimed to investigate the postprandial effect of GF-pasta, made by using the pasta-making process applied to artisan wheat pasta, on palatability, appetite sensation, and glucose metabolism in 8 healthy volunteers. Two iso-caloric lunch-meals consisting of: 1) gluten-free pasta (GFP) and 2) refined wheat pasta (RP) were compared in cross-over design. Both subjective appetite, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), and blood sample were taken before meal and at half-hour intervals for 4 hours. Palatability was evaluated immediately after the meal-test by VAS. All participants underwent pre- and postprandial energy expenditure (EE) measured by indirect calorimetry. We found that subjective palatability did not significantly differ between meals. Similarly, repeated measures ANOVA showed that GFP did not affect appetite ratings, postprandial glucose, and insulin responses compared to RP. Then, postprandial EE was affected by time (P=0.006), increasing at 60 min, but not by meals. In conclusion, artisanal GFP was as palatable as RP pasta, without affecting perceived satiety and postprandial glycaemia compared to RP in healthy subjects. Clearly, GFP results are preliminary and need to be investigated in larger studies.",

Controlling the functional properties of freeze-dried fruit after osmotic dehydration with aqueous solutions at water activity of a w =0.90 is presented. Decrease in the water adsorption index (WAI) was recorded for all dehydrated samples. The largest decrease (for pears and pineapples by 25 and 65%, respectively) was observed in osmoactive solutions containing trehalose. Considerable increase in the FAI was recorded in samples of dehydrated pineapple. In osmoactive trehalose solutions that increase hardly reached 46%, whereas in sorbitol and xylitol its value elevated to 39% and 13%, respectively. Regardless of the osmoactive sweetener applied prior to freeze-drying, an increase in specific surface area (S BET ) of dried materials was observed. For dehydrated pears, S BET ranged from 96 to 697 m 2 g −1 , and for pineapple, from 115 to 938 m 2 g −1 . Osmotic dehydration before lyophilisation of fruit samples weakened rehydration relative to the control. The dehydration carried out with osmoactive sweeteners, that is, sorbitol, xylitol, and trehalose, allows obtaining a product with good functional properties that can be successfully used for supplementation of dietary products, in particular for diabetics.",

Their shear stress, apparent viscosity, complex viscosity, storage modulus (G′), and loss modulus (G″) positively correlated with starch concentration. The loss factor (tan δ) of all LS pastes was less than 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents an analysis of the impact of blanching and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Cantonese bacon using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). The study aims to investigate how different processing techniques influence the composition of volatile compounds in meat products, thereby contributing to the understanding of flavour release patterns. The experiment involved dividing pork belly into six groups: conventional (C), heat treatment (H, 50 °C, 15 s), high-temperature treatment (S, 80 °C, 5 s), conventional treatment with GBE (CG, 0.5% GBE), heat composite treatment with GBE (HG, 50 °C, 15 s, 0.5% GBE), and high-temperature heat composite treatment with GBE (SG, 80 °C, 15 s, 0.5% GBE). The researchers identified a total of 36 compounds in the GC-IMS spectrum. The results showed that the ethanol content decreased in the H group samples after blanching treatment, while it increased in the S group samples. The CG, H, HG, and SG groups exhibited more significant changes compared to the C group. The H group had the highest number of VOCs among all the groups. Additionally, the flavour of the H, CG, and HG group products was notably enhanced. In conclusion, GC-IMS allows for real-time visual analysis of VOCs, and both blanching treatment and the addition of GBE significantly affect the composition of VOCs in the samples.",

The study aimed to determine the presence of nisin-resistant Staphylococcus , Enterococcus, and Listeria spp. in 157 raw milk and 125 cheese samples. As a result of the isolation procedure, a total of 282 bacterial strains were isolated. 83/282 strains showed resistance to 300 ppm nisin concentration and they were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. The two most common species were Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus . In both raw milk and cheese samples, nisin-resistant Listeria could not be detected. Generally, enterococci (59/65) showed higher biofilm formation ability than staphylococci (13/18). 38% (25/65) of enterococci and 88% (16/18) of staphylococci were determined to have protease activity in at least one of Skim Milk Agar, Casein Agar, or Milk Agar. In addition, the most common antibiotic resistance in nisin-resistant enterococci was against chloramphenicol. This study revealed that nisin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are present in raw milk and cheese. In addition, the presence of some virulence factors such as biofilm production, protease activity, and antibiotic resistance in resistant isolates needs to be drawn attention to. Consumption of nisin-resistant microorganisms with virulence factors through food is a food safety risk.",

The inhibitory effect and mechanism of DENA against CE were investigated through fluorescence chromatography, circular dichroism, and molecular docking. DENA inhibited CE activity (IC 50 = 1.08 ± 0.09 mg mL −1 ), characterised by a non-competitive inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, DENA induced a fluorescence quenching in CE, causing a blue shift in the λ max . This coincided with a transition in the secondary structure of CE from a layered to a helical structure by circular dichroism, indicating a significant reduction in its stability. Moreover, molecular docking confirmed that DENA binds to amino acid residues in the enzyme through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, leading to structural changes and reduced enzyme activity. These results suggest DENA has the potential to lower blood lipid levels by inhibiting CE activity.",

It is rich in steroidal saponins and possesses broad health benefits. In this study, the optimal extraction protocol of the total saponins from Chinese onion (ACS) was explored, and the content of the total steroidal saponins in ACS reached 56.62%. Network pharmacology was applied to predict the related signalling pathways and targets between the main phytochemicals in ACS and hypercholesterolaemia. Enrichment analysis showed that ACS might intervene hypercholesterolaemia through the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Meanwhile, cholesterol-lowering effects were verified by ACS intervention in high-cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia in Kunming mice. Compared with the model group, the TC and LDL-C levels of mice were decreased and the HDL-C level increased significantly after administration of ACS at a dose of 200 mg kg −1 day −1 . The body weight gain, liver index, and atherosclerosis index all decreased dramatically. ACS could significantly reduce the fat content in the liver and reduce the number of fat droplets from the haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of mouse liver. The immunohistochemical staining indicated that ACS could up-regulate the expression of PI3K protein in the liver, thus playing an anti-hypercholesterolaemic role. This study indicated that ACS exhibited significant therapeutic and preventive effects on hypercholesterolaemia, and exerted anti-hypercholesterolaemia through the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway.",

The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio significantly increased. The histopathological alterations were prevented by the AMFJ treatment. Compared to MS group, Bax and MAC387 values were significantly lower and Bcl-2 value was higher resulting in significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.001) Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in all AMFJ-treated groups.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ergosterol, as a precursor for synthesising useful molecules like vitamin D 2 , possesses significant physiological functions in both fungal and human systems. In fungi, ergosterol plays a crucial role in stress responses. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, the changes in specific ergosterol content of Kluyveromyces marxianus under various stress conditions are less known. This study investigated how ergosterol content changes in response to different stress factors. Carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio was examined using experimental design. The effects of aeration and shear force beside constant overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa) were examined. Cell growth and specific ergosterol content were investigated using ethanol stress during a two-stage fermentation. Based on the results, contradictory settings regarding C/N ratio and shear force were found to be favourable for cell growth and specific ergosterol content. However, increased aeration consistently elevated specific ergosterol content and favoured cell growth as well (2.5-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively). In K. marxianus fermentations, higher ergosterol yield can be achieved through a two-stage fermentation (138.9 mg L −1 compared to 52.9 mg L −1 ), where the first stage provides favourable conditions for cell growth, and the second stage involves stress (beneficial for ergosterol production) conditions. Conclusions drawn from the two-stage fermentation results suggest that early transitioning of cell growth to the second phase will not result higher adaption and specific ergosterol content compared to the transition at the end of exponential growth phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Food manufacturing and processing are part of the nation's critical infrastructure. Due to the recent global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the potential contamination of the food chain and the resulting public health implications are of high consequence to society. The current primary food manufacturing and processing facilities already have various mechanisms such as hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system in place. However, the widespread microbial infections in these facilities raise concerns that they will not only threaten the welfare of food processing workers, but also have a potentially greater consequence on the public if the food is contaminated with an infectious agent. Despite the increasingly recognised role of the environment in the spread of microbes, the effect of air properties remains poorly understood. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in meat processing facilities not only provide a means of transport for viruses and bacteria but may also deposit them on surfaces where they can survive for days. To maintain a stable and safe food chain supply during the pandemic, the challenges to ensure safe food supply and protect the workers' health must be quickly addressed through sustainable, safe and economic approaches. With these two imminent challenges in mind, the overall goal of this review article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of the environment in the impaction and resuspension of bioaerosols, focusing on airborne bacteria and viruses. The review includes the latest results of modeling the spread of microbial aerosols in the airflow and the development of preventive measures to mitigate virus contamination in the unique environment of meat processing operations. By understanding how the environmental factors and seasonality affect the infectivity and spread of airborne pathogens, mitigation measures can be designed to minimise future infections within and beyond these facilities.",

Many metals can be used in the biological method, including copper oxide (CuO). In this study, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) were synthesised using Pimpinella anisum L. aqueous extract. For characterisation of the CuONPs, UV–Visible Spectroscopy (UV–Vis), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses were performed. The biological activity of the P. anisum extract and CuONPs was determined using DNA cleavage (agarose gel electrophoresis), antioxidant (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity), mutagenic (Ames/ Salmonella test), and catalytic (methylene blue degradation) activities. In DNA cleavage activity test, CuONPs completely denatured DNA at high concentrations (100 and 200 μg mL −1 ) due to their oxidative activity. The results showed that both the extract and CuONPs have antioxidant properties in DPPH and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities. According to the mutagenicity, CuONPs did not have a mutagenic effect. In catalytic activity, CuONPs degraded methylene blue within 240 min by 99.45%.",

The components of the plants were compared with the sensor data, and the most sensitive sensors were determined by sorting according to the highest components. The study data indicated that the MQ3 sensor exhibited the highest sensitivity for thyme, black cumin, and lavender oils, which contain 63% carvacrol, 38% thymoquinone, and 36% linalool, respectively. Also, MQ7 was the most sensitive sensor for menthone (68%) in mint oil and eucalyptol (45%) in rosemary oil. In addition, a low-cost and non-contact device that works with an infrared sensor has been developed to detect the identity of the oil added into the vial. The study data showed that low-cost Arduino-based IR and odour sensors can determine the identity and component percentage of oils. The fact that the developed device can detect with 100 percent accuracy even in case of peppermint and rosemary oils, which are very similar in appearance, shows that the study data will be an inspiration for contactless determination of oil quality and type.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gallnut honey, a typical Chinese medicinal commodity, is produced from the nectar of Rhus chinensis Mill. Gallnut honey is very popular with consumers because of its health effects and nutritional value, but its specific nutritional composition and medicinal components are not clear. Free amino acids are important nutritional components of honey, and can provide relevant information about the honey, such as geographical and botanical origin, as well as adulterations. The aim of this paper was to explore the free amino acid characteristics of gallnut honeys in different areas. 18 free amino acids from 17 places in China were determined by automatic amino acid analyser analysis, and the geographical characteristics were studied by principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Results showed that gallnut honey is rich in free amino acids. A total of 12 types of free amino acids were detected in all honey-producing areas, and the total amino acid content was 0.132–0.292 g/100 g. Due to its free amino acid content gallnut honey has high nutritional supplement potential, and exhibits good pharmacodynamic activity and special taste characteristics. Flavour-related free amino acids were primarily aromatic free amino acids and umami free amino acids. Pharmacodynamic free amino acids accounted for 61.22–83.85%. Results also showed that free amino acids contribute to the geographical tracing of honey, and samples of gallnut honey at different altitudes can be distinguished by cluster analysis.",

Fermented paste formulations were developed using inoculation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG at 0.5% (w/w) and incubation for 2 days at 35 ± 2 °C. The unfermented VV paste was preserved with sodium benzoate of 0.065%, while fermented formulations were kept devoid of any chemical preservative. All formulations were packed in glass jars and retort bags, and thereafter treated in boiling water bath for one hour. The spiced, fermented VV paste scored highest in sensory evaluation and maximum crude protein and moisture contents, while lowest in contents of ash, fat, crude fibre, and carbohydrates. The fermented (salted and spiced) VV pastes showed variation in pH at 4 °C. Shelf life of 56 days was observed for fermented VV paste stored in glass jars under refrigerated conditions. The antioxidant analysis revealed that DPPH radical scavenging activity of fermented paste formulations increased significantly up to 21 days followed by gradual decrease until the 56 th day, while total phenolic content of all paste formulations decreased with storage time. Hence, fermented spiced paste showed enhanced nutritive and antioxidative potential and shelf life up to 56 days.",

This study explored the effects of P. lobata extract (PLE) on D-galactose/lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS)-induced liver inflammation and oxidative stress in mice, along with its impact on gut microbiota. The in vivo studies indicated that PLE significantly reduced hepatic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. It also lowered serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities, indicating reduced liver damage, and mitigated oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde levels while restoring superoxide dismutase activity. Western blot analysis revealed that PLE inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB pathway proteins (p65 and IκB) and suppressed TLR4 expression, highlighting its role in this inflammatory pathway. Additionally, PLE ameliorated D-GalN/LPS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, reducing Proteobacteria abundance and promoting beneficial genera such as Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , and Akkermansia . These findings suggest that PLE protects against liver inflammation and oxidative stress, while improving gut microbiota composition, offering potential therapeutic strategies for liver-related diseases.",

However, it can be susceptible to heavy metal contamination, which has raised concerns about its safety for consumption. This study aimed to analyse the extent of heavy metal contamination in lotus roots and assess the potential health risks associated with their consumption. The results showed that all measured heavy metal concentrations were below the maximum allowable limits, with contamination indices for all metals across nine provinces remaining below 1.0, classifying the lotus roots as “safe” for consumption. Non-carcinogenic risk assessment using the THQ showed values below 1.0 for all heavy metals in both adults and children, indicating negligible health risks. The HI was calculated as 0.107 for adults and 0.126 for children, with arsenic contributing significantly to these values at 47.76% for adults and 39.55% for children. The carcinogenic risk assessment revealed Carcinogenic Risk (CR) values of 8.37 × 10 −8 for Pb, 2.04 × 10 −5 for Cr, and 2.30 × 10 −5 for As in adults, and 9.86 × 10 −8 for Pb, 2.40 × 10 −5 for Cr, and 2.71 × 10 −5 for As in children. All CR values were within the acceptable range, indicating no apparent carcinogenic effects from lotus root consumption at current intake levels. However, it was noted that increased consumption could elevate risks associated with As, with limits of 174 and 93 g for adults and children, respectively, to maintain safety.",

TEOE exhibited greater effectiveness at T8 compared to T3, reducing microbial counts to 1 log CFU g −1 . Conversely, LEOE demonstrated superior efficacy under T3 in most instances and received a higher acceptability score. Additionally, at T3A, both emulsions demonstrated comparable effectiveness against all bacterial strains, although a slight reduction in antimicrobial proprieties were noted after simulated temperature abuse at 24 h. Therefore, the optimal combination for preserving cooked chicken meat is TEOE under T8 or LEOE under T3; assuming post-cooking contamination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present work evaluates the effect of the incorporation of 6% carnauba wax (CW) and 7% monoglyceride (MG) oleogels for production of a healthy lipid mixture (linseed and sunflower oils) oleogels as a fat replacer at 30, 50, and 70% in hamburger formulation. Hamburgers' fatty acid composition, cooking loss, fat absorption, and texture and oxidative stabilities were evaluated. Incorporation of oleogels in hamburger formulation resulted in a significant decrease ( P &lt; 0.05) in amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), as well as a decrease in the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and atherogenic indices, and an increase in linoleic and linolenic acids (PUFAs) content. Substitution of animal fat with CW and MG based oleogels improved the manufactured hamburgers' quality by reducing cooking loss and fat absorption. In addition, the use of oleogel improved the oxidative stability during the storage of burgers. The lower hardness of oleogels compared to animal fats, as well as their nutritional and technological properties, make them a desirable candidate for animal fat substitution.",

It was shown that wine differentiation could be successfully performed based on measurements of selected volatile alcohols and esters in wine with the application of Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). Also, sensorial assessment could provide for some wine differentiation between vineyard treatment regimes. Both approaches, the instrumental and sensorial, could be successful in wine discrimination, provided single vintage is considered.",

A standardised food frequency questionnaire was administered to the whole sample (response rate through mothers was 98%). Moreover, every second mother who has not yet breastfed the child was asked for a 24-h dietary weight record of her child (response rate 79%). Twelve percent of the children were long term breastfed. The “Food pyramid”of sample was created by the following daily portions: milk and dairy (3.5), other protein-rich food (1.0), fruits and vegetables (4.2) and cereals (2.5). The energy intake of non-breastfed children, comprising of 15% protein (41.7±17.4 g), 35% fat and 50% carbohydrates, was 4.9±1.6 MJ. The results of micronutrient dietary intake in comparison to the European “Population Reference Intake”were satisfying with the exception of iodine. The analysis of the nutrition of Czech children aged 14-25 months did not show any serious problem without a low representation of long-term breastfed children and probably lower intake of iodine, when compared with European recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The surplus of waste glycerol, by-product of the biodiesel production process, is available at the global market. Some species of the genera Streptomyces have the ability to assimilate glycerol and convert it into valuable metabolic products. In the present study, the ability of Streptomyces hygroscopicus to assimilate waste glycerol and convert it into metabolic compounds with antifungal activity against four phytopathogenic fungi obtained from apple fruit samples expressing rot symptoms, was investigated. Production of antifungal metabolites by S. hygroscopicus was carried out in 3 l stirred tank bioreactor through 7 days. Fermentation was carried out at 27 °C with aeration rate of 1.5 vvm and agitation rate of 100 r.p.m. The aim of this work was to analyse bioprocess parameters and to determine at which stage of bioprocess the production of antifungal metabolites occurs. Activity of the cultivation liquid on two isolates of Alternaria alternata and two isolates of Fusarium avenaceum were determined every 12 h using in vitro well diffusion method. It was found that the maximum production of antifungal metabolites occurred at 108 hour of cultivation. Formed inhibition zones have shown that the produced antifungal metabolites have high efficacy on tested phytopathogenic fungi (inhibition zone diameter higher than 35 mm for all test organisms).",

Boiling, autoclaving, microwave irradiation, and sprouting resulted in significant (P&lt;0.05) loss of BBI. Minimum loss was observed in sprouting, while autoclaving for 5 min completely deactivated BBI. Microwave irradiation of the soaked seeds resulted in higher BBI loss than of dry seeds. Among the commercial soy products, BBI concentration was high in soy flour brands, minuscule in ready-to-cook miso soup and undetectable in extruded soy products and roasted soy nuts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quinoa is a pseudocereal having outstanding nutritional profile and health-promoting biofunctional compounds. It is able to pop into an affordable, crispy, and flavourful ready-to-eat snack by conventional oil-popping method. Oil-popping is the process of frying grains in hot oil for a short time to induce vapour-driven expansion of grains. The effects of process variables on oil-popping quality of quinoa were evaluated. The conditions of processing were optimised using Response Surface Methodology. The grains (10 g) were hydrated by adding 0.1–0.3 mL of water containing a varying salt concentration of 0–1%, w/w and popped in coconut oil maintained at a popping temperature of 200–240 °C for a popping time of 10–30 s. The developed popped quinoa was analysed for popping quality indices. It was found that the increase in popping temperature, popping time, and salt concentration, and decrease in moisture level significantly decreased bulk density but increased popping yield (% popped grains), expansion ratio (degree of volume expansion), and flake size (average kernel size) of popped quinoa. Overall acceptability of popped quinoa in terms of sensory attributes was positively correlated with popping temperature and popping time. The optimised variables generated a popping yield of 75.56%, expansion ratio of 3.07, flake size of 11.58 mm 3 , bulk density of 0.29 g mL −1 , and overall acceptability score of 8.40. A threefold expansion and a fair popping yield obtained from oil-popped quinoa offer a significant potential to generate profit for manufacturers.",

TPC, TFC, and antioxidant capacity values of fermented thyme leaves were found significantly higher than of dried and fresh samples. The bioaccessibility index (BI) value for TPC and TFC was highest for PT and lowest for DT, indicating that both processes had different effects on the structure of phenolic compounds present in the thyme leaves. Similarly both Recovery and BI values of DPPH antioxidant capacity were highest for PT, but lowest for fresh samples. When CUPRAC assay was applied, the recovery % for FT and PT was similar, and the BI was higher for FT.

Partial characterisation studies showed that the enzyme has 45 °C and pH 8 as optimum working conditions, and its activity increased by 24% with the addition of 5 mM Mn +2 to the reaction medium. Additionally, the enzyme showed high stability and kept almost full activity in a cell-free medium for 20 days at 4 °C.

The economic importance of the loss in winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) due to larvae of the cereal leaf beetle ( Oulema melanopus , CLB) generated studies investigating the significance of the flag leaf. Simultaneously, the role of other leaves remains rather undiscovered. We simulated herbivory caused by CLB larvae in a two-year study between 2017 and 2018. We removed different amounts of leaf material from two winter wheat cultivars, either from the flag leaves only, or from all leaves. The impact of artificial defoliation was measured in grain production per ear, and related to natural CLB larval herbivory. Removing all leaves simulated CLB larval herbivory more closely than the artificial defoliation of flag leaves only. Our results suggest that the relative importance of flag leaves in seed production may be lower than previously assumed. Further studies involving various cultivars are invited to enhance the knowledge on the significance of the damage done by CLB larvae.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Enterococcus spp. were isolated from sausage and yogurt line production. The genomic assay was performed by PCR, and distinct enterococci ( n = 28) were identified. Testing revealed that 10.7% of the isolates had a resistant phenotype, 7.1% were resistant to erythromycin ( Enterococcus faecium ) and 3.5% were resistant to tetracycline ( Enterococcus gallinarum ). Enterococci cells and biofilm formation in 24 well polystyrene plates and the effect of sanitisation procedures in these biofilms were determined. The sanitisers were chlorinated alkaline H (CAH), chlorinated alkaline A (CAA), quaternary ammonium D (QAD), quaternary ammonium M (QAM), chlorine dioxide (CD), sodium hypochlorite (SH), and peracetic acid (PA). A total of 7 isolates (25%) moderately and the others poorly formed biofilms. The best reduction results were 61 and 55% of the cells with the CAH sanitiser in BHI and water, respectively. The PAA, SH, and CD sanitisers showed low efficiency on Enterococcus planctonics, and the other had an effect on cell growth. The sanitisers CAH, QAD, QAM, PAA, and SH showed efficiency in reducing the cell viability of Enterococcus in biofilms, and values obtained from CAA and CD suggested low biofilm removal capacity. Enterococcus spp. form biofilms and have become a problem in the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lycium barbarum contains a variety of phytochemicals, primarily polysaccharides, and other potent compounds. L. barbarum is a plant that has several uses in contemporary society, including food processing and everyday eating. However, through traditional processing methods the medicinal or edible value of L. barbarum cannot be fully exploited, to further improve the utilisation rate of L. barbarum and enrich the variety of L. barbarum market. The L. barbarum compound beverage, which uses L. barbarum as its primary ingredient, was created through a series of trials, including the creation of tea beverage recipes and research on the most suitable content of stabilisers, flavouring agent formulations and so on. In addition, several validation tests, including those involving hypoglycaemic and lipid-lowering were conducted. The results indicated that 0.1 g mL −1 stabiliser CMC-Na, 0.2 g mL −1 erythritol, 3 g mL −1 citric acid, 8% L. barbarum juice, and 6% chrysanthemum tea cold brew extract were the best combinations for food additive formulations. Additionally, compound beverages have hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects. In conclusion, the research and development of L. barbarum compound beverages can not only increase the rate at which L. barbarum is utilised but also offer fresh ideas for the research and development of L. barbarum as they transition from cash crop agricultural products to market-oriented standardised processed products.",

In our research, elderberry pomace extract (EP) was added to apple juice as natural food additive for controlling microbial spoilage and enriching antioxidant components. During the 8-week storage period of enriched apple juice (EPA) and control apple juice samples antioxidant properties were evaluated using the FRAP assay, Folin–Ciocalteu method, and pH differentiation method. The amount of polyphenols components was quantified using an RP-HPLC method. The microbiological status of samples was studied by determining the total viable and yeast/mould counts. The EPA is an important source of polyphenol components and other bioactive compounds, and the results suggest that extract of elderberry pomace could be a promising natural preservative to improve microbiological stability during refrigerated storage and increase the quality of apple juice.",

We assessed 190 complete responses from chefs/cooks and managers/owners of restaurants and catering businesses in Hungary between February 2021 and February 2022 via email on four aspects; health, nutrition, nutrition practice, and consumers' concerns. This study shows an overall improvement in chefs' and restaurants' management's nutritional knowledge compared with similar studies in the past. However, most chefs still believe that the customers ignore the nutrition and nutrient content of the meals when dining away from home. In addition, experienced chefs do not perceive that the preparation of low-fat foods requires additional work and that low fat-foods can taste great. This study found no significant differences related to nutrition in menu planning based on chefs' and managers' backgrounds (i.e., gender, age, position, educational level, work experience, and type and location of establishment).",

Model emulsions were then prepared to contain oleosomes in proportions of 15, 25, and 35%. Rheological and viscosity analyses were conducted on these model emulsions, focusing on elastic and viscous modulus values. The results of the analyses, which revealed that an increase in the oleosome content in the model emulsions correlated with a concurrent increase in emulsion viscosity as well as in the elastic (G′) and viscous (G″) moduli, demonstrate the significant impact of oleosome concentration on the rheological properties of the emulsions. All samples exhibited a G′ &gt; G″ relationship, indicating their semi-solid nature. Moreover, an increase in the oleosome content was found to result in a higher consistency index for the product, while the flow index remained largely unchanged.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Penaeus vannamei is an important farm-raised shrimp species in China. However, the shrimp deteriorates quickly and has a short shelf life. The surface colour will change with the increase of spoilage, which can reflect its freshness. Therefore, a method for predicting Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVB-N) content using a combination of a chromatic value and Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra is provided. This study explores which chromatic parameter is most efficient for freshness prediction from a data analysis perspective. The Levenberg–Marquardt Optimized Artificial Neural Network (LM-Optimised ANN), the Quadratic Support Vector Machine (Quadratic SVM), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithms verified the idea. The combination of spectra and chromatic value b* can achieve a more accurate prediction of TVB-N content with RMSEP of 1.660 in Quadratic SVM, 1.337 in PLSR, and of 0.964 in LM-Optimised ANN, better than for other methods. As the polyphenol oxidase blackens the colour of the shrimp, the fusion of NIR spectra and b* can improve the prediction of TVB-N content with fewer parameters. Finally, we constructed an easy and fast TVB-N content prediction system.",

There was no significant difference ( P &gt; 0.05) in lactose hydrolysis (&gt;95%) using the free enzyme in the different types of milk. In contrast, significant differences were observed for the hydrolysis of whole cow milk (WCM) and skimmed cow milk (SCM) with the immobilised enzyme (IE). WCM required a longer hydrolysis time (43 h). Thus, the fat content may have affected the lactose hydrolysis of bovine milk with immobilised β-galactosidase. No difference was observed for whole sheep milk and skimmed sheep milk hydrolysed by IE, possibly due to the presence of smaller fat globules, which did not affect the lactose hydrolysis. No significant differences were observed for lactulose synthesis in whole milk from the different species evaluated. The lactulose synthesis in cow and sheep milk by the enzymatic route may be a promising alternative, though further studies are required to optimise the production of this prebiotic in situ .",

Membrane pore size had much more influence on UF permeation rates than the source of the YE. UF filtration rates were on the average 4 times lower when the YE were treated with the 3000 Da membrane as compared to the 10 000 Da filter, and the 1000 Da unit gave rates approximately 40% lower than those observed with the 3000 Da pore size membrane. Pre-filtration with a 8 ?m membrane reduced between 47 and 96% the original YE turbidities, while UF with a 1000 to10 000 Da membranes gave filtrates having between 80 and 99.9% less turbidity than the original YE. On the average, UF with the 10 000 Da unit removed 12% of total solids, while UF with 3000 and 1000 Da cutoff membranes generated the retention of 20 and 23% of solids, respectively. Brewers' YE had lower total nitrogen content than bakers' YE, and UF increased the total nitrogen content of the dried yeast extract filtrates (YEF) obtained. The powders obtained after freeze-drying of brewers' YEF tended to have higher moisture contents than bakers', and this was quite significant with the YEF powders obtained with the filtrates generated with the 1000 Da membrane.",

The breaking force (N) was determined by compression or Back extrusion tests with an Instron texture tester. Electronmicroscopic studies (SEM) were made to support the interpretation of the results.For each vegetable several sections of changes of the breaking force (lnF) were identified. For potatoes a three phase change of the breaking force by all temperatures (85 °C, 95 °C, 100 °C) was observed. In the first of the 3 different observed stages of potato blanching the breaking forces increased with time (0–40 s). In the second and third stage of the blanching process of potato a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the breaking force and the blanching time. The second phase observed was faster (40–160 s) than the consecutive slower third phase (160–240 s).For green peas the change of the breaking force (lnF) can be described by two consecutive first rate reactions. A faster decreasing period between 0–25 s was followed by a slower decreasing one between 70–140 s. Between the first and second stage of the blanching process there was an initial lag period (25–70 s), which will not be described here. In the period after 140 s, there was not any change, this period is constant.For carrots the fastest change can be observed at 100 °C compared to the results at 85 and 95 °C. A three-phase curve was observed as well. An initial lag period (0–90 s) was followed by a faster (90–190 s) and a slower (190–240 s) decreasing one. In the second and third stage of the blanching process of carrots a linear relationship was found. For the changes of the breaking force (lnF) a kinetical approach was applied, reaction rate constants and apparent activation energies were calculated. The kinetical approach helps to compare and forecast changes at different process conditions.",

The fatty acid composition of lard was not influenced by dietary factors and prolonged heating. Supplementing the diets with tocopherol-acetate (30 mg kg -1 of feed) significantly increased the oxidative stability of lards during heating and the protective effect of vitamin E was comparable with that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Dietary selenium (0.3 mg kg -1 of feed as sodium-selenite) was not effective as an antioxidant in lards.

Quality and storage-life of packaged carrots slices were determined by observing changes of mass, total carotenoide pigments, microbial counts (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, enterobacteria, sulphite-reducing clostridia, yeast and moulds), sensory quality and texture by the use of penetrometer.

The absorber for oxygen added to the foil had no influence on the permeability to CO2, O2and N2.

Commonly applied aqueous and alcoholic extracts were analysed for Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Ti, V and Zn content. The concentrations of the minerals examined were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Determination of the flavonoids in solidaginis herba and extracts was carried out by a spectrophotometric method, as required by the German Pharmacopoea. For the study of the flavonoid composition of crude drug, the HPLC technique was applied. To determine the relative nutrient contribution of these pharmaceuticals to the diet, data obtained were combined with flavonoid content particulars, then a comparison with U.S Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) was made. For evaluation of the phytotherapeutic relevance, k/Na ratio was also calculated. It has been found that the pharmaceuticals examined are important sources of potassium, chromium, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and lower sources of iron and zinc, assuming a daily intake of 1-2 l aqueous extracts as recommended for urological diseases. Flavonoid content of the different Solidaginis herba extracts ranged from 62.4 mg l-1 to 305.2 mg l-1.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a preliminary and exploratory study on mother's attitudes and behaviour towards infant feeding in Poland.The aim of this study was to explore the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors on mother's choice of breastfeeding and attitude towards baby ready food.Primary cross-sectional data were gathered through a sample survey research.The choice for breastfeeding is found to be associated with lower income, whereas no significant effects of mother age and education are observed.With respect to attitude towards baby ready foods, younger mothers were found to attach significantly more importance to advertising and information on the product label.They also rely more on specialised information from paediatricians with respect to infant feeding.Generally, the findings point towards a greater need for information related to infant feeding among younger and economically less-favoured mothers.",

The carcasses of feathered game (Phasianus colchicus), left entirely untreated after hunting and placed in a storage space at a pre-set temperature of 7 °C for 21 days were used in the study. Samples of breast and thigh muscles were taken at regular weekly intervals. Measurement of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, histamine, phenylethylamine) was based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Higher biogenic amine concentrations were detected in the muscles (both breast and thigh) of pheasants hanging by their legs compared to pheasants hanging by their heads (no statistically significant difference in biogenic amine concentration between monitored groups was, however, established). Higher concentrations of biogenic amines were found in the thigh muscles compared to breast muscles in both monitored groups. The obtained results show, that hanging the carcasses of pheasants during storage by the head is more suitable method in term of biogenic amine concentration than storing carcasses hanging by the legs.",

Significant correlation models were established with the coefficient of correlation (R2) greater than 0.8. An optimization of process variables was attempted for maximum antioxidant activity and overall acceptability. ANOVA tables revealed that increase in fat and sugar levels lowered the antioxidant activity, while enhancement of mango pulp significantly increased both antioxidant activity and overall acceptability of the beverage.

According to this lack of knowledge, our aim was to lower the curing salt to a still microbiological safe level using mTG by frankfurters, one of the most well-known heat treated meat products in Hungary. The observed technofunctional properties suggest to use mTG enzyme preparation at 0.5% concentration. This enzyme dosage can reduce the average 1.8% salt content to 1.6% and it also may contribute to extended shelf life of popular frankfurters.

The UF-RO-OD procedure resulted in a final concentrate with a 65-70 °Brix dry solid content and an excellent quality juice with high polyphenol content and high antioxidant capacity.Nanofiltration (NF) and membrane distillation (MD) were not proper economic solutions.The influence of certain operation parameters was examined experimentally. Temperatures of UF and RO were: 25, 30, and 35 °C, and of OD 25 °C. Recycle flow rates were: UF: 1, 1.5, and 2 m3 h−1; RO: 200, 400, and 600 l h−1; OD: 20, 30 and 40 l h−1. The flow rates in the module were expressed by the Reynolds number, as well. Based on preliminary experiments, the transmembrane pressures of UF and RO filtration were 4 bar and 50 bar, respectively. Each experimental run was performed three times. The following optimal operation parameters provided the lowest total cost: UF: 35 °C, 2 m3 h−1, 4 bar; RO: 35 °C, 600 l h−1, 50 bar; OD: 20, 30 and 40 l h−1; temperature 25 °C.In addition, experiments were performed for apricot juice concentration by evaporation, which technique is widely applied in the industry using vacuum and low temperature.For description the UF filtration, a dynamic model and regression by SPSS 14.0 statistics software were applied.",

    "abstract": "Clarithromycin is an antibiotic widely used for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication and together with amoxicillin and proton pump inhibitors they constitute the first line triple treatment regimen against H. pylori. Diarrhoea is one of the major drawbacks during H. pylori eradication and is majorly attributed to clarithromycin, while Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic and is shown to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. We aimed to evaluate the effect of clarithromycin on orocecal transit in rats and to identify whether the supplementation with S. boulardii has a role on orocecal transit index. Adult rats of both sexes were divided into two groups to determine immediate or chronic effects of S. boulardii and clarithromycin on orocecal transit. The first group was given single dose of the test drug, while the second group received the test drugs for one week through orogastric intubation. Both groups were randomly distributed into four subgroups; the placebo group (group A), the S. boulardii group (group B), the clarithromycin group (group C), and the co-administration that is clarithromycin plus S. boulardii group (group D). Rats were given 20 mg kg−1 clarithromycin and 500 mg kg−1S. boulardii. We did not find any difference among the subgroups in group 1, where only single dose of the test drugs was administered. In chronic administration group, that is group 2, significant differences among the subgroups were observed (P=0.004). Post-hoc comparisons of orocecal transit index between group “2A and 2C” and “2C and 2D” were significantly different (P=0.013 and P=0.005, respectively). Our results show that long term clarithromycin administration leads to rapid orocecal transit index and S. boulardii supplementation to clarithromycin can abolish this adverse effect in rats. Those findings suggest the beneficial use of S. boulardii in H. pylori eradication regimens.",

Parboiled rice, in which technological processing helps to maintain active substances inside the grains, exhibited also relatively high phenolic levels. The highest antimutagenic effect was proved in Indian Rice, Arborio, Jasmine Rice and Three Colours Rice independently of rice extract concentration. Because of relatively high values of phenolics and high antioxidant activity, the antimutagenic activity of these samples could be attributed to biologically active phenolics present mainly in the bran layer of whole rice grain.",

    "abstract": "The food industry is in the crossfi re of increasing pressure of competition, consumer demands, and growing importance of ecological sustainability considerations.Life cycle analysis is one of the most important methods for evaluation of environmental effects of food industrial technologies and packaging systems.During the last decades there have been an intense work to collect pieces of information on different environmental aspects of food packaging systems all over the world, but there is a considerable gap between the amount of knowledge and its practical application in decision making on the level of enterprises as well as in the process of determination of environmental protection fee.Application of modern, freely available software frameworks for life cycle analysis offers a favourable possibility for integration of environmental information into managerial and governmental decision making processes.Based on case studies, the article demonstrates the possibilities of utilisation of cumulative environmental burden indicators as well as expert decision-support systems for optimisation of product-portfolio, based on environmental considerations.",

Recently, media have been promoting the application of a GFD, however, this is necessary only in gluten-related disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge on CD among individuals, who conducted a self-administered coeliac disease test. Three hundred adult volunteers took part both in the anti-tissue transglutaminase screening and the survey concerning knowledge on CD. Five positive CD tests were obtained, representing 1.67% of the analysed population. In general, the questionnaire respondents were familiar with the issue of CD. The majority of them correctly defined CD as gluten intolerance, and realized that it may occur at any age. Gastrointestinal problems were easily associated with CD, however, extraintestinal symptoms were less frequently recognized as a manifestation of this disease. A GFD was properly identified as a method of treating CD by 95% of the respondents. Self-administered, transglutaminasebased screened persons presented a good level of knowledge on CD, regardless of their gender, place of residence, or education. However, dissemination of knowledge is needed, as CD is still an underestimated problem.",

The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the number of washing cycles (one, two, or four) on the quality of surimi-like material obtained from mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) using the bleaching method with sodium bicarbonate. The product was evaluated based on its chemical and physical characteristics. The chemical compositions of samples showed an increase in protein (45.7 to 89.9%, dry basis) and decrease in fat (49.1 to 7.0%, dry basis) contents, while the moisture content increased from 69.5 to 79.1% after four washing cycles. Washing diminished yield. Gel prepared with MDCM washed once showed the lowest gel strength (507.1 g.cm). It thereafter increased to 546.0 and 602.7 g.cm after double and quadruple washings, respectively. Higher content of myofibrillar proteins and higher whiteness were also obtained after successive washings. It was concluded that four washing cycles was the most appropriate method for producing surimi-like material from MDCM.",

The most significant limitation of membrane applications is fouling, which causes flux decline. During this work, regenerated cellulose membranes covered by TiO 2 -nanoparticles were investigated and applied to the separation of whey solution. Experiments were carried out in a dead-end ultrafiltration cell, and the changes in filtration parameters and the photocatalytic effects of the UV irradiated TiO 2 modified membrane surface on the membrane fouling were examined. Our results showed that the water flux decreased with increasing TiO 2 layer thickness, but the retention of turbidity and of COD increased. After separation, the membrane surface was cleaned by UV irradiation by means of photocatalytic oxidation. It was found that the original flux was recoverable, while the retention of the membrane decreased after cleaning.",

The data obtained clearly demonstrated that the type of carrier used for enzyme immobilization has influence mainly on isomaltose synthesis. The higher yield of oligosaccharides (especially isomaltose) was attained when using immobilized glucoamylase preparation resulted from pore diffusion and tortuosity effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aspergillus strains were isolated from Hungarian mills in order to get information on the appearance of sterigmatocystin (ST) producing moulds, whose presence has never been demonstrated in Hungary. Fungal isolates were classified into nine morphotypes, sections Nigri , Nidulantes , Versicolores (two morphotypes), Circumdati , Flavi (two morphotypes), Clavati and Terrei by classical mycological assays. ST producing strains could be classified into section Versicolores . ST production of the isolates was assessed by liquid and solid phase growth experiments and compared to ST producing reference strains: Aspergillus pepii SzMC 22332, Aspergillus versicolor SzMC 22333, Aspergillus griseoaurantiacus SzMC 22334 and Aspergillus nidulans RDIT9.32. Four of our isolates marked as Km11, Km14, Km26 and Km31 showed ST production in liquid medium. ST production on solid phase corn grit substrate was measured after three weeks of incubation, and Km26 isolate proved to be the most prominent with a toxin concentration of 277.1 μg g −1 , surpassing all reference strains. The toxin-producing ability of Km26 isolate was also tested in a field experiment, where corn was infected. By the end of the experiment, ST level of 19.56 μg kg −1 was measured in infected corn. Molecular taxonomic identification of the Km26 strain was performed using internal transcribed spacer (ITS), calmodulin and tubulin sequence analyses. Based on these studies, strain Km26 was identified as Aspergillus creber . Here we report that an ST-producing A. creber strain has appeared in Hungary, and the Km26 strain is the first known extreme ST-producing mould in this country. As a result of climate change, aflatoxin B1 producing Aspergillus flavus strains have appeared in Hungary in the last decade. As strain Km26 is the only A. creber isolate in Hungary so far, there is no sign of mass prevalence, and due to the lower temperature optimum of the species compared to A. flavus , its appearance is probably not related to climate change.",

L. plantarum RD7 showed the highest B 2 production (0.84 μg mL −1 ) after 36 h, while L. fermentum K16 exhibited maximum B 12 production (0.084 μg mL −1 ) after 12 h. L. rhamnosus K4E produced 0.24 μg mL −1 of folate after 12 h. Highest production of lactate (16.43 μg mL −1 ) and acetate (5.86 μg mL −1 ) was reported by L. rhamnosus K4E. L. plantarum RD7 showed maximum butyrate (0.253 μg mL −1 ) production compared to the other cultures. The highest bioconversion of soy aglycones was reported by L. rhamnosus K4E with 55.43% for daidzein and 72.30% for genistein, during soymilk fermentation. These potent cultures have a potential to be used as functional starter cultures for the production of functional fermented soy foods.",

The anti-glycosylation activity of OA was determined by bovine serum albumin (BSA) fructose model. The results showed that OA moderately inhibited the formation of the intermediates of non-enzymatic glycosylation, fructosamine and α-dicarbonyl compounds, and strongly inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In addition, we analysed the effect of OA on glycometabolism induced by palmitic acid (PA) in HepG2 cells. The results showed that OA had almost no impact on HepG2 cell viability at concentrations lower than 30 µM. With the increase of OA concentration, glucose production in IR HepG2 cells decreased, while glycogen content increased. Meanwhile, OA has a significant inhibitory effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in IR-HepG2 cells. Those results suggested that OA could be a promising natural blood glucose decreasing substance in the pharmaceutical and functional food industries.",

In this study, two female tester lines were crossed with four male lines to obtain new tomato hybrids. The eight F 1 hybrids and two commercial hybrids were planted in a randomised complete block design with two replications in a greenhouse in Antalya. The tomatoes of the hybrids and lines were harvested at fully ripened stage to evaluate yield, total soluble solids (TSS), fruit firmness, lycopene content and fruit colour parameters. TSS values of the cultivars and lines ranged from 4.5 to 9.5 °Bx, fruit firmness from 7.94 to 11.85 kg cm −2 , lycopene from 52.10 to 55.88 mg kg −1 , yield from 554.3 to 1336.7 g/plant.

A 14-question survey was applied in these establishments, addressing the origin of the vegetables, washing procedures, and temperature conditions during storage and exposure. In addition, 30 samples of leafy vegetables were collected and submitted to the enumeration of total coliforms, coliforms at 45 °C and tested for Salmonella . Based on the responses to the survey, the establishments could be clustered into three groups. Group 1 included four establishments, where the vegetables originated from farms exclusively and were displayed to consumers at room temperature, and where most of the food handlers had participated in courses on good handling practices. Group 2 included two establishments that performed a centrifugation step and where vegetables were not available to consumers in a self-service. Finally, group 3 included four establishments, where vegetables originated from suppliers exclusively, were stored under refrigeration, and displayed to consumers on refrigerated tables. The mean count of total coliforms was 2.5 ± 0.7 log MPN/g, while coliforms at 45 °C were detected in only one sample (0.9 log MPN/g). Salmonella was not found in any sample. Microbiological results obtained for leafy vegetables from establishments clustered in the three groups did not differ significantly. These data contribute to a better understanding of the hygienic handling of leafy vegetables in the surveyed Brazilian food establishments.",

The optimised reaction conditions of hydrolysis were at 6% (w/v) of meat protein in 0.1% NaHCO 3 buffer, pH 7.5; pancreatin enzyme with 50 TAME units/g meat protein substrate, 37 °C and 60 min). Hydrolysates (MDMH) were assessed for degree of hydrolyses (DH, %) by using trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid method and MW distribution by SDS-PAGE. Modification of immune reactive binding sites in MDMHs was monitored by immunoblot with cow’s milk, chicken egg or meat allergic human patients’ sera. Biological value indices (True Digestibility (TD), Net Protein Utilisation (NPU), Biological Value (BV)) were determined using rat feeding trials. Among the MDMH products, the pancreatic hydrolysate proved to be the most favourable in terms of biological value and digestibility as well as hypoallergenic property.",

The blood samples were treated with anticoagulant (EDTA) to eliminate the possible measurement distorting effects. We found that 2 log reduction in the microbial load could be achieved with a pressure treatment above 400 MPa. According to the protein denaturation measurements (DSC), blood proteins were resistant to pressure treatment, even at 300–400 MPa a substantial part of proteins remained in native state. The colour of the samples got darker with the rising pressure, however, visible colour change was observed only above 400 MPa. It can be established, that the HHP treatment was suitable to increase the microbiological stability of blood, without significantly changing its techno-functional properties.",

The combination of sweetener with chia gel (SCC) had the highest moisture content, while the replacement of fat in muffin (CC) revealed similarity to the control in lightness and redness values. There was also no significant difference in terms of firmness when only the sweetener was replaced (SC). While the control muffin obtained the highest overall acceptability score, the lowest score was observed in CC.

    "abstract": "Enteritis is a serious problem for patients having received abdominal radiation. This study was to investigate whether zinc affected intestinal injury induced by the radiation. ICR mice were divided randomly into three groups and treated with one of three different compounds. Two of the compounds contained zinc (gluconate and amino acid chelated with bovin prostate extract) and one was water. One week after receiving the treatment, they were irradiated with 6 or 10 Gy at the abdominal region. One, 2, and 4 weeks after the irradiation the animals were sacrificed to examine the histological changes in the intestinal mucosa. The apoptotic cell numbers were found to be significantly higher after irradiation. The number of the apoptotic cells increased with increasing radiation doses. In this study we found that zinc appears to have the capability to lower the occurrence of apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa, thus protecting intestinal mucosa from injuries. Based on this finding, it would be reasonable to suggest that zinc could be used as food supplements in patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy in a hope to reduce radiation induced toxicity.",

Various foods (raw vegetables, fruits, cultivated shells, etc.) may be contaminated at the location of cultivation; this is called primary contamination. Secondary contamination is when infected persons transmit the virus to the foods (e.g. bakery products) with contaminated hands.In Hungary the year 2006 was definitely the year of calicivirus outbreaks, the majority of which were detected in hospitals, elderly homes and children communities. The number and prevalence of outbreaks showed relatively high difference by counties. The outbreaks confirmed our conviction that without suitable and available laboratory methodology the agent could remain unknown. Furthermore, a general and controlled surveillance system is needed, which enables the rapid detection and elimination of gastrointestinal outbreaks of viral origin in collaboration with adequate laboratories.",

Baked goods have a high fat and sugar content, and their intake accounts for a high percentage of the food consumed by the population for breakfast, mid-morning and mid-afternoon meals.

The values for carbohydrates ranged between 36.8% and 62.3%, and for sugars between 9.0% and 33.8%. The fat content ranged from 6.0% to 36.8%, while 76% of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) determined were atherogenic acids. In accordance with daily energy intake recommendations for SFA and sugars, the intake of one serving of the product provides 25% or more of the recommended energy from SFA for nine of the twenty baked goods tested, and more than 15% of the energy recommended from sugars for fourteen of these products.",

It was developed originally for the investigation of mould contamination of tomato purée. It is also used nowadays for quality control purposes for other food products as well. Recently this constitutes the basis of the acceptance of the finished products in international trade. This technique demands experts with a lot of practice and morphological proficiency. The investigation makes use of eyes and so the tiredness of the investigator can cause uncertainties.The possibility of other methods for the determination of mould contamination of tomato purée was investigated to replace the Howard method. The NIR technique — as a rapid, non-destructive, reagentless and accurate method — was anticipated as a suitable method for the mentioned purpose. Canned tomato purée had been allowed to become mouldy then the sample was blended with non-mouldy samples in different ratio, so a series of tomato purées containing known amounts of mouldy purée was prepared. Howard mould counts and ergosterol content — another mould contamination relating value — was used as reference for NIR calibration.At quantitative investigation better results were obtained using ergosterol values. The best correlation coefficient (R=0.93) and the smallest standard error of calibration (SEC=0.008 mg g−1 ergosterol) was achieved with triangular smoothing and second derivation of the spectra. At qualitative investigation Polar Qualification System (PQS) was used. Clusters between samples with low and high ergosterol levels could be separated.",

Biological value (BV) and net protein utilisation (NPU) of milk protein based formula are lower than that found in the literature. The same bioassays for soy protein isolates based formula are extremely low, while PER and NPR values are higher than that of proteins in milk based formula. The data indicate that protein qualities of both powdered infant formulas evaluated in vivo are not satisfying and can not provide nutritional support to healthy infants.

The introduction of a z-value related dimensionless temperature enabled to extend similarity conditions for F-values. The locations of the critical points of species or attributes with diverse z-values differed in the same process. The most important factor influencing the critical point’s location was the difference between heating and initial food temperatures divided by the z-value. When this difference was sufficiently great, the critical point approached the geometric centre, but reached it only for the infinite cylinder.

Electrophoretic separation of defatted and non-defatted control soybean samples showed the same protein patterns. On the densitograms of mutant lines quantitative and qualitative differences could be observed. Defatted raw soy samples reflected more differences in the number of peaks than non-defatted ones. Beside soy trypsin inhibitors, several more soy proteins of low molecular weight are dissolved. KA mutant line 9 has a unique 2-propanol soluble protein pattern, and a new protein band of Rf=0.37 compared to the control line. Sixty percent 2-propanol soluble soybean seed proteins are suitable for cultivar identification and characterization, furthermore to distinguish soybean lines of the same origin.",

The upper surface of affected leaves turned yellow and white fungal-like growth was observed on the underside. Diseased plants wilted and rapidly collapsed, resulting in losses of nearly 100%. Downy mildew of impatiens can be caused by two pathogens, Plasmopara obducens or Plasmopara constantinescui (syn: Bremiella sphaerosperma), which can be distinguished by the symptoms and by morphology of sporangiophores and sporangia. For molecular identification the 5′-end of the large subunit of ribosomal RNA gene was amplified by PCR using NL1 and NL4 primers and cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the Hungarian isolate showed highest identity (99.72%) with two isolates of Plasmopara obducens from the United Kingdom and Serbia. On the basis of the symptoms, molecular and morphological characters, the pathogen was identified as P. obducens. The appearance of the pathogen in Hungary seriously endangers the production of I. walleriana, which is a popular ornamental in gardens and city parks. The chemical plant protection is not effective against the pathogen, by the occurrence of the first symptoms the diseased plants should be removed from the plantlet and must be destroyed.",

Concerning the application of any new technology, it is a more and more important demand that the environmental impact should be lower compared to the earlier technologies. This lower impact can be manifested in less energy and water use, in less wastes production or in more rational energy use.",

Nitrate formed through nitrification of the pea processing wastewater could not be denitrified, thus rising sludge occurred in the secondary clarifiers. On the other hand, during the corn campaign, severe deterioration of the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency, as well as the overproduction of extracellular polysaccharides leading to viscous bulking, were caused by the extremely high C/N ratio. In order to efficiently treat the wastewater of the vegetable processing industry, establishment of highly flexible systems with unaerated first stage proves to be necessary.",

Four of the 6 verocytotoxin-producing strains belonged in phage group 20, one in phage group (2)3(7), and one in phage group 4; four strains were of B3, one of A1, and one of A1(A2) phage type.Because of a technical failure the milk was pasteurized at 69 °C for 15 s, which is 2 °C less than required.

It was observed that the defrosted mackerel was characterized by advanced stage lipolysis and accumulated lipid oxidation primary products. During the frying and oven-baking of the defrosted mackerel, the lipolysis spread throughout the fish. The hydroperoxide content decreased 4.7–4.9 times and mostly secondary derivatives of lipid oxidation accumulated. During the process of frying the mackerel, the lipid oxidation chain was widespread. More conjugated triens and fewer conjugated diens were formed, and the polyene indices increased. In contrast, oven-baking did not cause changes to the conjugated lipids, and the polyene indices decreased more than 60%.",

    "abstract": "The authors evaluated the data of 30 patients with cystic fibrosis (18 male, 12 female), between ages 2–18 (average age: 9.57 years). In 60% of the patients serum cholesterol was below the 5th percentile value according to the data of theNational Cholesterol Education Program(1991). They examined the connection between the serum cholesterol levels and the total fat, fatty acids and cholesterol intake. No significant differences were found between total fat, fatty acids and cholesterol intake of patients with serum cholesterol levels below the 5th percentile value and patients with levels above the 5th percentile value. The analysis of the nutritional data showed that lipid intake was in accordance with the proportion prescribed for patients with CF (35.56% of energy). The intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were 11%, 11% and 8,3% of total energy, respectively, the PUFA/SFA ratio was 0.78. The ratio of linoleic to alfa-linolenic acid was especially high: 29. The clinical condition of the patients in the low cholesterol level group, as shown by the Shwachman-Kulczycki score was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the group with serum cholesterol levels above the 5th percentile value. The authors therefore suggest the importance of the regular monitoring of serum cholesterol levels in patients with cystic fibrosis. Observing the changes in serum cholesterol levels is a fast, informative and inexpensive method of evaluating the clinical course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Alimentary factors of enterogen arthropathies were studied, in particular the early morphological detection, to prevent the disease progression by nutritional prescriptions. Authors compared the method of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with conventional X-ray and nuclear medicine investigations. The results showed the superiority of HRCT to detect cartilage erosions and ligamental calcifications in the sacroiliac joint and lumbar facet joint. The importance of nutritional factors is briefly discussed. The need for high quality and high quantity food of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is well known. Elemental diet is effective for remission of IBD. Folic acid intake is extremely important. Total parenteral nutrition in acute active disease (Crohn's fistulas) has not been proved to effect IBD. Elimination of whole protein as a possible luminal factor for long term application can help, if elementary amino acids are in the diet. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (major components of fish oils) have beneficial effects. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet can decrease the inflammation. Antioxidants, glutamine are essential in the diet. Removal of fat is effective to get remission. Alimentary complication in IBD patients can be osteoporosis, so there is a need for regular bone densitometry. Conclusion of the study suggests that HRCT offers more sensitive detection of enterogen arthropathy related changes. The predictive value of this diagnostic method is accurate enough to advise restrictive and/or supplemental diets of IBD patients. Dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of repeated courses of steroids.",

Although a perfect fit with multivariate nonlinear regression was not obtained, the results of the analyses indicate practical solutions to be possible.",

Methionine incorporation during α-chymotrypsin catalysed EPM shows an optimum curve in function of the content of the added methionine ethylester in the reaction mixtures. In our present study, the maximal enrichment of Met was at the ratio of 48.7 g of methionine ethyl ester/100 g of proteolysate of soy protein isolate and thereafter the amount of the methionine incorporated decreased. A possible interpretation of this fact could be the changes in the reaction environment, which modifies the conformation of the enzyme, namely, the structure of chymotrypsin. CD (circular dichroism) data showed that conformation of chymotrypsin was modified at 37 °C with addition of methionine ethyl ester (as one of the substrates in the EPM reaction). The hydrolytic activity of α-chymotrypsin, which was measured with artificial substrate, N-benzoyltyrosine ethyl ester, was reduced with increasing amount of methionine ethyl ester.",

Two of these were Lc. lactis subsp. lactis UC317 and NCDO763, while four of them were Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, HP, Wg2 and AM2. To determine their performance in manufacture of Beyaz cheesemaking, the activity of six different strains of Lactococcus were monitored during cheese production by determining the curd acidity. Also, their proteolytic and lipolytic activities were tested by determining nitrogen fractions and free fatty acid contents, respectively, after 3 days of ripening. These cheeses made with each strain of Lactococcus did not differ significantly in pH decline during cheesemaking. The gross compositions of the fresh cheeses were found to be similar; however, the cheeses made with HP and Wg2 had the lowest and highest levels of salt-in-moisture content, respectively. Water-soluble nitrogen, 12% trichloroacetic acid soluble nitrogen, total free amino acid and total free fatty acid contents were significantly influenced by using different strains of lactococci in manufacture of Beyaz peynir. All strains, except for Wg2 and AM2, gave a satisfactory result in chemical quality of the cheese; however, some differences were observed.",

It was supposed that the elements besides organic compounds in greater celandine also have favourable effect as adjuvants, therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the bioavailability of the elements. The element transfer through the gastrointestinal system was measured by in vitro model from the pressed extract into buffer solutions with different pH (stomach pH=1.1, intestine pH=2.8, plasma pH=7.5). It was stated that the elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, Zn) were able to be absorbed through the stomach-bowel system, since they passed through the membrane. The transfer of the elements from the latex into the different buffer solutions greatly depends on the element and the pH of applied buffer solution. The transfer of the elements from the latex ranged between 0.9% (Ca into buffer solution pH=7.5) and 59.3% (B into buffer solution pH=2.8). The transfer of the highest amount of elements was observed in the case of buffer solution pH=2.8, and less transferable elements were Ca with 33.64% and Mg with 33.89% of the initial value. On the basis of results, it can be stated that the elements are able to transfer through the gastrointestinal system and may have adjuvant effects.",

    "abstract": "The use of melatonin as antioxidant has been extensively established. But what would the antioxidant function be if one were to go one step back in the anabolism of that amine, and orally administer its precursor — the amino acid tryptophan? Diurnal animals ( Streptopelia roseogrisea ) were administered orally capsules containing 125 or 300 mg L-tryptophan/kg b.w. for 7 days at the end of the light period (20 h ). A control group received capsules with methylcellulose. The antioxidant function was studied through the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) by superoxide anion, and through the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) produced in the lipoperoxidation that occurs from the respiratory burst in response to the presence of a foreign particle in phagocytic cells (heterophils), which were extracted at 2 h — at the acrophase of melatonin in the blood stream. In the heterophils extracted from the group that received 125 mg kg −1 b.w. tryptophan, there was less oxidative stress as determined by the NBT reduction than in those from the 300 mg kg −1 b.w. group. In the study of the lipoperoxidation of the membranes as determined by the levels of MDA, however, no significant variations were observed between the different groups. The lower concentration (125 mg L-tryptophan/kg b.w.), administered orally, succeeded in diminishing the free radicals produced in the heterophils for the destruction of the ingested foreign agent, but not fully or maximally. The possible solution to this prooxidant/antioxidant imbalance would be to administer a lower concentration of tryptophan to attain the perfect balance for application in nutritional treatments.",

Calculations based on a nutrition model of a boarding school in four months were done to estimate the mean dietary intake of nitrates and nitrites, industrially added to foodstuffs, by children aged 7 to 10 years. Following recognised methodology of the Codex Alimentarius and the European Commission, it was assumed that nitrates and nitrites are used in the widest possible range of foods and at their maximum permitted levels, resulting in overestimation of intake values. The mean daily exposure of consumers with the lowest (21 kg) and the mean (26.5 kg) body mass to nitrates ranged from 0.6 to 6.7% and from 0.5 to 5.3% of their acceptable daily intake (ADI), respectively. For the same consumers, the mean daily exposure to nitrites ranged from 0 to 13.0% and from 0 to 10.3% ADI. No significant seasonal differences were obvious. The results indicated that the above-mentioned group of children is sufficiently protected from hazard of nitrates and nitrites in food.",

The growth curves were fitted with the modified Gompertz model, and the estimated maximum specific growth rate was considered to be pressure dependent. A delay in the maximum value of bacteriocin production was registered for more severe pressure conditions, but it was found more notorious for pressure followed by temperature treatments. At lower pressure intensity treatment, regardless of the application order, there was an enhancement of bacteriocin production per cell when compared to the control while maintaining the maximum production value.

    "abstract": "Confectionery and chocolate manufacture has been dominated by large-scale industrial processing for several decades.It is often the case though, that a trial and error approach is applied to the development of new products and processes, rather than verifi ed scientifi c principles.The purpose of this book is to describe the major features of unit/physical operations, the chemical operations such as inversion, caramelization, and the Maillard reaction, as well as the complex operations as conching, drying, frying, baking, and roasting, that are used in confectionery manufacture.A study of confectionery and chocolate engineering must therefore examine the physical and chemical, as well as the biochemical and microbiological properties of the processed materials.In this way, verifi ed scientifi c principles may be more consistently applied to new process and product development.Because both raw materials and end products in the confectionery industry are diverse, and because the operations -which affect these mostly cellular materials -have particular properties, a new approach to the subject is needed, in contrast to the usual technologyfocused discussion.This volume offers a scientifi c, theoretical description and analysis of confectionery manufacture, building on a background of chemical engineering and a system's approach theory called \"structure theory,\" as described by Blickle and Seitz (1975).Structure theory deals with the interrelationships of properties of the materials produced, the manufacturing operations, and the machinery itself.In the author's comprehension these may be imagined as a technological triangle graph where the vertices are the sets of material properties and the edges are the relations between them.These combined operations are linked as well in detailed technological lay-outs of the most important product groups.This second edition adds to information presented in the fi rst edition on essential topics such as food safety, quality assurance; sweets for special nutritional purposes, artisan chocolate, and confectioneries.In addition, information is provided on the fading memory of viscoelastic fl uids, which are briefl y discussed in terms of fractional calculus, and gelation as a second order phase transition.The author, who has over 40 years' experience in confectionery manufacture, aims to open up new possibilities for process and product improvement, relating to increased effi ciency of operations, the use of new materials, and new applications for traditional raw materials.This book is aimed at food engineers, scientists, and technologists in research and industry, as well as graduate students in relevant food and chemical engineering-related courses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reducing sugars are known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly by means of the glycation reaction. The hydroxyl radical, a prominent entity of ROS, is known to alter cellular DNA and induces damage to DNA, and plays a role in diseases such as diabetes mellitus. In this study, the oxidative damage of DNA induced by the lysine/Fe 3+ /MG reaction was investigated. Silybum marianum seeds extract ( Sly E), standard silymarin (Sly), and vitamin B6 derivatives, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine (PM), and pyridoxine (P) in reversing glycation-induced damage in DNA were evaluated. In addition, different sugars and sugar phosphates were incubated with plasmid pBR 322 DNA to control and compare their harmful effects. Our results revealed that Sly E protected lysine/Fe 3+ /MG induced oxidative DNA damage more effectively than Sly. Vitamins, on the other hand, prevented this DNA damage in the order of PLP&gt;P&gt;PM. The DNA altering and damaging intensity of sugars and sugar phosphates tested increased considerably in the following order: Ribose-5-phosphate &gt; fructose-6-phosphate &gt; ribose &gt; fructose &gt; fructose-1,6 biphosphate &gt; glucose-6 phosphate &gt; glucose. The results show that the lysine/Fe 3+ /MG glycation reaction can cause oxidative damage of DNA through a mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals. It also provides evidence that ribose-5-phosphate and fructose and its phosphate metabolites can alter DNA more rapidly in vitro than glucose and its phosphate metabolites.",

This paper presents the estimation of red meat production including all slaughterings both in slaughterhouses and in non-slaughterhouses by using a re-established model based on change in the inventory of animals including imported and exported animals, slaughtering rate for the slaughtered animals raised domestically in Türkiye, and total red meat consumption per capita per year in Türkiye. Total red meat production in Türkiye was estimated as 1 million 952 thousand 38 tonnes, bovine meat production was estimated as 1 million 471 thousand 550 tonnes, sheep and goats meat production was estimated as 480 thousand 488 tonnes in 2021. Total red meat human consumption per capita in Türkiye was estimated as 23 kg carcass weight per capita per year and 17 kg retail weight per capita per year. 17 kg of total red meat human consumption came from bovine meat, and 6 kg came from sheep and goats meat. According to the result of cluster analysis of European countries, Türkiye was clustered in the group of lowest total red meat consumption with Albania, Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Moldova, North Macedonia, Czech Republic, and Serbia.",

All isolates were found to be resistant to cefotixin and oxacillin, 8 isolates (26.6%) to clindamycin, 1 isolate (3.3%) to rifampicin, and 1 (3.3%) isolate was found to show intermediate resistance against clindamycin. Biofilm formation was determined for all the isolates at 22 °C and 37 °C (24 h, 48 h and 72 h). MIC values of white vinegar samples were determined at 3.12% for all isolates. MIC/2 and MIC/4 concentrations of white vinegar increased the biofilm forming capacity of the isolates by 21.2% and 17.1%, respectively. After exposure to MIC/2 concentration of white vinegar for seven days, the antibiotic resistance status of the isolates to tetracycline, rifampicin, and clindamycin changed, and the biofilm forming abilities significantly decreased at 4 °C and 37 °C for 48 h and at 37 °C for 72 h ( P &lt; 0.05). The results showed that the use of subMIC concentrations of white vinegar should be avoided in routine sanitation applications.",

Sesamol was orally administered once a day for 5 months. Morris water maze was used to evaluate the learning and memory ability of mice. The number of synapses in the hippocampal neurons was detected by Golgi staining. Nissl staining was used to observe the changes of Nissl bodies in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Aβ, SIRT1, BDNF, and p-CREB/CREB in the hippocampus and cortex. Compared with the model group, sesamol decreased the latency period of APP/PS1 mice ( P &lt; 0.05) and increased the total number of neuronal dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA3 region, as well as increased the number of Nissl bodies ( P &lt; 0.05). Western blotting results showed that sesamol significantly reduced Aβ protein expression in the hippocampus and cortex, increased SIRT1 expression in the cortex, and increased BDNF expression in the hippocampus ( P &lt; 0.05). Sesamol improved the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice probably through increasing the density of neuronal dendritic spines and upregulating the levels of SIRT1 and BDNF.",

Spray drying was performed on a pilot scale using a mixed flow spray dryer. The effects of the inlet air temperature (150–210 °C) and feed flow rate (2–7 L h −1 ) on several responses such as moisture content, yield, dispersibility, bulk density, and outlet air temperature were investigated using response surface methodology. In addition, with the optimised parameters, Carr index, Hausner ratio, solubility, wettability, hygroscopicity, degree of caking, crystallinity, and morphology of the obtained whey powder were determined. The investigation revealed that feed flow rate is the main parameter influencing all responses. The inlet air temperature significantly affected the bulk, tapped density, and outlet air temperature. The optimal inlet air temperature and feed flow rate for the production of whey powder were 182 °C and 3.2 L h −1 , respectively. Under these parameters the moisture content, yield, bulk density, hygroscopicity, and degree of caking of the obtained product were 28.6, 1.80%, 0.24 g cm −3 , 16.10 g H 2 O/g powder, and 85.56%, respectively.",

An optimisation process was carried out to determine the injection time to be applied in the ionic gelation technique and the encapsulation efficiencies, particle sizes, swelling ratios, in vitro release profiles, and antioxidant activities of the obtained capsules were determined. While the encapsulation efficiency of the capsules obtained by the cold gelation technique was determined as the highest (98.2 ± 0.99%), it was revealed that the viscosity of the wall material used in the ionic gelation technique was important in the encapsulation efficiency. The particle size and swelling rate of the capsules obtained using the cold gelation technique were the highest. The release rate of oleuropein was generally higher at gastric pH than at intestinal pH. A correlation was found between antioxidant activities and the encapsulation efficiency of capsules.",

Compared with the control group, the content of α-helix and β-sheet increased and the secondary structure of GP changed from disorder to order after phosphorylation. The activity of GP was increased and its structure was more tightly in the Phk group than that in the control group. The phosphorylation at Ser277, Ser430, Ser809, Thr304, Tyr298, and Tyr525 resulted in tighter spatial structure. In conclusion, phosphorylation of GP enhanced its catalytic activity by making the secondary and spatial structure more orderly, which is of great significance for controlling meat quality by regulating glycolysis.",

This study utilised response surface methodology to evaluate the optimal conditions required to extract SDF (U-SDF) from Lentinula edodes via the ultrasonic-assisted hot-water method, and evaluated the hypolipidemic effects and anti-inflammatory effects of U-SDF. The optimal extraction conditions for U-SDF were ultrasonic power of 182 W, extraction time of 2 h, extraction temperature of 81 °C, and solid-liquid ratio of 1:24 (g mL −1 ). Under these conditions, the extraction rate of U-SDF reached 8.08%. U-SDF treatment significantly improved liver and kidney indices in diabetic mice, markedly reduced the levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and significantly increased the level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in a dose-dependent manner. U-SDF also improved adipose tissue injury in diabetic mice, significantly decreased the levels of cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and alleviated inflammation of the abdominal aorta. In conclusion, U-SDF from L. edodes is an excellent source of dietary fibres, which exhibit good hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting potential applications as a functional additive in diverse food products.",

Sensitive detection methods are necessary to identify contaminated samples. Detection of campylobacters by culturing is slow and tedious, whereas PCR technology offers the potential for rapid and sensitive detection, however, it may be inhibited when used directly for food or pre-enriched food samples. Different methods for sample and/or DNA preparation were studied to find an optimal combination for sensitive PCR detection of C. coli in enrichment broth. Buoyant density centrifugation (BDC) prior to cell lysis improved PCR detection of C. coli by 100-1000-fold. Preston enrichment broth spiked with 101-102 CFU ml-1 was detected positive after 18 h of enrichment. Specific flaA PCR detection of C. coli in enrichment broth following BDC and simple heat lysis of the cells can be conducted within two working days. This study is a part of the undergoing development of a rapid and sensitive molecular procedure for specific detection of C. coli in foods.",

Although it was expected, there was not any liver protecting activity of the Beiqishen tea extract in the hyperlipidemic rat model, which was proved by biochemical and morphological studies. The reason for our expectation was the significant polyphenol content of Beiqishen tea. Although, the detoxifying activity of tea polyphenols could be observed in hyperlipidemy, at the same time toxic metal element content (As, Mo, Ni, Pb and Cr) of the tea infusion accumulated in the liver in both normo- and hyperlipidemic rats.",

Because of the high boiling point of the solvents, an extraction method was used for the isolation of products after reverse hydrolysis. This method resulted in higher yields (15-25%) than our original evaporation method (11-19%).",

The wine varieties Rhine Riesling, Müller Thurgau and Riesling have the potential for the production of quality distillates, suitable for maturation. Pinot White, Traminer and Chardonnay give more acceptable wines than distillates and it is therefore not advisable to use them for distillates production, while the varieties Pinot Gris, Frankovka and Steinschiller are not suitable for the production of distillates.",

Examined acoustic phenomena were the following: acoustic streaming, standing wave, and cavitation. Physical parameters (suspension density, dissolved oxygen, temperature) of the sound field had essential effect on the acoustic phenomena formed in the ultrasound field and on the threshold levels of their formation.

The isolates were screened for probiotic potentials and amylolytic activities. Four isolates possessed probiotic potentials: L. plantarum CA3b, L. fermentum GA2d, L. plantarum GA1d, and L. plantarum GA3e. Lactobacillus plantarum CA3b, L. fermentum GA2d, and L. plantarum GA3e survived pH 2.5 and 3.5 after 180 min.

Lactobacillus plantarum CA3b hydrolysed 3% starch with an average zone of clearance of 10.0 mm, while L. plantarum GA1d hydrolysed 2% with a zone of 9.5 mm. These two strains also possessed bacteriocin activities against E. coli, and were characterised based on their reactions to pH, temperature, and enzymes treatments.

The objective of the research was to compare the collagen/hydroxyproline content and X-ray Computed Tomographic (CT) connective tissue proportion of longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle in Hungarian Simmental bulls and cows. Animals (n=24) were slaughtered at similar live weight (bulls: 530.6+44.7 kg, cows: 527.3+53.5 kg) under standard commercial conditions in Hungary. After 24 h chilling, LT samples were taken from the right half carcass at the 12 th rib. CT examinations were carried out with a 16-slice CT system (slice thickness: 5 mm). Samples were scanned at different user-selectable tube voltages e.g. low: 80 kV and high: 140 kV. CT value at LT muscle area of each mixed scan (80 and 140 kV) was determined. Volumetric connective tissue content was measured (above 200 CT value) as well. Following CT, the hydroxyproline/collagen content and intramuscular fat content of LT were determined. Cows had lower carcass weight (247 kg vs 295 kg), EU conformation score (3.5 vs 5.5), and fatness score (4.2 vs 5.9) than bulls (P&lt;0.01). Bulls had higher LT area, but intramuscular fat content was similar for bulls (2.8±1.9) and cows (2.7±2.0). On the other hand, bulls had lower CT intramuscular connective tissue proportion in LT compared to cows (0.4±0.2% vs 0.7±0.3% P&lt;0.01). The same tendency could be observed for the collagen content (0.5±0.2% vs 0.7±0.1% P&lt;0.01). Correlation between the CT connective tissue proportion of LT and collagen content was r=0.8 (P=0.000). There was a weak positive correlation between slaughter age and CT connective tissue as well as collagen content of LT (r=0.3–0.4, P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, intramuscular connective tissue proportion in LT increased with slaughter age, and older cows had higher collagen and connective tissue proportion than bulls. Mixed CT scans can be used for the analysis of intramuscular connective tissue content.",

The quantity of methyl-donor compounds (choline, carnitine) and easily mobilizable methyl groups were measured in various fruit parts (stalk, fruit flesh, seed kernel) of five sour cherry cultivars using OPLC technology, and the cultivar dependence of the detected compounds was examined. The results of comparative examinations established the presence of choline in the stalk and seed and of a significant amount of carnitine in the fruit flesh.

The Mal d 1.01 and 1.02 genes could be detected from 91% and 79% of apple cultivars, respectively, due to the high degree of conservative regions. The Mal d 1.04 gene has 4 functional varieties and 2 pseudo-alleles, so it is highly variable. The PCR amplifi cation with Mal d 1.06 primers gave one or two fragments with different sizes. The electrophoretic pattern is a suitable means to select apple cultivars according to their low, medium, or high Mal d 1 allergen content. Florina apple showed the single 154 bp allele, which is responsible for the small Mal d 1 allergen content in homozygote form.. Several samples gave weak signal or did not give any fragment-band on the gel, so Mal d 1.07 and 1.08 genes might have more varieties.

In order to understand how effective communication methods help to stop decrease of poultry meat consumption, determinative factors according to consumer risk perception and changes in poultry meat consumption were identified. Analysis of the consumer survey conducted in 2016 showed that education and gender were the most important socio-demographic variables, though poultry consumption was almost completely undisturbed.

Higher contents of procyanidin B2 and gallic acid were found in the pulp as compared to those found in skins. Studies during the ripening stage showed that the higher ratio of procyanidin B2 and gallic acid concentrations in the pulp vs. skins relates to late-ripening cultivars, while for early-ripening cultivars a lower ratio was observed. Contents of phenolic acids, catechin, stilbenes, and anthocyanins were studied by means of LC-DAD; other compounds were measured by FTIR.",

    "abstract": "Garlic is widely used as food flavouring, and China is the world's largest garlic producer and exporter. To develop a convenient technique for evaluation of garlic cultivars would be worthwhile, and it would have wide application in such a huge market. In this research, 3D front-face fluorescence data of 8 garlic cultivars were recorded, and independent component analysis was used to decompose the overall fluorescence spectra into six independent components. The first, second, and fourth independent components showed a big difference among the cultivars, and the chemical fluorophores behind these three components were specified as protein, vitamin B6, and ATP, respectively, as fluorescent markers for evaluation. The result showed that all 8 cultivars cluster separately. The cultivar “YNQJ” have the highest quality in terms of protein and vitamin B6, “NXYC” and “SDHB” have the highest content of ATP, while “SXXA” is the poorest in terms of protein and ATP, and “HNJZ” has the lowest content of vitamin B6. Therefore, rapid evaluation of garlic cultivars can be accomplished successfully by using only the proportion values of three properly selected fluorescent markers.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are among the most important causes of acute diarrhoea in humans throughout the world. Poultry meat is a major source of Campylobacter infections. Sensitive detection methods are necessary to identify contaminated samples. Detection of campylobacters by culturing is slow and tedious, whereas PCR technology offers the potential for rapid and sensitive detection, however, it may be inhibited when used directly for food or pre-enriched food samples. Different methods for sample and/or DNA preparation were studied to find an optimal combination for sensitive PCR detection of C. coli in enrichment broth. Buoyant density centrifugation (BDC) prior to cell lysis improved PCR detection of C. coli by 100-1000-fold. Preston enrichment broth spiked with 101-102 CFU ml-1 was detected positive after 18 h of enrichment. Specific flaA PCR detection of C. coli in enrichment broth following BDC and simple heat lysis of the cells can be conducted within two working days. This study is a part of the undergoing development of a rapid and sensitive molecular procedure for specific detection of C. coli in foods.",

The Fe, Zn, β-carotene, and PA concentrations were found to be in the range 19.31–50.64 mg kg −1 , 12.60–37.18 mg kg −1 , 0.17–8.27 µg g −1 , and 6.59–7.13 g kg −1 , respectively. The genotypes V335, V420, V393, V416, V414, V372, and V351 were identified to have higher concentration of β-carotene, Fe, and Zn but lower amount of PA. Possible availability of the minerals Fe and Zn was determined using molar ratio between PA as inhibitor and β-carotene as promoter for their absorption. The micronutrient molar ratio showed that Fe and Zn traits could be dependent of each other. Low R 2 value revealed relation between β-carotene and kernel colour. The selected genotypes could be considered as potential sources of favourable genes for further breeding programs to develop micronutrient enriched maize cultivars.",

Aac was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by temperature and pH, and exhibited the highest AHL-degrading activity at temperatures of 37 °C and pH of 8. Mg 2+ and Fe 2+ can further increase the AHL-degrading activity. 10 mM EDTA inhibited its activity possibly by chelating the co-factors (metals) required for Aac activity. Tryptophan and arginine were identiﬁed as key components for Aac activity that are critical to its AHL-degrading activity. This study provides useful information on Aac and for V. parahaemolyticus control.",

There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences among genotypes, and the onion genotypes showed a tendency to be classiﬁed according to diﬀerent colours. The cultivars of the same colour exhibited similar tendencies in terms of accumulating most of the analysed components. About 1.78 fold variation in dry matter (%) and 2 fold variation in fresh weight per bulb were recorded among coloured onions. Red genotype D-888-B possessed maximum contents of TS and NRS, while the yellow coloured genotype POH-5 accumulated highest RS and lowest NRS contents. Maximum values of fructans (3.68 g/100 g DW), AIS (6 g/100 g DW), protein (10.61 g/100 g DW), and FAA (4.24 g/100 g DW) were also found in red coloured genotypes D-715-B, D-97-B, PR-305, and D-PS-121-B, respectively. Proline content in diﬀerent genotypes was found to vary about 6.9 fold. The correlation studies showed a positive relationship between most of the quality parameters. Our results suggested that red group genotypes were better than yellow and white groups for all the studied parameters except for RS, which makes red genotypes more suitable for processing purposes.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the eﬀect of wheat–oat ﬂour ratio on the physical properties and β-glucan characteristics of extrudates. Results showed that increasing the wheat–oat ﬂour ratio resulted in a decrease in the water solubility index (r 2 =0.8567) and hardness (r 2 =0.9316), whereas the expansion ratio (r 2 =0.9307) and water absorption index (r 2 =0.9061) increased. Wheat ﬂour generally caused an increase in L values from 57.81 to 62.94 providing bright samples. Few cells were observed at high wheat–oat ﬂour ratios under a scanning electron microscope, and a smooth surface was noted. Meanwhile, the total (r 2 =0.9867) and soluble (r 2 =0.9848) β-glucan contents were inversely proportional to the wheat–oat ﬂour ratio. Extrudates with added wheat ﬂour had a high molecular weight, but wheat ﬂour had no signiﬁcant (P&lt;0.05) eﬀect on the viscosity of β-glucan extracts. Conclusively, incorporation of wheat ﬂour at a wheat–oat ﬂour ratio of 2.33 provides ready-to-eat food based on whole oat ﬂour, on account of improving the texture and providing suﬃcient β-glucan contents (0.806 g/100 g) without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting β-glucan viscosity.",

    "abstract": "After the transformation process and privatisation a rather specific dual structure has been formed in the Hungarian food industry: large food industrial enterprises, dominantly in foreign ownership, fulfilling locally the global strategy of the international firm, and micro - and small - scale firms in domestic ownership. The strategic behaviour of Hungarian food industrial firms have been examined by direct-question surveys and interviews. Based on enterprise- and business-level strategy theories, the objective was to create a taxonomy of strategic patterns of Hungarian food industrial firms. On basis of investigations four characteristic groups of small and medium scale enterprises could be separated from each other. The high cost of technology development, the uneven quality and quantity of agricultural raw material, the concentration of food trade organisations are important hindrance factors of development of food industrial enterprises. The small and medium scale enterprises consider the activity of chambers of producers as an important tool in improving their economic position. In opinion of food industrial entrepreneurs the most important factor of success in privatisation was the knowledge of legal loops and good social network. Under these conditions, the promotion of preparation of newly formed small and medium scale enterprises to meet the demands of EU joining is a necessary precondition of success. The multinational food industrial enterprises forming four groups follow diversified strategies. This variability of multinational firms increases the flexibility and competitiveness of the Hungarian food industry.",

In practice, particularly in the food sector, this kind of linear accumulation has rarely succeeded. In the case of foods, due to a decrease in consumption and vertical competition, not only the profit share, but often some of the costs could not be made good either in the selling price. This failure has an impact on agricultural producers and the food industry, whereas in commerce, the profit-need could be realised easier. In the formation of a food consumer price there are diverse practices in use from the simple markup pricing method to the complex marketing strategies-based price-forming. This paper presents the results of price analyses done in the course of food retail activity investigation.",

    "abstract": "Studies performed so far on different human carcinoma cell lines, as well as numerous case-control and epidemiological studies have given proof to the protective effects of selenium against cancer. However, the anticancer properties of selenium are site-specific. The aim of this work was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of selenium against CaCo2 human colon carcinoma cells, and SW620 lymph node metastasis of colon carcinoma cell line. Three selenium compounds, seleno-DL-cystine (SeC), seleno-L-methionine (SeM) and sodium selenite were used. Initial number of cells was 210 4 and the cells were incubated for 72 h with the aforementioned Se compounds at 10, 100 and 1000 µmol Se concentrations. Cytotoxicity was measured by the MTT cell survival assay. In the present study, decreased viabilities of both CaCo2 and SW620 cells were established following the treatment with selenite, SeC, and SeM. At 10 µmol Se levels all three chemical forms exerted a more or less anticipated cytotoxic effect with viability decreases ranging from 22 to 37%. However, the other two levels of 100 and 1000 µmol Se did not exhibit an expected proportional rise in cytotoxic effect compared to 10 µmol, which warrants further research on the reasons for increased resistance of these cells. Cell morphology also indicates that investigated Se forms induced apoptotic cell death in both cell lines. The results confirm the applicability of Se in the prevention and treatment of the investigated cancer sites.",

CoPS were isolated from 72% of acid-set cheeses ranging from 1.70 to 5.15 log 10 CFU g −1 . CoPS in a number ≥ 4 log 10 CFU g −1 were determined in 5.56% of the acid-set cheese samples. Out of the total number of CoPS isolated from cheese, 37.62% of the isolates have been shown to produce enterotoxins. All isolated strains that produced enterotoxins were identified as Staphylococcus aureus based on the detection of spa gene by PCR. For cheese-derived isolates with CoPS number ≥ 4 log 10 CFU g −1 , it has been proven that they possess sec gene encoding staphylococcal enterotoxin C. According to our results, during the proper fermentation process of artisanal acid-set cheese, the conditions do not support the growth of a critical level of staphylococci or the production of enterotoxins.",

The GABA production by isolate NG16 was therefore thoroughly characterised. The optimal batch culture conditions for GABA production were an initial cell density of 5×10 6 CFU mL −1 , a monosodium glutamate concentration of 2%, an initial pH of 7, a fermentation temperature of 35 °C, and an incubation time of 96 h. Under this cultivation conditions, NG16 produced a maximum GABA yield of 25.52 ± 0.41 mM.",

The main goal of this study was investigation of the effects of ascorbic acid and acerola juice on the changes of some sensorial parameters and bioactive compounds of aseptically filled and industrial scale produced apple juice during storage for 12 months. While the viscosity and pH of apple juice did not change significantly, the ΔE* peaked (20–30) at month 6 of the storage period. The colour of apple juice was lighter than at the beginning of storage. Maximum total phenolic contents were 1,100, 1,400, and 1,250 mg L −1 in the control, ascorbic acid supplemented, and acerola added samples, respectively. Other parameters (antioxidant capacity, ascorbic acid, browning index, etc.) peaked in month 4. Acerola was a good alternative anti-browning and antioxidant agent for the treatment of apple juice in the processing. The antioxidant capacity of apple juice treated with acerola was higher than with ascorbic acid. The results were obtained with industrial samples, thus, they can serve as a very good base for the optimisation process and industrial production without the need for scale-up.",

Green tea (2 mg kg −1 ) was administrated to GT and F+GT groups by oral gavage for eight weeks. Biochemical parameters in serum and oxidative stress markers in the liver were analysed. The liver sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. As of the 3rd week of the experiment, the body weight of rats in the F group showed a statistically significant increase in comparison with the F+GT group. The serum glucose and triglyceride levels of the F+GT group significantly decreased when compared with the F group. The fructose-induced degenerative changes in the liver were reduced with green tea.

Dietary polyphenols, targeting oxidative stress, are at the center of investigations. Our aim was to examine the effects of a polyphenol rich extract on metal element homeostasis and transmethylation ability in non-alcoholic fatty liver model. A ten-day rat model was used (control group, hyperlipidemic group with fat-rich diet, hyperlipidemic group with fat-rich diet and polyphenol supplementation, N = 8 in each group). The hyperlipidemic diet increased the concentration of the majority of the elements with significantly higher contents of B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Se, Si, and Zn in the liver. Further elevation of Al, Pb, and Sn concentrations could be observed in polyphenol supplemented animals. The polyphenol supplement unexpectedly decreased the transmethylation ability of the liver (132.00 vs. 114.15 vs. 92.25 HCHO μg g −1 ) further. The results emphasize the possible role of altered metal and non-metal element concentrations and decreased transmethylation ability in the pathomechanism of fatty liver disease. Dietary supplementation with natural compounds may have undesirable effect as well, there is the necessity to improve the efficacy of polyphenol formulations because of their low oral bioavailability.",

Fifty rats were allocated in 5 groups: control, MS, MS+AMFJ 2.5 , MS+AMFJ 5 , and MS+AMFJ 10 . In the course of 10 weeks, the control group was on a regular rat diet while the other groups received HFHF diet.

In MS rats, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, visceral obesity, and increased adipocyte size were observed. In AMFJ-treated groups, the serum glucose and triglycerides, as well as visceral fat and adipocyte size decreased significantly and did not differ from those of the control group. AMFJ at doses 2.5 and 5.0 mL kg −1 showed an anti-apoptotic activity in adipocytes, while at the dose of 10 mL kg −1 a pro-apoptotic effect was detected. In conclusion, AMFJ could antagonise most of the negative consequences of HFHF diet on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in a rat MS model.",

The basic objective was to change grain-based feeding to nutritionally complete feeds, which ensure rapid growth and more efficient feed conversion rates. This study aimed to utilise empty ponds during the summer period for carp production. Thus, there is no need for fish producers to catch fish in large ponds at the operating water level to satisfy smaller market demands appearing during the summer. The other aim was to compare the meat quality of fish raised on traditional and nutritionally complete feed until market size in the last year of production. Fatty acid profile and the levels of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish fillets were specified, and their ratios were analysed. The result showed that nutritionally complete feed with different fatty acid composition affects the fatty acid composition of carp fillet during the rearing period. Quality of the fillet of carp fed with higher unsaturated fatty acid content became more favourable to the consumers due to health promoting effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

The main physical, structural, and rheological properties of γ-CD-MOF emulgels were investigated. The emulgels prepared with 5% and 10% γ-CD-MOF were durable. The X-ray diffraction patterns proved the existence of β polymorph type lipid crystals. The rheological analyses showed that the gel strength increased with increased γ-CD-MOF concentration, and thixotropic behaviour was observed depending on the gel strength at 10 °C. In addition, the samples were heat resistant proved by rheological temperature ramp tests. Finally, addition of the emulsifiers did not cause any change in the centrifuge stability and colour properties of the emulgels. These samples could be used to prepare different emulsion type food products.",

Purple basil is a medicinal and aromatic herb with many health benefits; it is commonly used for seasoning foods. Semi-shade and tray drying methods were used for drying purple basil for tea production. Physical, chemical, and sensory characteristics of samples were evaluated. Total polyphenol contents of samples increased with drying processes and were between 9.55 and 14.18 mg GAE/g. Colour values decreased with drying. Volatile composition of samples was determined using the SPME/GC-MS system. 2-Propenoic acid, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), and eugenol were the predominant volatile compounds in all samples. In sensory evaluation, samples produced by tray drying with added citric acid had the highest general acceptance. In conclusion, purple basil was evaluated as a suitable plant for herbal tea production due to its easy preparation, pleasant flavour and colour.",

Irradiation has shown to improve microbial safety and expands durability of raw fruits. Undoubtedly, current food processes undesirably affect bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins. Fresh barberry fruit was harvested in Birjand city by methods including “cutting branches” and “collecting fallen fruit under shrubs”, which locally are known as “puffy barberry” and “jewel barberry”, respectively. Some of the fresh barberries were treated by osmotic solution and then they have been dried. Untreated dried fruit was processed by freezing. Osmotic and frozen treatments were packed in polyamide film. Some of the dried jewel/puffy barberries packed in polyamide film were irradiated at doses of 0, 3, 5, and 10 kGy. All samples were stored at 4 and 25 °C for 6 months. Effects of barberry types (puffy/jewel), processes, storage time and temperature on chemical, microbial, and pest characteristics of dried barberry fruit were evaluated. Puffy barberry gamma irradiated with 5 kGy after 6 months of storage at 4 °C showed acceptable properties. Irradiation and storage at 4 °C were reported as optimal processing and storage conditions for barberry fruit.",

    "abstract": "According to the thorough analysis of S. YODA 1 from the mid nighties, the \"explosive rate at which the world's population continues to increase\" (now 6 billion and perhaps by the year 2050 it will have reached 10-12 billion), due to \"the accompanying and unavoidable increases in energy consumption and the resulting reality of the deterioration of the environment, the human race is faced with a triad of serious problems -economic growth, consumption of energy and resources, and conservation of the environment -in other words, the world finds itself facing a formidable Trilemma\".This threefold system of demands undoubtedly requires new ideas, approaches, a totally new way of thinking of the mankind.The continuing wasting application of energy recources, the large-scale mass production, large-scale consumption and large-scale disposal of refuse that made possible to permanently raise the living standard on one side of our Planet go together with the fact that there are many regions all over the world that simply suffer from shortage of food.This can be interestingly and convincingly seen, if we look at the academic and industrial research problems that concerne scientists of the western hemisphere: problems of the quality, packaging, ingredients like prebiotics and probiotics (generally the relationship of health and diet), functional foods and organic foods, while at the same time in the so-called \"developing countries\" the main problem is still to find the mode of satisfactory mass food production.By the opinion of many analysts the forthcoming century will start a new age (side by side with the revolutionary Microelectronics) of development (or perhaps we are already in it): the Biosociety Era (very well foretold by K. Ereky, the \"inventor\" of the word biotechnology in 1919) in which every segment of human life will be strongly affected by bio-things (bioenergy, biomaterials and bioprocesses) and hopefully good contributions will be given to the solutions of the contradictions between rich and poor along with the trilemma of development.This Biosociety considerably depends on the uprising biotechnology that is harnessing the natural biological processes of microbes, and plant and animal cells for specific industrial (including food) uses.As a matter of fact biotechnology is an \"old wine in a new barrel\" and it was a long long way from the beginning of the ancient beer production (can be seen on a fabulous Mezopotamian clay tablet in the Louvre) to the",

    "abstract": "At present, concerns about food safety focus on microbiological problems.A very different situation prevailed from the mid-1950s until a few years ago, when the presence of residues of man-made chemicals in food preoccupied food scientists and toxicologists as well as legislators, the media, and the general public.Such chemicals were suspected of increasing the risk of cancer in man, and a first important outcome of that thinking was the introduction in 1957 by U.S. Representative James J. Delaney of amendments to the U.S. food law, containing the famous Delaney Clause, which stated that no food additive will \"be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.\"Pesticide residues in processed food were classified as food additives, with the result that in processed food the Delaney Clause allowed no trace of a pesticide that had caused cancer in animal tests, regardless of how exaggerated the dose administered to the test animals may have been.Developments in food legislation in other countries were much influenced by the American model.A culmination of chemophobia was reached with the publication in the United States of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962.The book was soon translated into many languages and became a world bestseller.It opened with an apocalyptic fantasy: birds vanished, baby pigs died, hens ceased to have chicks, people grew ill, and there were no bees to pollinate the apple blossoms.Man had caused this, implied Carson, by using chemicals recklessly.Man-made chemicals rendered toxic the air, the water, the soil, and the food.We were, said Carson, being progressively poisoned by the food from farm, market, and grocery, which had been contaminated by chemical pesticides and food additives, all of which were interacting in unknown ways in our bodies.For Carson, nature was benevolent, whereas modern technology was hideous.In her opinion, few natural carcinogens existed, such as arsenic, radioactive minerals and ultraviolet light; the bulk of carcinogens present on earth was produced by man.Toward the end of the book, she warned that the use of man-made chemicals could wipe out the entire human race in about twenty years.The influence of Carson on our time can hardly be exaggerated.All over the world, the use of pesticides and food additives was more and more restricted in the following years.Enormous sums were invested in animal studies designed to test the carcinogenic properties of various chemicals.Protocols of such studies were refined in order to make sure that no adverse effect of a test substance would remain undetected: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was administered to the test animals, animal strains known to be particularly prone to developing cancer were chosen, the tests were conducted during the whole lifetime of the animals and were even continued in several following generations.The sensitivity of analytical methods to detect residues of pesticides and other xenobiotics in food was enormously improved.Large scale epidemiological studies were initiated with the aim of finding correlations between eating habits and cancer rate in population groups.",

Fried rapeseed oil was mixed separately with 3 levels of MgO (2, 4 and 6% w/w) and activated charcoal (2, 6 and 10% w/w). For all the treatments the average % improvement of quality indices was statistically analysed. Increasing levels of both activated carbon and MgO significantly affected (P<0.05) the different quality parameters tested so far.",

Physiological consequences of these disturbances are expressed in certain cases only in incomplete ripening, while in irrevocable cases they are manifested as serious tissue damages such as non-parasitic storage disorders known as core flush, soft scald, and internal or external CO 2 injuries. It has been widely demonstrated in pome fruits that in a transient phase of maturity, during the pre-climacteric, ripening of pome fruits is preceded by changes in gene expression, detachment of new mRNA-s and the synthesis of compounds that are certainly essential for ripening processes. It is likely that this transient phase is closely related to changes on molecular level, and therefore, it may be considered as critical when external effects influence fruit life.",

    "abstract": "The number of reported foodborne diseases -one of the major causes of gastrointestinal illnesses (GI) -is increasing, and still it represents only a small fraction of the people becoming ill due to contaminated food.Apart from the acute symptoms a small percentage of foodborne disease cases may develop long-lasting sequelae, i.e. chronic diarrhoea, reactive arthritis, and these affect the quality of life and have financial consequences also for the individual as well as for the society.The morbidity and mortality from foodborne diseases are also difficult to judge, and are probably underestimated.The foodborne diseases also mean a great impact on the society -due to human illness, in some cases death, the health care and public health system, because of the recall and destruction of food, loss of sales to the food industry the economy are under constraints.Because of drastic changes in the way of life (increase in travelling, importing exotic foods, increasing number of people being more vulnerable to foodborne diseases, changing in food processing and packaging technologies, globalisation of food supply etc.) as well as in the environment (antibiotic resistance, global warming, \"emerging pathogens etc.), there is a great likelihood for the increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases.The common effort of food scientists, authorities and food producers is to lower the incidence of foodborne diseases.The production of safe foods is alone not enough, the safe handling is equally important.The personnel producing and handling different food items should be aware of the meaning of safety, of what to do to produce safe food and of handling foods safely in order to reduce the likelihood of foodborne diseases.The consumers also hold responsibility in this context.Since the \"absence of any risk\" is unattainable, every tool, scientific and administrative (HACCP system, risk analysis) should be used to minimise the risk of occurrence of pathogens in food and food contact areas.The book covers all type of foods from farm to fork, considering the processing technologies and handling, and discusses the risk factors from all aspects and investigates how to overtake them.The book consists of the following chapters: 1. Safe handling of raw meat and poultry products; 2. Safe handling of dairy and egg products; 3. Safe handling of fruits and vegetables; 4. Safe handling of seafood; 5.

    "abstract": "The food safety issue -and the foodborne diseases of microbial origin on the first place -is one of the main concern of the food industry and health authorities in the new millennium, as it has been emphasised by many scientists (i.e.Farkas, J.: Editorial, Acta Alimentaria (30, 2001).The importance of foodborne micro-organisms cannot be overestimated, since hardly 20% of the reported foodborne diseases are resolved, and the causative agents of the rest are unknown in the United States -and probably the situation does not differ very much in other countries either.It also has to be considered that only a small portion of foodborne illness episodes are reported and investigated annually even in the developed world, and the situation in the third world is much worse.With the societal and consumer habit changes (more travelling and eating out, special diets, need for minimally processed foods, preference for additive-and preservative-free foods, increase in the number of immuno-suppressed, chronically ill and advanced age people, etc.), the food safety risks become greater.New regulation HACCP introduced recently helps the producer to maintain the microbiological quality of food products.The quantitative risk assessment and the predictive modelling relying on science provide the scientific base necessary for regulatory decision-makers.The majority of antimicrobial treatments applied singly or in combination (hurdles) are generally effective against pathogens that need to reach high numbers and to produce toxins to cause human illness.In recent years, however, the concerns have been focused on pathogens infecting in low numbers (i.e.E. coli O157:H7, certain Salmonella serotypes, parasites and viruses), or on those that proliferate also at refrigeration temperature (like Listeria monocytogenes).It has also been indicated recently that pathogenic bacteria develop systems that assist them to survive and adapt to environmental stresses, and that exposure to one stress and activation of protective genes often lead to cross-protection against other stresses.Food environments are generally stressful for bacteria (i.e.low moisture level, restricted availability of nutrients, some acids, chemicals are at stressful level, presence of competitive microflora, etc.).Stresses present in foods naturally or artificially have great effect on gene expression in bacterial pathogens, and some of the genes might be associated with bacterial virulence.Preservation technologies face besides the well-known \"traditional\" problems the new ones discussed above.In the last years a number of new food preservation technologies have been developed and have become or are becoming applicable in the industry.Some, however effective they are, have only limited application area, because of the changes in the quality of food, and some are impractical to use in certain products.",

    "abstract": "In the commercial processing of croquettes a 80 °C heat treatment for 30 min is applied to the raw materials to make a semi-solid paste called „bechamel”. Since the heat treatment is not that of sterilization, some micro-organisms surviving it may proliferate in the next steps, which could introduce two microbial hazards; the presence of pathogenic bacteria and croquettes spoilage. To evaluate microbiological hazards, microbiological analysis of the bechamel cooled and stored under refrigeration following commercial processing were developed at different times of cooling. In addition a fast cooling method was assayed. Immediately after heat treatment used to obtain the bechamel, microbial counts were always under 1 log CFU g-1, except for mesophilic aerobes which were at least of 1.2 log CFU g-1. During cooling used in commercial process of croquettes, levels of most micro-organisms investigated showed high increases as compared with behamel after cooking. In this step mesophilic organisms, psychotropic organisms and yeast reached levels of around 6 log CFU g-1. Enterococci counts increased during cool storage, although always were at levels below 3.2 log CFU g-1.EnterobacteriaceaeandClostridiumsp. only slightly increased at the end of cold storage reaching levels of around 3 log CFU g-1. Although rates which could be considered as being inadmissible were reached at day 5, the use of over 1-day old bechamel could be associated with microbiological sanitary hazards or with the spoilage of the croquettes made afterwards. In contrast, the bechamel cooled at -20 °C air temperature for 12 h, only showed total aerobic counts of under 1 log CFU g-1. Cooling of bechamel is a decisive critical control point and a fast cooling should be considered in the implementation of an HACCP program in the prepared and frozen croquettes process.",

However, statistically significant differences were detected between 12 and 25 °C as well as 12 and 37 °C ( P &lt; 0.05). All isolates were significantly different in biofilm production by the MTT assay at all tested temperatures. Furthermore, a relationship between the presence of the icaABCD genes and biofilm formation was observed. The agr type I was the most prevalent (54.4%) among the isolates, followed by agr type II (41.3%) and agr type III (9.6%).

The results show that the fermented wheat flour contains secondary fermentation metabolites (e.g. acetic, lactic and pyruvic acids). Both fermented wheat flour and potassium sorbate have antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis . The sensory evaluation demonstrated that fermented wheat flour in the recommended concentration range had no impact on sensory quality. Therefore, fermented wheat flour represents a potential substitution for conventional potassium in bakery products.",

The thermal effusivity is one of the less explored thermophysical parameters.

This paper describes the application of a relatively new inverse photopyroelectric method (IPPE) to determine thermal effusivity of dehydrated whey protein isolate and egg white powder versus protein content. In both cases the effusivity values decreased linearly with increasing protein content. One percent increase in protein content of whey protein isolate and egg white lead to 6.5 and 7.2 Ws 1/2 m −2 K −1 decrease in effusivity values, respectively.",

Beside the raw material quality (grapes), the quality of wines can be fundamentally influenced by the technological conditions applied in the wine making process. Yeast and other microorganisms play a key role in the formation of metabolites during alcoholic fermentation. In this study, the effects of autochthonous or selected wine yeasts ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and fermentation temperatures (15 °C and 19 °C) were tested on major monoterpenes contents of wines during the period 2016–2017. The obtained values show that the highest contents of linalool (24.36 μg L −1 ) and hotrienol (11.84 μg L −1 ) were determined in wine samples produced with active (selected) wine yeast at lower temperature. Sensory evaluation results indicated that monoterpenes can have a positive effect on the overall sensory quality of Sauvignon Blanc wines, despite the fact that their determined concentrations in the evaluated samples were not higher than their threshold values.",

Some physical, chemical, and sensory properties of pasta samples were evaluated and compared with control samples prepared with durum wheat semolina. As the concentrations of shorts increased in the pasta formulation, the brightness values decreased and the redness values increased. The ash, fat, total dietary fibre, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and mineral content increased with the use of shorts. The highest solid loss value (10.28%) was found in pasta samples containing 45% shorts. The addition of shorts up to 30% presented similar overall acceptability scores to control pasta samples. As a result, it was observed that as the shorts content of the samples increase, the nutritional value and the levels of some components that affect health positively, increase as well. So, the samples containing 30% shorts appear to be at forefront due to health effects and overall acceptability scores.",

The results show that processing, composition and type of powder substances as well as the dispersion medium (water or milk) have important role in the formation of the rheological parameters in the beginning and during storage. The time of cream formation is shorter in water than in milk but the samples prepared with water loose their concistency faster during storage. The reason for such behaviour is the faster separation of water from their structure.
