The morphology, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and biodegradation behavior of these blends have been investigated. The results indicate that PLA/PHB blends are immiscible but exhibit molecular interaction. PHB is highly crystallizable, and it enhances the recrystallization of PLA and consequently increases the heat distortion temperature. Adding PLA to PHB improves the mechanical properties of PHB. In fact, blending with PHB is also a viable approach to improve the mechanical properties of PLA because the PLA/PHB 75/25 blend exhibits significantly improved tensile properties compared with pure PLA. This is due to the finely dispersed PHB crystals acting as a filler and nucleating agent in PLA. The biodegradability, studied by weight change measurement at room temperature, improved with increasing PHB content. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The morphology, chemical structure, thermal behavior, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity and drug release properties of drug‐loaded PVA/CS composite nanofibers before and after crosslinking were characterized. The results showed that the morphology of PVA/CS composite nanofibers was not been destroyed in both crosslinking and in vitro drug release process. The Young's modulus, tensile strength, thermal properties and hydrophobicity of crosslinked PVA/CS composite nanofibers significantly increased in comparison with those of PVA/CS (without crosslinking) due to the formation of crosslinking network structure. In vitro release studies showed that crosslinked PVA/CS composite nanofibers had lower drug release rate and smaller amount of drug burst release than that of PVA/CS. According to release exponent “ n ”, the release of ampicillin sodium from crosslinked PVA/CS composite nanofibers fit to the Fickian diffusion mechanism. Those results demonstrate the potential utilization of crosslinked PVA/CS composite nanofibers as a transdermal drug delivery system.",

The reaction took place in an autoclave at 120–200°C with aqueous NaOH solutions and at 110–120°C with a nonaqueous solution of KOH in methyl Cellosolve. The disodium or dipotassium terephthalate received was treated with sulfuric acid and terephthalic acid (TPA) of high purity was separated. The 1 H NMR spectrum of the TPA revealed an about 2% admixture of isophthalic acid together with the pure 98% TPA. The purity of the TPA obtained was tested by determining its acidity and by polymerizing it with ethylene glycol by using tetrabutyl titanate as catalyst. A simple theoretical model was developed to describe the hydrolysis rate. The activation energy calculated was 99 kJ/mol. This method is very useful in recycling of PET bottles and other containers because nowadays TPA is replacing dimethyl terephthalate (the traditional monomer) as the main monomer in the industrial production of PET. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, simple blends often have poor mechanical properties and unstable morphologies. Compatibilization of such blends is necessary. Preformed graft or block copolymers have been traditionally added to act as compatibilizers. Another route, however, is to generate these copolymer compatibilizers in situ during melt blending using functionalized polymers. In this review, a variety of reactive polymers that have been utilized in the reactive compatibilization of polymer blends is examined. They are classified into six major categories according to the types of reactive groups they have, namely, maleic anhydride, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid derivatives, primary and secondary amines, hydroxyl and epoxide, and reactive groups capable of ionic bonding. Their preparation methods and applications and the chemical reactions they undergo during melt blending are presented. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As large components of fiber reinforced composite materials are being more frequently produced by Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), a computer simulation of the injection process can help the mold designer to accomplish three important tasks: (1) to ensure a complete filling of the mold through adequate positioning of the injection ports and of the air vents; (2) to verify the integrity of the mold during the filling process through knowledge of the pressure distribution; and (3) to optimize the production cycle using information about the filling time. The resin impregnation is usually modeled as a flow through a porous medium. It is governed by Darcy's law, which states that the flow rate is proportional to the pressure gradient. In our model, Darcy equation is solved at each time step inside the saturated part of the mold using nonconforming finite elements. This method was chosen because the approximated flow rates, contrary to conforming finite elements, satisfy locally the important physical condition of resin conservation across inter‐element boundaries. This permits simplification of the numerical procedure. It is no longer necessary to resort to a control volume approach to move the flow front forward. The resin pressure distribution and the resin front positions are obtained by the computer simulation and calculated results for selected mold geometries are compared with experimental observations. Molds with inserts, multiple injection ports, and the case of anisotropic preforms can be analyzed by the computer program. © 1993 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Injection molding process and quality control has been an active research area for many years, as part quality and yield requirements become more stringent. This paper reviews the state‐of‐the‐art research and development in injection molding control. It organizes prior studies into four categories, namely, process setup, machine control, process control, and quality control, and presents the distinction and connection of these different levels of control. This paper further reviews and compares the typical variables, models, and control methods that have been proposed and employed for those control tasks. Strictly speaking, real online quality control without human intervention has yet to be realized, primarily due to the lack of transducers for online, real time quality response measurement, and a robust model that correlates the control variables with quantitative quality measurements. Based on the research progress to date, this paper suggests that the different levels of control tasks have to be integrated into a multilevel quality control system, and that the quality sensor and the process and quality model are the two most important areas for further advancement in injection molding control. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract When considering energy consumption and environmental issues, solvent‐resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) based on polymeric materials emerges as a process for substituting conventional separation processes of organic solutions, such as distillation, which consume high amounts of energy. Because SRNF does not involve phase transition, this process can potentially decrease the energy consumption and solvent waste and increase the yield of active components. Such improvements could significantly benefit a number of fields, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and catalysis recovery, among others. Therefore, SRNF has gained a lot of attention since the recent introduction of solvent‐stable polymeric materials in the manufacture of nanofiltration membranes. The membrane materials and the membrane structures depending on the fabrication methods determine the separation performance of polymeric SRNF membranes. Therefore, this article gives a comprehensive overview of the current state‐of‐art technologies of generating membrane materials and corresponding fabrication methods for SRNF membranes made from polymeric materials expected to provide the most benefit. The transport mechanisms and the corresponding models of SRNF membranes in organic media are also reviewed to better understand the mass transfer process. Various SRNF applications, such as in pharmaceutical and catalyst, among others, are also discussed. Finally, the difficulties and future research directions to overcome the challenges faced by SRNF processes are proposed.",

The dynamic rheological behavior and morphology of the blends were studied using a parallel‐plate rheometer and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The results showed that the shear‐thinning tendency of blends became stronger with increasing PBAT content. Moreover, at low frequencies, the complex viscosity, storage modulus and loss modulus for blends with 20 wt% PBAT content were higher than that of other samples when PBAT content was less than 50 wt%. Based on SEM images, three distinct morphologies—spherical droplet, elongated fibrous structure, and co‐continuous structure—were observed as the content of PBAT increased from 5 to 50 wt%. When the PBAT content reached 70 wt% and above, the morphology became droplets again, with PLA droplets dispersing within the PBAT matrix. In addition, the PLA droplets in the PBAT/PLA (80/20 w/w) blend were smaller and more regular than the PBAT droplets in the PLA/PBAT (80/20 w/w) blend, despite the same composition ratio. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The printed stent could be compressed into a temporary shape with thinner diameter easy for implantation. The compressed stent had excellent shape fixity and could maintain its temporary shape at room temperature for storage.

Then, a series of gelatin‐based hydrogel nanocomposites containing CuO nanoparticles were prepared by immersion of gelatin hydrogel in CuCl 2 solution with different concentrations. Gelatin was chosen, due to its cheapness, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility. The structure and morphology of hydrogel nanocomposites were characterized by a number of techniques such as FT‐IR, XRD, energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Then, swelling behavior of synthesized hydrogel nanocomposites in distilled water and different saline solutions was investigated. Their sensitivity to pH, biodegradability, and gel content was determined. Moreover, the water uptake and shrinking kinetics of hydrogel nanocomposites were evaluated. Finally, they were used as drug delivery agent, and the different concentrations effect of CuO nanoparticles present within the hydrogel nanocomposites compared with neat hydrogel on mentioned tests was studied.",

These cellular polymer films can be produced by stretching or foaming, but depending on the application and conditions, different polymers, such as polypropylene (PP), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene naphthalate), poly(tetrafluoro ethylene), cross‐linked PP, and some cyclo‐olefines, have been considered. Nevertheless, cellular PP was the most investigated material because of its outstanding properties such as high piezoelectric d 33 coefficient, flexibility, good fatigue resistance, good charge trapping properties, and low cost. In this review, recent advances related to the materials used for ferroelectret applications and their processing are discussed. The effect of different parameters such as pressure, electrical breakdown strength of the gas phase, presence of fillers, and service temperature on the d 33 coefficient is presented and discussed.",

Essential oils (EOs) as naturally occurring functional ingredients have shown great prospects in active food packaging. EOs can inhibit the growth of superficial food pathogens, modify nutritious values without affecting the sensory qualities of food, and prolong the shelf life when used in food packaging as an active ingredient. Since 2016, various reports have demonstrated that combinations of electrospun fibers and encapsulated EOs could offer promising results when used as food packaging. Such electrospun platforms have encapsulated either pure EOs or their complexation with other antibacterial agents to prolong the shelf life of food products through sustained release of active ingredients. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the essential oil-loaded electrospun fibers that have been applied as active food packaging material.",

Taking into account the polymeric waste, recycling is the intentional action that is aimed at reducing the amount of waste deposited in landfills by industrial use of this waste to obtain raw materials and energy. The incineration of waste leads to recovery of the energy only. Recycling methods divide on mechanical (reuse of waste as a full-valuable raw material for further processing), chemical (feedstock recycling), and organic (composting and anaerobic digestion). The type of recycling is selected in terms of the polymeric material, origin of the waste, possible toxicity of the waste, and its flammability. The (bio)degradable polymers show the suitability for every recycling methods. But recycling method should be used in such a form that it is economically justified in a given case. Organic recycling in a circular economy is considered to be the most appropriate technology for the disposal of compostable waste. It is addressed for plastics capable for industrial composting such as cellulose films, starch blends, and polyesters. The biological treatment of organic waste leads also to a decrease of landfills and thereby reducing methane emissions from them. If we add to their biodegradability the absence of toxicity, we have a biotechnological product of great industrial interest. The paper presents the overview on end-of-life options useful for the (bio)degradable polymers. The principles of the circular economy and its today development were also discussed.",

Below this temperature, PNIPAM is hydrophilic, while above it, the polymer becomes hydrophobic, making it ideal for thermosensitive drug delivery systems (DDSs). In tissue engineering, PNIPAM provides a biocompatible, nontoxic and stimuli‐responsive surface for cell culture. Its nontoxic nature ensures safety in medical applications. PNIPAM enhances biosensing diagnostics through its affinity for biomolecules, improving accuracy. Widely used in hydrogels, smart textiles, soft robotics and various medical applications, PNIPAM adapts to environmental changes. Its straightforward synthesis allows for the creation of diverse copolymers and composites, applicable in selective reactions and conjugations with fluorescent tags or chemical modifications. PNIPAM’s versatility extends to pH‐responsive alternatives, broadening its application spectrum. Practical examples include phase separation in water treatment and cleaning processes. This discussion explores PNIPAM’s biomedical and drug delivery applications, particularly in cancer treatment, photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), gene delivery and medical imaging. Additionally, it highlights PNIPAM’s noncancerous applications, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of oncogenes and detailed imaging of deep and tumour tissues.",

As is well known, in the near future, the role of concrete will continue to be primary in the construction of buildings and structures due to increasing demand. However, despite its advantages, this important building material is not without flaws. In particular, due to its porosity, concrete is highly permeable to liquids, making it insufficiently resistant to frost and corrosion and sometimes even brittle. At the same time, concrete mixtures used in modern construction must meet requirements such as good adhesive properties, improved waterproofing, high workability, retention of rheological characteristics over time, and the potential for increased strength. Today, the use of polymer additives as modifiers to improving concrete is particularly relevant. The purpose of this review is to examine recent advances in understanding the impact of polymer additives of both inorganic and organic nature on improving concrete properties.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrasonic welding is considered as one of the most promising welding techniques for continuous fiber‐reinforced thermoplastic composites. Intermolecular friction within the bulk, resulting from the application of ultrasonic waves applied on the surfaces, generates the heat required for welding to take place at the interface of the joining members via the so‐called “energy directors” (EDs). Energy directors consist of resin protrusions or artificially produced asperities on the composite surfaces and play an important role both in the welding process and in the quality of the resulting welds. This paper presents the results of a study on the effects of configuration of different EDs on the ultrasonic welding of carbon fiber/polyetherimide advanced thermoplastic composites in a near‐field setup. Triangular EDs were molded on the surface of consolidated composite laminates with a hot platen press. Single lap‐shear‐welded samples were produced to investigate the influence of the orientation of the EDs with respect to the load direction, as well as the configuration of multiple EDs. The results indicate that the configuration of multiple transverse EDs was more effective in covering the overlap area, once the resin has melted, causing only a minimum fiber disruption at the welding interface. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microcellular foam injection molding provides many advantages over conventional foams and their unfoamed counterparts, but its applications are limited by visible surface quality problems such as silver streaks and swirl marks. In this study, we propose a variable mold temperature method to improve the surface quality of molded parts. Electromagnetic induction heating is used in combination with water cooling to achieve rapid mold surface temperature control during the microcellular foam injection molding process. The effect of processing parameters, such as mold temperature, melt temperature, and injection velocity on the part surface quality, was investigated using surface roughness measurements and visual inspection of the molded parts. The results show that using induction heating to increase the mold surface temperature from 100°C to 160°C can decrease surface roughness of polycarbonate moldings from 25 µm to 6.5 µm. It was also found that the flow marks formed by gas bubbles on the part surface can be removed completely at a mold temperature of 160°C. Further increases in the mold temperature show slight improvements in the surface roughness up to 180°C, at which point the surface roughness starts to level off at 5 µm. This surface roughness value reflects an 80% improvement without a significant increase in cycle time over parts molded at a mold temperature of 60°C using water heating. Higher melt temperature and faster injection speed will also improve the surface quality of microcellular injection molded parts but not as significantly. The usefulness of a variable mold temperature in improving part surface quality during microcellular foam injection molding has been successfully demonstrated. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A heated mold with temperature above the polymer‐softening temperature is highly desired in precision injection molding. The elevated mold temperature reduces unwanted freezing during the injection stage, thus improving moldability and enhancing part quality. The resulting advantages include, but are not limited to, longer flow path, improved feature replication and surface transcription, reduced molecular orientations and residual stresses, smoother surfaces of composites, better control of crystallization, stronger weld lines, etc. However, the heated mold needs to be rapidly cooled during the cooling stage to maintain a short cycle time. Despite the large body of available literature, mold rapid heating and cooling does not represent a well‐developed area of practice. Development of capable techniques for rapidly heating and cooling a mold with a relatively large mass is technically challenging because of the constraints set by the heat transfer process and the endurance limits set by the material properties. This article attempts to offer a constructive overview on the state of the art in mold rapid heating and cooling, with the goal of explaining the working mechanisms and providing unbiased accounts of the pros and cons of existing processes and techniques. Successful applications of existing processes are highlighted and potential improvements of these processes are suggested. The article further intends to provide a fundamental understanding of the constituent elements and corresponding building blocks needed in a workable mold with a rapid heating and cooling capability. An increased understanding of these elements will facilitate the development of more capable new processes. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As a continuation of our previous review on 1D nano‐PANI (D. H. Zhang and Y. Y. Wang, Mater Sci Eng B 2006, 134(1), 9–19), the research and development of 1D nano‐PANI, including both syntheses and applications, in the past 5 years (2006–2010) are reviewed in this paper. Newly invented chemical methods for fabrication of 1D nano‐PANI, such as solid‐state polymerization, seeding polymerization, UV light‐ and microwave‐assisted polymerization, plasma‐induced polymerization, porous membrane controlled polymerization, and vapor phase polymerization, are briefly reviewed, and morphology controlling of the nanostructures during several synthesizing processes are reported and discussed at first. The formation mechanisms and key factors that affect the morphology evolution of the 1D nano‐PANI are discussed. Novel features of 1D nano‐PANI, such as aligned or oriented, longer, self‐doped, chiral, derivative, carbonized, and dendritic PANI, are summarized. Finally, newly exploited applications of 1D nano‐PANI in the past few years, such as sensors (e.g., gases sensors, biosensors, moisture or humidity sensors, TNT sensors, taste sensors, and noble metal ion sensors), absorbents, catalysts, actuators, supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, electrochromic devices, hydrogen storages, surface modifiers, field‐effect transistors, and functional materials, are discussed in detail. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on the PVT (pressure–volume–temperature) behavior of polymer, a novel process control methodology for injection molding is presented in this study. With the present control method, the process pressure is controlled by cavity temperature instead of time, which is used in a conventional injection‐molding process; thus the relationship between P (pressure) and T (temperature) can be controlled, which means that the V (volume) or part weight can be controlled because of the invariable PVT relationship of polymer. The objective of this study is to validate the feasibility of this process control methodology and examine its consistency. Experiments were conducted on an injection‐molding machine with an opened‐loop microprocessor controller. The weight of the molded parts serves as the main measure to probe the process capabilities. The variation of the mold temperature was monitored. The experimental results reveal that the present PVT control method yields much better part quality and uniform part weight than the conventional P–time (pressure–time) control method. It is also proved that the novel process control methodology can be used to accommodate the product weight change due to variation of the melt or mold temperature. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Furthermore, these cross‐linked networks were also tested for the release of Loxoprofen sodium hydrate (LSH). Drug was loaded by diffusion method and showed pH‐dependent drug release characteristics. Korsmeyer–Peppas model is the best fit model to explain drug release from the cross‐linked network. Maximum swelling, drug loading, and release has been observed at pH 7.4. It is concluded that highly stable SA and AA based polymeric matrixes are developed. These polymeric matrixes have potential to be used as a carrier for controlled delivery of LSH.",

In this work, the use of alginate blends was tested in a novel production methodology of therapeutic dosage forms based on polymeric chain reticulation phenomena induced by exposure to bivalent ions. Two kinds of sodium alginate were used to obtain gel films (structured films) in blends with Pluronic F127®. The blends were considered for applications in gel paving of drug‐eluting stents. Sodium alginate was also used in shell–core particle production (structured particles) to obtain shell‐barrier reducing drug release in the preparative steps (see wash operations). Both structures, films and particles, were obtained using Cu 2+ and Ca 2+ ions, respectively. Film/shell barrier properties were tested in dissolution experiments using vitamin B12 as an active molecule model. Experimental work demonstrated that the alginate composition is a crucial point in defining reticulated structures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methacrylic acid (MAA) was grafted to impart pH‐responsive character, whereas benzoyl peroxide (BPO) was applied for simultaneous grafting and cross‐linking polymerization. The hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared , thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and X‐ray diffractometry. Scanning electron microscopic photographs were taken to analyze the surface morphology. Swelling behavior was analyzed to assess better performance of biodegradable hydrogels for optimized loading and release of the drug targeted to the colon. Gel fraction, swelling ratio, diffusion coefficient, drug loading, and cumulative release increased with an increase of pectin ratio and decreased with an increase of MAA and EGDMA ratio. Strategically, hydrogels with higher amounts of pectin were prepared for complete degradation in the colon. Our investigations indicate that pectin‐ co ‐poly(MAA) hydrogel is a suitable delivery system developed for oral delivery of the drug targeted to the colon.",

The addition of graphene nanosheets to polymer matrix improves existing and incorporate new properties on such nanocomposites for various engineering applications. For instance, graphene nanosheets in polymer matrix are believed to form microcapacitors. Each microcapacitor contributes to the effective capacitance and dielectric constant of the composite. Although research has proved polymer/graphene composites as high dielectric constant materials, the major challenges facing their practical applications are high energy dissipation, high dielectric loss, and low electric field strength. In view of this, many researchers have shown efforts to minimize energy losses associated with polymer/graphene composites by insulating graphene nanosheets with different organic and inorganic substances. This is believed to prevent direct contact of graphene nanosheets and reduce the high mobility of π‐orbital or free electrons in the polymer matrix. However, maintaining high dielectric constant at low dielectric loss in polymer/graphene composites has not been achieved. If this challenge can be addressed in the future, polymer/graphene composites can yield energy storage capacity comparable with those of electrochemical capacitors. Therefore, this review considered energy storage and loss capacity of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/graphene nanocomposites from the perspective of electrical and dielectric properties. This article to the best of our ability reviewed various research results on dielectric constants/losses, breakdown strengths, energy densities, and electrical and thermal conductivities of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/graphene nanocomposites.

Also, a complete analysis of the internal air temperature profiles was performed to determine the thermal behavior of PLA during the rotational molding cycle. The results showed that rotomolded biocomposites were successfully produced but had higher porosity than compression molded ones due to the absence of pressure while forming. This led to different level of mechanical properties reduction as fiber content increases. Nevertheless, for compression‐molded biocomposites, crystallinity (30% at 30 wt.%), tensile modulus (14% at 30 wt.%) and impact strength (71% at 40 wt.%) improvements were obtained compared to neat PLA .",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the damaging effects of antimicrobial resistance relating to wound management and infections have driven the ongoing development of composite wound dressing mats containing natural compounds, such as plant extracts and their derivatives. The present research reports the fabrication of novel electrospun Polycaprolactone (PCL)/Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)/Chitosan (CS) fiber mats loaded with Eugenol (EUG), an essential oil, known for its therapeutic properties. The electrospun fiber mats were prepared via electrospinning from either water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), total porosity measurements, and water contact angle. The in vitro EUG release profile and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also evaluated. The obtained results proved that the EUG was loaded efficiently into electrospun PCL/PVA/CS fiber mats and the two W/O and O/W emulsions prepared from the PCL/PVA/CS (7 : 3 : 1) and PCL/PVA/CS (3 : 7 : 1) revealed porosity within the ideal range of 60–90%, even when EUG was loaded. The measured contact angle values showed that the O/W emulsion exhibited a more hydrophilic character and the wettability noticeably decreased after adding EUG in both emulsion blends. Furthermore, the electrospun PCL/PVA/CS fiber mats demonstrated a rapid release of EUG during the first 8 hours, which enhanced gradually afterward (up to 120 hours). Moreover, an efficient antibacterial activity against S. aureus (inhibition ratios of 92.43% and 83.08%) and P. aeruginosa (inhibition ratios of 94.68% and 87.85%) was displayed and the in vitro cytotoxic assay demonstrated that the normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) remained viable for at least 7 days, after direct contact with the produced electrospun fiber mats.

One composite would have a ~1/4‐monolayer polymer coverage, while the other had a ~2‐monolayer coverage. The produced composite materials were characterized in the adsorptive behavior of Pb 2+ from aqueous solution. When there was less PAA produced in a nanocomposite sample, there was higher Pb 2+ sorption capacity due to potentially less blocked alumina pores by in situ formed PAA . Isothermal and kinetic models for Pb 2+ sorption were applied by considering the effects of the initial Pb 2+ concentration and the contact time. The adsorption kinetics was best expressed using the pseudo‐second‐order equation. Through the isothermal studies, the maximum Pb 2+ monolayer adsorption capacity of 167.79 mg/g was recorded for the composite with higher PAA loading.",

Hydrogels having stimulus‐responsive properties are a few of the desired properties for real‐life applications.

The properties of hydrogels were optimized using various characterization techniques. Successful GO incorporation into the CS matrix was clearly confirmed by Fourier transform infrared analysis. Scanning electron microscope and TEM micrographs portray rough and porous surface morphology of the composite hydrogels. The prepared hydrogels have demonstrated enhanced thermal properties due to the incorporation of GO . To investigate the pH ‐responsive behavior, the pH ‐dependent study for the hydrogels was carried out in acidic and basic media. Increasing the amount of GO content inside the gel imparted enhanced mechanical properties to the hydrogel. There was a sharp increase in tensile strength from 4.37 to 20.96 MP a accompanied by an increase in Young's modulus from 0.122 to 0.364 MP a. DMA confirmed better elastic behavior of the composite hydrogel. The hydrogel exhibited fast self‐healing property when cleaved under ambient conditions.

Afterward, a starch-based bioplastic fabrication procedure was proposed. From preliminary tests, plasticizers were sufficiently selected, including water, glycerol, natri bicarbonate, and acid citric. Using different combinations of these plasticizers, four types of bioplastics were then fabricated to study the effect of the plasticizers as well as to characterize the properties of the corresponding bioplastics. A cutting tool for ASTM D412 type A standard tensile testing specimen was then designed and fabricated. Using these dog-bone specimens, tensile results showed that the hardness of the fabricated bioplastic was positively proportional to the ratio of the starch. Furthermore, from SEM characterization, the bioplastic specimens were fully plasticized.

For this goal, the analytical hierarchy process, also known as the AHP, is used to choose the best material based on factors such as cost, temperature resistance, printing speed, and mechanical properties of the material. The results revealed that PEEK-CF is a better material for the customized impeller application than PETG-CF. The PEEK-CF obtains the higher priority value of 0.6363, and the PETG-CF obtains 0.2791.

Their use in additive manufacturing (AM) processes represents a significant advancement, allowing for the direct integration of electronic functionality into intricate 3D‐printed structures. This results in a reduction in production time and costs associated with conventional assembly methods. This paper examines different conductive polymers, including PANI (polyaniline), PPy (polypyrrole), and PEDOT (poly(3,4‐ethylene dioxythiophene)), with a focus on their involvement in AM methods including fused deposition modeling and inkjet printing. Current developments in ink formulations, including those integrating graphene, are improving conductivity while also tackling environmental issues. However, there are still obstacles that need to be overcome, such as finding the right balance between conductivity and processability, maintaining stability in different environmental conditions, dealing with biocompatibility concerns, and optimizing compatibility with other materials. Continuing research is improving these materials, and conductive polymers show potential for transforming electronics and medical applications due to their ability to be scaled up, their flexibility, and their adjustable electronic properties. This review article offers a thorough summary of the latest research trends, difficulties, and future paths in the realm of electronics and AM that utilize conductive polymers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to study the miscibility and various transitions (α, β, and γ) in binary blends of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) with low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) and high‐density polyethylene (HDPE). Addition of a rubbery phase, such as EVA, reduced all the transition temperatures. A peak broadening of tan δ was observed with increasing EVA content in the blends. This can be explained by the observed reduction of the crystallinity of the systems. The presence of a single transition peak in the region of glass transition temperature ( T g ) has indicated that the blends were miscible. However, morphological investigation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the features of a two phase system in which the EVA domains would be dispersed in the polyethylene (PE) phase. The results have demonstrated that DMA is not sensitive enough to study the miscibility of polymeric blends with a similar backbone structures (such as PE and EVA) in view of the small difference in their T g . For such blends, therefore, the use of direct observations, such as microscopic examinations is necessary. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Racemic copolymers of polylactic acid were investigated to determine the effect of copolymer ratio on melting point, degree of crystallinity, mechanical properties, and processing behavior. The copolymer ratio was found to have a strong influence on the crystallization behavior of the polymer. In addition to the ratio of the L ‐form to a random mixture of the D and L forms of the lactic acid in the copolymer, the effect of the polymer's molecular weight was examined. The copolymers were produced from the lactide form of the monomer to achieve weight average molecular weights above 100,000. The molecular weight had a profound influence on processability and rate of crystallization. Other notable factors influencing the properties and processing of the copolymers were the concentration of residual monomer in the polymer, the processing time‐temperature history, and the extent of molecular weight degradation during processing. An important factor in the commercial development of biodegradable polymers is the ability to control the rate of degradation. Ideally, the polymer should not degrade during functional use, but degrade quite rapidly when discarded. This paper discusses various aspects associated with the control of the rate of degradation of polylactide copolymers; both from the perspective of stabilizing the polymer during processing and product use, and subsequently accelerating the rate of degradation after disposal. Of particular interest are the influences of molecular weight, crystallinity, end capping, and plasticization. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is a well‐known fact that weldlines are unavoidable in most injection‐molded products of even moderate complexity. While there are many situations where they are barely perceptible, weldlines represent a potential source of weakness in molded parts. In injection molding weldlines are generated when two separate melt streams join either in multigated molds or as a consequence of flow around obstacles. The development of many interesting materials has been hampered by poor weldline strength. Among such materials are plastics reinforced with fibers or platelets, liquid crystal polymers, and a number of multiphase polymer blends. Weldlines have ever been called the “Achilles' heel” of these multiphase materials. This article is a review of the literature published on weldlines in injected parts. It deals primarily with the aspects related to the mechanical behavior of weldline‐containing parts. It begins with a brief description of the phenomena important for the part formation in the mold, including those leading to weldlines, in addition to the techniques used to characterize weldline‐containing parts. The following three sections consider the structure and properties of weldlines in neat amorphous and semicrystalline polymers, filled and reinforced plastics, and finally in polymer blends and alloys. In the last section methods developed for increasing the weldline strength are discussed. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper aims to identify the main parameters that improve the flexural properties of long glass fiber/polyamide 66 injection moulded parts. The mould geometry has been chosen so as to reproduce some geometrical accidents (e.g. sharp frontal and tangential steps) occurring on industrial moulds. A Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) has been used in order to quantify the effects of processing conditions on the flexural strength and modulus. Polymer melt temperature is the main parameter acting on the flexural properties, in both flow and transverse directions. The structure/process/flexural properties relationship has then been deduced from microstructure analysis (crystallinity, local residual fiber length and average orientation, interfacial quality). For optimized injection moulding conditions, leading to the highest flexural strength in the flow direction, a fiber content gradient has been noticed over the part length and width, which is strongly amplified by the presence of any sharp geometrical discontinuity. The results have also pointed out the limits of the plasticating unit of the injection, moulding machine. A similarity with the reinforcement mechanisms of short fiber reinforced thermoplastics has been highlighted. However, in the case of long fibers the fiber orientation mechanism is more complicated due to tangling effects. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several materials including unfilled and filled thermoplastics, thermoplastic elastomer, and elastomer are tested. Die characteristics, power consumption, and die swell are determined during extrusion. The rheological properties, molecular weight, tensile properties, and impact strength of materials with and without sound and ultrasound treatment are investigated, indicating permanent changes in these properties.

Three epoxy resins were chosen in this study: D.E.R.‐331 was a bisphenol A type epoxy resin, Eporite‐5630 was a bisphenol A type epoxy resin modified with a UV stabilizer, and ERL‐4221 was a cyclo‐aliphatic epoxy resin. The curing agent was methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), and the catalyst was tetra‐butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB). Thermal, environmental, and optical properties of the cured epoxy resins were studied. It was found that cured ERL‐4221 had better UV resistance, but other properties of ERL‐4221 were lower because of the internal stress generated during the curing process. D.E.R.‐331 showed better thermal stability, but the aromatic groups in the main chains caused sensitivity to photodegradation. Eporite‐5630 had the advantages of D.E.R.‐331 and better UV resistance than D.E.R.‐331 because of the addition of UV stabilizer. Among the three materials, Eporite‐5630 was the best choice of the balance properties for LED applications. This finding may assist in the selection of epoxy resins used in LED technology. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract As a biomaterial, cellulose can be converted into a wide range of derivatives with desired properties for a variety of medical, biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications. The oxidation of cellulose yields oxidized cellulose (OC, oxycellulose, 6‐carboxycellulose). OC represents an important class of biocompatible and bioresorbable polymers. In vivo bioabsorption of OC occurs via chemical depolymerization and enzymatic hydrolysis. Despite the fact OC is well established as a hemostatic agent and is widely used in a clinical practice, it still attracts a great interest and its new applications, especially pharmaceutical, are investigated. The present review is focused on characterization of OC's physical and chemical properties. Its synthesis and mechanisms involved in its in vivo and in vitro biodegradation are discussed. Medical and biomedical applications of OC are summarized, and especially its hemostatic, enterosorbent, and wound‐healing properties are described. In addition to these applications, OC could be used as a pharmaceutical excipient in solid (e.g., tablets, microparticles), semisolid (e.g., gels), as well as liquid (e.g., suspensions) dosage forms. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The propagation of low‐intensity ultrasound in polymers, acting as a high‐frequency dynamic mechanical deformation, can be successfully used to monitor changes in the modulus of polymers associated with glass transition, crystallization, cross‐linking, and other chemical and physical phenomena related to changes in the viscoelastic behavior, such as gelation phenomena. The velocity of sound is related to the polymer storage modulus and density, whereas the absorption of ultrasonic waves is related to the energy dissipation in the material and, therefore, to the loss modulus. Accordingly, ultrasonic measurements have been used by several authors to monitor the evolution of the viscoelastic moduli of polymers as a function of time or temperature and, recently, become a characterization technique of its own right, generally known as ultrasonic dynamic mechanical analysis (UDMA). Often the technique is used in conjunction with rheological methods as a means of providing a better insight into the viscoelastic behavior of polymer systems. As yet UDMA is underutilized primarily because of the low operating temperatures (usually below 100○C) of commercially available ultrasonic transducers, and also due to the requirement of a coupling medium to ensure an efficient energy transfer mechanism between the transducer and the test material. Despite these limitations, this paper shows that the use of ultrasonics is potentially a powerful method for the characterization of polymers, particularly as a tool for online monitoring of events occurring during polymer processing and in the manufacture of polymer matrix composites. The aim of this paper is to review the progress made in recent years, highlighting the potential and reliability of UDMA for monitoring physical transitions in polymers such as glass transition, melting, crystallization, as well as physical changes taking place during curing of thermosetting resins. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All polymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheological analysis to roughly identify the foaming conditions. Batch and solid‐state foaming methods were employed. In the first case, cell nucleation was promoted by inducing a fast pressure drop rate in a pressurized vessel. In the solid‐state process, foaming was promoted by increasing the temperature of gas‐saturated samples in an oil bath. The effects of foaming methods and process parameters on cellular morphology were analyzed. All polymers were successfully foamed by using the solid‐state technique, showing relative densities ranging from 0.13 to 0.44 for PEN and from 0.27 to 0.57 for PES, PPSU, and PEI. The morphology was microcellular in all cases, and PES exhibited nanocellular cells after some processing conditions. The batch‐foaming process was less effective to prepare foams than the solid‐state one. In fact, higher relative densities and reduced temperature windows for foaming were evidenced for amorphous polymers, whereas PEN crystallized during the heating step and foams with poor morphology and high relative densities were obtained. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The operating window is defined as a domain inside which stable and uniform coating is possible; different types of coating defects are found outside the window. A flow visualization technique was applied to observe the coating bead, particularly the positions and shapes of the downstream and upstream menisci, just before and after coating defects appear at high coating speeds. Special features of coating bead shapes, which lead to onsets of ribbing and air entrainment, were identified. The two‐dimensional flow in the coating bead region was computed by the commercial software package FLOW‐3D®. Critical features observed experimentally for the onset of coating defects were used to judge whether the coating flow was within the operating window. The theoretically evaluated operating windows were found to be much larger than those determined experimentally in terms of coating speeds.

The latter was finally deacetylated to get new aminated chitosan derivatives. Factors affecting conjugation and amination steps were studied. The amination process was confirmed by using FT‐IR, TGA analysis, and the solubility test. The new aminated chitosan derivatives show a higher solubility, almost double, at a pH ranging from 5 to 6 compared with z pristine chitosan. The antibacterial activity of the chitosan derivatives was tested against four different bacterial strains: two Gram‐negative ( Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) and two Gram‐positive ( Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus ). It was found that the antibacterial activity of the chitosan derivatives is better than those of chitosan and increases with the increasing amount of introduced amine groups. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity test using the Caco 2 cell line shows a moderate safety level for the new aminated chitosan derivatives. Chitosan derivatives show potential bactericidal activity against all strains examined especially against Gram‐negative bacteria ( E. co li and P. aeruginosa ). For Gram‐positive bacteria, chitosan derivatives killed 93% of B. cereus and 92% of S. aureus , compared with 44% and 85% for chitosan after 3 and 5 h, respectively. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nanofibers produced by electrospinning or other methods show enhanced properties such as high surface area to volume ratio, flexibility in surface functionalities, and mechanical properties. To increase their practical usage and opening new windows for their innovative applications, theses nanofibers can be assembled into an ordered structure like yarn. Besides their intrinsic‐based polymer characteristics, these nanofiber yarns have an exceptional high specific surface area as a heritage of their forming nanofibers. This unique property together with the increased number of fibers in an unit area of cross section will improve their some properties such as water and chemical absorbency and flexibility in comparison with conventional yarns. So far, miscellaneous methods are established for fabricating electrospun nanofibers into yarn and the effects of processing factors on the characteristics of produced nanofiber yarns are studied by many researchers. In this review, the achievements in nanofibers bundles and yarn production and different established methods including twisted, hybrid, and core types are discussed.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is currently a considerable interest in developing bio‐based and green nanocomposites in industrial and technological areas owing to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and environmental friendliness. In this study, a bio‐based nanosized material, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), extracted from southern pine pulp was employed as a reinforcing agent in a natural rubber (NR) matrix. NR/CNC nanocomposites were prepared by a solution mixing and casting method. The morphology, thermal, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform‐infrared spectroscopy, tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The CNC displayed a gradient dispersion in the nanocomposites, and no microscaled aggregates were observed. Both the tensile strength and modulus of the nanocomposites increased with the addition of CNC, accompanied by a slight decrease in elongation at break. The storage modulus also improved with the addition of CNC, which served as good evidence of the reinforcing tendency of CNC in the NR matrix. The thermal stability of the nanocomposites showed an insignificant decrease in CNC addition. The glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites was not influenced by CNC.",

The prime objective of this work was to determine water absorption, chemical resistance, and mechanical properties of the green composites reinforced with ecofriendly natural cellulosic Saccharum cilliare fibers. The mechanical and physicochemical properties of the green composites have been investigated as a function of fiber loading for assessing their applicability in different potential applications in everyday life. The green composites thus prepared have been found to show a universal trend of an increase in properties with fiber loading up to 30%, and beyond this the properties decrease. A fiber/matrix interaction between the polymer and reinforcement has been analyzed based on the mechanical and morphological studies. Overall results suggest that the natural cellulosic S. cilliare fibers were capable of serving as a feasible reinforcement for green polymer composites. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The addition of starch to LDPE reduced the melt flow rate (MFR), the tensile strength, and impact strength, whereas the tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus increased.

The LPS, LPGTS, LPMTS, and maleic anhydride treated LPMTS (LPMTSM) samples were analyzed for the MFR, mechanical properties (tensile, flexural, and impact tests), thermal (TGA and DSC), and morphological properties. As a result, the incorporation of plasticizers or compatibilizer into LPS caused the considerable improvement in MFR and mechanical properties. Moreover, the presence of compatibilizer produced better properties for the LPMTSM sample than for the other samples, indicating better dispersion and homogeneity of starch to the matrix.

The polymer blend nanocomposite samples have been prepared using a simple in situ polymerization method. The structural changes in the polymer blend resulting from its interaction with ZnFe 2 O 4 have been identified by Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies. The FTIR spectra of blend nanocomposite showed the presence of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles at 580 cm −1 . The chemical interactions between the polymer and ZnFe 2 O 4 have been confirmed by the shift in the position of FTIR peaks. The XRD results indicate the increase in the crystalline nature of the polymer blend with the incorporation of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles into the blend. Scanning electron microscopy photographs of the nanocomposites show the dispersion of nanoparticles in PIN / PVA blend, while transmission electron microscopy images reveal the presence of spherically shaped nanoparticles in the polymer blend with an average size of 15 nm. The glass transition temperature of polymer blend composite has been shifted to a higher value, and thermal stability of the polymer blend improved with the addition of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. The incorporation of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles in the PIN / PVA blend matrix leads to a significant improvement in overall mechanical properties, AC and DC conductivity. The dielectric properties are found to be higher for ZnFe 2 O 4 ‐reinforced blend systems than the pure blend system due to polarization exerted by the incorporation of nanoparticles.",

It has been widely used in the aerospace and transportation fields and is especially used as structural material such as aircraft skins, wings, and tails. However, under complex service conditions, interlaminar failure in FMLs greatly reduced mechanical properties of the material, even leading to serious economic and safety disasters. The failure and destruction of important structural parts of aircraft and other manned transportation vehicles are extremely unsafe for people. Therefore, it is of great significance to summarize the interlaminar failure behavior of FMLs and find ways to avoid these defects. This review paper is a collection of various researches done by many groups, which systematically discuss the interlaminar failure behaviors and their control methods of FMLs. The application status of several common FMLs in aircraft structures was given. The common interlaminar failure modes of FMLs and the testing and evaluation methods of interlaminar properties were stated. The failure mechanisms and the corresponding control methods were analyzed. Finally, the future developments of FMLs were also discussed by the authors. Through this review article, readers can obtain new research progress about the control method, the mechanism and future development on the failure behavior of FMLs in a more efficient way.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present study, the polyethersulfone ( PES ) mixed matrix nanofiltration membranes with the embedding of the graphene oxide ( GO ) and sulfonated graphene oxide (s‐ GO ) nanoparticles were fabricated via phase inversion method. The effect of GO and s‐ GO on the morphology and performance‐fabricated PES membrane was evaluated in terms of pure water flux, dye retention, salt rejection, heavy metal removal, and antifouling properties. The fabricated membranes were characterized using FE ‐ SEM , AFM , and water contact angle and porosity measurement. As a result, by adding GO and s‐ GO nanoparticles, the pure water flux ( PWF ) of mentioned membranes significantly improved due to the higher hydrophilicity. The increased hydrophilicity of the mentioned membranes was proved by the water contact angle data. The evaluation of nanofiltration performance was assessed by rejection measurement of cationic and anionic dyes. The rejection of heavy metals in the following order 97.5%, 87.8%, 76.3%, and 60.6% for Cr, Cd, Cu, and Ni, respectively, was obtained for the sample that contains 1 wt% s‐ GO . Moreover, other nanocomposite membranes showed relatively good results. The rejection results showed that GO and s‐ GO nanoparticles embedded membranes have higher dye retention ability than the bare PES . Fouling resistance of the membranes was evaluated by filtration of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution. The results of antifouling properties showed that the membrane containing 0.5 wt% s‐ GO had the best fouling resistance.",

    "abstract": "There is a considerable demand for the development and application of polymer materials in the flexible electronic- and polymer-based electrolyte technologies. Chitosan (CS) and poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (POZ) materials were blended with different ratios to obtain CS:POZ blend films using a straightforward solution cast technique. The work was involved a range of characteristic techniques, such as impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and optical microscopy. From the XRD spectra, an enhancement in the amorphous nature in CS:POZ blend films was revealed when compared to the pure state of CS. The enhancement was verified from the peak broadening in CS:POZ blend films in relative to the one in crystalline peaks of the CS polymer. The optical micrograph study was used to designate the amorphous and crystalline regions by assigning dark and brilliant phases, respectively. Upon increasing POZ concentration, the dielectric constant was found to increase up to ɛ ′ = 6.48 (at 1 MHz) at 15 wt.% of POZ, and then a drop was observed beyond this amount. The relatively high dielectric constant and dielectric loss were found at elevated temperatures. The increase of POZ concentration up to 45 wt.% made the loss tangent to shift to the lower frequency side, which is related to increasing resistivity. The increases of dielectric constant and dielectric loss with temperature were attributed to the increase of polarisation. The loss tangent peaks were found to shift to the higher frequency side as temperature elevated. Obvious relaxation peaks were observed in the imaginary part of electric modulus, and no peaks were found in the dielectric loss spectra. The concentration dependent of M ″ peaks was found to follow the same trend of loss tangent peaks versus POZ content. The relaxation process was studied in terms of electric modulus parameters.",

Characterization of pH‐responsive hydrogels by FTIR, SEM, and thermal analysis revealed that hydrogel has porous structure, favors swelling, drug loading, and drug release at a specific site in gastrointestinal tract and thermally more stable than parent polymer. In comparison with simple drug solution and hydrogel formulations, pharmacokinetic parameters of hydrogels formulations showed a significant difference in C max values of (CMC‐ g ‐AA) CA and the same oral dose of rabeprazole sodium was 87.28 ± 12.671 and 61.263 ± 5.37 ng/mL, respectively, T max of graft copolymer matrices CA (4.43 h) was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher than drug solution (1 h) and area under curves (AUCs) for CA (952.25 ± 191 ng⋅h/mL) was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher than the drug solution (83.67 ± 8.28 ng⋅h/mL) indicated the effect of dosage form would last for longer duration.

Therefore, it is of great significance in terms of safety to study the flame retardant properties of polymers while still maintaining their optimal performance. Current literature shows that although traditional flame retardants can satisfy the requirements of polymer flame retardancy, due to increases in product requirements in industry, including requirements for durability, mechanical properties, and environmental friendliness, it is imperative to develop a new generation of flame retardants. In recent years, the preparation of modified two-dimensional nanomaterials as flame retardants has attracted wide attention in the field. Due to their unique layered structures, two-dimensional nanomaterials can generally improve the mechanical properties of polymers via uniform dispersion, and they can form effective physical barriers in a matrix to improve the thermal stability of polymers. For polymer applications in specialized fields, different two-dimensional nanomaterials have potential conductivity, high thermal conductivity, catalytic activity, and antiultraviolet abilities, which can meet the flame retardant requirements of polymers and allow their use in specific applications. In this review, the current research status of two-dimensional nanomaterials as flame retardants is discussed, as well as a mechanism of how they can be applied for reducing the flammability of polymers.",

Consequently, effective methods for monitoring the injection conditions (e.g., pressure, velocity, and temperature) in real-time and adjusting these conditions adaptively as required to ensure a consistent part quality are essential. This study proposes a quality index based on the clamping force increment during the injection cycle, as determined by four strain gauges attached to the tie bars of the injection molding machine. Also, various quality indexes for online quality monitoring and prediction purposes based on the pressure, viscosity, and energy features extracted from the pressure profiles obtained at the load cell, nozzle, and molding cavity, respectively, are compared. The feasibility of the proposed quality indexes is investigated experimentally for various settings of the barrel temperature, back pressure, and rotational speed of the plasticizing screw. It is shown that all of the quality indexes are correlated with the injection-molded quality and hence provide a feasible basis for the realization of an on-line quality monitoring and control system. Particularly, the tie-bar elongation quality index requires no modification or invasion of the injection molding system or cavity and hence provides a particularly attractive solution for monitoring and controlling the part quality.",

Jute–mycelium-based vegan leather was constructed using hessian jute fabric, natural rubber solution, and extracted polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer from Bacillus subtilis strain FPP-K isolated from fermented herbal black tea liquor waste. The bacterial strain was confirmed using 16S rRNA genomic sequencing. The structural characteristics of sustainable mycelium vegan leather were identified using FTIR, SEM, and TGA methods. To address the functional features of the developed vegan leather, solubility, swelling degree, WVP, WCA, and mechanical strength were also evaluated. Mycelium networking was further validated by micromorphological examination (SEM) of the leather sample’s cross-sectional area. Jute–mycelium leather demonstrated a tensile strength of 8.62 MPa and a % elongation of 8.34, which were significantly greater than the control sample. Vegan leather displayed a strong peak in the O ═ H group of carbohydrates in the examination of chemical bonds. A high-frequency infrared wavelength of 1,462 cm−1 revealed the amide group of protein due to the presence of mycelium, while the absorption peak at 1,703 cm−1 in leather indicated the crosslinking of PHA. Moreover, the TGA study finalized the thermal stability of leather. The enhanced hydrophobicity and reduced swelling degree and solubility also endorsed the water resistance properties of the leather.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the drive to adopt sustainable practices and develop eco‐friendly processes and products has gained significant momentum in the global polymer industry. A key component of this shift is the increased use of recycled materials, which not only align with environmental goals, but also offer considerable economic advantages. Integrating post‐consumer recyclates (PCRs) into manufacturing processes, particularly in injection moulding, holds great potential for reducing CO 2 emissions, decreasing reliance on virgin materials, mitigating waste and promoting a circular economy. Nevertheless, a switch to 100% recyclate has not yet been effective or economical in many areas of application, so mixtures of virgin and recyclate material represent a promising approach and must be analysed further. Therefore, this study examines the impact of different virgin/recyclate‐mixture ratios on both injection moulding process stability and resulting part quality, focusing on high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) blends. For this purpose, virgin/PCR mixtures are compounded, rheologically analysed using high‐pressure capillary rheometry and processed via injection moulding. The process data are analysed, and the produced parts are mechanically and geometrically evaluated. The findings show that for PP, an increasing recyclate content results in a nearly linear improvement in tensile strength and modulus of elasticity without significantly affecting material viscosity, ensuring stable processing conditions. However, part warpage increases with higher recyclate content. In contrast, for HDPE, a higher recyclate content decreases the mixture viscosity, leading to decreased injection pressure and dosing torque during processing. Despite this, the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity improve, while part warpage decreases for HDPE. For both materials, though tensile strength and elasticity increase, higher recyclate contents negatively affect fracture behaviour, as evidenced by breakage patterns and strain at break. The study also demonstrates that the linear mixing rule can be applied to process parameters and part geometry characteristics for virgin/recyclate mixtures, facilitating the integration of recyclate content into product development.",

The initial compounding stage was carried out either in a rotating drum or by twin-screw extrusion (TSE). Compounds were injection molded using both conventional molding and a shear-controlled orientation in injection molding (Scorim) technique. It was possible to obtain composites with very good mechanical properties, approaching those of cortical bone. The best results were achieved for 30% sintered HA composites processed by TSE and Scorim, due to the in situ formation of HA fibers, and the development of molecular orientation and more compact microstructures in the moldings. This was confirmed by SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The biodegradability of the composites was also assessed and was found to be faster than that of the matrix. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 16: 263–277, 1997",

    "abstract": "Abstract Born more out of necessity, the “awareness‐attitude” of our society has caused the channeling of technological developments toward immediate economic and ecological benefits. The polymer industry has a newfound interest in fillers from industrial by‐products and other waste materials having potential “recyclability.” This new class of fillers includes fillers from natural sources (e.g., natural fibers), industrial by‐products (e.g., saw dust, rice husks), and a recent entry in the form of rice husk ash—an industrial waste material–‐obtained by burning rice husks. Their recyclability and utilization has become a major driving factor in their acceptance and employability, as well as low cost and abundant availability. However, their performance in composites and processing requirements has hindered their applicability within the current economic framework. The present article reviews the performance of rice husk ash, or silica ash, in polymeric composites. Silica ash, composed mainly of silica, is obtained after burning rice husks and is a major industrial waste material in rice growing countries. Optimism surrounds the application of silica ash as a potential filler in a variety of polymeric composites, however, its performance has been limited by its inherent characteristics. This paper emphasizes the need for better characterization of silica ash to obtain an in‐depth understanding of its behaviour with the view to identifying suitable modifications to improve its performance as a filler. It is emphasized that poor understanding of silica ash as a filler is linked to the lack of surface characterization, since its behaviour is significantly linked with its surface properties. Based on this analysis, a new approach to silica ash modification is proposed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hence, a system that controls the injection molding process based on process variables has been developed at the Institute of Plastics Processing at RWTH Aachen University during the last years. It controls the quality determining process variable cavity pressure directly and realizes a desired course of cavity pressure in the injection and holding pressure phases. The cavity pressure course in the holding pressure phase is controlled online on the basis of pvT behavior of the processed plastic material. Thus, an optimal course of the process in the pvT diagram can be guaranteed and the quality constancy of the molded parts can be clearly increased. Using the pvT‐based process control, the effect of varying mold and melt temperatures on the molded part weight can be decreased by about 90% compared with the conventional process control. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The MCM‐41 was modified by attaching S ‐dodecyl‐ S ′‐(α,α′‐dimethyl‐α′′‐acetic acid)trithiocarbonate (DDMAT) as the RAFT agent and methacrylate group using 3‐methacryloxypropyldimethylchlorosilane. The kinetics of styrene RAFT polymerization by different approaches was compared with the model polymerization mediated by free DDMAT. The quantity of the grafted chain grown from the surface and inside of the pores of MCM‐41 and free polymer chains in bulk was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The molecular weight of the produced polymer chains increased linearly with the monomer conversion for three methods. The gel permeation chromatography showed that the molecular weight of grafted and free polymer chains in the “grafting from” approach is higher than other methods, and molecular weight distributions were relatively narrower whereas the rate of polymerization for “grafting from” was higher. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Based on our results obtained, it was found that the zeta potential values of MNP s increased from −29.8 to −58.1 mV after modification of MNP s with 1.2 wt.% of OA . Indeed, results obtained clearly to show that a maximum colloidal stability of MNP s in a basic medium could be significantly improved. As a result, this resultant colloidal suspension performance was approximately 7 times higher (21 days‐ high colloidal stability against precipitation and agglomeration) than that of the undecorated MNP s sample (3 days). Based on vibrating sample magnetometer ( VSM ) analysis, the resultant OA ‐decorated MNP s exhibited superparamagnetic behavior with slightly lower saturation magnetization (51–69 emu/g) than that of undecorated MNP s sample (80 emu/g) at room temperature. This behavior was attributed to the sufficient carboxylate ions from the outer layer of the bilayer of OA ‐decorated MNP s, which promoted the high colloidal stability performance.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the present work, polymer hydrogels have been used as the drug carrier for delivery systems of anticancer drugs. This investigation involves the formation of alginate hydrogels by a combination of three different monomers. The sodium alginate (SA) hydrogels were developed by free‐radical polymerization of selective water‐soluble monomers such as acrylamide (Am), methacrylamide (MAm), N ‐isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), and water‐soluble polysaccharide (SA). The structural and morphological characterizations of the developed hydrogels were obtained from FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy studies. Then, the hydrogels developed were encapsulated with a model cancer drug 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) and hydrogels containing 5‐FU drug were evaluated for in vitro release studies. The released profiles of the drug showed that between 95% and 34% the loaded drug was released in the first half‐an‐hour at a buffer solution of 7.4 and the rest of the drug was released slowly. The results suggest that poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide‐sodium alginate) P(NIPAAm‐SA) hydrogels show better properties than such as P(Am‐SA) and P(MAm‐SA). The drug release kinetic parameters suggested that the Am and MAm hydrogel networks are anomalous in nature, and the diffusion type of NIPAAM systems shows a slightly Fickian phenomenon.

Breathability is an important factor of clothing comfort. Nanofibrous layers have application in these fields due to their interconnected porous area and high surface area. In this work, two different nanofiber layers were fabricated and examined as waterproof and breathable layers. Polyurethane (PU) and PU/nylon 66 (hybrid) nanofiber layers were produced via electrospinning set up with different electrospinning durations. Some of the samples’ characteristics such as tensile strength, microindentation, air permeability, water vapor permeability (WVP), and contact angle of water were investigated. Moreover, a novel approach was applied for determining the performance of layers against acidic water to simulate acidic rain. The results show that the tensile strength, indentation force, and acidic waterproof ability of the layers increased with increasing the process duration, that is, while air permeability was decreased simultaneously. This work shows that the required force for indentation and strength of the hybrid layer was less than that of PU nanofiber layer. Also, the electrospun hybrid layers show better air permeability than the PU membrane but still have lower WVP, which affects the breathability of the layer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Novel green composites were successfully prepared from bacterial poly(3‐hydroxybutyrate) ( PHB ) and pita fibers derived from the agave plant ( Agave americana ). Various weight contents (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt.‐%) of pita fibers at different lengths (5, 15, and 20 mm) were successfully incorporated into PHB by compression molding. The newly prepared PHB /pita fibers composite sheets were characterized in terms of their mechanical and thermomechanical properties and then related to their morphology after fracture. Attained results indicated that the mechanical stiffness of PHB significantly improved with both the content and length of pita fibers, although ductile properties were reduced. In particular, the elastic modulus of the 40 wt.‐% PHB composite sheets containing 20‐mm‐long pita fibers was approximately 55% higher than the unfilled PHB sheet. Shore D hardness also improved, achieving the shortest pita fibers the highest improvement. Pita fibers with lengths of 15 and 20 mm also increased the Vicat softening point and heat deflection temperature ( HDT ) by 38 and 21°C, respectively. Due to their optimal shape, it is concluded that pita fibers with lengths above 15 mm can potentially reinforce and improve the performance of PHB biopolymer. In addition, the compression‐molding methodology described in this research work represents a cost‐effective pathway to feasibly prepare long‐fiber‐reinforced thermoplastics ( LFRT s) fully based on renewable raw materials. Resultant green composite sheets can be of interest for the development of sustainable parts in the automotive industry and other advanced applications in polymer technology.",

Different surface topologies of PCL were induced by phase separation using solvents with various solubility parameters. The investigated solvents were chloroform, acetone, tetrahydrofuran ( THF ), and ethanol (Et OH ). The PCL films with different surface topologies and protein‐adsorbed PCL films were studied with respect to their hydrophobicity, the concentration and nature of functional groups on their surface, their surface roughness, and their cytotoxicity. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the films with the roughest surface were cast from 40:60 Et OH : THF and contained significantly larger amounts of adsorbed protein.

The pH ‐responsive swelling behavior of ( PAM ‐ co ‐NaAlg) hydrogels is tested in different pH ranges showing higher swelling capacities in basic than in acidic media. This property proposes the use of ( PAM ‐ co ‐NaAlg) hydrogel as internal curing agent for concrete. The hydrogel is examined with cement weight ratios of (0.1–0.5) wt%. The study shows that cement with ( PAM ‐ co ‐NaAlg) hydrogel improves the compressive strength of cement at 0.1 and 0.2 wt%.",

Both untreated and sonicated carbon nanotubes were used and designated as U‐CNT and S‐CNT, respectively. The filler content was varied from 0 to 8 phr. Regardless of the filler type, the increase in the filler content not only results in increased compound viscosity, reduced cure time, and enhanced cross‐link density but also leads to the increase in the modulus and hardness of the vulcanizates. For N330 and XE2‐B, the tensile strength increases continuously with increasing filler content. However, for both U‐CNT and S‐CNT, the tensile strength tends to increase with increasing filler content up to 2 phr and decreases noticeably afterward. At any given filler content, the CNTs give the vulcanizates with the highest values of electrical and thermal conductivities, storage modulus, and tan δ, followed by XE2‐B and N330, respectively. Results also elucidate that the sonication of CNT without the presence of surfactant prior to mixing could not improve the degree of CNT dispersion, leading to insignificant difference in properties of the U‐CNT‐filled and S‐CNT‐filled vulcanizates.",

First, by considering the electrospun solutions behavior, the thermodynamic studies were evaluated then Hansen solubility theory was applied to select the desirable solvent systems. The dissolving power of the solvents for PVP was obtained in the following order: DMF &gt; NMP &gt;&gt; chloroform &gt; PrOH &gt; EtOH. It seems that every solvent, which is able to dissolve PVP polymer, shows different spinning characteristics under identical conditions of processing parameters. By using PrOH, chloroform, and NMP solvents, electrospun nanofibers’ average diameter was decreased intensively but at the same time beads formation was observed. We investigated that EtOH was a desirable solvent for PVP to fabricate fibers with z micrometer diameter distribution, but because of its low dissolving power it is suitable for microfiber synthesis with the electrospinning process. Based on the Hansen theory and experimental results, the PVP/DMF solutions showed desirable characteristics for the electrospinning system. Furthermore, the PVP nanofiber's uniformity of the PVP/DMF solution was higher than other solvent systems, which mean that fiber diameter distribution is scanty than others. Finally, it has been demonstrated that with an appropriate solvent the nanofiber diameter distribution and formation of beads can be controlled by Hansen theory.",

In this study, the design of experiments issued for optimization of electrospinning of polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ). Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and the Taguchi orthogonal array L27 OA are employed to analyze the influence of process control parameters. The variables studied are the applied voltages, solution concentrations, rotational speeds, collecting distances, and flow rates. A mathematical model of the polymer fiber diameter as a function of significant process parameters has been built using response surface methodology ( RSM ). The concentration percentage and the flow rate were determined to be the most significant process variables at 99% and 90% confidence levels, respectively. The predictive model provides 84.34% average model accuracy, which is considered acceptable as this study deals only with 27 of 243 trials needed for a full study based on principles of design of experiments.

To promote the development and use of suitable hydrophilic materials for biomedical applications, we used three hydrophilic films of varying hydrophilicity and examined the effects of their hydrophilicity on blood compatibility, protein adsorption, blood clotting time, hemolytic activity, biocompatibility, and cell attachment. Across the spectrum of hydrophilicity examined, no obvious differences in biocompatibility were observed. While high material hydrophilicity was associated with higher hemolytic activity, it still fit the nonhemolytic criteria. Further, higher hydrophilicity decreased protein adsorption and cell attachment, but increased thromboresistance in our blood clotting time assay (~30% higher blood clotting index at 10 min). These results indicate that hydrophilicity increases blood compatibility with regard to thromboresistance, but reduces cellular compatibility (i.e., cell attachment), characteristics that could be exploited for a wide range of potential applications in various fields, such as glucose electrode test strips.",

The equilibrium contact angles were calculated from the Tadmor theory and further used for apparent surface energy calculation applying the above‐mentioned approaches. Due to the surface plasma activation both the roughness of the surface and the polar component of apparent surface free energy increased.

Meanwhile, the tensile strength, stiffness, and hardness of the composites increased with increasing alumina content, while the strain-at-break of the composites decreased. It was observed that the composites containing 5 vol% of alumina had the best tensile strength, stiffness, and hardness. The uniform distribution and dispersion of alumina particles were likely responsible for the improvement of the mechanical properties. In other hand, small decrease in tensile strength, stiffness, and hardness of composite was found in the composites with 10 vol% of alumina.

In this manner, they have developed microspheres, nanoparticles, niosomes, liposomes, etc. Now in recent past, work is going on the development of novel hydrogel microparticles that have more desirable response than conventional hydrogels. These newly developed hydrogel microparticles have a number of advantages over the conventional hydrogels as well as over other micro‐ or nanotechnologies. These are used to achieve either sustained or prolonged action as well as rapid release of drugs by complexation with hydrophilic polymers to enhance their solubility and ultimately bioavailability of poorly water‐soluble drugs. Various techniques are used to prepare hydrogel microparticles such as the ionic gelation method, spray drying, dispersion, photopolymerization ionotropic gelation method, free radical precipitation polymerization, inverse emulsion polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc. Certain polymers along with various types of initiators, cross‐linkers, and monomers are used in different concentrations depending upon the purpose of hydrogel microparticles. In recent review, we have focused upon the loading and drug release patterns from hydrogel microparticles, various technologies, and components applied in their preparations and applications in the pharmaceutical field. Hydrogel microparticles can be aimed for various purposes such as solubility enhancement of hydrophobic drugs, and targeted drug delivery, magnetic carriers; therefore, these are useful assets of pharmaceutical market.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, Fe 3 O 4 /graphene oxide/chitosan (FGC) nanocomposite was synthesized using coprecipitation method for application to removal of nickel ion (Ni(II)) from aqueous solution by adsorption process. To determine residue Ni(II) ions concentration in aqueous solution after adsorption process, we have used UV-Vis spectrophotometric method, which is an effective and exact method for Ni(II) monitoring at low level by using dimethylglyoxime (DMG) as a complex reagent with Ni(II), which has a specific adsorption peak at the wavelength of 550 nm on UV-Vis spectra. A number of factors that influence Ni(II) ions adsorption capacity of FGC nanocomposite such as contact time, adsorption temperature, and adsorbent dosage were investigated. Results showed that the adsorption equilibrium is established after 70 minutes with the adsorbent dosage of 0.01 g.mL −1 at 30°C (the room temperature). The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of this adsorption including free enthalpy change (∆G 0 ), enthalpy change (∆H 0 ), entropy change (∆S 0 ), and reaction order with respect to Ni(II) ions were also determined. The Ni(II) ions adsorption equilibrium data are fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum monolayer capacity (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>) is 12.24 mg.g −1 . Moreover, the FGC adsorbent can be recovered by an external magnet; in addition, it can be regenerated. The reusability of FGC was tested and results showed that 83.08% of removal efficiency was obtained after 3 cycles. The synthesized FGC nanocomposite with many advantages is a promising material for removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution to clean up the environment.",

The use of recycled filaments as the feedstock for 3D printers is a feasible alternative, but its application is limited to rather poor product quality. This study, thus, evaluates the effects of adding iron (Fe), silicon (Si), chromium (Cr), and aluminum (Al) nano‐crystalline powders into the recycled polypropylene/high‐density polyethylene plastics feedstock for filament extrusion. Physical and mechanical analysis tests revealed that the addition of 1% Fe–Si–Cr or Fe–Si–Al resulted in better thermal stability, and up to 37% and 17% improvement, respectively, in yield strength and Young modulus compared with the original recycled filaments, possibly due to the enhancement of interfacial adhesion between the nano‐metal powders and the polymer, leading to reduced crack formation.",

In this study, the thermal reversible DA bond was introduced into polyurethane by the design of molecular chain to obtain the self‐healing properties. The pre‐polyurethane ( HTK ) end‐capped with furan rings was synthesized by hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer and furfuryl alcohol firstly. Then, HTK was mixed with bismaleimide (BMI) to synthesize the cross‐linked polyurethane HTK‐PU. Finally, the properties of the HTK‐PU were characterized. It can be observed from DSC that the DA reaction occurred at 76°C and the r‐ DA reaction occurred at 109.5°C. This cross‐linked polyurethane shows a remarkable high hardness (shore D80). When preserved at 80°C for 6 hr, the self‐healing efficiency of the HTK ‐ PU was 53.75% known from tensile test, and cracks on it virtually disappeared as observed from polarizing microscope ( POM ). When preserved at 80°C for 12 hr, the self‐healing efficiency was 67.56%.",

Two different coagulation bath temperatures were used to investigate the kinetics of membrane formation and subsequent effect on membrane performance. The maximum water flux of 141 ml/cm 2 .h was observed using 21% of PES concentration in NMP + THF cosolvent system. The highest tensile strength of 29.15 MPa was observed using membrane prepared with 21% PES concentration in NMP as solvent and coagulation bath temperature of 25°C. The highest hydraulic membrane resistance was reported for membrane prepared with 21% PES concentration in NMP as solvent. Moreover, the lowest contact angle of 67° was observed for membrane prepared with 15% of PES concentration in NMP as solvent with coagulation bath temperature of 28°C.

The as-prepared PVDF membranes were systematically characterized by a series of analytical techniques such as Water Contact Angle (CA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and SEM-mapping. Furthermore, the performance of membranes on antibacterial properties, the pure water flux, and fouling resistance was investigated in detail. Those results showed that the membrane modified by Ag@MOFs containing 30% Ag had the higher anti-bacterial performance, and the clear zone could be increased to 10 mm in comparison with that of blank membrane. Meanwhile, the pure water flux of Ag@MOF membranes increased from 85 L/m 2 h to 157 L/m 2 h, and the maximum membrane flux recovery rate (FRR) of 95.7% was obtained using SA as pollutant, which is attributed to the introduction of Ag@MOF composite material. Based on the above experimental results, it can be found that the Ag-MOF membranes displayed the excellent antibacterial activity, high water flux, and fine fouling resistance. This work provides a facile strategy to fabricate the Ag@MOFs modified membranes, and it shows an excellent anti-bacterial and water flux performance.",

The RP composites utilized in this study are polyethylene and polypropylene. The mixtures of RP and DPF are heated at 80°C and then poured into a priori prepared mold. The mold is designed to have three cavities for three specimens in order to characterize them through impact, creep, and tensile tests. The results showed that the hardness and impact increased with this process. In addition, an increase in the DPF up to 15 wt% was observed with a small increase in the DPF length. High creep resistance was also observed to be 10 mm with 20 wt% in the DPF specimens. The maximum strain was obtained in a 2.5 mm fiber length with 5% of DPF due to ductility of the plastic matrix. Moreover, with a small ratio of tough DPF, short fibers are unable to block or resist rapid plastic deformation in specimens. In fact, the DPF specimens of 10 mm length with 20 wt% exhibit a high tensile strength of 78 N/mm2 in comparison with other composite specimens. This is due to the length and content of fibers, which improve transferring action and microfailure modes.",

The number of studies on zeolite‐based inhibiting pigments has increased significantly in recent years, due to the need to replace chromates and reduce the content of phosphate corrosion inhibitors. Based on the results available in the literature, an assessment was conducted on the inhibitory properties of complex zeolite pigments obtained by various methods. Emphasis is placed on the advantages and disadvantages of ion exchange modification of zeolites with inhibitory substances and mechanochemical synthesis of pigments. Zeolites have a wide perspective in anticorrosion technologies due to their porous structure, large surface area, high pore volume, and the ability to accumulate inhibitory ions and molecules. Such properties of zeolites make possible their use for the development of self‐healing or “smart” polymer coatings. Considering the environmental safety of zeolites and their excellent thermal and chemical stability, anti‐corrosion polymer coatings inhibited by zeolite pigments could become an effective environmentally friendly alternative to chromate‐based protective coatings. The main trends and prospects for the development of research in this domain are presented.",

Edible pullulan films extend the shelf life and enhance food safety, while active pullulan films inhibit microbial growth and oxidation, thus supports food preservation. In the pharmaceutical industry, pullulan‐based films offer promising solutions for oral drug delivery, providing biodegradable and rapid disintegration for enhanced solubility and bioavailability of drugs. Additionally, due to their mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial properties, pullulan films demonstrate potential in wound dressings and tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, pullulan’s utility extends to the cosmetic industry, where it is used widely in various ingredients in skincare products, cosmetics, and personal care items. Its moisturizing, stabilizing, and film‐forming properties make pullulan an attractive component in the industry.

Some of which are based on the materials used in the production of the part, though others are rather pertinent to the process parameters. The manufacturing process and filament formulation has also a significant impact on the cost of the final product, as well as its physical, mechanical, and thermal properties. As the result, judicious combination of parameters can effectively act toward fine‐tuning FDM toward three‐dimensional printing (3DP) of pieces with quality fit‐for‐application. In this sense, the use of design of experiments (DOEs) is often needed for the purpose. Printing process parameters, including layer height, wall thickness, temperature, printing velocity, and tool path, have been discussed, in the understanding that 3DP time increases with decreasing layer thickness, and in turn increases production time and overall cost. A specific account is given on recent developments increasingly and more thoroughly focused on recognizing the impact of the process parameters and raw materials on the final product.",

    "abstract": "As far as the mixing performance in single-screw extrusion processes is concerned, it is well known that the deformation measure or stretching which materials undergo due to the regular flows inside a conventional screw channel increases linearly with the extruder channel length. In general, the chaotic mixing is far superior to the regular mixing. Therefore, it would be fascinating if one could make the chaotic mixing possible in single-screw extruders with a special, and yet easily manufacturable screw without sacrificing the pumping performance of single-screw extruders. With this purpose in mind, we have developed a new screw (termed \"Chaos Screw\") for the single-screw extrusion process to enhance the mixing performance via the chaotic flows. The main idea of the Chaos Screw design lies in the spatially periodic barriers inserted in the channel to break closed streamlines in regular flows, which induces the chaotic mixing. The present article describes the basic mechanism of the chaotic mixing in a single-screw extruder and presents experimental evidence of the chaotic mixing using the Chaos Screw. Experimental mixing patterns due to the chaotic flow clearly indicate that the Chaos Screw drastically enhances the mixing performance in a single-screw extruder. It may be mentioned that the accompanying article, Part II, presents numerical investigation which shows that the chaotic mixing was successfully predicted by numerical simulations. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) was used in extrusion for the improvement of polymer blend properties. Various extruder configurations using a twin-screw extruder and a single-screw extruder were designed for investigating the effects of dissolved supercritical CO2 on the viscosity and morphological properties of polyethylene, polystyrene, and their blends. The viscosities of the polymer/CO2 and the blend/CO2 solutions were measured at various concentrations of CO2 and PE/PS blending ratios using a wedge die mounted on the twin-screw extruder. The effect of CO2 on the morphology of PE/PS blends was also investigated using a twin/single-screw tandem system. This system allowed for preferential dissolution of the CO2 into the matrix and/or dispersed polymer phase. By introducing devolatilization to the tandem system, the morphological behaviors of PE/PS blends were investigated on unfoamed filaments. In general, the mixing between two polymers was improved by the dissolution of CO2. The size reduction of the dispersed phase was explained using the viscosity ratio of the two polymers. Finally, the interface between foamed and unfoamed polymers was studied in a bilayer structure produced by using a special configuration of the tandem system. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, heat‐shrinkable characteristics of a polyethylene compound were obtained by blending mixtures of low‐density polyethylene with varying amount of peroxide. These were then extruded and molded to the required shape and then cross‐linked by chemical means, followed by heating and stretching and then cooled to “freeze‐in” the oriented polymer structure (elastic memory). A decrease in the melting point and heat of fusion (Δ H f ), as determined from the DSC melting enthalpies, was observed with an increase in the dicumyl peroxide (DCP) concentration. Tests on the heat shrinkablity of the samples showed that the stretching temperature has a large effect on the shrinkage temperature. The results showed that by increasing the peroxide content, the shrinkage temperature was decreased. The elongation at break decreased with an increase in the DCP concentration. Increasing the temperature in lightly cross‐linked samples (low percent DCP) resulted in a reduction in the elongation at break. Increasing the cross‐linking density (DCP content) gave an opposite effect. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents an innovative design of a tandem extrusion system for fine‐celled foaming of plastic/wood‐fiber composites using a physical blowing agent (PBA). The plastic/wood‐fiber composites utilize wood‐fibers (WF) as a reinforcing filler in the plastic matrix and are known to be advantageous over the neat plastics in terms of the materials cost and some improved mechanical properties such as stiffness and strength. However, these improvements are usually accompanied by sacrifices in the ductility and impact resistance. These shortcomings can be reduced by inducing fine‐celled or microcellular foaming in these composites, thereby creating a new class of materials with unique properties. An innovative tandem extrusion system with continuous on‐line moisture removal and PBA injection was successfully developed. The foamed composites, produced on the tandem extrusion system, were compared with those produced on a single extruder system, and demonstrated significant improvement in cell morphology, resulting from uniform mixing and effective moisture removal. The effects of WF and coupling agent (CA) on the cell morphology were studied. An increase in the WF content had an adverse affect. The cell morphology and foam structures were improved when an appropriate CA was added. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This process is suitable for providing a wide range of syndiotactic polystyrenes comprising homopolymers, with a broad range of melt flow rates as well as copolymers of various comonomer contents, leading to products with various melting temperatures. Essential relationships and correlations of the separate process stages are demonstrated, in addition to useful analytical methods to control the process.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymer insulation for outdoor use has become increasingly more important and is expected to dominate the future HV‐outdoor applications. Polymeric insulators were reported to have performed better than porcelain and glass in laboratories and outdoor test sites. This paper reports an experimental investigation concerned with electrical and surface properties of a silicone‐modified polymer in comparison with silicone rubber (SIR), ethylene‐propylene‐diene monomer (EPDM), and alloys of SIR–EPDM. The loss of hydrophobicity of polymeric materials induced by UV, salt spray, and water salinity aging was examined in this work. An ATR–FTIR technique was used to study the surface degradation of polymers occurring during UV aging. Tracking and erosion induced by high‐electrical stresses reduce the lifetime of polymeric materials used for outdoor insulation. The results of standard tests showed that silicone rubber suffers from a deterioration of tracking resistance, caused by the loss of hydrophobicity from the action of water salinity stresses. The silicone‐modified polymer shows good hydrophobicity behavior in environmental conditions and excellent tracking and erosion resistance, as compared to SIR, EPDM, and alloy of SIR–EPDM. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Reactions were carried out under static (no mixing) and dynamic conditions on model samples and samples processed in batch mixers, respectively. As expected, MW and MWD decrease with increasing peroxide concentration. Low‐ and mid‐MW fractions increase at the expense of the high‐MW fractions. Localization of peroxide occurs under macrosegregation conditions and causes overall loss of peroxide efficiency and side reactions. MW and MWD undergo no further change after three to four times the half‐life of the peroxide. A kinetic model developed using the quasisteady‐state approximation on free radicals successfully simulates the degradation reaction kinetics for peroxide uniformly mixed. The method of moments is used to calculate the molecular weight averages. The results of this work confirm the importance of mixing uniformity as a parameter controlling the product characteristics in reactive processing.",

In particular, epoxy‐based polymers, exhibiting excellent mechanical properties for structural stability, filled with carbon nanotubes (CNTs: single, double, and multiwalled—SW, DW, and MW), characterized by remarkable mechanical and electrical properties, allow us to manufacture a very versatile class of composites for structural applications in automotive, aeronautics, industry, electronics, etc. Many aspects concerning the optimization of such composite systems are still to be clarified. In this paper, the physical properties of samples based on the epoxy resin with the same weight percentage (0.5%) of different CNTs have been studied. The physical behavior of the nanocomposites resulted to be dependent on the type and on the chemical functionalization of the nanoinclusions. The elastic modulus and the electrical conductivity of composites based on unfunctionalized CNT are higher than those obtained for the functionalized systems. Moreover, the maximum electrical conductivity achieved for the composite based on unfunctionalized MWCNT is not far from the target required for aeronautic applications. The contrasting results obtained for the different physical properties enlighten the difficulty in choosing one of the CNT types for the realization of multifunctional materials. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It was observed that blending HDPE with PP increased the rate of crystallization as well as the crystallite size of HDPE, attributed to the lower molecular weight and melt viscosity of the system. A depression of the melting temperature, the degree of crystallinity as well as the rate of crystallization with increased DCP content, confirmed that crystallization was inhibited by the formation of cross‐links and branches in the system. The GPC measurement revealed that the molecular weight and its distribution were influenced by the addition of DCP and/or PP to PE, resulting in the differences in the rate of crystallization, and the size and the degree of perfection of the crystallite.",

The mechanical analysis showed higher reduced modulus and lower creep effect for PMMA prepared from the DMF solution than for PMMA prepared from the chloroform and toluene solutions. The spectroscopic analysis pointed out the formation of a strong bond between the polymer carbonyl group and the solvent amide group for the PMMA prepared from the DMF solution and a significant distortion of the polymer chain for the PMMA prepared from the chloroform and toluene solutions.

The experimental results showed that optical polymer's refractive index exhibits a considerable amount of variation for the lenses molded under different packing pressures. Specifically, within the range investigated in this study, refractive index variation is more uniform when higher packing pressure was used but less so for lower packing pressure. Refractive index variation is believed to be the result of density variation, which itself is caused by shrinkage variation at different packing conditions. In addition, using density information in the plastic lenses predicted by finite element simulation, refractive index variation was numerically determined using the differential Lorentz–Lorenz equation and the results were in good agreement with the experiments conducted in this research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this regard, solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (as an important category of PCMs) and cellulose acetate (CA) were used as core and shell solutions, respectively. Electrospinning with a coaxial spinneret was performed, and nanofibers with the mean diameter of 545 nm under the controlled condition were produced. The formation of the core/shell structure was verified by scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis results not only revealed the thermal stability improvement of PCM but also confirmed the presence of the core/shell structure too. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis was also performed to measure the thermal energy storage capacity of the core/shell phase change nanofibers before and after a thermal cyclic test. A major finding in the present study is that the thermal energy storage capacity of core/shell nanofibers after the thermal cyclic test is significantly higher (41.23 J/g) than initial one (14.77 J/g). Ultimately, it can be summarized that the special core/shell configuration provides desirable thermal stability and durability concurrently along with high thermal energy storage capacity.",

When EVOH is stretched at moderate strain rates, evidence of strain‐induced crystallization and recrystallization was observed. Higher strain rates produced less structural variation because the homogeneous flow of the chains and the crystalline perfection are restricted due to the rapid drawing. In reference to the drawing temperature, EVOH showed a diffusive yielding, and the mechanical parameters were reduced due to the softening of the crystalline region. For EVOH composites, the filler hinders the molecular mobility, causing an increase in the strength and restricting the plastic flow. However, the higher temperature, higher molecular mobility, and ductility are not so affected by the filler content. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mesoporous alumina, as a porous, high specific surface area, high activity, and heat stable material, has been widely used as an industrial adsorbent, catalyst, and catalyst support. The modification of alumina with organic polymers has been widely investigated in recent years. In this study, we compared the dependence of the adsorption of a polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid) ( PAA ) on γ‐alumina particles on polymer size via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We found that PAA with a hydrodynamic diameter greater than the alumina pore size would only adsorb on the outer surface of the oxides. For polymers with hydrodynamic diameters smaller than the alumina pore size, PAA infiltration resulted in a monolayer coverage of both the outer and inner surfaces of the oxide. Among the three PAA that could infiltrate the alumina pores, the one with the smallest molecular weight showed the highest adsorbed amount on alumina. The temperature, pH , concentration, and ionic strength of the PAA solutions were varied to illustrate the physicochemical differences of the prepared polymer/oxide composite materials. The high PAA ‐loaded composites were treated with a nickel ion solution, converted to Ni/alumina catalysts, and used in the methanation of carbon dioxide. The Ni/alumina catalysts were analyzed with X‐ray diffraction and temperature‐programmed reduction to illustrate the structural characteristics. The catalytic CO 2 methanation of the catalyst samples revealed that a solution pH value higher than p K a of PAA favored the formation of catalysts with high catalytic activity.",

The flexural and impact properties, dynamic mechanical behavior, thermal transitions, thermal stability, phase, and fracture morphology are presented. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the thermal stability of blends diminished by the increasing amount of TPS. It is revealed from differential scanning calorimetry results that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and melting temperature ( T m ) are negatively affected by the NOR. Flexural and impact tests show that the mechanical properties are deteriorated by NOR. The TPS phase size becomes coarser with NOR as observed from scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that the properties of PLA/TPS blends are very sensitive to NOR and the PLA/TPS concentration as well.",

The SrAl x O y :Eu 2+ ,Dy 3+ phosphors excited by UV or visible light emit phosphorescence in the blue‐green region after the excitation source has been removed, and the phosphorescence last for more than 15 h. The major disadvantage of SrAl x O y :Eu 2+ ,Dy 3+ phosphors is that they are prone to hydrolysis and their luminescent properties gradually deteriorate. The dispersion of these phosphors in a waterproof polymer matrix is an alternative method reported for retaining their luminescent properties. The review extensively deals with strontium aluminate based luminescent materials, the mechanism of luminescence, their synthesis techniques, and different mixing procedures to prepare polymer/strontium aluminate composites. Different methods to improve the dispersion of the strontium aluminate in the polymer matrix are also outlined.",

The results show the presence of an oxidation peak (anodic current peak) at approximately +1110 mV vs. saturated calomel electrode in all cases of the investigated parameters. A gradual increase in the anodic current peak density ( I p ) is observed with a repeating number of cycles accompanied with the appearance of a new peak at low positive potential from the second repeating cycle. In addition, the effects of m ‐toluidin, sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate concentrations, scan rate, and temperature values have the same behavior on I p values, in which there is an increase in I p values till certain values (different for each parameter) and then decrease. The experimentally obtained kinetic equation is deduced from values of I p , and a simplified mechanism for the electrochemical anodic polymerization of m ‐toluidin is proposed.

LD slag is a major solid waste generated in huge quantities during steel making. It comes from slag formers such as burned lime/dolomite and from oxidizing of silica, iron etc. while refining the iron into steel in the LD furnace. Although a number of ways for its utilization have been suggested in the past, its potential as a filler material in polymeric matrices has not yet been explored. In this work, composites of five different compositions (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5 and 30 wt% of LD slag reinforced in epoxy resin) are prepared by a simple hand layup technique. The composites are characterized in regard to their density, porosity, micro‐hardness and strength properties. Erosion trials (ASTM G 76) are conducted on the composite samples following a well‐planned experimental schedule based on Taguchi's design of experiments. The study reveals that the impact velocity and LD slag content in the composites are the most significant among various factors that influence the wear rate. This work shows that LD slag, in spite of being a waste, possesses fairly good filler characteristics as it modifies the properties and improves the erosion resistance of the polymeric resin.",

At first, by introducing the reactions of the foam production and expressing the stoichiometric relationships, a method is provided to select the amounts of the basic compounds for getting the desirable properties. By knowing the OH number of polyol and the NCO content of isocyanate after selecting an amount of a blowing agent for the reaction, the quantity of each compound to produce the desirable foam can be found. Then different foams with various amounts of surfactant are produced. By preparing proper samples, the mechanical, thermal, nonacoustical, and acoustical properties of the foams are measured or calculated by using different instruments. The nonacoustical properties are obtained based on two distinct methods, i.e., a semiphenomenological method and an indirect method. The obtained properties are validated by comparing the calculated theoretical sound absorption coefficients with the measured ones. The results show that with a small increase of surfactant, the acoustical properties of foam samples improve by about 50% without any significant changes in other mechanical and thermal properties of the foams. This improvement results from the variations of reticulation rate and cell size. In addition, the initial desirable porosity and density considered in the stoichiometric relations are fairly achieved in produced samples. These results validate the accuracy of the stoichiometric relations.",

The CNC used as nanoreinforcing fillers were extracted, at nanometric scale, from sugarcane bagasse fibers using sulfuric acid hydrolysis process, and their morphology and structure were characterized. Plasticized ALG films and plasticized ALG ‐ CNC bionanocomposite films were prepared by solvent casting method. Before the casting process, the steady shear viscosity of film‐forming solutions of all studied formulations was studied and compared. The obtained ALG ‐based films were successfully characterized in terms of their structure, transparency, water vapor permeability ( WVP ), moisture uptake ( MU ), thermal, and mechanical properties. It was found that all studied plasticized films keep the same transparency level of neat ALG films, thus suggesting that the selected plasticizers are compatible with the ALG biopolymer, and the CNC are well dispersed within the bionanocomposite films. The elastic modulus and tensile strength of neat ALG films were largely decreased after the addition of different plasticizers, while the elongation at break was significantly increased. However, these selected mechanical parameters were simultaneously improved when CNC are incorporated into plasticized ALG bionanocomposite films. The WVP and MU properties of ALG films were decreased when different plasticizers and CNC were added. Herein, the steps to form new eco‐friendly ALG films were described by taking advantage of the combination of plasticizers and CNC with ALG biopolymer. The as‐produced films exhibited good optical transparency while reducing the WVP and enhancing tensile properties, which are the main properties required for packaging applications.",

The total nine formulations were prepared according to formulation by design helped by JMP software 13.2.1. The patient oriented quality target product profiles were earmarked and on that basis critical quality attributes were identified. Preliminary screening studies along with initial risk assessment eased the selection of film-forming polymer (HPMC E 15) and plasticizer (PEG 400) as CMAs for formulation of films. A 3 2 full factorial plan was utilized for assurance of impact, i.e., HPMC E15 (X 1 ) and PEG 400 (X 2 ), as independent variables (factors) on thickness (mm) (Y 1 ), disintegration time (s) (Y 2 ), folding endurance (Y 3 ), and tensile strength (kg) (Y 4 ). Furthermore, prediction profiler assists in predicting composition of best formulation encompassing desired targeted response. The optimized formulation (F6) showed fast drug dissolution (&gt;90%) within 8 min, and solid state characterization by DSC, XRD revealed excellent film characteristics. In a nutshell, the fast dissolving buccal film for clonidine hydrochloride was successfully developed assisted by QbD approach with markedly improved biopharmaceutical performance as well as patient compliance.",

Higher swelling results (83.68%) were obtained at pH 7.4 in less than 3 h. Porous surfaces with drug were seen in TEM images. Maximum release was observed at pH 7.4 (89.51%). Solubility enhancement was 7.38‐fold in water as compared to pure acyclovir. Thermal stability of grafted microparticles was increased up to 440.13°C.

The apparent activation energy ( E a ) was determined using Ozawa–Flynn–Wall, Tang Wanjun, and Coats–Redfern (modified) methods. The apparent activation energies range from 61.3 to 110.9 kJ mol −1 . Increasing the heating rate shifted the T max to a higher level. The lower activation energy observed indicates the breakage of the bonds at weak links. Moreover, the values of activation energy are significantly controlled by the heating rate, level of conversion, and calculation technique. A comparison among the different techniques has been made on the basis of the apparent activation energy from the TG data. The activation energies determined by all the three methods are in good agreement with each other. Furthermore, the pyrolysis of model polypropylene was carried out over the temperature range 350–415°C in a salt bath using Pyrex reaction vessel. The gaseous fraction produced was collected in gas sampling bag and monitored gas chromatographically. The major hydrocarbons detected were methane, propylene, propane, 2‐methylpentane, 2,4 dimethylpentane, and 2,4 dimethylheptane.",

A synthesized MIL-53(Fe) sample was characterized, and results indicated that the formed MIL-53(Fe) was a single phase with small particle size of 0.8 μm and homogeneous particle size distribution was obtained. The synthesized MIL-53(Fe) has been used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by a drop-casting technique. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the MIL-53(Fe)-modified GCE showed that the MIL-53(Fe) was successfully immobilized onto the GCE electrode surface and the electrochemical behavior of the GCE/MIL-53(Fe) electrode was stable. In addition, several electrochemical parameters of MIL-53(Fe)-modified GCE (GCE/MIL-53(Fe)) including the heterogeneous standard rate constant ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msup> <mrow> <mi>k</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>0</mn> </mrow> </msup> </math> ) and the electrochemically effective surface area ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>A</mi> </math> ) were calculated.

Therefore, the GCE/MIL-53(Fe) electrode has been used as a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for cadmium ion (Cd(II)) monitoring in aqueous solution using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique.

The study results indicate improved compaction, shear strength, consolidation, and the bearing ratio of the PF-stabilised clay soil. As the PF content increased, its maximum dry density increased and its optimum moisture content decreased; its angle of internal friction increased and its cohesion coefficient decreased; and its void ratio, consolidation coefficient, and hydraulic conductivity all decreased. Comparing the unstabilised (0% PF) and stabilised (3% PF) clay soil, the void ratio, consolidation coefficient, and hydraulic conductivity decreased from 0.96 to 0.93, from 2.52 to 2.34 cm 2 /s, and from 1.12 to 1.02 cm/s, respectively.

    "abstract": "The polymer laser sintering (PLS) process is one of the most promising additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for polymeric materials. However, the technique has challenges because the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the polymeric powder deteriorate due to the high temperatures prevailing in the build chamber during manufacture. These high temperatures cause agglomeration of powder, which leads to a decrease in the flowability of powder. There is also a related drop in the coalescence of the powder granules during PLS, which results in porosity that undermines the mechanical integrity of printed parts. Moreover, the viscosity of the melt increases due to cross-linking of molecular chains. This, in turn, increases the tensile strength of the printed components at the expense of the percentage elongation at break. Thus, high prolonged processing temperatures decrease the reusability of polymeric materials used in PLS. In this paper, a review of the studies conducted to investigate ways of reducing the effects of high temperature on polymeric powders is presented.",

In this research, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising cellulose acetate (CA) with various loadings of bentonite (Bt) clay were fabricated by adopting the phase-inversion technique for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation. The developed pristine and MMMs were characterized for morphological, thermal, structural, and mechanical analyses. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and nano-indentation investigations revealed the promising effect of Bt clay in MMMs as compared to pristine CA membrane. Nano-indentation test identified that elastic modulus and hardness of the MMM with 1 wt. loading was increased by 64% and 200%, respectively, compared to the pristine membrane. The permeability decreased with the incorporation of Bt clay due to uniform dispersion of filler attributed to enhanced tortuosity for the gas molecules. Nevertheless, an increase in gas separation performance was observed with Bt addition up to 1 wt. loading. The opposite trend prevailed with increasing Bt concentration on the separation performance owing to filler agglomeration and voids creation. The maximum value of ideal selectivity (CO2/CH4) was achieved at 2 bar pressure with 1 wt. % Bt loading, which is 79% higher than the pristine CA membrane. For CO2/N2, the ideal selectivity was 123% higher compared to the pristine membrane with 1 wt. % Bt loading at 4 bar pressure.",

Indeed, microwave heating allows regio-, chemio-, and stereo-selectivity, faster chemical reactions, and higher yields even in solvent-free processes. Thus, this heating mode provides a good alternative to the conventional heating by reducing time and energy consumption, hence reducing the costs and ecological impact of polymer chemistry and processing. This review states some achievements in the use of microwaves as energy source during the synthesis and transformation of polymers.

Gamma irradiation source (60Co irradiation) was used to irradiate SAH from 1 to 10 kGy dose at room temperature (~27°C). The swelling ratio, water absorption, equilibrium water content, and gel fraction properties of the hydrogel were investigated. The as-prepared hydrogel treated with KOH (THG) showed excellent absorption capacity but less mechanical stability compared to untreated hydrogel (UHG). The gel fraction of treated SAH was slightly lower in methanol, but the utmost in water at 5 kGy infers the proper grafting of SAH at this point. The prepared SAH was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) to investigate the surface morphology and molecular interaction, respectively. Moreover, this study’s focal point is to propose an alternative method to remove chromium and methylene blue by SAH from industrial wastewater. The Cr adsorption capacity of UHG was higher than that of THG because the proton’s replacement is easier than that of K by Cr. On the other hand, THG was found to be more efficient in removing methylene blue from industrial wastewater due to the presence of an easily ionized group (–COOK) in SAH. Therefore, the hydrogel can be proposed as a potential superabsorbent to remove heavy metals and organic dyes from industrial wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPECs) of polysaccharides are multifunctional polymer materials that improve the mechanical and physicochemical properties of individual polysaccharides. In this study, highly porous (&gt;90%) materials based on IPECs of versatile natural polysaccharides, chitosan (30 and 1,200 kDa) and pectin, are obtained by freeze-drying technique. To enhance the interaction between chitosan and pectin macromolecules, the latter are chemically functionalized with dialdehyde groups. The chitosan-/aldehyde-functionalized pectin (Chit/AF-Pect) polyelectrolyte complex sponges obtained are characterized using SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, and TGA. The swelling capacity study reveals a higher swelling ratio of IPEC sponges with an increase in both the molecular weight and content of chitosan: for Chit30/AF-Pect, the swelling ratio rises from 327% to 480%, while for Chit1200/AF-Pect, from 681% to 1,066%. Additionally, the in vitro degradation test demonstrates higher stability of Chit1200/AF-Pect sponges in comparison with those of Chit30/AF-Pect: after 4 days of incubation, the weight losses are found to be 9%–16% and 18%–41%, respectively. The cytotoxicity study shows that Chit30/AF-Pect sponges are noncytotoxic, with cell viability values &gt;70%. Furthermore, the Chit30/AF-Pect sponges, obtained at chitosan:pectin weight ratio of 5:1, exhibit bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli BIM B-984 G, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BIM B-807 G, Staphylococcus aureus BIM B-1841, and slightly inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis BIM B-1530 G. These findings indicate that the obtained Chit30/AF-Pect sponges can be used to create wound dressings for wound healing applications.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel semiempirical mathematical approach consisting of a coupled thermo‐kinetic model as valuable tool for predicting the polymeric fraction profile of membranes synthesized by nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS). Equilibrium binodal curves (BCs) of the system component were incorporated to the Fick’s diffusive kinetic model allowing a satisfactory prediction of the tendency to develop symmetric or asymmetric porous membrane morphologies, as well as a fair quantification of average porous fraction profiles. The model was validated using two different ternary systems: (i) polycaprolactone (PCL)/N‐methylpyrrolidone (NMP)/water (W) characteristic of instantaneous demixing (asymmetric finger‐like porous cross‐section morphology); and (ii) PCL/NMP/isopropanol (IPA) characteristic of delayed demixing (symmetric sponge‐like cross‐section morphology). The loading of graphene oxide (GO) in the quaternary system PCL/GO/NMP/IPA also gave rise to a sponge‐like porosity, characteristic of delayed demixing systems, which was reasonably predicted by the coupled thermo‐kinetic model developed in this study. In addition, a computational scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image processing methodology was developed to validate the thermo‐kinetic model, resulting in an advantageous tool for that purpose. Overall, this work reveals the usefulness of the new thermo‐kinetic mathematical approach as a facile computational tool for membrane manufacturers and researchers for a preliminary discrimination of component combinations in quaternary polymer/nanofiller/solvent/nonsolvent NIPS systems.",

Although most studies have shown that compatibilizers can improve the product performance of PC/ABS alloys, there are still different scholars who have demonstrated that compatibilizers do not have the expected effect. This study investigated the effects of various types of compatibilizers on properties such as the impact strength of PC/ABS alloys. To make rubber particles better mixed and achieve fine dispersion, a closed torque rheometer was used to make PC/ABS alloys. To avoid the influence of flow orientation on rubber particle dispersion during injection molding, test specimens were prepared using the mold pressing method. PC‐rich alloys with no compatibilizer show the best performance in all trial samples. Maleic anhydride grafted ABS (ABS‐g‐MAH), synthesized by emulsion polymerization, could not enhance properties significantly as a compatibilizer. Methyl methacrylate–butadiene–styrene (MBS), which has the same rubber content as ABS powder, could not improve performance either. Sufficient rubbers well‐dispersed in styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) and PC content are key factors in influencing the performance in PC‐rich blends.",

The protein content, morphology, molecular weight distribution (MWD), mechanical properties, dynamic mechanical analysis, and thermo‐mechanical properties were studied. The morphological characteristics of the Hevea brasiliensis natural rubber clones were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that the particle sizes of the three clones ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 µm. Moreover, the MWD exhibited a bimodal pattern in the RRIM600 and RRIT251 clones, leading to a high polydispersity index (PDI) that correlates with protein content. Additionally, the PB235 clone showed higher molecular weight (Mw) than the other clones, which affected the properties of the vulcanized latex films. The mechanical properties, dynamic mechanical properties, thermal properties from temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR) analysis, and swelling resistance were also studied. The results indicated that the crosslinked density of the vulcanized latex films is related to the bimodal MWD. This leads to increased physical interactions between the end chains of short and long rubber molecules. Moreover, the crosslinked density is associated with protein content. This study confirms that the MWD and non‐rubber components in different natural rubber clones affect the properties of vulcanized rubber.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in biomedical engineering have shed light on the remarkable capabilities of self‐healing hydrogels, particularly those derived from chitosan (CHS) or its derivatives. These hydrogels exhibit noteworthy properties such as self‐healing (SH), biocompatibility, and responsiveness to various stimuli like pressure, temperature, and pH. Recently, different therapeutic approaches, especially gene therapy and chemotherapy, have been explored through the incorporation of CHS‐based hydrogels with therapeutic agents. Despite their promise, the clinical application of CHS hydrogels has been limited owing to an inadequate combination of physical and chemical properties, resulting in uncontrolled swelling and suboptimal SH behavior, particularly in terms of mechanical properties. This comprehensive review will explore the mechanistic understanding of various functionalized CHS, shedding light on their ability to offer desired SH properties while enhancing swelling behavior. These advancements are crucial for applications in tissue engineering and wound management. This comprehensive review aims to serve as a guide to CHS‐based self‐healing hydrogels, emphasizing their potential in addressing diverse challenges in the field of biomedical engineering.",

    "abstract": "Structure-property relationships of injection- and compression-molded microfibrillar-reinforced PET/PA-6 blends with different weight ratio of the components have been studied. The blends were prepared by melt mixing using a single-screw extruder. Thermal, X-ray (WAXS), morphological, and static mechanical studies of the bulk samples were carried out in order to determine an optimum processing window. The upper processing temperature was established by the onset of the melting of the fibrillized PET component in the blend. Morphological studies of the injection-molded samples indicate skin-core morphology. The skin layer is composed of fibrils that are well oriented along the flow axis. The core region is composed of a small amount of randomly oriented, fibrillar PET bundles, as well as a large amount of spherical PET domains in the isotropic PA-6 matrix. SEM observations of the fracture surface of compression-molded samples show well-extended PET fibrils embedded in an isotropic PA-6 matrix. The reason for this significant difference in the morphology of the samples is the fact that in the case of compression molding it is possible to keep very accurately the desired processing temperature in a quite narrow interval. On the other hand, an overheating of the system due to non-isothermal shear and a viscosity dissipation are the main reasons for the melting of a part of the PET fibrils and their transformation into spherical domains in the core of the injection-molded samples. The morphology strongly affects the tensile properties of the bulk samples. Compared to the values of injection-molded neat PA-6, the elastic modulus and the strength of injection-molded MFC (Microfibrillar reinforced composites) blends have been increased by a factor of 2.5 and 1.7, respectively. In the case of compression-molded samples, both modulus and strength were about four times higher than those of the neat PA-6. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 19: 249–259, 2000",

This laminar morphology, induced by biaxial orientation, was found to result in a significant increase in the oxygen barrier property of PP/EVOH (85/15) blends by about 10 times relative to the pure PP. In this study, compatibility in the PP/EVOH blend system was evaluated by investigating the influence of compatibilizer on the rheological, morphological, and mechanical properties of the blends. In addition, the effects of compatibilizer content, draw ratio, and draw temperature on the oxygen permeability and morphology of biaxially drawn blend films were also studied. It was revealed that an optimum amount of compatibilizer, maleic anhydride grafted PP, should be used to improve the barrier property of the PP/EVOH blends with a well‐developed laminar structure. The draw ratio and draw temperature had a significant influence on the permeability of the blends. The blend films exhibited a more pronounced laminar structure when the blends were stretched biaxially under processing conditions of higher draw ratio and draw temperature, resulting in higher barrier properties. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The three carbon fillers investigated included an electrically conductive carbon black, synthetic graphite particles, and a milled pitch‐based carbon fiber. For each polymer, conductive resins were produced and tested that contained varying amounts of these single carbon fillers. In addition, combinations of fillers were investigated by conducting a full 2 3 factorial design and a complete replicate in each polymer. The objective of this study was to determine the effects and interactions of each filler on the SE properties of the conductive resins. Carbon black caused the largest increase in SE.

The nature of the stress–strain curve recorded during the process of extension, and its dependence on the parameters of extension mentioned above, are analyzed. Results show that for specimens stretched in the biaxial simultaneous mode, the stress–strain curve is concave upward, which is typical for amorphous polymeric materials. Strain‐hardening occurs at high planar extensions, and is accompanied by a steep rise in the stress measured during stretching. The magnitude of this stress increases with increasing strain rate and extension ratios, but decreases with increasing temperature of stretching. During biaxial sequential extension, the stress–strain curve is concave upward at low strain rates or at high temperatures of stretching, but becomes convex upward at higher strain rates or lower temperatures. The curve also changes from concave to convex upward at high limiting extension ratios in the first direction. The convex upward nature of the stress‐strain curve is typical of semi‐crystalline materials, indicating the occurrence of strain‐induced crystallization during stretching in the first direction. Again, the level of stress, measured during stretching, increases with increasing strain rate and limiting extension ratio in the first direction, while it decreases with increasing temperature of stretching. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

A standard SMC was pyrolyzed under nitrogen, at 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700°C, for 30 min in a 3.5‐dm 3 autoclave. This paper focuses on the possibilities of reusing the fibers and fillers contained in the solid residue obtained from SMC pyrolysis. The solid pyrolysis residue was recycled in another thermoset composite, bulk molding compound (BMC), of polyester and fiberglass. The mechanical properties of BMCs prepared with different proportions of the solid residue (fiber + CaCO 3 filler) from SMC pyrolysis were compared with those of BMCs prepared with the same proportions of virgin fiber and CaCO 3 . In summary, pyrolysis can be an appropriate technique for recycling SMC, with 500°C, the most suitable temperature for the process. Solid residues of 75 wt%, composed of 65 wt% of powdery material (mainly CaCO 3 ) and 35 wt% of fiberglass, were obtained. Such solids can be recycled in a proportion of 6 wt% in BMC to replace virgin filler and fiberglass, with no detrimental effect on the BMC mechanical properties. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A back light module is a key product for providing sufficient light source for a liquid crystal display (LCD). The light guide plate (LGP), used to increase the light usage rate, is a key component in the back light module. This study researches the microinjection molding process parameters and the quality performance of the LGP. Its purpose was to develop a combining Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with the Taguchi method. This is to optimize the multiquality performance of the LGP for the injection molding manufacturing process, in which both the LCD and the LGP spontaneously produce the best quality performance for V‐cut depth and angle. First, an L 18 orthogonal array was planned for the manufacturing parameters that affect the microinjection molding process. These included cooling time, mold temperature, melt temperature, injection speed, injection pressure, packing pressure, packing switching, and packing time. The TOPSIS was used to deal with the single‐quality optimization disadvantage of the Taguchi method. Then, the TOPSIS response table was used to obtain the optimized manufacturing parameters combination for a multiresponse process optimization. From the analysis of variance, the significant factors for the quality performance of the LGP could be obtained. In other words, by controlling these factors, it was possible to efficiently control the quality performance of the LGP. Finally, with the five verified experiments, the optimized processing parameters came within a 95% confidence interval. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Fast and reliable production of micro/nanofeatured patterns on large‐area polymer films is of a great importance. In this study, a novel roll‐to‐roll thermal imprinting process was developed, capable of providing a mold‐heating rate of 125°C/s with sufficient temperature control to produce large‐area patterns continuously at a rapid production rate. With this new process, selected micro/nano patterns were produced on a polyethylene terephthalate film at a production rate exceeding 1 m/min. The roller mold temperature played a profound role in affecting the replication quality. To achieve good feature transfer properties, an elevated roller mold temperature approaching the melting temperature of the polymer was found to be critical. Microcavity filling time calculation further revealed that the elevated roller mold temperature is also necessary for achieving a rapid film feed rate as desired in the continuous roll‐to‐roll process. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The UV–vis spectra showed that the transmission of nanocomposites increased with the sepiolite content and wavelength. The thermal degradation behavior of PVC was investigated by using TG analysis under nonisothermal conditions at different heating rates under a nitrogen atmosphere. The apparent activation energy of samples was determined by using the Kissinger method. The nanocomposite showed higher activation energy than that of pure PVC. The results showed that the thermal degradation of PVC was shifted toward higher temperatures with an increase in the amount of sepiolite. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The morphologies of the nonwoven nanofiber membranes and the corresponding nanofiber filaments were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties and crystal structure of both the nanofiber membranes and the nanofiber filaments were investigated by using a universal testing machine and wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction (WAXD), respectively. We found that the tensile strength and Young's modulus of nanofiber filaments were dramatically improved by increasing either the number of twists of the nanofibers or the width of nanofiber membranes, compared with nonwoven PVDF nanofibers. WAXD analysis indicated that the crystalline transformation from β‐phase to α‐phase occurred by the shear force driven by repeated twisting. It was concluded that both the crystalline structures of fibers and the fiber morphologies played a crucial role in the mechanical properties of the resultant nanofiber filaments. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The resulting experimental database is of the utmost importance for generating design allowables for structures integrating such thermoplastic‐based composites. Depending on the test and the laminate's staking sequence, a temperature increase higher than the glass transition temperature ( T g = 98°C of fiber fabric reinforced PPS laminates softens the matrix behavior and significantly degrades the quality of the adhesion at the fiber/matrix interface, resulting in reduced mechanical properties (in‐plane shear, compressive, flexural and interlaminar shear). However, it does not seem to be detrimental for the tensile and the double lap joint's properties in quasi‐isotropic laminates. In angle‐ply laminates, the ductile behavior of the PPS matrix is exacerbated at high temperature resulting in larger plastic deformations and a lesser hole sensitivity of this material. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Their low solubility causes elimination of most of the drug from body as such, and desired therapeutic levels are not achieved. Polymers are major players in these formulations, e.g., chitosan, polyvinyl pyrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, β‐cyclodextrin, etc. β‐Cyclodextrin is one of the most efficient polymer among all of these to work as a carrier for these drugs to enhance solubility. In the present work, microparticles were prepared by different techniques to enhance solubility of rosuvastatin calcium. Microparticles were evaluated for Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, dissolution studies, powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and stability studies to confirm enhancement in solubility. Different in vitro kinetic models such as zero order, first order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas were applied to determine the release behavior of drug from prepared formulations. Results were statistically analyzed by the one‐way ANOVA test, and the p value was determined to check significant results. Results of PXRD had shown that drug nature was changed from crystalline to amorphous, and FTIR and thermal analysis confirmed that the complex was formed between drug and β‐cyclodextrin. SEM images had shown that microparticles had small size loaded with drug.

The paper presents the first scientific study to show how different results are given by the various definitions of stress–strain used and to recommend a specific definition when calculating the energy absorption characteristics of the PVA sponge. A series of tensile tests on PVA sponges are carried out. Three stress definitions (second Piola–Kirchhoff stress, engineering stress, and true stress) and four strain definitions (Almansi–Hamel strain, Green–St. Venant strain, engineering strain, and true strain) are used to determine the modulus of resilience and modulus of toughness. The stress–strain curves of PVA sponges show a near constant plateau stress over a long strain range, which is ideal for energy absorption applications. The results reveal that the Green–St. Venant strain definition has the highest modulus of resilience (3000 J/m 3 ) and toughness (56,900 J/m 3 ) at different definitions of stress and may overestimate the modulus of resilience and toughness. The Almansi–Hamel strain definition exhibits the lowest modulus of resilience (1760 J/m 3 ) and toughness (4850 J/m 3 ) at different stress definitions and may underestimate these values. The results also show that the effect of varying the stress definition on the modulus of toughness measurements is significant but not when calculating the modulus of resilience. The true stress–true strain definition favors spongy material mechanics since it gives more accurate measurements of the sponge's response using the instantaneous values.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Protein‐based thermoplastics offer an attractive alternative to petroleum‐based plastics if their properties allow for large volume production using processes such as injection molding. A fractional factorial design was used to analyze the influence of injection‐molding parameters (melt temperature, tool temperature, injection rate, holding pressure, and cooling time) on the injection‐molding process (maximum injection pressure, injection pressure curve) and mechanical properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, secant modulus) of blood meal–based thermoplastics. Optimal mechanical properties were obtained at higher tool and melt temperatures while the injection rate was unimportant. The most important injection parameter was the holding pressure, which has to be lowered when using a higher melt temperature, which was preferred for better elongation at break. A lower holding pressure also produced moldings with a higher modulus, which could be good for demolding. Blood meal–based thermoplastics behaved mostly like standard thermoplastics, without any significant deviations. Within a workable processing window, its mechanical properties were largely unaffected by processing conditions, but as with any thermoplastic, care must be taken to select the best injection‐molding parameter settings to achieve optimal part quality and high processability. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The smoke‐suppression properties and flame retardancy of iron oxide brown on IFREP compositions were investigated by the cone calorimeter test (CCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis‐infrared spectrometry. Remarkably, CCT data revealed that the incorporation of iron oxide brown into IFREP compositions can significantly reduce heat release rate, total heat release, smoke production rate, and total smoke release, and so on. On the other hand, the SEM results showed that iron oxide brown can greatly improve the structure of char residue. The thermogravimetric data indicated that iron oxide brown had different effects on the process of thermal degradation of the IFREP compositions. The volatilized products formed on thermal degradation of IFREP compositions indicated that the volatilized products were H 2 O, CO 2 , CO, carboxylic acid, and aliphatic hydrocarbons according to the temperature of onset formation. Here, iron oxide brown is considered to be an effective smoke‐suppression agent and a good synergism with IFR in flame‐retardant epoxy resins, which can greatly enhance the char residue.",

It has been confirmed by computation and experimentation that melting in starve-fed single-screw extruders is totally different compared with melting in flood-fed extruders. It is faster, and the screw length needed for melting extends with an increase of the flow rate. The screw is fully filled for some distance from the die only and starved beyond it.

A composition of Gel/PAA hydrogel is widely used as a biological glue of soft tissues. However, the influence of PAA on the mechanical properties of this composite hydrogel so far has not been determined. In this study, gel hydrogels were prepared at various PAA content, i.e., 10, 20, and 30 wt%, using a thermal‐initiated redox polymerization method. Afterward, as=prepared cylindrical hydrogel samples were subjected to a series of compressive loading to measure their linear elastic (elastic modulus, maximum stress and strain) and nonlinear hyperelastic (hyperelastic coefficients) mechanical properties. The potential ability of the Yeoh material model to closely address the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the hydrogel was verified using finite element (FE) modeling of the compression test. The results showed that the addition of PAA (&gt;10 wt%) invokes a significant decrease in the Young's modulus and maximum stress of the hydrogels whereas a significant increase in the maximum strain. The highest Young's modulus (25 MPa) and maximum stress (12 MPa) were observed in the hydrogels with PAA (10 wt%), whereas the highest maximum strain (43%) was detected in the Gel/PAA (30 wt%) samples. The experimental results were well compared to those anticipated by the Yeoh and FE models. The results suggested that an optimum addition of PAA not only could enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogels but also provide a nonlinear behavior of composite hydrogels, which is suitable for soft tissue engineering.",

The processability was investigated using a Brabender® mixer and a Pharma 11 Twin Screw Extruder. HPMCAS extrudates were characterized with regard to glass transition temperature, true density, yellowness index, crystallinity, morphology, and free succinic acid/acetic acid/succinoyl group/acetyl group content. The specific energy input and mean residence time were also calculated and correlated to the physicochemical properties of final extrudates. Additionally, the effect of the die opening size of the twin screw extruder was investigated. The glass transition temperature of HPMCAS was found to be 137 and 133°C, using dynamic mechanical analyzer and oscillatory rheometer, respectively. HPMCAS demonstrated a shear thinning behavior at all temperatures tested (150, 160, and 170°C). The process conditions, screw configurations, as well as the diameter of die opening significantly affect the amount of free acetic acid and succinic acid. With a modified screw configuration and 1‐mm die, the amounts of free acetic acid and succinic acid from the material processed at 180°C were 0.114% and 0.337%, respectively. Moreover, when the die was removed, the amounts of free acetic acid and succinic acid were further reduced to 0.084% and 0.294%, respectively. In conclusion, we successfully extruded HPMCAS at a temperature as low as 130°C and up to 180°C without any significant thermal degradation.",

This adsorbent was characterized by several techniques such as FTIR , TEM , TGA , VSM and DLS . Three kinetic models, pseudo‐first‐order, pseudo‐second‐order and intra‐particle diffusion models were used to study the adsorption kinetics. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics of pharmaceuticals onto magnetic poly (St‐ AMPS ) adsorbent followed the pseudo‐second‐order model and were relatively rapid. In addition, it was found that the intra‐particle diffusion was not the sole rate‐controlling step and the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto adsorbent occurred via two steps adsorption process. The experimental data were fitted with three isotherm models including Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin‐Radushkevich (D‐R). It was found that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto magnetic poly (St‐ AMPS ) nanoparticles was the best described by the Langmuir model. Maximum adsorption capacities of 150.602, 47.824 and 119.904 mg/g were obtained for DCF , ATN and CFX , respectively. Also the obtained free energy from D‐R isotherm (6.19, 4.93 and 6.45 kJ /mol for DCF , ATN and CFX respectively) indicated that the adsorption process was a physiosorption. Magnetic poly (St‐ AMPS ) adsorbent could be recycled for removal of CFX , DCF and ATN by alkaline aqueous solution ( pH 8). Therefore, this adsorbent can act as a promising adsorbent for water treatment processes.",

Viscosity versus shear rates was evaluated by both rotational and capillary rheometers to cover a large range of shear rates. Higher viscosity of PA 6 compared to PP 25 and PP 18 at the theoretical shear rate resulted in the encapsulation of PA 6 by PP 25 and PP 18 at the periphery of the bicomponent fiber cross section. Interfacial instability from the center to the periphery fiber was explained as a result of non‐uniformity of shear rates across the fiber cross section.

It was found that the optimal ratio of DMSO to water in a coagulation bath was 85/15. The analysis of the structure of different fibers (including fibers with carbon nanotubes) demonstrated the superposition of crystalline phase and orientation‐disordered mesophase. The evolution of this structure could provide the answer to the question of which structure of “white” fibers is best for obtaining high‐quality “black” fibers. Measurement of the structure and mechanical properties of fibers allowed us to optimize the technology of thermal treatment of fibers including the intensity of heat output in the stages of thermal‐oxidative stabilization and carbonization as well as the strain characteristics and applied tension. Model carbon fibers have a satisfactory complex of mechanical properties. We aimed to choose a set of experimental approaches as a proper way to produce high‐strength carbon fibers.",

    "abstract": "Interfacial interaction between host matrix and nanofillers is a determinative parameter on the mechanical and thermal properties of nanocomposites. In this paper, we first investigated interaction between carbon nanotube (CNT) and montmorillonite clay (MMT) absorbing on epoxy surface in a theoretical study based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results showed the interaction energy of -1.93 and -0.11 eV for MMT/epoxy and CNT/epoxy, respectively. Therefore, the interaction between epoxy polymer and MMT is of the chemisorptions type, while epoxy physically interacts with CNT. In addition, thermal and mechanical analyses were conducted on nanocomposites. In DSC analysis the glass transition temperature which was 70°C in neat epoxy composite showed an improvement to about 90°C in MMT nanocomposites while it was about 70°C for CNT nanocomposites. Finally, mechanical properties were investigated and MMT nanocomposite showed a change in compressive strength which increased from 52.60 Mpa to 72.07 and 92.98 Mpa in CNT and MMT nanocomposites, respectively. Also tensile strength improved to the value of 1250.69 Mpa MMT nanocomposites while it was about 890 Mpa in both CNT nanocomposite and neat epoxy composite which corresponds to the calculation result prediction.",

Hence, becoming a potential threat to veterinary and public health. Therefore, to control the infection new nontoxic, biocompatible antimicrobial formulation with enhanced antibacterial activity is massively required. Current study was planned to synthesize chitosan coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (CS-NPs coated TiO 2 ). Coating was being done by chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) using ionic gelation method. Aqueous solution of Moringa concanensis leaf extract was used to synthesize titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs). The synthesized nanoformulations were characterized by using XRD, SEM, and FTIR. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated the crystalline phase of TiO 2 NPs and CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed spherical shaped nanoparticles size of chitosan NPs ranging from 19–25 nm and TiO 2 NPs 35–50 nm. Thesize of CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs was in the range of 65–75 nm. The UV-Vis Spectra and band gap values illustrated the red shift in CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the linkages between TiO 2 NPs and chitosan biopolymer, Zeta potential confirmed the stability of CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs by showing 95 mV peak value. In-vitro antibacterial activity of CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs and Uncoated TiO 2 NPs was evaluated by disc diffusion method against PDR strain of E. coli isolated from mastitic milk samples. The antibacterial activity of all the synthesized nanoformulations were noted and highest antibacterial activity was shown by CS-NPs coated TiO 2 -NPs against pandrug resistant (PDR) E. coli strain with the prominent zone of inhibition of 23 mm. Morphological changes of E. coli cells after the treatment with MIC concentration (0.78 μ g/ml) of CS-NPs coated TiO 2 NPs were studied by transmission electron microscopy TEM showedrigorous morphological defectand has distorted the general appearance of the E. coli cells. Cytotoxicity (HepG2 cell line) and hemolytic (human blood) studies confirmed nontoxic/biocompatible nature of CS-NPs coated biologically synthesized TiO 2 NPs. The results suggested that biologically synthesized and surface modified TiO 2 NPs by mucoadhesive polysaccharides (e.g. chitosan) coating would be an effective and non-toxic alternative therapeutic agent to be used in livestock industry to control drug resistant veterinary pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The grafting of pH-responsive poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes was carried out on the surface of a commercial TFC-PA membrane using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Poly(t-butyl acrylate) was polymerized through the SI-ATRP method followed by its acid hydrolysis to form PAA hydrophilic polymer brushes. Surface morphology, permeation flux, salt rejection, and pore sizes were investigated. The contact angle for water was reduced from 50° for a pristine membrane to 27° for the modified membrane due to a modification with the hydrophilic functional group and its brush on membrane surfaces. The flux rate also increased noticeably at lower pH values relative to higher pH for the modified membranes, while the flux remains stable in the case of pristine TFC-PA membranes. There is slight transition in the water flux rate that was also observed when going from pH values of 3 to 5. This was attributed to the pH-responsive conformational changes for the grafted PAA brushes. At these pH values, ionization of the COOH group takes place below and above <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> to influence the effective pore dimension of the modified membranes. At a lower pH value, the PAA brushes seem to permit tight structure conformation resulting in larger pore sizes and hence more flux. On the other hand, at higher pH values, PAA brushes appeared to be in extended conformation to induce smaller pore sizes and result in less flux. Further, pH values were observed to not significantly affect the NaCl salt rejection with values observed in between 98.8% and 95% and close to that of the pristine TFC-PA membranes. These experimental results are significant and have immediate implication for advances in polymer technology to design and modify the “switchable membrane surfaces” with controllable charge distribution and surface wettability, as well as regulation of water flux and salt.",

    "abstract": "In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were functionalized by various molecules, including sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ), polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMB), and Tween 80 to investigate the long-term stabilization of AgNPs in an aqueous dispersion. PHMB-functionalized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs/PHMB) exhibited better stability than others and could be stored at ambient temperature for at least 180 days. In addition to creating stabilization based on the electrostatic repulsion, the use of PHMB helped to increase the degree of stability of the colloidal AgNPs for a long time owing to strong interactions between Ag atoms on AgNPs with nitrogen (N) positions in PHMB molecules. The formed bond led to improving maintenance ability of the electrostatic repulsion layer among independent nanoparticles. The applicability of the as-prepared AgNPs/PHMB was also examined for Mn 2+ detection via a colorimetric approach. The calibration curve was found to be linear over the range of 0–100 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.97. The amine groups of PHMB brought out a cooperative effect to form of ion-templated chelation with Mn 2+ , which caused the aggregation of AgNPs/PHMB. This suggested that the AgNPs/PHMB could be used as a potential probe in the detection of Mn 2+ ions. More importantly, the long-term stability of AgNPs/PHMB paved a great promising path to provide many further solutions for the producer in practical applications.",

Two product defects, namely, volumetric shrinkage and warpage, as well as seven process parameters including injection speed, injection pressure, cooling time, packing pressure, mold temperature, packing time, and melt temperature, were considered. Injection molding experiments were conducted on specifically chosen test points and results were used to compute the volumetric shrinkage and warpage (at each test point). Thereafter, three relationships between the product cycle time (one relationship), the two product defects (two relationships), and the injection molding parameters were constructed using the kriging technique. An optimization problem to minimize the product cycle time (described by the first relationship) subject to constraints on the product defects (described by the latter two relationships) was then formulated. A combination set of points between the lower and upper extreme values of acceptable product defect was generated to serve as constraints for the two product defects. The optimization problem was then solved using the Fmincon function, available in the Matlab optimization toolbox. A plot of the optimization results revealed an appreciable tradeoff between the cycle time and the two product defects. To validate the optimization, an additional injection molding experiment was conducted for one of the optimization results. Results from the additional experiment showed reasonably close agreement with simulation optimization results differing in the cycle time, the warpage and volumetric shrinkage by 6.7%, 3.2%, and 8%, respectively.",

Initially, the SCF-reinforced PP composites with a varying composition of SCF in the range of 0–40 wt% loading were first melt-mixed in a twin-screw extruder and later injection-molded to produce the testing samples. The experimental results indicate that with an increase in SCF loading, an increase in the tensile modulus and strength was observed along with a rapid decrease in the values of strain at break. A sudden decrease in strain at break was observed in composites in the range of 10–15 wt% SCF. To further study the sudden decrease in strain at break, an investigation was performed on composites that contained 10–15 wt% of SCF loading, starting from 10 wt% with a 1% increment to 15 wt% of SCF. The results of this study show that a decrease in strain at break was not linear; on the contrary, it was accompanied by a ductile to brittle transition, which specifically occurred in the range of 12–13 wt% of SCF loading and then continued to decrease with an increase in SCF loading.",

Residual wall thickness was calculated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The response surface methodology (RSM) model, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and Kriging model were employed to map the relationship between process parameters and hollowed core ratio, and wall thickness difference. Based on the comparison assessments of the three surrogate models, multiobjective optimization of hollowed core ratio and wall thickness difference for cooling water pipe by integrating design of experiment (DOE) of optimized Latin hypercubes (Opt LHS), RBF neural network, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was studied. The research results showed that short shot size, water pressure, and melt temperature were the most important process parameters affecting hollowed core ratio, while the effects of delay time and mold temperature were little. By the confirmation experiments for the best solution resulted from the Pareto frontier, the relative errors of hollowed core ratio and wall thickness are 2.2% and 3.0%, respectively. It demonstrated that the proposed hybrid optimization methodology could increase hollowed core ratio and decrease wall thickness difference during the WAIM process.",

Due to which, massive efforts are being made to develop and nurture the next generation of composite materials that are energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and biodegradable. Light weight, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, and comparable tensile strength exhibited by natural fibers render them the choice for use in several industrial products and applications over the last decade. Natural fibers as the reinforcing entity are pitted against their synthetic variants primarily because of the superior aspects like biodegradability and excellent strength-to-weight ratio. This article presents the review on various nonconventional natural fibers such as tamarind seed and shell, Luffa cylindrica, groundnut shell, coconut coir, papaya bast, okra, and Ashoka tree seed. The flow of the chapter includes the introduction, extraction methodologies, and fabrication, and investigations of mechanical properties, applications, and sustainability are dealt in detail for nontraditional natural fibers. The okra fibers possess greater tensile strength of up to 262.8 MPa in comparison with other fibers, while the Ashoka tree seed fibers are known to possess a maximum flexural strength of up to 125 MPa. Further, these fibers are used as reinforcements in potential applications in interiors and automobile and aircraft panels and wood-based particle board composites owing to the increase in tensile and flexural strengths of composites.",

In order to overcome this shortcoming, the effect of material and process variables on the degree of foaming and the growth behavior of the gas bubbles was studied by using polyolefins, such as polypropylene (PP), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE). These materials were foamed in extrusion process with a blowing agent consisting of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. A higher degree of foaming was obtained with a low temperature of cooling water and high melt temperature. The take-up speed did not influence the degree of foaming. It was also observed from cell morphologies that the size of the gas bubbles was reduced with increased take-up speed and decreased melt temperature, but the size of the gas bubbles was nearly invariant as the temperature of the cooling water increased. In addition, the effects of the molecular weight, the molecular structure, the melt viscosity, and the melt tension on the degree of foaming and the growth of the gas bubbles were investigated. It was revealed that the degree of foaming and the size of the gas bubbles were directly related to the melt tension of the polymer melt, regardless of the structure and the molecular weight of the polymer resin and the temperature of the polymer melt. This implies that the ability to sustain the cell in the melt state is a critical foaming parameter in the extrusion process. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 19: 97–112, 2000",

Polystyrene plate parts of different thicknesses, designed with various channel geometries, were gas-assisted injection molded. Part flexible strength was measured by a bending test. It was found that part stiffness basically increases linearly with the inertia moment of the plate. Gas channel design, introducing an additional moment of inertia determined by the geometry of the channel section and the hollowed core, resulted in structural reinforcement of the part. An analysis algorithm based on DKT/VRT elements superimposed with beam elements, representing gas channels of various section geometries, was developed to evaluate part bending behavior. An equivalent diameter was assigned to the beam element so that both the original gas channel and the circular beam had the same moment of inertia. The results from this 2.5-dimensional model were also verified with three-dimensional analyses using the Ansys program. The present simulations show reasonable accuracy upon comparison to bending tests and predictions from Ansys. This investigation indicates that it is possible to use the same CAE finite-element mesh modeled for process simulation when performing part structure and warpage analyses, resulting in high computational efficiency. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TAIC and PBQ exerted effects smaller than triacrylate type. When the multifunctional monomers were added to the 0.01 phr peroxide containing system, MFI decreased below that of peroxide, and increased above that of multifunctional monomer of the same concentration, and synergistic physical properties were generally obtained, especially at low content of coagent. However, at higher peroxide concentration (0.05 and 0.1 phr) MFI increased with PETA and TMPTA, and decreased with PBQ. In general, increase and decrease of MFI were respectively followed by the decrease and increase of modules, strength, and impact strength as well. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

It was found that the shear history depresses the melt strength and the oscillatory shear modulus, especially the storage modulus in low frequency region. This phenomenon is not caused by lowering of the molecular weight, which remained the same as the original, for all shear history samples, indicating absence of mechanical/thermal degradation during processing. Furthermore, annealing the melt processed samples enhances both the melt strength and the oscillatory modulus to the values of the original, unsheared sample. Finally we applied shear history in a cone‐and‐plate rheometer and found that the growth curve of the storage modulus, which can be expressed by a simple equation, is determined by both the duration of the flow and the magnitude of the applied shear stress. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polypropylene (PP) has not been used extensively in rotational foam molding because it has been traditionally considered as nonfavorable for foaming applications because of its relatively weak melt strength and melt elasticity at elevated temperatures. However, because of the unique end‐use properties of PP, PP foams have recently grown in importance. An experimental study was conducted to identify feasible processing strategies for producing PP foams with satisfactory morphologies in dry‐blending‐based rotational foam molding. The obtained results revealed that cell coalescence plays a key role in the production of PP foams in rotational foam molding. If it is efficiently suppressed, the cell morphology of the PP foams improves dramatically. To suppress cell coalescence, it would be necessary to preserve the melt strength of PP during processing. One way of doing this is maintaining the temperature of the PP melt as low as possible. This can be accomplished by either lowering the decomposition temperature of the chemical blowing agent by using an activator such as zinc oxide and/or reducing the temperature of the oven. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In particular, this investigation compares the effects of introducing trialkoxysilane functional groups at the chain end (using amine‐ and mercapto‐silanes) with similar types grafted in the middle of the chain of the constituent resin (using an isocyanate silane). The use of coupling agents with a basic character (amine silane type) brings about the formation of denser networks in both constituent phases of the resulting epoxy–silica hybrid, which is manifest through a large increase in the T g and a more extensive suppression of the molecular relaxations within the glass transition regions. Increasing the number of alkoxysilane functional groups at the chain end, with the use of a bis‐aminosilane, has a relatively minor effect on the morphology and dynamic mechanical spectra of the resulting epoxy–silica hybrids. It was also found that while the incorporation of small amounts of a high molecular weight epoxy resin causes considerable plasticization of the organic phase, much larger amounts of organic (aliphatic) co‐agent within the siloxane phase are required to deteriorate those properties that are related to the inorganic character of the hybrid material. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Moisture absorption was seen to decrease as the temperature of molding and annealing increased with a predictable effect on mechanical and thermal properties: namely, increased moisture absorption indicated lower strength, stiffness, but higher ductility and impact resistance. Thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry indicated that with an increase in moisture absorption in the nylon‐6,6 a broadening of the melting endotherm is observed, suggesting a typical plasticizing effect of water on the nylon‐6,6. This study suggests that molding conditions of a nylon‐6,6 material may ultimately effect the levels of crystallinity in the final part and establish a relationship between the amount of absorbed water for a given nylon product and its processing variables.",

Cornstarch was extruded using a corotating twin‐screw extruder at varying moisture content, medium/high screw configuration, and 300/400‐rpm screw speeds. Extrudates were evaluated for bulk density, expansion ratio, cell structure, bending strength, thermal and pasting properties. Temperature change (Δ T ) was defined as the temperature difference between the native starch melting temperature and its melt temperature just behind the die during extrusion at a given moisture content. Δ T was significantly affected by starch moisture content and mechanical shearing, which controlled the melting behavior of the starch in the barrel. Amylose–lipid complex formation during extrusion increased as Δ T increased and leveled off at Δ T of about 20°C. Pasting peak viscosity of the starch extrudates decreased as Δ T increased and leveled off at Δ T of about 15°C. Within the same range of mechanical shearing intensity, extrudate bulk density and bending strength decreased linearly as Δ T increased. Extrudate expansion was negatively correlated to bulk density. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 23: 277–290, 2004; Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com).

Unlike metallic and ceramic barriers, however, polymer films are known for their semipermeable nature; that is, they permit small gaseous and vapor molecules to migrate through their atomic/molecular structures. Since the intrusion of oxygen/water from the surrounding air or the loss of water/carbon dioxide from a packaged product can be detrimental to the shelf life of the product, the steady state transmission rate of a polymer film has become an important property characteristic of polymers to be used for packaging. An attempt has been made in this study to review the transmission data of commercially available polymer films. The three molecular species O 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O were of particular interest. Since these permeability data vary over five orders of magnitude, several log‐log plots were constructed in order to assist decision making in film selections. Data for 34 different polymers are given. The effects of order or crystallinity, the presence of plasticizers, and the effects of laminated layering are discernible. It is the latter modification (laminating) that possesses demonstrable potential for improving the barrier properties of polymer films used for packaging purposes.",

The effect of composition of the hydrogel beads and the amount drug load on the release of IBP was studied in acidic and phosphate buffer (PB) solution of pH 6.8. In accordance with the swelling behavior of the beads, drug release from the IPN beads in acidic solution was found to be confined within those from homopolymeric beads. On the other hand, drug release from IPN beads in PB solution was found to be less than those from the homopolymeric beads although the swelling of the beads followed the same trend as in an acidic solution. An increase in the drug load further decreased the drug release from all the beads in both the dissolution media. FTIR, XRD, and DSC analyses demonstrated the absence of any interaction between the drug and the polymers. The results indicated that IPN hydrogel beads provided more sustained release of IBP than homopolymeric beads. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Fumed silica and expanded graphite nanoparticles were used to prepare nanofilled PES by a melt‐compounding technique with the view to improve the barrier properties. Solvent uptake at equilibrium and solvents resistance of nanofilled PES compounds were investigated by three different methodologies: (1) weight increase by methylene chloride absorption in a vapor‐saturated atmosphere, (2) solvent uptake of acetone at equilibrium, and (3) decay of storage modulus induced by acetone diffusion. The storage modulus decay was measured by means of dynamic mechanical analysis on samples immersed in an acetone bath. The collected data were fitted to an ad hoc model to calculate the diffusion coefficient. The produced nanofilled PES showed a significant improvement in barrier properties and considerable reduction in acetone uptake at equilibrium, in comparison with the neat PES. Nanofilled PES compounds were also used to produce continuous glass fiber composites by the film‐stacking manufacturing technique. The composites exhibited, by and large, improvements in flexural and shear strength. Their solvent resistance was evaluated by measuring the variation of mechanical properties after exposure to acetone for 1 and 5 days. These tests showed that the composites produced with the nanocomposite matrix did not exhibit higher solvent resistance than those prepared with neat PES, probably because of the deterioration of the fiber/nanocomposite‐matrix interfacial bond in the wet state. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effects of TMPTA concentration on oscillatory shear rheology, melt elongational rheology, and thermal properties were comparatively evaluated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the grafting reaction took place and TMPTA had been grafted onto the PP backbone. Differential scanning calorimetric results showed that the crystallization temperatures of modified PPs were higher than those of the initial and degraded PPs. The rheological characteristics such as higher storage modulus ( G ′) at low frequency, increased degree of shear thinning, a plateau in tan δ–ω plot, and upturning at high viscosity in the Cole–Cole plots proved that the long‐chain branches have been added to the linear PP molecule. The melt elongational rheology showed that the modified PPs exhibit improved melt strength and increased elongational viscosity in the presence of TMPTA and DCP, which further confirmed the existence of long‐chain branching (LCB) in their backbone. According to the analytical results from oscillatory shear rheology and elongational rheology, it can be inferred that the LCB level in modified samples increases with an increase in TMPTA concentration. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Starch as one of the most abundant, renewable, low‐cost, and biodegradable carbohydrate polymers worldwide suffers from some drawbacks: The most important one is that it lacks properties of synthetic polymers. So, modification of starch by graft copolymerization will provide a substantial modification route to alter physical and chemical properties of starch, thereby increasing its utilization, by attaching a flexible synthetic polymer onto the rigid natural polysaccharide backbone without greatly changing the latter. In addition to the main disadvantage of the above technique, the high percentage of homopolymer and low percentage of grafting are other disadvantages. At this point, our research team focused on how to maximize the graft yields and graft reaction efficiency percentage, minimize the homopolymer percentage, as well as enhance the water solubility of the prepared copolymers. Based on the results obtained, appropriate conditions for grafting methacrylic acid onto pregelled starch were established and the graft yield was higher under the following conditions: 10 mmol/L potassium persulfate (KPS); 8 mmol/L tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) 50% methacrylic acid concentration (based on weight of substrate); liquor ratio, 10; reaction time, 60 min; and polymerization temperature, 60°C. On the other hand, grafting was significantly enhanced by adding Fe 3+ , Cu 2+ , and Li + in the grafting media and it follows the following order: Fe 3+ &gt; Cu 2+ &gt; Li + , in addition to the solubility percentage. Approximately 37.5% graft yield and 75% graft reaction efficiency as well as 25% homopolymerization were obtained when methacrylic acid was graft copolymerized onto pregelled starch as a reactive carbohydrate polymer using a new redox initiation system, namely KPS/TMEDA redox pair. Furthermore, a notable enhancement was observed in solubility percentage of grafted samples with lower graft yields than that of the higher one. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The nanocomposite of polypyrrole with organonophilic montmorillonite and hydrophilic montmorillonite clays was prepared by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer in the presence of montmorillonite nanoclays. FTIR spectroscopy studies and X‐ray diffraction pattern were used to confirm the formation of a polypyrrole/montmorillonite nanocomposite. The scanning electron microscopy image of the nanocomposite showed the homogeneous and continuous structure of the nanocomposite. Also cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the synthesized nanocomposites were electroactive. The anticorrosive properties of nanocomposite coatings on iron coupons were evaluated and compared with pure polypyrrole coating. According to the results in corrosive environments, the polypyrrole/organonophilic montmorillonite nanocomposite has enhanced corrosion protection effect in comparison to pure polypyrrole and polypyrrole/hydrophilic montmorillonite coating. It was concluded that the better corrosion protection effect was due to the better dispersion of organophilic montmorillonite nanoclays in the polymer matrix, which results in a decrease in the corrosion current and corrosion rate. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At the same loading, SWCNT provided greater thermal conductivity enhancement when added to thermoplastic elastomer matrix when compared to GNP. Moreover, SEM images showed that SWCNT and GNP were well dispersed in PTT‐PTMO, suggesting that in situ polymerization is a highly efficient method for preparing hybrid nanocomposites with low loading of carbon nanofillers. To further improve thermal conductivity of PTT‐PTMO–based nanocomposites, a hybrid SWCNT/GNP was used. When the ratio of SWCNT to GNP was 5:1, i.e. 0.5 wt% of SWCNT and 0.1 wt% of GNP, the PTT‐PTMO–based nanocomposites exhibited the highest thermal conductivity of 0.30 W/m·K, higher than that filled with SWCNT and GNP alone. This suggests that the combination of two types of nanofillers, which differ in shape, allows obtaining the synergistic effect for the thermal conductivity enhancement of PTT‐PTMO.",

The interfacial tension and viscosity ratio between the components were altered by modifying the PE minor phase with PE‐ graft ‐maleic anhydride (PE‐g‐MAH) and by using different melt flow rate PE minor phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and volume resistivity (VR) measurements show that when the matrix's viscosity is greater than that of the dispersed phase, simultaneous mixing and premixing the CNT in the PE phase form a unique microstructure that yields a VR that is 4–6 decades lower than when premixing the CNT in the PA phase. When the viscosity of the dispersed PE phase is greater, kinetic restrictions limit the migration of the CNTs from the PE phase, resulting in high VR values for all mixing procedures. The wetting parameter was used to calculate the thermodynamic drive of the CNTs localization. It was found that the MAH modification reduces the interfacial tension between the CNT and the modified PE phase, which results in selective localization of CNT in there rather than in the PA phase. This observation was confirmed in SEM imaging and also expressed in high VR values of these composites.",

After characterization, the potential application was verified through release of PQ from PQ/clay and PQ/clay/Alg formulations. According to the results, the release of PQ from PQ/MMT was slower than the release from the PQ/CL system. The presence of the alginate polymer in PQ/clay/Alg capsule beads caused the system to liberate PQ in a more controlled release manner than PQ/clay samples. Furthermore, the release data were fitted to empirical equations to estimate the kinetic parameters. The results suggested the feasibility of the use of clay/Alg formulations for controlled release of herbicides in agricultural applications.",

Cured NR‐ g ‐PMMA with different grafting levels were studied systematically and compared with cured natural rubber. A remarkable improvement in the properties of natural rubber was obtained by grafting PMMA.

The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were studied, and the results showed that the Young (tensile) modulus and tensile strength of the prepared nanocomposites were significantly increased by increasing the filler content, which should be due to the high aspect ratio of GO plates and their uniform dispersion in the UHMWPE matrix.

The uniform and thick coating of PANI on the c‐MWCNT surface was observed. The electrical conductivity of PANI/c‐MWCNT (3 wt%) nanocomposite is recorded about three orders of magnitude higher than that of pure PANI.

It is therefore achievable to prepare ultra‐large‐scale integrated circuit (ULSIC) on ultralow dielectric constant (i.e., low‐ k ) materials. The research on nano/mesoporous polymer based low‐ k materials, including the past decade advances, the introduction of principles and methods of nano/mesopores, characterization, commonly used raw materials, typical products, and corresponding dielectric properties, is extensively reviewed and summarized in this paper. The nano/mesopores can be introduced into the polymers by more than five methods such as reprecipitation, sol–gel, thermolysis, supercritical foaming, and electrochemical etch. The pore size, morphologies, porosities, and film thicknesses of the products can be controlled by raw materials and processing conditions in these methods. The low‐ k dielectric materials based on nano/mesoporous polymers have great potential application in ULSIC in light of their special dielectric, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PPS composite was manufactured by using the compression‐molding process. Composite samples were eroded in a specially designed sandblasting system employing various parameters, and variation of the erosion rate was investigated. Samples were eroded at different erosion times, particle impingement angles, and under various pressures by using three different sizes of alumina particles. Impingement velocities of erodent particles were measured by using the double disk method. The results are also discussed regarding impingement velocity of the erodent particles. Glass mat reinforced PPS composites exhibited semiductile erosion behavior by showing a maximum erosion rate at 30° and 45° impingement angles. The erosion rate of the composite was increased with augmentation in erosion time, velocity, pressure, and particle size. Maximum erosion was observed when the composite was eroded after 10 s at 45° impingement angle under 4 bar pressure by using 60 mesh size erodent particles. The morphology of eroded surfaces was examined by using a scanning electron microscope, and possible wear mechanisms were discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Twin‐screw extruders (TSE) are typically the equipment of choice in polymer blending and compounding operations due to the relatively high stresses and controllable residence times they impart on the melts. However, the mixing action is shear dominated and shear flows are energetically inefficient for dispersive mixing by comparison with extensional flows. We present a new extensional mixing element (EME), developed as a static dispersive mixing element for TSEs with dispersive mixing provided by extension‐dominated flow through stationary hyperbolically contracting channels. In Part 1 of the work, we present the design and show, experimentally and computationally, that the EME effectively imparts extension‐dominated flow through its channels. We also show that the flow is fully developed throughout most of the EME sections, with only small inlet transients being observed, and that it is possible to predict the real pressure drop in the system. Experimental validation of the EME for immiscible blends of varying viscosity ratios will be discussed in Part 2.",

Although the moisture absorption decreased with increasing nano‐Ca CO 3 content except for 8 wt%, the moisture absorption and diffusion behaviors were different from each other. It was found that the incorporation of 2 wt% and 4 wt% nano‐Ca CO 3 decreased moisture absorption capacity effectively. This is due to the more uniform distribution of nano‐Ca CO 3 particles, which created a longer diffusion path of moisture molecules in the nanocomposites. For the diffusion rate of moisture, there is no significant change observed on adding nano‐Ca CO 3 . The effect of moisture absorption on the mechanical properties of nano‐Ca CO 3 ‐filled epoxy nanocomposites were investigated as a functional property of nano‐Ca CO 3 content. Due to moisture absorption, the flexural strength of epoxy/nano‐Ca CO 3 composites significantly impaired when compared to dry nanocomposites.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nonwoven kenaf fiber ( KF ) mat‐reinforced unsaturated polyester resin composites were exposed to a natural weathering environment for 12 months. The composites were prepared using vacuum‐assisted resin transfer molding ( RTM ). Prior to molding, the KF mat was treated by immersing it in 6% Na OH solution for 3 hrs and by heating it at 140°C for 10 hrs, respectively. The influences of weathering exposure on the composites with respect to the different treatments were investigated using flexural properties, fracture toughness, Fourier transform infrared, thermal stability, color and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Natural weathering reduced the flexural and fracture toughness due to damage to composite structures, the formation of microcracks on the sample surface, discoloration, and chemical content alteration. A relatively better durability in terms of flexural properties was exhibited by alkali‐treated KF composites, although poor durability in fracture toughness was observed due to the improved fiber–matrix adhesion.",

Among the membranes containing GO , the membrane with a 0.5 wt% GO loading exhibited the best antifouling performance, that is, this membrane recovered more than approximately 96% of its initial pure water flux, demonstrating a high resistance to the irreversible fouling.

The results indicated that the morphology of the fibers is extremely dependent on the solvent's properties, especially volatility and electrical conductivity, and the ionic characteristics of additives. Finally, to estimate the optimal electrospinning conditions for production of nanofibers with minimum possible diameter, modeling of the process was undertaken using the response surface methodology.

The chemical and crystalline structure of (HA- g -PEG) and POM/HA- g -PEG composites was investigated by means of FTIR and XRD. The thermal properties, degree of crystallinity, and melting behaviour of POM-based composites were analysed with TG, DSC, and TOPEM DSC methods. The tensile strength, Young’s modulus, toughness, and wettability of POM were investigated as well. A preliminary assessment of bioactivity, in vitro chemical stability, and formaldehyde release from POM/HA- g -PEG composites by Schiff’s test was also performed. An SEM/EDX method was used to observe the morphology of POM/HA- g -PEG composites. The results indicate that the addition of 1% HA- g -PEG slightly increases the melting temperature and degree of crystallinity. In small amounts, HA- g -PEG particles probably act as nucleating agents for the POM crystallization process. Incorporation of 5% HA- g -PEG to POM caused a decrease in the crystallinity of the polymer matrix, as a result, some mechanical properties of POM/HA- g -PEG composites also decreased. The thermal stability of POM/HA- g -PEG composites improved significantly from 309°C for unmodified POM to 342°C for POM/10.0% HA- g -PEG 600. The most effective thermal stabilizer was synthesized with the lowest mass-average molar mass PEG. The in vitro bioactivity test confirmed that, as the average molar mass of PEG in HA- g -PEG hybrids increased, POM-based composites indicated higher bioactivity. The in vitro chemical stability analysis results showed that both the POM matrix and the HA- g -PEG additive remain stable during the whole incubation time. Importantly, after seven days of dynamic incubation, no formaldehyde was detected in all filtrates, which is crucial in biomedical applications, among others.",

The PE/PHBV (80/20) blend is more susceptible to the microbial action in the soil than the PP/PHBV (80/20) blend. The blends showed higher biodegradation in the PHBV amorphous phase, due to consumption of ester groups, leading to rearrangement of the crystalline phase of PHBV fraction. On the basis of quantification of CO 2 , the PE/PHBV (80/20) film showed approximately 7% biodegradation, and the beginning occurred in a period of 60 days.

A steady‐state erosion rate of these composites has been studied with various impingement angles (30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°) with different impact velocities (48, 70, and 82 m/s). The results indicate that 20 wt% filled cenosphere particles to (GJJG) hybrid epoxy composite exhibit better wear resistance. The maximum erosion at 45° and 60° impingement angles also indicates the semiductile behavior of the composite. The morphologies of the worn surfaces were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope, and it was revealed that inclusion of higher weight percentage of cenosphere particles restricted the impact velocity to erode the surface. The increase in erosion resistance of the developed composites is the outcome of this result.",

Thermogravimetric analysis revealed no significant changes in BC ‐ DHS thermostability compared to BC ‐ HS . However, the crystallinity of BC ‐ DHS improved ( P &lt; 0.05). The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that the carbonyl group in BC ‐ DHS is more active than that of BC ‐ HS .

The study is dedicated to investigating a new physical compatibilization approach of biosourced materials as well poly (lactic acid) ( PLA ) and polyamide 11 ( PA 11) in comparison with the chemical compatibilization through addition of a multifunctionalized epoxide. For this reason, this paper deals with gaining better understanding physical compatibilization in the biosourced blend with the incorporation of an acrylic melt strength enhancer into PLA / PA 11 blend. The main focus of this paper is studying how physical compatibilization improves melt strength in comparison with chemical approach. Hitherto, the chain extension–branching balance was demonstrated to be difficult to be controlled and decoupled from chemical compatibilization at the polymer–polymer interface. Hence, the physical approach is presented as an original route in this work to develop a PLA ‐based blend with good film blown processability and engineering properties. Morphological, rheological and thermomechanical properties of the new obtained biosourced blends were studied. The physical compatibilization effect was confirmed by the tuning interfacial properties. The extensional rheology highlighted that melt strength for the physical blends was also improved without any pronounced strain hardening in comparison with reactive blends. Besides, a great enhancement of the blowing processing windows of physically PLA ‐ PA 11 compatibilized blend was highlighted while higher blow‐up ratio and take‐up ratio values were obtained. Overall, a correlation between the obtained thermal and crystalline properties was performed for the optimal biosourced blown film.",

As the common water-retention polymers, the molecular weights, and structures of polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are obviously different. Modified soil water management with polymers (i.e., PAM and CMC) has shown great promise for water conservation. Few researchers have reported the comparison of the effects of PAM and CMC on soil infiltration characteristics, especially in coarse-textured soils (i.e., sandy loam). In this research, two high-molecular polymers (PAM and CMC) were used to investigate the effects of polymers on soil water infiltration characteristics by laboratory experiment. The infiltration reduction effects of CMC treatments were more obvious than those of PAM treatments. With the applied rates of PAM (0.2–0.8 g/kg) and CMC (1–4 g/kg) increased, the processes of soil water infiltration were inhibited. The average infiltration time of CMC with different application rates is 1.85 times than that of PAM with different treatments. The mean wetting front distances of different application rates treatments of PAM and CMC were 22.20 and 19.23 cm. At the same application rate, applied CMC is more effective in reducing soil sorptivity than applied PAM in sandy loam soils. Moreover, the cost of application of CMC is lower than the cost of application of PAM. The mean economic inputs of PAM and CMC were 153.90 and 35.24 RMB/hm 2 . Therefore, CMC was selected and recommended as the suitable water retention agent in sandy loam soils.",

It was found that at 0.5 wt% of MWCNTs the original core–shell type morphology of the ternary blend samples almost remained intact. and this observation was independent of the sequence of feeding. At 1 wt% of MWCNTs, the core–shell morphology was retained only for those nanocomposite samples prepared using the sequential feeding mode. In addition, it was demonstrated that the thermodynamic predictions could be utilized for the nanocomposites containing low MWCNTs contents. However, this was not true for the nanocomposites with higher MWCNTs contents due to the predominating role of viscoelastic properties of the PS shell.",

The consequence of nanoparticle usage is development of new formulation strategies for composites which have potential applications in various types of packaging (dried food, frozen food, etc.). Particularly important for the double‐layered films is good adhesion between two layeres of films as they can easily separate under the mechanical stress. Food packaging, except good barrier, is needed to have good thermal and mechanical properties because they have to be flexible and endure the higher temperatures, like sterilization, etc. For the studied samples, oxygen permeability parameters were analyzed but also thermal and mechanical properties were determined. It is found that thermal stability and mechanical properties of double‐layered films compared to PE film alone were improved, especially for the samples when zeolite is modified with magnetite. Oxygen barrier performance in modified PE / PCL samples was improved, as it can be seen in sample with higher content of magnetite in zeolite.",

In this paper, a benzoxazion resin with a triazine structure was synthesized successfully and the flame‐retardant mechanism of the resin was discussed. Its flammability property and the thermal decomposition were measured and analyzed with a cone calorimeter and thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry–mass spectrometry. The chemical structure as well as the surface morphology of the cured resin after combustion was characterized by Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy. The results illustrated that little heat was released during the ignition process of the cured resin. The gas including NO 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O, and a few CO were produced during the thermal decomposing. With the surface of the cured resin after combustion covered with the layer of the triazine structure, the benzoxazine resin with the triazine structure exhibits a desirable property of a flame retardant.",

Effects of keratin content on the structure and properties of blended fibers are analyzed by the combination of scanning electron microscope ( SEM ), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ), thermogravimetric‐differential thermal analysis ( TG ‐ DTA ), and tensile test. The results indicate that the blended fibers have an average diameter about 110 μm with oblate cross section and rough surface. The hydrogen bonds are established between PVA and keratins during the spinning process. The curves of thermal performances of blended fibers are between those of keratin and PVA . In the case of the mechanical properties of blended fibers, they gradually decrease with an increase in keratin content. Hence, it should be pointed out that to obtain satisfactory fibers, the content of keratin in the blended solution has to be less than or equal to 15%.",

The impregnated jute fibers were entered into pultrusion die, and tube‐shaped composites were fabricated. Properties of final samples were investigated by tensile measurement and void faction. It was found that tensile strength of jute/HDPE was higher than jute/starch. It seems that the melt viscosity of polymer plays as an important role determining the mechanical performances. In addition, tensile strength increases with increasing volume fraction of fiber in the composites. Morphological study showed that in jute/starch sample, impregnation was not done perfectly and tubular cross section has inhomogeneity.",

For the non-Newtonian index of the three polymer materials, it decreases with the feature size under the microscopic scale while it increases or does not change with the feature size under the macroscopic scale.

In addition, the dissolution rate and solubility of the SDs with a carrier-drug ratio of 8 : 1 were better than the samples of 4 : 1. The DSC and XRD patterns showed that the crystallization of GA in SDs prepared by PVP K30 and PVP K60 was significantly inhibited, and both were transformed to amorphous. Based on FTIR and Raman detection, a hydrogen-bond between PVP and drug molecules is formed. SEM results showed that there were no significant differences in the appearance of SDs prepared with four PVPs, and no crystalline morphology of GA was seen. In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrated that the dissolution performance of the PVP-GA-SDs prepared by the solvent method is related to the molecular weight of PVP, and the change in the molecular weight of PVP does not cause a monotonic change in dissolution of GA.

The results of tensile strength, tensile strain, extension, and load at break clearly revealed a substantial improvement in tensile properties of the epoxy matrix due to homogeneous dispersion of f‐MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix and strong interfacial adhesion between them as well.

Comparison of the rheological behavior of homo‐ and copolymer solutions has shown that the presence of carboxylate ion(s) in the macromolecular chain leads to supramolecular structure formation. Small additions of non‐solvent (water) enhance the viscoelasticity of the solution, whereas a large amount of water results in gel formation; beyond a certain threshold of water concentration, macroscopic phase separation takes place.

The prepared MMIP was characterized, and the results showed that it exhibited good recognition and selective ability, offered a faster kinetics for the adsorption of trichlorfon. Scatchard analysis indicated that the binding sites in the CdTe@ MMIP had two distinct groups (the high and low affinity binding sites). The saturated adsorption capacity ( Q max1 ) was 63.2 mg/g due to the low affinity binding sites, and another saturated adsorption capacity ( Q max2 ) was 71.4 mg/g due to the high affinity binding sites. Using it as sorbent, a method of molecularly imprinted magnetic solid‐phase extraction coupled with capillary electrophoresis ( MIMSPE ‐ CE ) for selective extraction, magnetic separation, and fast determination of trace trichlorfon in vegetable samples was developed. Under optimal conditions, appreciable sensitivity was achieved with a LOD of 30 μg/kg ( S / N = 3) for the developed method. The relative standard deviation ( RSD ) for five replicate extractions of 0.05 mg/L trichlorfon standard solution was 4.2%. To evaluate the accuracy of this method, the blank cucumber and cauliflower samples spiked with trichlorfon were extracted and analyzed by this method with good recoveries ranging from 78.7% to 96.6%. Moreover, this method was applied to the quantitative detection of the trichlorfon residues in rape samples, and the results correlated well with that obtained from the gas chromatography method.",

This study proposed a new optimization strategy for the injection-molding process in which the parameter optimization problem is converted to a weight classification problem. Injection-molded parts are produced under varying parameters and labeled as positive or negative compared with the standard weight, and the weight error of each sample is calculated. A support vector classifier (SVC) method is applied to construct a classification hyperplane in which the weight error is supposed to be zero. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm contributes to the tuning of the hyperparameters of the SVC model in order to minimize the error between the SVC prediction results and the experimental results. The proposed method is verified to be highly accurate, and its average weight error is 0.0212%. This method only requires a small amount of experiment samples and thus can reduce cost and time. This method has the potential to be widely promoted in the optimization of injection-molding process parameters.",

Everolimus, a drug that inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation of endothelial cells, represents a promising alternative to prevent in-stent restenosis. In this study, everolimus was encapsulated by a film hydration technique in liposomes by using phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol at different ratios. As the ratio of cholesterol increases, it modulates the rigidity of the structure which can affect the encapsulation efficiency of the drug due to steric hindrance. Moreover, various lipid : drug ratios were tested, and it was found that as the lipid : drug ratio increases, the encapsulation efficiency also increases. This behavior is observed because everolimus is a hydrophobic drug; therefore, if the lipidic region increases, more drug can be entrapped into the liposomes. In addition, stability of the encapsulated drug was tested for 4 weeks at 4°C. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to prepare liposomal everolimus by film hydration technique followed by extrusion with high entrapment efficiency as a viable drug delivery system.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid FRP-concrete-steel double-skin tubular columns (hybrid DSTCs) are a novel form of hollow columns consisting of an outer FRP tube, an inner steel tube, and an annular layer of concrete between the two tubes. Due to the effective confinement of the two tubes, the concrete in hybrid DSTCs is well confined, leading to excellent ductility and strength enhancement. Hybrid DSTCs also have excellent corrosion resistence due to the effective protection of the outer FRP tube. However, existing studies mainly focused on hybrid DSTCs with a circular cross-section. When subjecting to different loads in the two horizontal directions, elliptical columns are preferred as they can provide different bending stiffness and moment capacity around two axes of symmetry without significantly reducing the confining effect of the FRP tube. This paper extends the existing work on circular DSTCs to elliptical DSTCs with a particular focus on four issues: the effect of elliptical aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of the outer elliptical cross-section), the effect of the FRP tube thickness, the effect of void area ratio (i.e., the ratio of the area of concrete void to the area of the outer elliptical section), and the effect of the cross-section of the inner steel tube (i.e., both rectangular and elliptical steel tubes were used). Experimental results show that, the averaged peak stress of the confined concrete in elliptical DSTCs increases with the increase in the elliptical aspect ratio, whereas the elliptical aspect ratio has no obvious effect on the ultimate axial strain; the cross-section shape of the inner steel tube has significant effect on the axial stress-strain behavior of the confined concrete in elliptical DSTCs; elliptical DSTCs with an elliptical steel tube exhibit much better ductility and strength enhancement than those specimens with a rectangular steel tube. A simple stress-strain model of confined concrete was proposed for elliptical DSTCs to account for the effects of the elliptical aspect ratio, the inner void, and the shape of the inner steel tube, which can provide reasonably accurate but conservative predictions.",

Burm. f.), coated by chitosan-CMC layer-by-layer assembly, displayed significantly higher lemon firmness and vitamin C content with excellent morphology, as well as inhibited weight loss and flesh browning. This study could provide support for quality maintenance in the fruit and vegetable industry and make a significant contribution to the utilization of the natural polysaccharide as a viable resource.",

Polymer blending combines the properties and advantages of their original polymers. This paper showcases hydrophobic polymers prepared through polymer blending; these blends are characterized and evaluated for their efficiency in the removal of crude oil spills from aqueous media. The application of these blends holds a great deal of importance in preserving the environment and the recovery of lost oil in spills. The blends are produced using polystyrene (PS) as the matrix polymer and individually blending poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) with the PS consisting of proportions of 5–20 wt.% each. The blends are then electrospun into bead-free microfibers with interconnected porosities as shown by their respective scanned electron micrographs. All fibrous sorbents showed a high affinity towards the removal of crude oil, motor oil, and diesel spills. The highly viscous motor spill showed a different pattern of sorption onto fibers than that of crude oil and diesel spills. Upon comparing all the studied electrospun fibers to commercially available polypropylene fibrous sorbents, results show that the sorption efficiency of the electrospun fibers is superior. Most notably, both PS-PE5 and PS-PVC5 fibers showed to be highly more effective than commercially available polypropylene (PP) sorbents towards all types of oil spills.",

    "abstract": "Supramolecular biopolymers (SBPs) are those polymeric units derived from macromolecules that can assemble with each other by noncovalent interactions. Macromolecular structures are commonly found in living systems such as proteins, DNA/RNA, and polysaccharides. Bioorganic chemistry allows the generation of sequence-specific supramolecular units like SBPs that can be tailored for novel applications in tissue engineering (TE). SBPs hold advantages over other conventional polymers previously used for TE; these materials can be easily functionalized; they are self-healing, biodegradable, stimuli-responsive, and nonimmunogenic. These characteristics are vital for the further development of current trends in TE, such as the use of pluripotent cells for organoid generation, cell-free scaffolds for tissue regeneration, patient-derived organ models, and controlled delivery systems of small molecules. In this review, we will analyse the 3 subtypes of SBPs: peptide-, nucleic acid-, and oligosaccharide-derived. Then, we will discuss the role that SBPs will be playing in TE as dynamic scaffolds, therapeutic scaffolds, and bioinks. Finally, we will describe possible outlooks of SBPs for TE.",

    "abstract": "This study reports a scalable green electrochemical synthesis of novel biogenic silver nanoparticles colloid (biogenic AgNPs) in large scale up to 5 liters using the bulk silver bar and the green tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) extract (GTE) as reducing agent during the electrochemical process. Under a direct-current voltage source, the biomolecules in GTE can release electrons to promote the reducing process of Ag+ to Ag0. More interestingly, the formation of the intermediate complex helps to cap on the nanoparticles, which leads to stabilizing AgNPs. The as-synthesized biogenic AgNPs with the size of 34 nm exhibit the outstanding electrochemical properties due to the presence of biomolecules on the biogenic AgNPs surface, which facilitates the effective attaching of AgNPs on the carbon surface of the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) through the formation of the strong C-O coordinate bonds between O atom of oxygen functional groups and C atom of SPE. The electrochemical properties of the biogenic AgNPs-modified SPE are enhanced significantly in comparison with bare SPE and pure AgNPs-SPE. The biogenic AgNPs-SPE is applied successfully to the detection of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The electrochemical sensor using biogenic AgNPs can reliably detect 4-NP in the linear range from 0.1 to 25 μM with the sensitivity about 6.69 μA μM-1 cm-2. The present work reveals, as the greener synthesis method with ultra-large scalable ability, high purity, and excellent electrochemical properties of biogenic AgNPs is very promising for technological applications in high-sensitive electrochemical chemosensors, nanopharmaceuticals, and other fields.",

Therefore, new materials are being developed that must have better mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity for heat dissipation, and tribological properties. The composites of expanded graphite (EG) and glass fibre-reinforced polyamide 6 (PA6/GF) were prepared, and the effect of EG particle size (~5 μm (EG5) and ~1000 μm (EG1000)) on these properties was investigated. Composites with different contents (2-10 wt%) of EG in PA6/GF were prepared using a laboratory twin-screw extruder and then injection moulded in the form of rods and discs required for thermal, thermomechanical, and tribological tests. EG acted as a nucleating agent but hindered the crystallization rate at higher concentrations, which was more pronounced when EG5 was added. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the storage modulus increased with the addition of both types of EG. However, the addition of EG5 increased the storage modulus more than EG1000. The lowest coefficient of friction was obtained by the addition of 10 wt% EG5. The wear increased with the addition of both types of EG, only slightly with the addition of EG1000. The thermal conductivity of the composites with EG increased from 0.42 W/mK to 1 W/mK. The results show that the use of EG with smaller particle size is much more beneficial than with a larger one.",

Date palm fiber-reinforced aliphatic epoxy composites for semistructural applications are the key goals of this work. To make the various composites, they used a combination of manual lay-up and adhesive bonding. Date palm fiber/bamboo hybrid composite and uncontaminated composites were tested through density, tensile, flexural, and impact tests and also studied the effects of swelling, water absorption, and physical performance in greater depth. According to studies, hybrid composites constructed from date palm fiber and bamboo had the best mechanical properties. The date palm/bamboo hybrid composite was created to impact the toughness of 12.72 J/m in tensile, flexural strength, and impact toughness measurements. The reduced swelling and water absorption were 27.66 percent and 15.37 percent, respectively, when testing a date palm fiber/bamboo hybrid composite.

The prepared CPCN was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX to understand their molecular interaction and surface morphology, respectively. The effect of parameters including pH, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, and contact time on the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye was studied. The maximum adsorption was found to be up to 63.13 mg/g MB with a pH of 10, adsorbent dosage of 2 g, an initial concentration of 150 ppm, and contact time of 120 min at room temperature (25°C) indicating a moderate adsorption capacity of the CPCN. Comparing the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models, the former fitted well with MB dye adsorption data, implying that the models can be applied to uptake MB dye by CPCN. In the kinetic adsorption experiment, the adsorbed dye almost reached equilibrium at about 120 min for the CPCN and followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Therefore, the CPCN can be used as a potential adsorbent in wastewater treatment.",

Traditional materials often suffer from limitations in structural integrity, flexibility, and thermal stability, presenting challenges for their application in energy storage.

Processing by a corotating twin‐screw extruder (Co‐TSE) and an internal batch mixer depressed the drawdown force, one of the elastic properties of a melt, to a great extent, even though molecular weight and the polydispersity did not change. On the other hand, the sample processed by a two‐roll mill exhibited the drawdown force as high as the original pellets, which is owing to the intermittent stress history instead of the relentless one in the Co‐TSE and the internal batch mixer. Furthermore, the effect of screw configuration in the Co‐TSE has also been investigated. It was found that the processing by conveying screws depressed the drawdown force and melt fracture more than that by kneading blocks as long as the torque and the residence time are the same. The large, abrupt, and frequent change in flow direction in the Co‐TSE with kneading blocks prohibits the molecular orientation, which leads to disentanglement associated with long‐chain branches. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Random and block copolymers containing propylene and low amounts of ethylene were used in formulations with nucleating agents based on derivatives of sorbitol such as dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) and para‐methyldibenzylidene sorbitol (MDBS). The introduction of low concentrations of DBS and MDBS leads to significant changes in the crystalline structure with respect to α and β phases, as well as in the kinetics of crystallization. Using WAXS, DSC, optical microscopy, and tensile testing, the following changes of nucleated propylene copolymers were observed: (a) an increase in the crystallization temperature; (b) an increase of the level of crystallinity; (c) a considerable decrease of the size of spherulites (i.e., an improvement of the transparency of the random copolymers); (d) a decrease of the amount of the β phase in block copolymers; (e) an increase in tensile strength at yield; and (f) an increase in secant modulus.

Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond® process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract During a routine extrusion compounding of a polymer blend of polyarylate resin and ethylene/acrylate rubber, an unexpected powdery product instead of a cohesive mixture was obtained. Also, the 20% rubber component was not well dispersed in the final product. This process problem was studied by simulation with a laboratory internal mixer following the procedure discussed by Shih. The powder formation was successfully reproduced. From the results of continuous video monitoring and analyses of the intermediate samples collected during the simulation experiments, we found that the progression of mixing from solid pellets to a cohesive mixture in a batch mixer or a twin‐screw extruder needs to “climb over” a prolonged transition state where the plastic polyarylate was dispersed in the 20% rubber. The finding led to two successful solutions to the powdering problem. A “phase‐inversion” mechanism is proposed to explain the observed morphological changes. This mechanism appears to have wider applicability in the processing of polymer blends. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The composites were dissolved in an appropriate solvent, and subsequently the polymer solution, containing the fibers in suspension, was filtrated for recovery of the reinforcing agent and of the polymer matrix. Different amounts of hot solvent were employed for washing during filtration, to vary the polymer content remaining on the fibers. The recycled fibers were incorporated in the same polymer matrix, but of virgin quality. The results on the tensile and impact performance of these second generation composites were compared to those of the base material containing unused fibers. It becomes evident that a significant increase of the tensile modulus and strength occurs as the polymer phase deposited on the fibers increases. However, it appears that this interphase alteration has a negative effect on the Izod impact strength.

Numerical solutions have been obtained by using the finite element method (FEM) and an integral constitutive equation of the K‐BKZ type with a spectrum of relaxation times. The material parameters have been obtained by fitting experimental viscosity and normal stress data for the melt as measured in shear, and elongational viscosity data available in the literature. Different L/D (L/2H) ratios have been considered ranging from very short to infinitely long dies. The numerical simulations reveal that as the flow rate increases, viscoelastic effects exhibited by the HDPE melt become important and manifest themselves in an enhanced swelling behavior after the die exit, while small, Newtonian‐like vortices exist in the contraction before entry to the die. Elastic recovery is also captured in an enhanced extrudate swell, which is always higher at the same apparent shear rate for the capillary than the slit dies and decreases drastically as the L/D (L/2H) ratio increases, reaching asymptotic values for very long dies. Such behavior is in agreement with experimental findings from flows through slit and capillary dies and in sharp contrast with purely viscous simulations which cannot predict such strong viscoelastic phenomena associated with the memory of the polymer melt. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

In addition to additive‐based reinforcement, self‐reinforcement without additives represents a way to increase material strength. In this study, the effects of self‐reinforced polyethylene during extrusion with a conventional single‐screw extruder are investigated. High extrusion pressure and controlled flow conditions at a low stock temperature, in conjunction with a longitudinal flow gradient in the die, permit the production of high‐strength, extremely rigid profiles from high‐density polyethylene (HDPE). The reinforcement is due to the shish‐kebab structure, which is responsible for the improvement of thermal and mechanical properties. The growth of shish‐kebab structures with an extended chain crystal axis and the radially lamellar structure, originated by flow‐induced crystallization, depends on the orientation of the macromolecules in the melt. Compared to a conventional extruded profile, the high‐strength profile exhibits molecular chain orientation largely parallel to the direction of extrusion, homogeneous transparency, and an approximately tenfold increase in Young's modulus, as well as improved thermal properties and good dimensional stability.",

It is shown that, in stratified flow, phase morphology variations are primarily caused by viscosity differences between the two phases. For disperse two‐phase flow, the phase morphology is strongly influenced by the interfacial tension as well as the viscosity ratio. This appears to be through the capillarity or Taylor number. Large interfacial tensions and small shear stresses or matrix viscosities lead to coarse phase morphologies and phase growth under quiescent conditions. Interface modification additives (compatibilizers) may be interpreted in terms of reduction of interfacial tensions. Applications to polymer processing operations and interpretation of rheological properties are described. The development of orientation of individual polymers in blends is reviewed. It is shown that chain orientation develops differently for the individual components in both compatible and incompatible blend systems. In incompatible systems, an addition of a second polymer to a crystallizing melt would appear to reduce the levels of eventual crystalline orientation in the latter, if the former shows sharp viscosity rises prior to the crystallization.",

The segmented polyurethanes were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), ultraviolet‐visible spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X‐ray diffraction, and their tensile properties and Shore A hardness were determined. The DSC data indicate rather good miscibility between the soft segments and the hard segments that accounts for the good transparency. The incorporation of a small amount of a second chain extender into MDI and 1‐4‐butanediol‐based segmented polyurethanes decreases the crystallinity of the hard segment, thus enhancing the transparency. A segmented polyurethane derived from MDI and 1,6‐hexanediol exhibits better transparency due to its relatively lower crystallinity of the hard segment. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Selecting the proper process conditions for the injection‐molding process is treated as a multiobjective optimization problem, where different objectives, such as minimizing the injection pressure, volumetric shrinkage/warpage, or cycle time, present trade‐off behaviors. As such, various optima may exist in the objective space. This paper presents the development of an integrated simulation‐based optimization system that incorporates the design of computer experiments, Gaussian process (GP) for regression, multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA), and levels of adjacency to adaptively and automatically search for the Pareto‐optimal solutions for different objectives. Since the GP approach can provide both the predictions and the estimations of the predictions simultaneously, a nondominated sorting procedure on the predicted variances at each iteration step is performed to intelligently select extra samples that can be used as additional training samples to improve the GP surrogate models. At the same time, user‐defined adjacency constraint percentages are employed for evaluating the convergence of iteration. The illustrative applications in this paper show that the proposed optimization system can help mold designers to efficiently and effectively identify optimal process conditions. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A soluble polyamide was synthesized from aromatic and aliphatic monomers by condensing 4‐aminophenyl sulfone with sebacoyl chloride in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at low temperature under inert atmosphere. A stoichiometric amount of triethylamine was added to precipitate the HCl produced during the polymerization reaction. The precipitates were isolated, yielding a clear neat polyamide solution. Thin and transparent film achieved from the polymer resin was characterized for FTIR, NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, water absorption, and mechanical measurements. The dried film was found to be soluble in DMAc, DMSO, and DMF. The film‐forming property of polyamide is being exploited for the preparation of the nanocomposites. Spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of polyamide. The values of M n , M w , and polydispersity as determined by GPC were found to be 9,779, 20,280 g/mol and 2.07 with RI detector whereas 10,133, 20,865 g/mol and 2.06 with UV detector, respectively. The thermally stable polyamide exhibited tensile strength (18.86 MPa), glass transition temperature (72.34°C), and water absorption (16.1%). These studies further verified the related physical properties of the polyamide. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 29:300–308, 2010; View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com .

In particular, the effect of the content of cyanate ester resin on the cure behavior and the properties of the cured new thermosetting resins were investigated. As a result, it was found that the ring‐opening reaction of a benzoxazine ring and thermal self‐cyclotrimerization of a cyanate ester group occurred, then the phenolic hydroxyl group generated by the ring‐opening reaction of the benzoxazine ring might coreact with the cyanate ester group. As the content of cyanate ester resin increased, the gelation reaction proceeded more quickly. The cured new thermosetting resin from benzoxazine and cyanate ester resin showed good thermal stability, high electrical resistivity, and high water resistance. As the content of cyanate ester resin increased, the glass transition temperature and electrical resistivity became especially higher. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The extrudate (die) swell of a high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) melt was studied both experimentally and numerically under slip conditions. The excess pressure drop due to entry (entrance pressure drop), the effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity, and the slip effects on the capillary data analysis have been examined. Using a series of capillary dies having different diameters, D , and length‐to‐diameter L / D ratios, a full rheological characterization has been carried out and the experimental data have been fitted both with a viscous model (Carreau–Yasuda) and a viscoelastic one (the Kaye‐Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko or K‐BKZ/PSM model). Particular emphasis has been placed on the effects of wall slip (significant for HDPE). It was found that viscous modeling underestimates the pressures drops (especially at the higher apparent shear rates and L / D ratios) and predicts virtually no extrudate swell. On the other hand, the viscoelastic simulations were capable of reproducing the experimental data well, and this was particularly true for the pressure drop. The prediction of viscoelastic extrudate swell presented a problem, since the simulations grossly overpredict it due to the highly elastic nature of the melt. This occurs despite the presence of severe slip at the wall, which brings the swell down considerably. At this point it is not clear whether this is due to the viscoelastic model used or other phenomena, such as sagging and/or cooling, when simply extruding in the atmosphere. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ionic liquids (ILs) are outstanding microwave‐absorbing agents due to their high ionic conductivity and polarizability, thus leading to a high heating rate and considerably shortened reaction time. In this study, a series of novel chiral poly(amide–imide) (PAI) nanostructures with hydroxyphenyl pendant units in the side chain were prepared with excellent yields via a simple microwave heating method using molten tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a molten IL and triphenyl phosphite as the condensing agent. The polymerization proceeded well in molten TBAB and PAIs were obtained with high yields and moderate inherent viscosities ranging from 0.32 to 0.49 dL/g. The obtained PAIs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, specific rotation, powder X‐ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM), thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and in some cases by 1 H NMR technique. The FE‐SEM micrographs and XRD showed that the synthesized PAIs were nanostructured and amorphous polymers that nanosize particles are in the range of 66–78 nm. The effect of ultrasonic irradiation on the size of polymer particles was also investigated. The transparent and flexible thin films based on PAI nanostructures were obtained by a casting technique, and their properties were studied. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The alumina acidic, silica ppt, and alumina neutral catalysts also showed good results; however, their effects were less pronounced as compared to silica gel.

Sodium alginate and pectin were used as raft‐forming polymers, sodium bicarbonate as gas‐generating substance, and calcium carbonate for generation of calcium ions. Physical test of all compressed formulations were within pharmacopoeial limits. Effect of pH of medium on raft formation was observed by placing the formulation in different pH mediums. Raft was characterized by their strength, weight, volume, resilience, reflux resistance, thickness, buffering capacity, neutralizing capacity, floating lag time ( FLT ) and total floating time ( TFT ). Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy was performed to check the interaction between the polymers and other excipients. Raft was effectively formed at pH 1.2. Raft strength, reflux resistance, and thickness of optimized formulation APR 15 were 9.71 ± 0.013 g, 2670 ± 0.987 g, and 5.1 ± 0.045 cm, respectively. Raft resilience for the APR 15 was found to be greater than 480 min. TFT of APR 15 was greater than 8 hr with 50 s FLT . Buffering and neutralizing capacity were 12.70 ± 1.21 meq and 7.0 ± 0.34 meq, respectively. FTIR spectra showed no interactions between sodium alginate, pectin, and other excipients.

The obtained data were compared to the results received for polyethylene and polymer with bromine‐containing fire retardants. The incorporation of nanofillers and halogen‐free fire retardants caused a reduction in combustibility as a consequence of the formation of char.

    "abstract": "Separation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from methane (CH 4 ) using polymeric membranes is limited by trade-off between permeability and selectivity as depicted in Robeson curve. To overcome this challenge, this study develops membranes by incorporating silica particles (Si) modified with [EMIM][Tf 2 N] ionic liquid (IL) at different IL:Si ratio to achieve desirable membrane properties and gas separation performance. Results show that the IL:Si particle has been successfully prepared, indicated by the presence of fluorine and nitrogen elements, as observed via Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). Incorporation of the modified particles into membrane has given prominent effects on morphology and polymer chain flexibility. The mixed matrix membrane (MMM) cross-section morphology turns rougher in the presence of IL:Si during fracture due to higher loadings of silica particles and IL. Furthermore, the MMM becomes more flexible with IL presence due to IL-induced plasticization, independent of IL:Si ratio. The MMM with low IL content possesses CO 2 permeance of 34.60 ± 0.26 GPU with CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 85.10, which is far superior to a pure polycarbonate (PC) and PC-Sil membranes at 2 bar, which surpasses the Robeson Upper Bound. This higher CO 2 selectivity is due to the presences of CO 2 -philic IL within the MMM system.",

Fiber length distributions of the composites were determined by using a vision measuring machine. It was found that the maximum number of fibers observed was in the range of 0–50 μm and the maximum length of the fiber in the composites is about 1 mm. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that the melting enthalpy crystallinity of the composites decreased slightly with the increase in CF loading. Thermogravimetric analysis results showed that the thermal stability of the composites improved with increasing CF loading. Mechanical test results showed that the tensile, flexural strength, modulus, and impact strength increased with increasing CF loadings. The strain at break decreased with the increase in CF content. The increasing screw rotation rate decreased not only the tensile strength and modulus but also the flexural strength and modulus. However, it increased the strain at break values of composites.",

The results showed that the new BPA‐free dental resins had comparable or better physicochemical properties when compared with Bis‐GMA/TEGDMA dental resin except for their water sorption that was higher than that of Bis‐GMA/TEGDMA dental resin. Therefore, the BPA‐free UDMTA/UDMA/TEGDMA resin system has potential to be used as a resin matrix of dental materials, but much more studies need to be undertaken in future.",

In this regard, nanofibers with and without MWCNTs were produced (with approximately similar diameters), and the effect of a good dispersion of MWCNTs on the thermal, physical, and mechanical properties of the nanofibrous samples was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to observe the surface morphology and interior structures of electrospun nanofibers, respectively.

The DSC results of phase change nanofibers (PCNs) and the phase change nanocomposite nanofibers (PCNNs) confirmed that the presence of MWCNTs extremely boosts the DOC of nanofibers (44.69% and 93.64% for PCNs and PCNNs, respectively), which can be attributed to the nucleation effect of MWCNTs. Moreover, the X‐ray diffraction pattern and tensile test results showed that the presence of MWCNTs can affect the average size of crystals and mechanical strength of nanofibers, respectively. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that the SPCNNs have good mechanical and thermal properties and appropriate potential for use in numerous thermal energy storage applications.",

There are many studies in Iran that have been performed in relation to SAPs and their useful application in agriculture; however, there is still a lack of its applied definition in arid regions. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of doing a meta-analysis of the results of studies conducted in Iran and answering a general question about whether the application of SAPs has been effective in enhancing the production or not, and if so, how much of SAP is recommended. To conduct this research, articles published during 2006–2016 on the subject of the effects of different rates of SAP application on yield and yield components of crops (including cereals, legumes, and medicinal and grassland plants) were investigated. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the mean consumption rate of SAPs for cereals, legumes, and medicinal and grassland plants was 83, 322, 1031, and 210 kg ha −1 , respectively, and that, at these SAP application rates, the mean seed yield in cereals, medicinal plants, and legumes increased by 15.2, 12.6, and 38% (equivalent to 1059, 345, and 452 kg ha −1 ), respectively, compared with the control. Dry matter response to superabsorbent application was slower compared with the seed yield response. The mean consumption of 83 kg ha −1 of superabsorbent for cereals increased seed yield by 15.2% on average. According to the results, it seems that the application of 100 kg SAP ha −1 is the most appropriate rate for increasing seed and dry matter yields and satisfying economic aspects. These study findings may shed light on the environment and socioeconomic concerns and improve efficacy and reduction of costs.",

In the present study, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) that could selectively recognize sulfadiazine (SDZ) was prepared using SDZ as the template molecule and methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. Using MIP as biomimetic antibody and Au@Pt@SiO 2 nanozyme as a marker, a new biomimetic immunoassay was developed to detect sulfadiazine.

    "abstract": "Abstract Packaging materials based on natural polymers are becoming popular because these polymers are derived from renewable resources and can display biodegradability. However, natural polymers are typically highly hydrophilic, and packaging films produced with them can absorb water, leading to dimensional changes and reductions in mechanical properties. In this work, films of thermoplastic starch ( TPS ) and blends of TPS /low‐density polyethylene ( LDPE ) were prepared, and their surfaces were decorated to alter their hydrophilic characteristics. Micro‐ (polymer microspheres) and nano‐components (polycaprolactone electrospun nanofibers) were deposited on the surface of starch and its blends with LDPE . Nanofibers containing silver sulfadiazine were also used to decorate the starch and its blends to change the topography (evaluated by SEM and atomic force microscopy) and to provide anti‐bacterial properties. High values of contact angle (CA) and low values of CA hysteresis were measured for the modified surfaces, including a CA higher than 150° and a hysteresis lower than 10°. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the intrinsically hydrophilic surfaces of biodegradable natural polymers could be altered by creating topographical patterns through decoration with nano‐/micro‐components to generate hydrophobic and even superhydrophobic features that can be useful in minimizing the water absorption of these materials.",

The shear thinning and power law behavior was observed for all samples. At low shear rates (100 s −1 ) apparent viscosity of composites with copper loading lower than 1.2 wt% exhibited a “ball bearing” effect. The Cu particles enhanced the thermal stability of Cu NP s/ PVC composites compared with neat PVC . The release of copper ions from Cu NP s/ PVC composite films into the aqueous medium was negligible after 6 h of immersion. Polymer films with Cu NP amount higher than 0.6 wt% showed a similar kinetics of bacterial growth; therefore, a substantial improvement of antimicrobial activity was not observed with increasing Cu NP content.",

In this work, the effect of ZnB on the flame retardancy of PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) woven fabrics was investigated. In order to provide the homogenous application of ZnB to the fabrics, the particle size of ZnB powders was reduced from 9 μ m to submicron scale by wet-milling with zirconia balls followed by high shear fluid processing. ZnB dispersion was mixed with low-formaldehyde melamine resin based cross-linking agent and it was applied to PET fabrics by pad dry cure method. ZnB dispersion was then added in different ratios to alkyl phosphonate and organophosphorus compound based commercial flame retardant finishing agents and applied to the fabrics. The effect of zinc borate with phosphorus based flame retardant (FR) finishing agents was examined by cone calorimetry under a heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 , vertical flame test, and limit oxygen index. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed up to 800°C under N 2 flow. Test results show that zinc borate can be combined with the organophosphorus based commercial FR finishing agents. Zinc borate could not improve the flammability properties of PET fabrics significantly but decreased mean CO, total smoke release, and total smoke production values.",

Compared to the traditional melt mixing (MM), SM followed by molding contributes to the construction of segregated structures in UHMWPE composite. This segregated structure can greatly improve the thermal conductivity of the composites. The segregated structure of composites prepared by MM is destroyed by shearing. Moreover, the thermal stability of composites by SM is improved with the increment of BN content, which is better than that of samples by MM, probably resulting from the barrier function of the segregated structure.",

Although β -glucan has multiple physiological functions, the physiological function of qingke β -glucan was few studied. In this study, the β -glucan was isolated, purified, determined the structural characterization, and measured the inhibitory activity to enzymes correlating blood sugar and lipid. Methods . β -Glucan was isolated from enzymatic aqueous extract of qingke by using deproteinization, decolorization, DEAE-52 column chromatography, and sepharose CL-4B agarose gel column chromatography. The structure of the β -glucan was determined using FT-IR and 13 C-NMR spectra analysis, and molecular mass by use of HPSEC-dRI-LS. The kinematic viscosity was measured. The inhibitory effects of this β -glucan on four enzymes were investigated. Results . This β -glucan had a uniform molecular weight of 201,000 Da with β -(1⟶4) as the main chain and β -(1⟶3) as a side chain. The β -glucan presented a relatively strong inhibitory activity on α -glucosidase, moderate inhibition on invertase, and a weak inhibition on α -amylase, whereas it did not inhibit lipase. Conclusion . The study indicates that the enzymatic β -glucan from qingke has the potential as natural auxiliary hypoglycemic additives in functional medicine or foods.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid FRP-concrete-steel double-skin tubular columns (hybrid DSTCs) are novel hollow columns consisting of an outer FRP tube, an inner steel tube, and the concrete between the two tubes. Hybrid DSTCs possess important advantages, such as excellent corrosion resistance as well as remarkable seismic resistance. However, existing studies are mainly focused on hybrid DSTCs with a circular cross section or a square cross section. When a column is subjected to different load levels in the two horizontal directions, a rectangular column is preferred as it can provide different bending stiffness and moment capacity around its two axes of symmetry. This paper presents an experimental study on rectangular DSTCs with a particular focus on the effect of the cross-sectional aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of the breadth to the width of the rectangular cross section). The effect of the cross-sectional shape of the inner steel tube (i.e., both elliptical and rectangular inner steel tubes were used) and the effect of FRP tube thickness were also investigated experimentally. Experimental results show that a larger aspect ratio will have no negative effect on the confinement effect in rectangular DSTCs; a rectangular DSTC with a larger aspect ratio generally has a larger ultimate axial strain and a higher axial stress at the ultimate axial strain; rectangular DSTCs with an elliptical steel tube generally have better performance than corresponding specimens with a rectangular steel tube. An existing model, which was developed based on a model for rectangular FRP-confined concrete columns and a model for circular DSTCs, is verified using the test results of the present study. The model generally provides close predictions for the peak axial stress of the confined concrete but yields conservative predictions for the ultimate axial strain for rectangular DSTCs.",

The composites were prepared with varying FSC concentrations (2.5%, 5 wt%, and 10 wt%) with the standard PUF matrix, while calcium carbonates in the standard sample (STD) were completely substituted with 50 wt% of collagen. When examining the effects of collagen concentration on mechanical characteristics, complex correlations emerge between tensile strength, elongation, tear resistance, and ductility. The results reveal that the addition of 2.5 wt% FSC increased tensile strength by 12.66% during heat aging, while the addition of 5 wt% at standard temperature increased elongation by 6.65%. Under normal conditions, collagen significantly enhanced the material’s resistance to tearing, demonstrating its potential for long‐term durability. Under typical conditions, tear resistance showed notable gains, increasing by 84.85% (50 wt% FSC) and 33% (10 wt% FSC), respectively. The tear resistance, however, diminishes under heat aging for all concentrations. Morphological assessments indicate a consistent closed cell structure across all samples, with collagen potentially contributing to reinforcement. The study supports the sustainable use of fish scale‐derived collagen as a filler, addressing waste management challenges and aligning with principles of environmentally conscious material development.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to convert cotton‐based post‐consumer textile waste to biodegradable paper, which not only addresses the discarding of waste but also provides a second use of cotton. The post‐consumer garment made with cotton was decolorized by stripping with concentrated NaOH and hydrose. Afterwards, it was chopped, ground, and treated with NaOH solutions. The paper was prepared through a wet‐laid process by mixing carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder with chopped cotton textiles. To reduce water absorbency, the uncoated paper was coated with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) using heat pressing technique. The surface morphology and chemical structure of uncoated pristine paper, coated paper, and TPU films were conducted using SEM and FTIR studies. The tensile strength, contact angle, air permeability, and biodegradability tests were investigated according to the standard methods. The tensile properties of the papers were increased after TPU coating, accounting well around 28% compared to the uncoated pristine paper. The elongation at the break of the coated paper was at least 40% greater than the uncoated pristine paper. The coated paper displayed a higher water contact angle of 100°, even after 10 min. The lower air permeability was observed in the coated paper due to TPU film blocking the free spaces of the paper. The TPU‐coated paper exhibited a weight loss of 48.1%–59.8% after 90 days, whereas the uncoated paper was 100% decomposed after 60 days. The burning of post‐consumer cotton textile waste (PCCTW) paper generated ashes resembling those of burning paper, implying clean and environmental friendly biodegradation. The papers can replace the petroleum–plastic materials and serve as food and other packaging applications.",

In this report, an L18 experimental matrix design based on the Taguchi method was conducted to optimize the joint strength of ultrasonically welded thermoplastics. For the factors selected in the main experiments, weld time and amplitude of vibration were found to be the principal factors affecting the joint property of ultrasonically welded thermoplastics. A weldability diagram was proposed based on the statistical results to give first guidelines for system optimization.

    "abstract": "Abstract Results of a study of the orientation characteristics of extruded poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (Homopolymer) sheets are discussed with respect to stretching condition. PET exhibits strain‐induced crystallization upon being stretched to large extension ratios. This may lead to strain‐hardening, which is accompanied by an upswing in the stress–strain curve recorded during the process of extension. A parameter pertaining to the extension ratio, at which the onset of strain‐hardening occurs during stretching of the specimen, is defined. This is called the strain‐hardening parameter (SHP). The dependence of the SHP on the mode of stretching, the temperature of stretching, the strain rate, and the limiting extension ratio in the first stretch direction, are studied. It is seen that the SHP in both simultaneous and sequential modes decreases with increasing strain rate and the limiting extension ratio in the first stretch direction, while it increases with increasing temperature of stretching. For specimens stretched in the simultaneous mode at 90°C, SHP versus extension rate shows a minimum. This could be due to viscous dissipation at high rates of extension. Also studied is the relationship of strain‐hardening and the SHP with strain‐induced crystallization. It is seen that for specimens stretched in the uniaxial constrained mode, the rapid increase in properties with extension occurs much before the upswing in the stress–strain curve. The upswing occurs at the extension ratio at which the increase in properties once again becomes gradual. This means that the upswing in the stress–strain curve indicates significant completion of strain‐induced crystallization and the establishment of structural order within the specimen. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The average molecular weight and the polydispersity have been reduced and the carbonyl and unsaturation indexes increase as the number of extrusions and the aggressivity of the screw profile increase. The kneading element with 90° caused the greater level of degradation. On the other hand, the addition of left‐hand conveying elements reduces the level of degradation because of the extra volume of molten polymer held in the screw, reducing the viability of oxygen inside the barrel. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the present study the mechanisms of fiber organization and fiber degradation have been investigated. The polymer matrix employed has been high density polyethylene (HDPE) with an MFI of 0.1. Fibers including jute and sisal have been used as discrete reinforcements with initial lengths varying from 5 to 10 mm. The extrusion process has been investigated using an open‐barrel single screw extruder. The issues of fiber distribution and bubble formation have been related to the mechanical properties of these composites, particularly tensile strength. Fiber degradation has been assessed after processing by microscopic examination of the extruder contents. The effect of the processing temperature on the level of fiber degradation is also discussed here. Fiber length after processing has been measured, and unimodal and bimodal fiber length distributions have been obtained. However, the issue of adequate sample preparation for the fiber length characterization procedure still requires further work in order to reduce the experimental error. Fiber orientation distributions have been estimated for some of the samples. It has been found that at higher processing temperatures the fibers show more alignment in the flow direction. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The selection of the compatibilizer is aided by the application of the principles of miscibility and of organic interactions. It may be advantageous to prepare the compatibilizer in situ . Chemical modification of the base components to enhance interactions between the components is an important option. Processing and rheological effects must also be taken into account. The combination of the compatibilizer and the processing conditions must yield a morphology that will preserve the desired properties of each component while minimizing the undesirable properties.

Polymers with similar initial viscosities and elasticities were first melt mixed and then simultaneously reacted and mixed to produce blends whose reaction‐modified components had very different molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. The rheological behavior of the blends in both shear and elongational flow were found to depend on composition, peroxide concentration, and, possibly, on the relative response rate of the individual components to peroxide attack. In general, the rheological properties of the reacted blends differed significantly from those of blends compounded in the absence of peroxide, and they were influenced by the presence of two components with vastly different structural and rheological characteristics: the degraded PP of low viscosity and elasticity, and a branched or crosslinked LDPE with increased viscosity and increased melt elasticity. Data from the batch experiments of this work are useful in defining process requirements for continuous reactive extrusion compounding, such as component characteristics, length of mixing/reaction zones, screw geometry, and sequence of feeding, as they relate to product characteristics.",

C.) was used to obtain MD velocity profile and bubble shape above the air ring under industrial film blowing conditions. Subsequently, the velocity profile and bubble shape were utilized to calculate strain and strain rate histories for a fluid element before it solidified. The deformational history of a fluid element was compared between LDPE and LLDPE of similar melt index and density. Also, the study was extended to two groups of LLDPE/LDPE blends: blends rich in LLDPE and blends rich in LDPE. We used a 100‐mil die gap for extruding resins rich in LLDPE to avoid melt fracture. A 30‐mil die gap was used to process blends that were rich in LDPE. Under the same film blowing conditions and frost line height, LDPE exhibits higher peak strain rates than LLDPE and the peak strain rates for LDPE occur closer to the air ring. Moreover, the MD strain of LLDPE continues to increase above the frost line. Conversely, the MD strain profile of LDPE levels off quickly before the frost line. The observed differences in fluid element deformation between LLDPE and LDPE on the blown film line are attributed to the higher melt tension of LDPE. For LLDPE, a 10 wt % LDPE addition causes a significant increase in strain and strain rate at lower positions. Interestingly, a further addition up to 25 wt % LDPE causes little or no further change in deformational history. The increased strain rates associated with an increased strain results in a stabilized LLDPE bubble. For LDPE, only slight differences in strain and strain histories were observed with the addition of LLDPE up to 25%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many plastics processes, nonvirgin materials make up relatively small percentages of materials added to the main processing stream. In thermoforming, however, as much as half the material that passes through the extrusion and thermoforming process chain is “nonproduct” web. Economics usually dictate that this material must be reprocessed. Materials that experience high levels of shear and/or temperature usually exhibit measurable and significant property loss. This means that the mixture of materials fed to the process has properties some‐what less than those of the virgin resin. This paper presents algorithms for determining final product properties, given single‐pass property loss and fraction of recycle in the resin mixture going to the process. The following cases are considered: Linear, where the single‐pass property loss is directly proportional to the mixture property prior to processing. This was first worked out by Smoluk for tensile strengths Power‐law, where the single‐pass property loss is proportional to the mixture property to a power. Impact strength is an example Offset, where the single‐pass property is equal to the mixture property minus a fixed amount. Fire retardancy seems to be an example of this Logarithmic, where the law of mixtures is logarithmic. Viscosity and intrinsic viscosity (molecular weight) are examples here For cases 1, 2, and 4, the algorithm yields a closed solution for steady‐state processes. The offset case yields a nested series that converges in about 20 steps. In addition, if a value can be placed on material property loss (either through higher product reject rates or higher virgin material costs), a “profit” algorithm can be created to determine the actual processing costs. From this, scenarios for reuse of regrind and/or off‐spec materials can be created. An example of such an algorithm is given.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, the conditions leading to the formation of cells and to the onset of crystallization of polycarbonate were examined with the use of supercritical carbon dioxide for the production of foams from preforms. Small plaques cut from extruded sheets were treated with supercritical carbon dioxide in an autoclave at temperatures varying from 60 to 200°C and from 4.5 to 30 MPa pressure. Visual observations and stereoscan electron microscopy examination revealed that penetration of supercritical carbon dioxide takes place via the advancing layer mechanism and that, for the particular grade of polycarbonate used in this study, the nucleation of the cells can take place at temperatures as low as 60°C. It requires, however, long treatment times and high pressures, and the growth of foam cells is severely restricted. Nucleation and growth of cells occurred much more readily at somewhat higher temperatures. With treatments at around 80°C, the onset of crystallization started to impose considerable hindrance to the formation of uniform and evenly distributed cells. This becomes increasingly evident at higher temperatures, between 100 and 180°C, owing to the formation of large spherulitic crystalline domains. A very effective nucleation and growth mechanism for the formation of cells was obtained, on the other hand, with treatments at 200°C due to the absence of crystallization phenomena. The degree of crystallinity increased with increasing treatment temperature, and the resulting morphology gave rise to two broad melting peaks. These are displaced to higher temperatures and become closer, merging into one peak with a low‐temperature shoulder. These events were monitored by thermal analysis and wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction examinations. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper begins with a brief description of the history of development of PVC plastisol. It, then, presents technical background on the nature of PVC plastisol, covering subjects of particle size distribution and nature of agglomerates, viscosity aging and deagglomeration, rheology of suspension, gelation and fusion, and thermodynamic interaction between polymer and plasticizer. The main part of the paper concerns rheological observation of the gelation and fusion process of PVC plastisol, as the title of the paper indicates. This is a summary of recent work by the authors plus their new work on the effect of plasticizer type. The first half is the investigation of gelation and fusion mechanisms with use of a model plastisol system. Viscoelastic measurements, thermal analyses on the behavior of glass transition, and the scanning electron microscopic examination of the particulate structure were used to support the investigation. The last half considers the effect of the material variables on the gelation and fusion behavior; molecular weight, extractable additives (emulsifiers), agglomerates and fine particles, size of primary particles and plasticizer type are covered. Among these material variables, the plasticizer type has by far the largest influence on the gelation behavior. The observed solvent power is not necessarily in agreement with the thermodynamic interaction parameters found in the literature. It is indicated that a further systematic investigation is necessary to elucidate the nature of the plasticizer–polymer interaction.",

Microcellular closed cell TPO foams were prepared using a two‐stage batch process method. The microstructure of these foamed samples was controlled by carefully altering the processing parameters such as saturation pressure, foaming temperature, and foaming time. Foam morphologies were characterized in terms of the cell density, foam density, and average cell size. Elastic modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break of the foamed TPO samples were measured for different cell morphologies. The findings show that the mechanical properties are significantly affected by the foaming parameters that varied with the cell morphologies. The experimental results can be used to predict the microstructure and mechanical properties of microcellular polymeric TPO foams prepared with different processing parameters. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The interest in thermoplastic composites is growing because of their advantages over thermosets, as well as their recyclability and higher toughness. The melt viscosity of thermoplastic polymers is very high, which makes fiber impregnation difficult. This difficulty can be overcome by the in situ polymerization with cyclic butylene terephthalate (CBT). However, this leads to a brittle polybutyleneterephthalate when isothermal RTM‐production is applied. To solve this problem, a nonisothermal production process for composites with CBT as matrix material was developed and the influence on the toughness was investigated. In the nonisothermal production process, different cooling rates were applied to examine their influence on the toughness of the produced composites. The difference in composites properties was related to the difference in the degree of crystal perfection, which was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two series of cross‐linked polyurethanes with various hard segment structures and different amounts were prepared and thermomechanical properties of these materials were studied. Cross‐linked polyurethane copolymers composed of poly(ethylene adipate)diol as soft segment and 4,4′‐methylenebis(phenylisocyanate), 1,6‐hexamethylene diisocyanate, and diols glycerin, 1,4‐butanediol, and 1,6‐hexanediol as hard segments were synthesized by a two‐step process. The networks have been prepared by end‐linking a mixture of the bifunctional precursor chains with trifunctional cross‐linkers at off‐stoichiometric ratios. The results show that the cross‐link and the polyurethane hard segment interaction play a special role in the interconnected chain density and its magnitude is revealed by the mechanical properties. Of most importance, maximum stress, tensile modulus, and elongation at break increased significantly at the 22 wt % composition of hard segment content. Interchain cross‐linking improves thermal stability, which was measured by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Cross‐linked polyurethane behaves as an elastomer and is useful for shock, noise, and vibration control. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A simple blend (i.e., blend without curative) of 60/40 rubber/nylon‐12 with three different types of natural rubber (i.e., air‐dried sheet natural rubber (ADS) and epoxidized natural rubbers (ENR) with 25 and 50 mol% epoxide) was prepared by the melt‐mixing process. Influence of different types of rubbers and the level of epoxide groups in ENR molecules on the properties of the blends were investigated. It was found that all the blends exhibited a co‐continuous phase morphology. Furthermore, the ENR/nylon‐12 blends exhibited superior mechanical properties, stress relaxation behavior, thermal and rheological properties, and a finer grain morphology than that of the ADS/nylon‐12 blend. This may be attributed to the higher interfacial adhesion between the ENR and nylon‐12 phases via a chemical interaction of epoxide groups in ENR molecules and polar functional groups in the nylon‐12 molecules. Temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR) measurement was also performed. Improvement in stress relaxation and thermal resistance of the blends with ENR was observed. Moreover, the higher temperature coefficient and lower glass transition temperature ( T g ) of the nylon‐12 phase in the ENR‐50/nylon‐12 blends were found. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the difficulty in its processability limits its potential applications. In this work, conductive emeraldine salt (i.e., one of the different oxidation states of PANI) was synthesized by oxidative chemical polymerization. Different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis were used to characterize the synthesized PANI. The processability of PANI has been improved by processing it, both by compression and extrusion methods, with different thermoplastic matrices such as polycaprolactone and polybutylene terephthalate. The obtained compounds have not only better processability but also improved thermal and mechanical properties. However, their conductivity decreases with respect to PANI, to a greater extent, for the compounds synthesized by the extrusion method. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The degree of silane grafting and cross‐linking of several high‐density polyethylenes (HDPE) was studied. The results are compared with those of a low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) and a linear low‐density polyethylene (LLDPE). Molecular characterization was done by gel permeation chromatography. The differences in grafting and cross‐linking performance are correlated to the different structural parameters of the polymers such as molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, polydispersity index (PDI), and branching. The results show that molecular weight plays the main role in silane‐grafting and cross‐linking performance. For samples with approximately similar PDI, the grafting level increased with both increasing number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight, whereas the gel content increased with increasing weight average molecular weight. However, a zigzag relation was observed for the variation of grafting and cross‐linking performances with PDI. The presence of long‐chain branching affects the size of molecules and reduces the grafting efficiency due to coil contraction and more intramolecular entanglements. The order of the degree of grafting for the different polyethylenes investigated was LLDPE &gt; HDPE &gt; LDPE, whereas the order for the gel content was LDPE &gt; LLDPE &gt; HDPE. The presence of unsaturated groups led to increase in the grafting level. However, there is no overall rule based on the density of polyethylene. Different grades of polyethylene show different behaviors depending on the silane and peroxide concentration. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The influence of its variable addition on the properties of PVAc—OMMT was investigated mainly by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and static tension, and the rheology was also investigated by the power‐law function equation and the Cross–Williamson model viscous equation. The exfoliated nanocomposite of PVAc—OMMT was obtained; linear macromolecular chains of PVAc were formed in the layers of OMMT, and no chemical bonding appeared between OMMT and PVAc, but there were some physical effects. The dispersion of PVAc—OMMT was better than PVAc. OMMT was exfoliated into layers or sheets of nanoparticles and was randomly dispersed in the matrix of PVAc. The particle diameter of OMMT ranged from 50 to 100 nm, whereas PVAc's diameter ranged from 250 to 500 nm; the smaller OMMT particles were adsorbed around the bigger all PVAc particles and formed a “strawberry” structure. PVAc and PVAc—OMMT were both pseudoplastic non‐Newtonian fluids; they possessed the normal stress effect (or the Weissenberg effect), that is the pole‐climbing phenomenon. The static tension properties of PVAc—OMMT were much better than PVAc, and the addition of OMMT in polymerization was reasonable and not more than 2.0% of VAc. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The fabrication process involved laying up multiple layers of woven CF between precut extruded sheets of PP and compression molding to achieve 3.5–4.0 mm CF‐reinforced PP composite laminate sheets. From the laminated sheets, test specimens were prepared and tested for tensile, flexural, and impact properties. It was found that the reinforcement of PP with 30% CF increased the tensile strength from 21.87 to 28.07 MPa, tensile modulus from 618 to 1867 MPa, flexural strength from 21.7 to 45.3 MPa, and flexural modulus from 813 to 1925 MPa. However, the tensile elongation at break decreased marginally from 26.72% to 20.99%. A multiaxial impact test indicates reduction in the total energy absorbed and the peak force of the fabric‐reinforced laminates in comparison with neat PP. Coefficient of thermal expansion results on CF‐reinforced PP laminate sheet indicate reduction in thermal expansion. Dynamic mechanical analysis of CF‐reinforced PP shows an increase in the storage modulus and loss modulus. Scanning electron microscopic images reveal fibers pull out and breakages due to lack of an interfacial interaction between the CF and the PP matrix. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) has been widely used in many applications because of its broad range of properties. However, synthesis of TPU with desirable properties is time consuming and only produces limited quantities. In this paper, twin‐screw extrusion was used to produce TPU blends of varying soft and hard segments with tunable properties. Foamed samples of TPU blends were produced by microcellular injection molding. Multiple characterization tests were performed to confirm the miscibility and tunability of the blends. It was confirmed that soft and hard TPUs were compatible at ratios of 2:1 and 1:2, but partially miscible at a ratio of 1:1. Rigidity increased while the shape‐recovery rate decreased with increasing the hard TPU content. The blend ratio influenced the foaming morphology, solid skin‐layer thickness, as well as mechanical properties. It was found that microcellular injection molding could reduce the injection‐shot volume without sacrificing too much mechanical property and, compared with their solid counterparts, the foamed blends could retain mechanical properties better than foamed pure TPUs. Decomposition and degradation behaviors were also studied. The biocompatibility of soft and hard TPU‐foamed samples, which could be potentially used as tissue engineering scaffolds, was confirmed by fibroblast cytotoxicity test. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The very fast curing rate, low coating thickness (&lt;100 µm), and a wide range of viscosity of ultraviolet (UV) systems hindered the study of UV‐curing shrinkage. A recently developed laser scanning method provided a chance to directly measure the real‐time (UV‐curing shrinkage. The effect of monomer chain lengths (degree of ethoxylation), monomer functionality, and monomer type (acrylate vs. methacrylate) on the shrinkage rates and shrinkage of UV monomers was systematically investigated. The concentration of double bonds and degree of conversion played the dominant role in the photopolymerization shrinkage and shrinkage rate. The main reason for the low shrinkage of methacrylate was that the low reactivity of methacrylate decreased the degree of conversion. The ethoxylation was an attractive way to lower the shrinkage and decrease the shrinkage rate due to significant reduction of the concentration of double bonds. The reduction of functionality was not obvious in decreasing the shrinkage or maximum shrinkage rate due to the combination effect of the concentration of double bonds and the degree of conversion. Besides, heat expansion attributed to polymerization could bring forward the maximum shrinkage rate from the shrinkage stage to the expansion stage. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Differential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate their melting and crystallization behaviors and to measure their respective degrees of crystallinity over mixing wide range of compositions. The degree of crystallinity reduced with POSS content, indicating restricted segmental motion of the polymer chains. Morphological observations were made using a polarized microscope, and the spherulite patterns observed in PEO/KI/I 2 collapsed with added POSS. A decrease in storage modulus was also observed by dynamic mechanical analysis. The ion conductivity measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was enhanced from 1.19 × 10 −5 to 1.27 × 10 −4 S·cm −1 at 70 wt% POSS; presumably, this was due to the combined effects of lower crystallinity, lower glass transition, and lower modulus as POSS content increases.",

The screws were pulled out and quenched by water, which allowed for quick access to the processed stream carcass. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), were employed to investigate the evolution of INM's dissolution into the molten excipient along the extrusion direction. The FT‐IR results show that kneading blocks accelerate the complete dissolution process. The unique capability of fully filled kneading blocks in mixing and melting associated with the dissolution of API into polymeric excipient matrix was discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Extrudate swell is a common phenomenon in polymer processing that can significantly influence the quality of final products. In this study, the viscoelastic flow patterns and the swell phenomenon of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) flowing through a hollow profile extrusion die are investigated by means of the finite element simulation. The mathematical model of three‐dimensional viscoelastic flow and extrudate swell of the polymer melt obeying a multimode differential Phan‐Thien and Tanner (mPTT) constitutive model is established. The rheological parameters of LDPE are obtained by fitting the material functions detected on a strain‐controlled rheometer. A penalty method is introduced to solve the viscoelastic flow and extrudate swell problem with a decoupled algorithm. The computational stability is improved by using the discrete elastic–viscous split stress (DEVSS) algorithm incorporating the inconsistent streamline‐upwind scheme. A streamface–streamline method is introduced to adjust the outlet free surface of the swelling extrudate. The design strategy of the hollow profile extrusion die is discussed. The essential flow characteristics and the mechanism of the swell phenomenon of polymer melt flowing through the hollow profile extrusion die are further investigated based on the proposed mathematical model and numerical scheme. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The micrographs revealed intercalated particles and tactoids, which were in accordance with the wide angle X‐ray scattering patterns. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed in the MD and TD directions, finding a slight anisotropy in the films, which was associated with a low level of polymer chain orientation due to the calender processing. The fracture behavior was also evaluated in the MD and TD directions using deeply double‐edge‐notched tension (DDENT) specimens. The mechanical and fracture tests were evaluated on aging (brittle) and deaging (ductile) films by applying a thermal treatment that consisted of heating above the glass transition temperature of the PLA and subsequent quenching. For ductile PLA composite films, the reinforcement effect promoted by the clay particles was not so evident.",

As similar to the swell ratio, which decreases with increasing die length, the drawdown force is found to increase with the die length. A prolonged residence time in a long die leads to the marked orientation. Consequently, crystallization occurs rapidly after passing through a long die, which is confirmed by wide‐angle X‐ray measurements. Moreover, the rapid crystallization by the addition of a nucleating agent also enhances the drawdown force.",

For uniform coating, the downstream contact line must not go beyond the die corner; otherwise, an undesirable vortex may appear near the downstream meniscus. The locations of the upstream and the downstream menisci were computed by the commercial software package FLOW‐3D®, and the theoretical predictions were verified by flow visualization experiments. Three possible approaches in die design were investigated to ensure the downstream meniscus remains in constant contact with the die surface. These were (1) reducing the angle between the slot die shoulder and the die lip, (2) increasing the lyophobicity of the die surface, and (3) raising the coating gap between the die lip and the substrate. The first method was found to be the most effective, as it also increases the maximum coating speed. The second method was feasible only if proper surface modification is applied. The third method potentially caused the creation of a new vortex under the die lip. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The results show that a PU foam sample incorporating only 0.05 wt% of nanoparticles has a great improvement (more than 90%) in sound absorption ability over the frequency range of 500–1,000 Hz. By the increase in the loading fraction of nanoparticles, a gradual decrease in acoustic damping is observed. Moreover, regarding size of nanoparticles, those with bigger nanometer sizes bring about a better sound absorption ability in PU foams. Besides acoustical properties, microcellular characteristics, nonacoustic parameters, and mechanical properties are also presented which are in agreement with the improved acoustical ability of foams quite well.",

BHET is obtained by the glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate waste. The synthesized PUs are blended with sodium alginate in the ratio of 7:3 and then cross‐linked by calcium chloride to get a pH‐sensitive protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) carrier. X‐ray diffraction patterns of different PU compositions indicate the presence of amorphous phase. The hydroxyl value of OH‐terminated PUs is found to be increasing with increasing amount of PEG in the composition. PEGylated PU shows higher water uptake and protection against hemolysis with a rising amount of PEG in the PU. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the blend shows characteristic peaks for both PU and alginate distinctly, indicating good dispersion of both the polymers. pH responsive swelling behavior in different pH media corresponding to the gastrointestinal tract (pH 1.2 and 7.4) is investigated for all the prepared blends. The minimum degree of swelling is observed for PU with the maximum amount PEG at pH 1.2, whereas the degree of swelling of the same PU significantly increased at pH 7.4. BSA encapsulation efficiency of the blends increases with an increase in PEG content in the PU and varies within the range of 88–99%.

Differential scanning calorimetry performed on neat PLA and PEG‐plasticized PLA showed that the former is characterized by a better quenchability than the latter. Neat PLA and PEG‐plasticized PLA were used for the production of rotational molding prototypes of simple shape. Owing to its very slow crystallization kinetics, a completely amorphous PLA was obtained by rotational molding with air cooling. As a consequence, rotomolded PLA is characterized by a good ductility and toughness. In contrast, the higher crystallization rate induced by the addition of PEG did not allow to obtain an amorphous structure for plasticized PLA, even if faster cooling was attained by water spraying. As a consequence, the PEG‐plasticized PLA, characterized by a semicrystalline structure, shows a lower ductility and toughness compared to neat PLA.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The change in stiffness with temperature in the presence of different media has been discussed for a long time because the ability to predict this behavior becomes fundamental to the design of new materials and their applications. That is why, in this work, the application of a mathematical model, which is able to predict the elastic properties of two polymers, is presented. The study takes into account the relationship between the viscoelastic and absorption properties of these materials in alkaline solution (Ca (OH) 2 , pH 12.5) and in distilled water (H 2 O, pH 7) as the immersion media. Diffusion coefficient values were higher when the resins were immersed in water than in the alkaline solution. In addition, the effect of the alkaline medium was higher for the unsaturated polyester resin (UPR). The highest decrease in modulus at the glassy state of the polymer network was observed for the UPR immersed in the alkaline medium. The greatest reduction of the T g value due to network plasticizing was found for the epoxy resin (ER) in the alkaline medium. Therefore, the ER exhibited a more stable behavior after aging at moderate temperature than the UPR.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Phanerochaete chrysosporium species was used to study the degradation of polymeric composites of (a) isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and (PLA) (iPP/PLA), and (b) iPP/PLA filled with calcium carbonate nanoparticles (nCaCO 3 ). PLA was synthesized using l ‐lactic acid under the controlled ultrasound cavitation technique, dried and used for composite preparation. Meanwhile, the synthesis and subsequent surface modification of nCaCO 3 was done using the ultrasound cavitation technique. Owing to ultrasound cavitation, a reaction mixture is dispersed uniformly but at the same time strong electrostatic force of attraction is developed over the surface of nCaCO 3 particles, which forms the agglomeration of particles. The deagglomeration as well as charge nullification was achieved using surface modification of CaCO 3 nanoparticles with triethoxy vinyl silane (TEVS) under controlled stirring. The sheets of iPP/PLA and iPP/PLA/nCaCO 3 were prepared at normal condition and subjected to a degradation study in minimal medium using P. chrysosporium microorganism up to 28 days. The growth of microorganism and fractures inside the polymer matrix before and after degradation was observed using a scanning electron microscope. Changes in extracellular protein content, biomass production, and percent degradation with respect to time of incubated samples have also been studied. It was found that the iPP/PLA/nCaCO 3 (5 phr) and iPP/PLA (at 30% PLA) composites show an increment in degradation. The presence of nCaCO 3 leads to faster degradation of iPP/PLA/nCaCO 3 nanocomposites, which decreases the mechanical property by 30% of PLA and 5 wt% of nCaCO 3 content.",

Better flame resistance and thermal stability were attained by the addition of nanoparticles. The flame retardancy and thermal stability of the composites were improved with the increase in concentration of Sm 3+ ‐doped TiO 2 . The glass transition temperatures of the composites were much enhanced by the increase in weight percentage of nano‐filler.

Confirmation of synthesis was done by aid of the Fourier transform infrared spectra, energy‐dispersive X‐ray, and the scanning electron microscope ( SEM ). SEM micrographs indicated the three‐dimensional cross‐linked structure of the hydrogels. The thermal properties were evaluated via the thermal gravimetric analysis. The swelling percentage and swelling kinetic parameters were determined. It was found that swelling of P( AA m‐ AA ‐ AHPS ) hydrogels was reached to 7,071% in distilled water, while P( AA m‐ AA ) hydrogels swelled 1,055%. And the swelling percentage was found to be affected by pH of the surrounding medium. The AHPS ‐based hydrogel giving the greatest swelling % was tested as a methylene blue remover from the aqueous solution by the batch adsorption method.

For this purpose, plasticized PLA samples were obtained by melt mixing and then processed by a lab-scale rotational molding equipment. For comparison, poly(ethylene glycole), PEG, and plasticized PLA samples were also produced. Despite the very low cooling rates attained in rotational molding, completely amorphous samples were obtained with neat PLA and PLA plasticized by cardanol derivatives. In contrast, PEG plasticized PLA showed a very high degree of crystallinity, as highlighted by DSC and XRD analysis, which made the extraction of the rotomolded box-shaped specimens impossible. The plasticizing effectiveness of cardanol derivatives was proven by tensile testing of rotational molded prototypes, which highlighted the reduced modulus and strength and improved strain to break, compared to neat PLA. Therefore, efficient toughening of PLA can be attained by the use of the two cardanol derived plasticizers, which involves a significant reduction of the polymer glass transition, as well as a reduced increase of the crystallization kinetic. On the other hand, the reduction of the glass transition temperature due to the addition of plasticizer is responsible for significant crystallization effects even during ageing at room temperature, which involves significant embrittlement of the material.",

    "abstract": "This article is an overview of a novel polymerization technique known as admicellar polymerization (ADPM). ADPM is known as a “surface analogue” of emulsion polymerization, and it consists of three main steps that include (1) admicelle formation, (2) adsolubilization, and (3) polymerization. This review encompasses all the applications of ADPM in the field of textiles. ADPM has been used mainly for finishing of textiles, e.g., for achieving flame retardancy, UV protection, water repellency, etc. It has also been used for improving the adhesion of natural fibers used for the reinforcement of polymer matrices. It was observed that though an extensive and constructive research work has been conducted at laboratory level to understand ADPM process and explore its applications, its industrial acceptance in textiles has not been reported yet. Scope for further research has also been discussed in this review article.",

Different combinations of Eudragit RS 100 and HPMC E5 were used with polyethylene glycol 400 as a plasticizer on a polyvinyl alcohol backing layer by the solvent evaporation technique. The patches were evaluated for organoleptic characteristics and physicochemical parameters. Initial in vitro dissolution experiments were conducted to optimize formulation parameters prior to ex vivo skin permeation studies. Eudragit RS 100 and HPMC E5 (9:1) combination was studied for skin permeation because of the sustain release effect. The effect of control patch and permeation enhancer including Tween 80, propylene glycol, and DMSO were evaluated at 10%–40% concentration in the Franz diffusion cell using excised abdominal skin of rabbit. Different kinetic models were used to interpret the release kinetics and drug release mechanism. The patch M04-PE containing 40% Tween 80 had better sustained release effect and had closer flux to the desired flux. M04-PE followed the zero-order kinetics with super case II release drug mechanism.",

In the traditional extracting methods, the Eucommia leaves or barks were dissolved in a medium or low polarity solvents, such as chloroform and toluene. However, in this process not only huge amounts of solvent were consumed but also the reversed‐phase solvent, such as ethanol and methanol, was needed to separate Eucommia rubber in a solid form from the solution. To solve these problems, we used the hydrophilicity of natural Eucommia rubber plant, using petroleum ether solution and alternating hot and cold water, to extract natural E. ulmoides rubber. This method could simplify the extraction process of E. ulmoides , reduce the amount of organic solvent used in the process of extraction, and save the extraction cost. The extracted E. ulmoides rubber was characterized, and the results showed that the molecular weight of E. ulmoides pretreated by the mechanical method was about 30 kDa and relatively narrow polydispersity. We also used the extracted Eucommia rubber in tread designing of car radial tires; the result showed that the mechanical properties of the rubber samples with Eucommia rubber increased compared with those without Eucommia rubber.",

Two PLA grades were considered: a low melt flow rate (MFR), high viscosity, material, characterized by an excellent quenchability, leading to a completely amorphous structure of rotomolded samples; a high MFR, low viscosity, material, characterized by a lower quenchability, leading to a semicrystalline structure of rotomolded samples. Three different granulometries were considered: a coarser one, that is, the pellets as received, intermediate size pellets produced by extrusion followed by pelletizing, and a powder obtained by grinding of as received pellets. Besides the different dimensions, the intermediate size pellets also experienced a supplementary extrusion step, which induced some degradation in the material. For both grades and three granulometries, void‐free prototypes were obtained, which indicate a very efficient sintering process, attributed to the low viscosity of all PLA grades. As a consequence, the modulus of the rotomolded samples was found to be unaffected by the PLA grade or granulometry. In contrast, the strength was shown to be more significantly dependent on quenchability than on the grade. To obtain an adequately high strength, an amorphous structure must be developed during cooling. Finally, the supplementary extrusion step experienced by the intermediate size pellets was shown to significantly decrease the strength of prototypes, as a consequence of the thermal degradation induced by this additional processing step.",

The viscosity and dynamic mechanical properties of epoxy formulations containing varying amounts of glass microballoons were established by parallel plate rheometry. Our studies reveal that solventless processing of formulations with microballoon loading &gt; 60% poses practical difficulties due to prohibitively high viscosities, although a packing efficiency of 74% is theoretically allowed in the case of hexagonal close packing.

But the mechanical performance and water resistance, particularly for fast-growing species, are unsatisfactory for high-end applications. In this study, the “new-type” scrimber technology was introduced to radiata pine ( Pinus radiata D. Don ) scrimbers. The structure, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability of the scrimber panels were investigated. Results showed that OWFMs as basic units of scrimber had been very even in size and superior permeability. The scrimbers exhibited a three-dimensional porous structure, and the porosity had a decrease with increasing density. Both OWFMs and densification contributed to the high performance in terms of mechanical properties and water resistance. The flexural, compressive, and short-beam shearing strength were significantly enhanced with increasing density. As the density was 0.80 g cm −3 , the flexural strength (MOR) was approximately 120 MPa, much larger than many selected wood-based panels. Moreover, the water resistance and dimensional stability also were closely related to the density. At the density of 1.39 g cm −3 , the water absorption rate and thinness swelling rate of the panels in boiled water were only 19% and 5.7%, respectively.",

Porosity and compressive strength of FAFG are respectively tested by Archimedes density test method and uniaxial compressive strength test method. It can be concluded that the FLA particle size has an effect on the pore structure and strength of FAFG. More specifically, the effect of FLA particle size shows itself macroscopically on the quantity of middle and large macro-pores and the uniformity of macro-pores distribution, and microscopically on the quantity of micro-holes and cracks and calcium silicate (C-S-H) quantity at the early stage of FAFG mixture. All of the properties of FAFG follow some kind of changing rule except at the turning point when FLA particle is of 0.125~0.25 mm in size. To explain clearly the root cause of FLA particle size effect on FAFG, SEM, and XRD are employed to explore the microstructure of FAFG and the component of FLA. It turns out to be the amorphous phase SiO 2 content in FLA of different particle sizes which could determine the reaction extent of FAFG mixture.",

In this method, the modified boehmite‐polyamide‐6 nanocomposites ( mB ‐ PA 6 NC s) were prepared under reflux condition and sonication subsequently. The prepared novel NC s were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT ‐ IR ), X‐ray diffraction ( XRD ), field‐emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE ‐ SEM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) techniques. Thermo‐gravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed an increase in onset of decomposition temperature for the NC s to that of pristine polyamide‐6. Furthermore, as the amount of mB was increased the onset of decomposition temperature shifts more toward higher temperatures. However, TEM images of mB ‐ PA 6 NC s display exactly and clearly that mB particles are present in the quantum dots scale in PA 6 matrix.",

ENR from renewable natural crop resources is a type of green material with potential to partially substitute or replace and toughen petrochemical-based polymers. Nanocomposites (epoxy resin/ENR/fillers nanoparticles) were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscope (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Comparison of characterized and mechanical properties of nanofiller reinforced with both nanocellulose and nanosilica were studied. The nanocomposites were characterized for their mechanical properties (e.g., impact strength, tensile strength) and thermal degradation behaviour by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Mechanical property investigation results show that, the impact strength of nanocomposites, can be improved by blending in ENR 50 mixed with nanofiller, relative to the baseline nanocomposite mixers. The nanofiller loading in epoxy composite showed the highest improvement in mechanical properties at 0.75 phr (parts per hundred of resin). Effects of accelerated weathering aging were evaluated, and the observed changes were larger with nanosilica than with nanocellulose filler. Here, the accelerated aging increase in tensile properties was found to be 10% after 14 days in both nanofillers, while the other mechanical properties did not change significantly. These nanocomposites are expected to have high wear rates limiting their service life.",

To obtain real-time and accurate estimations of Mooney viscosity, a novel soft sensor method, referred to as multimodal perturbation- (MP-) based ensemble just-in-time learning Gaussian process regression (MP-EJITGPR), is proposed by exploiting ensemble JIT learning. This method employs perturbations on similarity measure and input variables for generating the diversity of JIT learners. Furthermore, a set of accurate and diverse JIT learners are built through an evolutionary multiobjective optimization by balancing the accuracy and diversity objectives explicitly. Moreover, all base JIT learners are combined adaptively using a finite mixture mechanism. The proposed method is applied to an industrial rubber mixing process for Mooney viscosity prediction, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over traditional soft sensor methods.",

Poly vinyl rubber material has been taken, and the specimens are prepared for testing the tensile properties and hardness. The specimens were prepared by using die with various temperatures and curing time. Sixteen specimens were prepared by changing the curing temperature, curing time, postcuring temperature, and postcuring time. The curing temperature 150°C and 170°C, postcuring temperature 100°C and 50°C, curing time 14 mins and 18 mins, postcuring time 120 mins and 60 mins, and the pressure of 150 kg/cm2 for all the specimens were maintained. The tensile strength and hardness analysis were done as per the ASTM standard, and it was found that the specimen prepared on 150°C curing temperature, 18 min curing time, 50°C postcuring temperature, and 120 min postcuring time provides the higher tensile strength. DOE analysis is also done to determine the best values of the factors impacting the mechanical characteristics of the seal material. Simple regression analysis is used to find the influence of curing temperature and curing time on the tensile strength and hardness for every 1°C temperature rise and 1 sec curing time.",

This paper describes a simple solution casting process for recycling postconsumed footwear leather fiber (PCF) into a biocomposite film reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). PVP was utilized as a compatibilizer to strengthen the interfacial bonding of GO and leather fiber via π–π interactions. UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the material dispersibility bonding between GO and PCF, structural properties, thermal properties, and surface morphology of the biocomposite films, respectively. Compared to pure PCF film, the oxygen transmission rate of the prepared biocomposite films is elevated by 64% as well as the biodegradability rate is intensified up to 60%. In addition, the film’s tensile strengths are raised by 216%, while their elongation at break is increased by 164.64% as compared with PCF. The versatility of these eco-friendly and biodegradable composite films extends to its possible applications in packaging and interior design.

Twenty-four commercial HDPE resins were analyzed in terms of their shear and extensional flow properties, extrudate swell characteristics, and melt strength. The resins had varying molecular weight characteristics and were produced using a variety of polymerization technologies (gas, slurry, and solution phase). It was found that shear viscosity is not only influenced by the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PI), but also technology dependent, irrespective of molecular characteristics. Increasing Mw was found to increase both shear and extensional viscosity, while increasing PI by increasing the concentration of smaller molecules increases the tendency of the resin to shear thin. In relating melt strength and temperature sensitivity of shear viscosity to molecular parameters, resins had to be grouped according to ranges of PI < 8, 8. < PI < 10, and PI > 10. Moreover, it was possible to relate melt strength to the Hencky strain obtained from creep experiments and to the melt index of the resins. Finally, it was found that extrudate swell behavior and melt strength are important parameters to be considered during parison formation, as observed during blow-molding experiments. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The influence of composition and melt drawing is examined. A novel methodology based on the form factor of the dispersed particle was used to estimate the equivalent spherical particle size of dispersed thermoplastic starch (TPS). This approach allows for the quantitative comparison of average dispersed phase particles regardless of their shape. Blends prepared in the one‐step extrusion process show increased levels of anisotropy as a consequence of a combination of coalescence and particle deformation during melt drawing. Reprocessed materials demonstrate morphologies that are highly stable to a wide range of hot stretch ratio conditions. The TPS particles of reprocessed blends show no coalescence and a low degree of deformation. This phenomenon is explained by plasticizer evaporation resulting from the second processing step. The TPS is transformed from a highly deformable phase to one resembling a partially cross‐linked material. These data indicate that the one‐step processing of LDPE/TPS blends can be used to generate a wide range of highly elongated morphological structures. A two‐step approach, analogous to typical compounding and shaping operations and involving controlled glycerol removal in the second step can be used to prepare a wide range of highly stable, more isotropic, dispersed particle morphologies. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract An understanding of flow behaviour of polymer melts through a slit die is extremely important for optimizing die design and, consequently, for die performance in processing polymer sheets and films. In view of the complex nature and the physical properties of polymer melts as well as of die geometries, such as coat‐hanger dies, no simple mathematical formulae can be used to compute the flow regimes within dies. This paper illustrates the development of a three‐dimensional (3‐D) computer model of an example of a coat‐hanger die design using the computational fluid dynamics package, FIDAP, based on the finite element method. A difference of only 3.7% was found when comparing the velocity distribution at the die exit obtained from the 3‐D simulation with that calculated using a two‐dimensional analytical design procedure, indicating that full 3‐D analysis seems to be unnecessary. However it has been shown that unwanted flow phenomena and production problems can be ameliorated by means of visualization and the detailed information obtained from computer simulations. Comparative simulation results with polymers of different rheological properties in the same die are also described. The comprehensive analyses provide a means of interpretation for flow behavior, which allows modification of the die geometry for optimal design. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many methods have been proposed for RTD determination but there are some drawbacks associated with each; they are expensive, hazardous, time consuming, or lacking sensitivity. A novel ultrasonic technique, sensitive to the filler concentration of polymer suspensions, is proposed. Ultrasonic properties (ultrasonic velocity and attenuation) were evaluated with regard to parameters such as linearity of the response, resolution of the measurement, and especially robustness to pressure and temperature variations. The attenuation, chosen for RTD evaluation along with a specific grade of calcium carbonate filler as the tracer, was then monitored to yield the RTD of the material in a twin-screw extruder, for different experimental conditions where quantity of filler utilized, as well as the method used to feed it, were changed in order to optimize the technique. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (TLCPs) are being widely investigated for their potential as “blend additives” in the 5 to 30% composition range for thermoplastic resins. Motivation for this activity stems from the desire to impart some of the remarkable qualities of TLCPs to the host resin, including enhanced processing and self reinforcement. The barriers inhibiting this technology include high TLCP resin costs, absence of specialized processing equipment, and blend brittleness. These and other barriers are expected to decline as the technology evolves. In the meantime, TLCP blends are expected to find usage in high value added niche applications, where current barriers are not controlling and where their prices can be justified on the basis of performance. The market potential for several TLCP/thermoplastic polymer blends in film and fiber applications are explored. Film and fiber blends are believed to have high potential for near term technical and commercial success. The incentives for development appear to lie primarily with host resin suppliers and device fabricators, and not with TLCP suppliers. The former are expected to benefit from improved consumption and sales resulting from improved resin system and device performance.",

The analysis is based on the lubrication approximation theory (LAT), which treats the flow locally as fully developed. A Newton‐Raphson iterative scheme is employed to solve the equations for a pressure‐driven flow of N number of layers ( N ⩽ 11). For a given total flow rate and flow rate ratios (or correspondingly total sheet thickness and individual layer thicknesses), the solution provides the interface locations and individual pressure drops that each extruder has to supply. The shear stresses at the channel walls are checked as a criterion for proper design. The die design or melt combinations are altered to produce smooth shear stresses with no humps or discontinuities at the points of confluence. A Adiabatic temperature rises are also computed based on the pressure drops in the system. Such an analysis provides a quick qualitative as well as quantitative insight into the proper design and melt combinations for multilayer sheet coextrusion.",

In this work, carbon fiber composites through gamma radiation polymerization of epoxy matrices have been produced for aerospace and advanced automotive applications. Composite samples were produced by irradiation at room temperature using different radiation doses and, as reference, thermal curing of the same epoxy resin formulations was also carried out. Furthermore, some irradiated samples were subjected to postirradiation thermal curing to complete the polymerization reactions. The properties of the cured materials were studied by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and mechanical flexural tests. Also the effect of moisture absorption on the thermal properties was investigated. The results indicate that irradiation at room temperature gives rise to different cross‐link densities of the epoxy matrix depending on the total absorbed dose. Postirradiation thermal treatment makes the materials more “homogeneous,” resulting also in a higher glass transition temperature. Moreover, thermal analysis performed on irradiated samples, cut in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the fibers, has shown fiber‐‐matrix interactions that are less intensive in comparison to thermally cured samples. The water absorption data show a plasticization effect of moisture on the epoxy matrix, causing a significant reduction of T g . Flexural tests reveal a marked effect of postirradiation thermal curing on the less cross‐linked samples, reflecting the higher efficiency of the thermal treatment on more mobile reactive species. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The kriging surrogate model is a statistics‐based interpolated technique that provides the approximate functional relationship between warpage and factors that influence warpage. In this study, it is used to be first trained by—and later replaced—the full‐fledged, time‐consuming numerical simulation in the optimization process. Based on this surrogate model, an adaptive iteration scheme that takes into account the predicted uncertainty is performed to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model while finding the optimum solution. The optimization process starts with a small number of initial training sample points and then adds additional key points during iterations by evaluating the correlations among the candidate points. As an example of validation and application, optimization of geometric dimensions and processing parameters for a box‐shape part with different and stepwise wall thicknesses has been performed.

The case design and matching have been described in detail, and four case adaptation strategies have been discussed. The ideology of fuzzy inference based on expert knowledge and practical experience reflects the test moldings for defects correction and process parameters optimization. Therefore, a fuzzy inference model was built for the correction and optimization process. Its key implementation techniques, such as fuzzification and defuzzification strategies, fuzzy rules definition, membership functions, etc, have been discussed.

Both techniques proved to be equally efficient in promoting the system's crosslinking, as evaluated by 29 Si MAS‐NMR. The MW‐assisted curing, however, was much faster. Photoelasticity analysis showed that MW‐assisted curing causes localized overheating of the samples, inducing a state of residual plane stresses that bring about dimensional instability of the coated material. Instrumented scratch tests for the coated samples revealed an increase of 1 order of magnitude in the minimal load at which a scratch track appears on the sample surface. However, the friction coefficient values for samples with thermally cured coatings were lower than those produced by MW‐assisted curing. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Taguchi method was used as a powerful experimental design tool for synthesis optimization. A series of superabsorbent hydrogels was synthesized by proposed conditions of Qualitek‐4 software. Considering the results of nine trials according to analysis of variance, optimum conditions were proposed. The swelling behavior of optimum superabsorbent hydrogels was studied in various solutions, with pH values ranging from 1 to 13. In addition, swelling kinetics, swelling in various organic solvents, the absorbency under load, and on–off switching behavior were investigated. Also, hydrogel formation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Surface morphology of the synthesized hydrogels was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A high‐performance Monte Carlo simulation, which takes diffusion‐controlled and chain‐length‐dependent termination into account, is developed to thoroughly simulate the kinetics of free radical and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene. The average termination rate constant greatly decreases during ATRP; nonetheless, it is almost independent of conversion and smaller in free radical polymerization (FRP). Polymer chains are entirely initiated at the beginning of the ATRP, whereas initiation of chains continues over the course of the FRP. The dead polymers are much lower in the concentration in ATRP too. In addition, unlike FRP, the rate of initiation decreases quickly at the beginning of the ATRP and amounts to zero. Besides, molecular weight linearly increases with conversion in the ATRP. Moreover, molecular weight distribution shifts toward higher molecular weight in the ATRP system, whereas that of free‐radically generated polymers remains intact throughout the reaction. Finally, the simulation results correspond closely to the experimental data. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 30: 257–268, 2011; View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, flexible polyurethane (PU) nanocomposite foams were prepared by in situ polymerization. The effects of incorporation of nanoparticles on the morphological and structural developments and the relation between this development and mechanical properties of the PU foam were demonstrated. The effects of three different contents (low, moderate, and high) of nanoclay and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) loading on foam morphology, structure, kinetics of foaming reactions, and mechanical properties were separately investigated. By adding MWNTs and nanoclay in foams, the foam morphology improved, in which cell density increased and smaller cells were obtained. The mechanical properties of foam especially tensile strength have been increased in the presence of nanoparticles. With enhancing the nanoclay content, the tensile strength of nanocomposite foam has improved but in the case of MWNTs contrary effects were observed. An increase in nanoparticle amount leads to a lower cell density. In general, the incorporation of both nanoparticles (nanoclay and MWNTs) in the foam structure leads to a lower foaming reaction rate that affects mechanical properties of foams. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recycled aged acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) does not recover the impact strength of virgin ABS mainly due to polybutadiene degradation or the presence of flame retardants (FR). So, ABS/PC (polycarbonate) blends were elaborated to obtain a recycled material with resilience at least equivalent to neat ABS and within the range of composition of real waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) deposits. ABS/PC blends were first made from virgin polymers to reach optimal processability and composition. Performing Charpy impact strength tests and morphological studies allowed us to evaluate influence of extrusion temperature and PC content on blends. Experimental results indicate that the impact strength of ABS/PC blends is higher when morphology is fibrillar‐like or co‐continuous. A virgin ABS FR /PC blend (70/30) with an impact strength greater than neat ABS has been obtained. But, with an equivalent composition, this result is not reached for recycled blends. So, to achieve efficient blends rich in recycled ABS, compatibilization is necessary. Recycled ABS/PC (70/30) blends compatibilized with 5% PP‐ g ‐MA prove to be more resilient than virgin ABS. However, a compatibilizing agent has a limited efficiency when it is used in the presence of a FR or subjected to a high residence time during injection. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The ohmic and rectifier contacts were thermally formed by annealing them in an evaporating system. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/(Co–Ni) nanofiber film was used as an interfacial layer between metal‐semiconductor. After the PVA/(Co–Ni) acetate was obtained, the nanofiber film was fabricated on silicon wafer using electrospinning technique. The dielectric properties of Au/PVA (Co,Ni‐doped)/ n ‐Si SDs were investigated in the gate voltage range of −1.5 to +1.5 V, before and after various illumination levels at 1 MHz. The dielectric constant (ε′, dielectric loss (ε″), dielectric loss tangent (tanδ, the ac electrical conductivity (σ ac ), and the real and imaginary parts of electric modulus ( M ′ and M ″) were obtained from the measured capacitance and conductance values. Experimental results show that the values of the dielectric parameters in dark and under illumination were different from each other. Also, these parameters were found to be functions of illumination intensity and gate voltage. Such illumination level‐related behavior of dielectric parameters can be explained on the basis of Maxwell–Wagner interfacial polarization and restructuring and reordering of the charges at the interface states. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article reports on mechanical and slurry abrasion response of a new class of material developed by reinforcement of blast furnace slag ( BFS ) in needle‐punched nonwoven polyester fabric epoxy composites. These epoxy‐based composites are prepared by the hand‐lay‐up technique with the variation of BFS content (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt. %) and at constant fiber loading. It is observed that the mechanical properties of the composites are improved significantly with the incorporation of filler. However, the properties like tensile, flexural and inter‐laminar shear strength are reduced beyond 10 wt. % of filler loading. Abrasive wear behavior of these composites is studied in the slurry environment by a slurry abrasion test rig ( ASTM G105). The specific wear rate of composites under a steady‐state condition with respect to normal load and sliding velocity is found to decrease with the increase in filler loading. Further, experimental design through Taguchi's L 16 orthogonal array is applied to determine the optimal parametric combination which reduces the wear rate. The parametric combination among sliding velocity of 0.93 m/s, normal load of 30 N, sliding distance of 600 m, silica sand size of 100 μm and filler loading of 5 wt. %, produces an optimum specific wear rate. The morphological study is conducted on abraded composite surfaces by using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and possible wear mechanisms responsible for wear have been discussed.",

It was found that incorporation of geopolymer particles significantly affected the cure characteristics and the mechanical properties. That is, faster curing was observed due to acceleration by metal oxide impurities. It was also found that 100% modulus and tensile strength increased with the addition of 10 phr GP . This is attributed to the physical interactions of GP particles with NR molecules. In addition, the Payne effect and improved thermal stability were also observed in the GP ‐filled NR composites.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, a new type of benzaldehyde‐based bisphenol ( BPBA ) was successfully synthesized which in turn was converted into a structurally modified and moderately low‐temperature‐cure benzoxazine ( BPBA ‐Bz) using three different amino compounds (aniline, allyl amine, and furfuryl amine) and formaldehyde at appropriate conditions. The molecular structure of these benzoxazines was confirmed by FTIR , 1 H NMR , and 13 C NMR . The curing behavior and thermal stability of the benzoxazines were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetric and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Data obtained from thermal analysis infer that the synthesized benzoxazines were found to possess a comparatively lower cure temperature ( T p ) and enhanced glass transition temperature ( T g ), thermal stability, and char yield than those of conventional benzoxazines. In addition, the influencing effect of catalysts on the reduction in curing temperature of benzoxazines was studied with different phenolic compounds viz 4‐hydroxyphenyl maleimide, imidazole core bisphenol, and monohydroxy imidazole ( MHI ) to utilize them in the form of adhesives, sealants, encapsulants, and matrices with other substrates for different applications. Among the different catalysts used, MHI was found to be the most efficient in reducing the cure temperature which brings down the polymerization temperature to 171°C from 229°C. Further, the effect of improvement of thermal stability and flame retardant behavior were studied by blending bismaleimide‐based cross‐linkers namely 4, 4′‐diaminodiphenylsulfone‐based bismaleimide ( BMI ‐S) and 4, 4′‐diaminodiphenylmethane‐based bismaleimide ( BMI ‐M). From the data resulted, it is concluded that the blends of structurally modified BPBA ‐based benzoxazines with BMI possess an significantly improved thermal stability and char yield than those of conventional benzoxazines and can be conveniently used in the form of encapsulants, sealants, adhesives, and matrices in the fields of automobile and microelectronic applications for better performance and improved longevity.",

Complex knowledge of their properties and behavior is needed to take full advantage of the application of these materials. This study focuses on the relationship between the polymeric matrix properties and the process of creating the conductive network within a composite. Two types of composites, based on low‐density polyethylene ( LDPE ) and poly(ethylene‐co‐vinyl acetate) ( EVA ), filled with 10–20 wt% of conductive carbon black, have been prepared. Resulting composite samples have been subjected to different tests, including uniaxial drawing test, rotational rheology, and dielectric spectroscopy in order to evaluate the relationship between their composition and properties. It has been observed that creation of the filler network is easier in case of more linear and polar EVA matrix, whereas electrical and rheological percolation threshold values are higher in the case of the composites containing branched LDPE matrices. Therefore, it can be concluded that the process of creation of conductive filler network and the pattern of changes of mechanical, rheological, and electrical properties are vastly influenced by the inherent properties of the polymeric matrix, that is, its branching level and polarity.",

Due to its high toxicity to human, there is a need to develop an efficient and low‐cost method to detect it in aquatic environment. A sensor of nitrated polyethersulfone (PES‐NO 2 ) doped with ZnYNiO nanocomposites was successfully fabricated. PES‐NO 2 was synthesized in this study using H 2 SO 4 : HNO 3 while ZnYNiO nanoparticles were fabricated using wet‐chemical technique under low temperature and basic condition. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis did confirm the interactions between the doped nanoparticles and nitro functions grafted on PES backbone. The developed polymeric nanocomposite (PES‐NO 2 ‐ZnYNiO) was then used as a superb coating sensor for As 3+ . The working electrode of desire heavy metal ion sensor was fabricated by glassy carbon electrode (GCE) coated with PES‐NO 2 ‐ZnYNiO nanocomposites as layer of thin film. To estimate the cationic sensor performances, a calibration curve obtained from current versus electrolyte (selective As 3+ ion) concentration relation was plotted. The linearity of calibration curve is found over the linear dynamic range (LDR) of 0.1 nM~0.1 mM. The slope of calibration curve is used to measure the sensitivity and detection limit (DL) of As 3+ cation sensor, and these are 9.8101 μA μM −1 cm −2 and 96.77 ± 4.84 pM, respectively. Therefore, the As 3+ ion sensor is found as selective with good sensitivity, reproducible with high accuracy, validated in real environmental samples, long‐term stability in aqueous medium, and highly active with short response time.",

Microstructures of nanocomposites and their mechanical properties were investigated. Their thermal behavior was analyzed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetry analyzer. Results show that the layer spacing of clay in the nanocomposites was improved. Observed from transmission electron microscopy photomicrographs, it was shown that the clay was dispersed more homogeneously in the nanocomposites compounded with Sc‐CO 2 . DSC traces show that cold crystallization appeared for nanocomposites, indicating that clay could act as a nucleating agent. Sc‐CO 2 was helpful in improving the thermal stability of nanocomposites. In addition, there existed a yielding phenomenon for nanocomposites during the tensile property measurement.

    "abstract": "Abstract This work presents a method to prepare a new class of polydiacetylene (PDA)/SiO 2 nanocomposites for colorimetric indicator applications. The silica concentration is 5 wt% of the diacetylene monomer, 10,12‐pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA). Under ultraviolet light irradiation, PCDA vesicle/silica nanocomposites were formed and an intense blue solution was obtained. The silica nanoparticles can improve chromic properties of molecules. The color transition of PDA/silica nanocomposites can change from blue (λ max ∼ 640 nm) to red (λ max ∼ 540 nm), which is irreversible when stored at different temperatures and time. This study investigated characterization of the aqueous suspension compared with pure PDA vesicles in the absorption spectra. Moreover, the color response was calculated. This is an efficient method for preparation of the colorimetric sensor of nanocomposite materials after UV irradiation. The PDA/5 wt% silica nanocomposites aqueous matrix would potentially be developed as a new colorimetric polymeric indicator to study the effect of temperature and time. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique were applied for characterization. The hydrogels, the semi‐interpenetrating polymer networks (semi–IPNs), and the hybrid composite hydrogel systems that were synthesized in this study have shown high water absorbency. Some swelling and diffusion properties were calculated, and they were discussed for the hybrid hydrogel systems prepared under various formulations. They were used in experiments on sorption of water‐soluble cationic dye such as Safranin T (ST). The sorption of ST into the polymeric systems was studied by a batch sorption technique at 25°C. For equilibrium sorption studies, dye removal capacity, adsorption percentage, and partition coefficient of the hydrogels, the semi‐IPNs, and the hybrid composite hydrogel systems are investigated. Consequently, the hydrogels, the semi‐IPNs, and the hybrid composite hydrogel systems developed in this study could serve as a potential device for water and dye sorbents. Some materials such as the hydrogels, the semi‐IPNs, and the hybrid composite hydrogel systems developed in this study with the ability to absorb water in high amounts could be used as a water and dye sorbents because of their potential applications in agriculture, environment, separation processes, and water purification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Composites of polypropylene (PP) with nontreated nanosilica at different particle sizes are prepared, and their viscoelastic properties are studied by dynamic strain‐ and frequency‐sweep experiments. It is clear that incorporation of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix due to the huge specific surface area enhances both moduli so that the storage modulus is intensified more than loss modulus. The specific surface area of a particles increases as a particle size decreases, leading to a stronger tendency to form reinforcing structures. In nanocomposites of smaller particles due to existence of a larger contact area between particles, more and stronger filler clusters are formed. Thus, a stronger filler‐‐filler network is formed by decreasing the particle size so that both storage and loss moduli present higher values. The slope of dynamic moduli as a function of frequency decreases with filler loading augmentation in a low‐frequency region, and this solid‐like behavior becomes more significant with particle size reduction. The PP composites in high filler loadings exhibit a yield stress, and weight fraction corresponds to the onset of this well‐defined yield stress and is lower in the case of smaller filler particles. In addition, the polymer chains adsorption on the particles and/or clusters surface and formation of filler‐‐polymer network increases with filler loading augmentation. The influence of these two reinforcing mechanisms leads to a gradual enhancement of the Payne effect and the solid‐like behavior in strain‐ and frequency‐sweep experiments, respectively. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The inclusion complexes formed by surfactant (S) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) can associate with hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (HPAM) in aqueous solution, and subsequently establish the SAP network, which exhibits advanced viscoelasticity at the optimum molar ratio (S:β‐CD = 2:1). Furthermore, this system presents enhanced surface activity and superior mechanical and thermal stability, as well as tolerance to elevated brine salinity and hardness due to the network “interlocking effect”. Sandpack flood tests suggest the excellent mobility control ability of this system during polymer flooding, and also a moderate permeability reduction capacity, which makes it more cost effective in oil fields than the currently used HPAM. Regarding EOR performance, this polymeric system (SAP) produced approximately 19% more incremental oil than the baseline HPAM under the same experimental conditions.",

Thereafter, the structural, morphological, and magnetic properties of the nanocomposite were studied by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and thermogravimetric analysis, and nanocomposites were further used for the removal of metal ions from aqueous solutions. The adsorption capacity of self-doped nanoadsorbent toward Cu(II), Cd(II), Co(II), and Cr(III) was investigated through batch adsorption techniques, and the extent of adsorption was measured as a function of pH, initial metal ion concentration, and contact time. It was found that the metal ion removal reached maximum at pH 8.0 and remained constant after 60 min. Experimental data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson, and Temkin equation models with the maximum adsorption capacity calculated as 294, 285.71, 277.7, and 285.7 mg⋅g−1 from the Langmuir isotherm for Cu(II), Cd(II), Co(II), and Cr(III), respectively. The kinetic study was carried out through pseudo–first-order, pseudo–second-order, Elovich kinetic, and intraparticle diffusion models in which the related correlation coefficient for each kinetic model showed that the pseudo–second-order rate equation was better described by the adsorption process. The four-probe conductivity measurement technique revealed that metal ion adsorption resulted in a rather significant enhancement of conductivity with a 100 order of magnitude increment for the supermagnetic nanoadsorbent due to charge delocalization of absorbed metal ions.",

The decomposition behavior of P( BBMS ) was thermally investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). For thermal decomposition kinetics of poly( BBMS ), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method was applied to thermogravimetry curves. The first step, which is one of the two decomposition stages, is comprehensively related to elimination of hydrogen bromide and the other step is related to a multi‐step process. The activation energy ( E a ) of thermal decomposition of the first step and 50% weight loss is 148.5 and 190.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The results showed that the side group elimination without chain breaking comprehensively proceeded at lower temperature, and at progressive temperatures subsequently the specific chain scission did so. Degradation of poly( BBMS ) did not lead to depolymerization. 1 H, 13 C‐ NMR , and FT ‐ IR analyses showed that the decomposition products during degradation of poly( BBMS ) to 260°C were comprehensively HB r and methacrylic acid.

The AC dielectric measurements of poly( BBMS ) were investigated up to 70°C between 100 Hz and 20 kH z depending on the alternating current conductivities. The dipolar functional groups (C–O, C=O, and Br) of the BBMS segment possesses significantly affect the dielectric constant. Also, the activation energy profile of different graphene/poly( BBMS ) composites were revealed by measuring DC conductivity of individual composite material.",

The effect of resin modification on mechanical, thermal, and physical properties of Vinyl ester/Abaca ( VE / AF ) composite was examined. HMDS resin modified composite showed an improvement in the mechanical and flame retardant properties when compared to the pristine composite due to the formation of siloxane bonding which is compatible with the functional groups of both the matrix and the fabric.

After inputting the exported data of the flow field from POLYFLOW , the self‐developed code was further used to characterize the mixing behavior at a finite time under different rotation speeds of the screw elements. A novel mapping method was proposed to convert the instantaneous flow field at the initial time point into the velocity field at any time point. Advection evolution of passive particle groups was simulated by a fourth‐order Runge–Kutta tracking method, and the corresponding variance index was also calculated. The effect of screw rotation speed on distributive mixing was examined. The results showed that the mixing was highly dependent on the initial position whether the particle groups were first placed close to or far away from the intermeshing zone.",

However, elastic modulus and tensile strength were improved by increasing the shot size. The effect of mold temperature and injection velocity was secondary. Higher levels of mold temperature and injection rate provided finer cell morphologies, but their effects on the elastic modulus and tensile strength were negligible.

The influence of gamma radiation on the properties of the blend ( PS / PEVA ) membrane was investigated. The irradiated samples showed an increase in the degree of crystallinity due to the presence of additional chemical bonds as observed by X‐ray diffraction. As a result of irradiation, the miscibility of the two polymer matrix is enhanced by interfacial adhesion between the components in the blend polymer without any voids as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, electrical conductivity in the blend ( PS / PEVA ) membrane was enhanced by introducing SO 3 H groups. Sulfonation process converts the blend from noncontact (5 × 10 −8 S cm −1 ) to semi‐contact (3.8 × 10 −3 S cm −1 ) by AC current at wet condition, and this can find applications in the fuel cells.",

Dielectric permittivity, dissipation factor and thermal conductivity of the Al/ SR increase with increasing the filler content. The dissipation factors still remain at a low level at high filler content because of the insulating alumina shell on the surface of core Al. Decrease in particle size and surface modification of Al can increase the dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity of the Al/ SR composites. Compared with spherical Al/ SR , the flaky Al/ SR composites present higher dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity. Dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity of the Al/carbon fiber ( CF )/ SR composites reach 72.1 and 2.01 W/m K at 75 wt% of the total filler content, respectively, suggesting that the ternary composites has potential applications in electromechanical actuators because of their high dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity but low dissipation factor, and good elasticity.",

The ultimate properties of the blend vulcanizate depend on a three‐dimensional network structure formed during vulcanization which relies mainly on the accelerator and the vulcanizing system used during compounding. The effect of monosulfide, disulfide, and poly sulfide cross‐links, which primarily gets controlled by different accelerators such as N‐cyclohexyl‐benzothiazyl‐sulfenamide ( CBS ), tetramethylthiuram disulfide, 2‐mercaptobenzothiazol, and N‐tert‐butyl‐2‐benzothiazyl‐sulfonamide on mechanical, thermal, and dielectric behavior of the blend vulcanizates, was studied. The results indicate that the semi‐efficient CBS vulcanizate has superior mechanical and thermal properties. Therefore, the effect of accelerator to sulfur ratio, that is, (accelerator/sulfur) on the properties of the blend vulcanizates was determined. It is to highlight that a distinctive correlation is observed between the cross‐link types and the fraction of immobilized polymer chains of the blend vulcanizates. Further, the effect of cross‐link types on segmental dynamics of the blend vulcanizates was studied through broadband dielectric spectroscopy.

However, they also generate non‐biodegradable waste which causes environmental pollutions. Therefore, a new material is expected to accelerate the degradation of packaging materials, making them naturally degraded and keeping the excellent properties meanwhile. One solution to address this problem is using hybrid biocomposites that are made of traditional polymer matrices, biodegradable polymers, and nanofiller using a melt‐blending process. Polylactic acid is added for dispersion phase and polypropylene is used as a matrix, during which maleic anhydride is used as a compatibilizer and nano‐TiO 2 is added as fillers. The melt‐blending process is used to make the materials into biodegradable composite films with functions in terms of UV resistance and water barrier properties. The composite films are tested for different properties in order to obtain the optimal amount of nano‐TiO 2 . The test results show that comparing to the control group that contains 0 wt% nano‐TiO 2 , adding 1 wt% nano‐TiO 2 improves the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the functional hybrid biocomposite films by 22% and 31%, respectively. The thermal resistance of hybrid biocomposite films is superior under 400°C. In addition, the functional hybrid biocomposite films have a UV transmittance that is less than 1%. After exposure to the medium waves ( UVB ) for 144 hr, the functional hybrid biocomposite films have tensile strength retention of 84.61%. The water contact angle of hybrid biocomposite films with 1 wt% nano‐TiO 2 is 112.7°, showing good water barrier property.",

In present work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced into PLLA scaffolds fabricated via selective laser sintering. It was found that the crystallinity of PLLA increased considerably since CNTs could promote the orderly stacking of its molecular chains, thereby improving the mechanical strength of PLLA scaffold. Furthermore, the fracture surface analysis revealed that CNTs acted as a bridge across the cracks and hindered their further expansion. Moreover, CNTs pulled out from the matrix to consume a large amount of fracture energy, which enhanced the resistance to external forces. As a consequence, the compressive strength, Vickers hardness and tensile strength of the scaffold were enhanced by 22.7%, 58.8% and 17.6%, respectively. Besides, the cells exhibited good attachment, spreading and proliferation on the scaffold. This study demonstrated that PLLA/CNTs scaffold was a promising candidate as bone implant.",

The surface energy lowest value 58 mJ/m2 and highest value 72 mJ/m2 were calculated for PSM20 and PSM50, respectively, by the Chibowski approach and Young equation. Sample PSM50 has exhibited the highest antibacterial activities, i.e., 18 mm and 19 mm, against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, by the disk diffusion method. Copolymer PSM50 has shown minimum algal adhesion for Dictyosphaerium algae as observed by optical microscopy. This lower bacterial and algal adhesion is attributed to higher concentrations of anionic SPMA monomer that cause electrostatic repulsion between functional groups of the polymer and microorganisms. Thus, the resultant PSM50 product has exhibited good potential for optronics shielding application in aquatic medium and medical diagnostics.",

To improve the mechanical and thermal properties of this material, in this research, PU foam was reinforced with aniline-modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectrum of modified MWCNTs showed the aniline was grafted on the surface of MWCNTs through the appearance of –NH2 stretches. The effect of MWCNTs with and without modification on the density, porosity, compressive strength, and heat conductivity of PU/MWCNT foam nanocomposites was investigated. The dispersibility of MWCNTs in the PU matrix was enhanced after modification with aniline. Compressive strength of PU nanocomposite reached the highest value after adding 3 wt.% of modified MWCNTs into PU foam. Besides, the water uptake of PU nanocomposites using 3 wt.% of MWCNTs was decreased to 13.4% as compared to that using unmodified MWCNTs. The improvement in thermal conductivity of PU/aniline-modified MWCNT nanocomposite was observed due to the change in the cellular size of PU foam in the presence of MWCNTs as shown by SEM images.",

    "abstract": "High-density polyethylene (HDPE)/carbon black (CB) is widely used in positive temperature coefficient (PTC) composites. In order to expand its applications to fields that need good flexibility, polyolefin elastomer (POE) was incorporated into HDPE/CB composites as a secondary thermoplastic elastomer phase to provide flexibility. The effects of POE and CB content on the PTC performance and flexibility were investigated. Micro morphology and crystallization behavior are closely related to PTC properties. SEM was conducted to reveal phase morphology and filler dispersion, and DSC was conducted to research crystallization behavior. The results show that the incorporation of 18 wt.% POE can decrease the percolation threshold of conductive carbon black from 22.5 wt.% to 16 wt.%. When the CB content is 30 wt.%, the room temperature resistivity gradually increases with the increasing content of POE because of the barrier effect of POE phase, and the PTC intensity is gradually enhanced. Meanwhile, the PTC switching temperature shifts down to a lower temperature. The incorporation of 18 wt.% POE significantly increases the elongation at break, reaching an ultrahigh value of 980 wt.%, which means great flexibility has been achieved in HDPE/POE/CB composites. This work provides a new method of fabricating PTC composites with balanced electrical and mechanical properties.",

The effects of the filler types, morphologies, particle sizes, and volume fractions on the UV curing characteristics of the slurry and dielectric properties of cured composites are systematically analyzed. The experimental results show that spherical fillers with large particle sizes, smooth surfaces, and high permittivity are conducive for reducing the slurry viscosity, increasing curing depth and adjusting the composite’s permittivity over a wide range.

After a certain time, the load was withdrawn and the strain recovery was followed with time. Although the deformational behavior of such material is conventionally described by the Burger model consisting of elastic, viscoelastic, and viscous components, in the present work, it is shown that the whole creep recovery process is reversible and is described by three viscoelastic components connected in series. Depending on the relative value of the observation and the relaxation times, the viscoelastic components appear pseudo- elastic or viscous. It is found that the model parameters evaluated from the creep data fail to predict the recovery data in both the initial and the end phases, while those from the recovery data can partially reproduce the creep data (satisfactorily in the late phase and with high deviation in the initial phase). The model parameters vary with stress values, but with a good approximation, they could be averaged for a certain stress range to describe creep processes for a specified time period. The proposed model describes creep data better than the Finley and the Weibull models.",

Different amine catalysts have been tested to promote the reaction of DPHS with the epoxy oligomer. The cure kinetics of this chain‐extended oligomer, using an aliphatic amine (triethylene‐tetraamine, TETA) as hardener, has been studied with the aid of differential scanning calorimetry and compared with that of the standard stoichiometric epoxy/TETA formulation. For each formulation the activation energy of the curing reactions has been evaluated by the Kissinger method. The results of thermogravimetric and flammability tests indicate that DPHS promoted the formation of a char, leading to an improved fire resistance. Finally, a comparison of the thermal and mechanical properties of the standard stoichiometric formulation relative to those of the epoxy modified with DPHS, and cured with TETA, showed only marginal changes in the physical and mechanical properties. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The ground mixed plastics were first compounded and melt filtered in a counter‐rotating nonintermeshing twin‐screw extruder and then combined with different amounts of additives in a corotating intermeshing twin‐screw extruder. Additives included unmodified and maleated polyolefin elastomers and styrene/olefin block copolymers. Blends were analyzed for thermal and mechanical properties, and processability. The most effective modifier in terms of impact strength improvement was a styrenic block copolymer with very similar rheological characteristics to the commingled plastics matrix. The experimental observations were interpreted by considering the complex morphological features of the injection molded multicomponent, multiphase systems. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Activation energies and relaxation times for these processes have been determined, and characteristics of trapping sites have been calculated. The electret state induced in PP fibers by the corona discharge treatment holds for a long time (several months).

    "abstract": "Abstract Simulations of the injection‐compression molding (ICM) process based on a Leonov viscoelastic fluid model has been employed to study the effects of processing conditions on the birefringence development and distribution in injection‐compression molded parts. A numerical algorithm combined with a modified control‐volume/finite‐element method is developed to predict the melt front advancement and the distributions of pressure, temperature, and flow velocity dynamically during the injection melt‐filling, compression melt‐filling, and postfilling stages of the entire process. Part birefringence was then calculated from residual stresses following the thermal‐mechanical history of the entire molding process. Simulations of a disk part under different process conditions including compression speed, switch time from injection to compression, compression stroke, packing pressure, and postfilling time were performed to understand their effects on birefringence variation. The simulated results were also compared with those required by conventional injection molding (CIM). It has been found that an ICM part shows a significant reduction of part birefringence near the gate area as compared with CIM parts. However, ICM parts exhibit higher birefringence values near the rim of the disk. The minimum birefringence occurs around the location where injection is switched over to compression. Although longer postfilling time and higher packing pressure result in higher birefringence values, their effects are not very significant. On the other hand, higher compression speed, larger compression stroke, and shorter switch time exhibit greater effects on the increase of part birefringence. Flow‐induced residual stress is the major origin of birefringence formation in the present case. The simulated birefringence for both ICM and CIM parts show good coincidence with those obtained from measurements by using a digital photoelasticity technique. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A stress‐induced crystallization model for semicrystalline plastics is proposed based on the theory that stress‐induced orientation of molecules and chains increase the melting temperature of thermoplastics, and hence, the supercooling which is the driving force for crystallization. By assuming that the effect of stress on crystallization is only by increasing the melting temperature, the basic quiescent‐state crystallization equation can be directly applied to model stress‐induced crystallization kinetics. The model has a minimum of experimentally based constants. A simple experimental technique, such as a rotational rheometer, can be used to determine the melting temperature shift. The model predicts the most prominent features of stress‐induced crystallization. The main advantage of the model is that the parameters in the quiescent‐state crystallization model do not change. Consequently, the parameters in the melting temperature shift model are easy to determine, and unknown constants are kept to a minimum. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The steady state data at low rates of deformation followed the dynamic viscosity, η = η′, and at higher rates the complex viscosity η ≃ η * . In elongational tests strain hardening was observed for LDPE and some for HDPE. There was no strain hardening in flow of a standard LLDPE, and the equilibrium extensional viscosity η ≃ 3η′ in full range of deformation rates. In blends with ultrahigh molecular weight PE and with LLDPE strain hardening and an increase of the maximum strain at break, ε b , were found. Some newer types of LLDPEs and their homologous blends show the strain hardening behavior. A brief review of the methods of measurement of the flow properties of polyethylene (PE) melt is provided. The text is divided into three parts: (1) types of melt flow; (2) comparative rheology of polyethylenes; and (3) linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) blends. In the first part, the methods of measurement and correlation between the measured values are discussed. The steady state shearing, dynamic deformation, and uniaxial extensions are considered. In the second part rheological behavior of the three principal types of PEs, low density PE (LDPE), high density PE (HDPE), and LLDPE are presented.

Extensive capillary rheometer measurements for several polymers, and blown film fabrication studies for LLDPE, seem to support an earlier finding that slip in the die land region invariably accompanies the observed extrudate irregularities. Lack of strong chemical forces for adequate adhesion at the polymer/metal interface in the die land region appears to be primarily responsible for the initiation of slip. Improvements in adhesion, by proper choice of the materials of construction and/or adhesion promoters in the resin, virtually eliminate the rate limiting effects of melt fracture in commercial blown film processing, and provide substantial improvements in critical end‐use properties, with LLDPE.",

Agglomerate size distributions in thermoplastic matrices were measured using optical microscopy. The greatest problems in dispersing fillers were with the smallest particles. One unexpected result with the polystyrene compounds was that the number of large agglomerates of the smallest particles actually increased with time. This was associated with uncoated small CaCO 3 particles clinging to the chamber walls of the internal mixer and being only gradually incorporated. The phenomenon was less pronounced in the polypropylene compounds. Generally large agglomerates were broken down with increased mixing. Stearic acid coating reduced the number of large agglomerates.",

The simulation program deals with a three‐dimensional nonisothermal, non‐Newtonian flow with moving interfaces. The finite‐volume method is implemented to solve the governing equations, while a compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes (CICSAM) is used to track the advancing melt fronts. For parallel computing, the program implements the “greedy algorithm'' as the domain decomposition method to distribute the computational work equally among the different computational nodes, and the message passing interface is used to communicate and exchange information between the computational nodes. For the symmetric multiprocessing nodes, OpenMP directives are integrated in the application's loop constructions. This approach effectively improved the solution efficiency in terms of computational time and accuracy. Three‐dimensional mold filling examples, which were used to verify and validate the numerical implementation and to demonstrate its performance and capabilities, are presented. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a remarkable membrane material. Owing to its high‐melting point, PTFE fine powder cannot be processed using conventional melting processing methods. Instead, techniques such as paste extrusion, rolling, and sintering have to be employed. Each processing step has an important influence on the final pore size quality within the membrane. In this paper, a PID controller (proportional‐integral‐derivative controller) was used to improve the properties of PTFE paste during the extrusion process and the quality of the PTFE membrane. A range of lubricant content (18, 20, and 22 wt%) was used to monitor the pressure drop at different extrusion speeds (0.5, 1, and 2 mm/s) and reduction ratios (RR = 26.47, 47.06, 80.06). It was found that a higher lubricant content and a higher reduction ratio resulted in a lower pressure drop. It was also found that a higher stretching temperature tends to result in larger pore size and broader pore size distribution at the same stretching rate. At a monitored and controlled constant low‐extrusion speed, the porosity of PTFE membrane was increased from 38% to 55% and the mean pore size was decreased from 0.22 to 0.15 μm because of less migration and more uniform distribution of lubricant during extrusion. Properties and the associated property uniformity of the PTFE extrudate affect the subsequent membrane‐forming process and the final pore size and size distribution significantly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

After injection of the final formulation, which is a viscous liquid to an aqueous medium, it deforms to become a semisolid or solid matrix. The performance of this matrix was investigated on the basis of peptide release from it. Erosion and morphology of ISFI were also studied. The effects of adding 12.8% (w/w) ethyl benzoate (EB) as a rate‐modifying agent on performance, erosion, and morphology of ISFI were assessed. The implant containing EB showed very low burst release (5.53% ± 0.82%) and the morphology turns to closed pore‐like structures. After adding EB, the morphology turns to closed pore‐like structures. This type of morphology has very close relation to the performance of the implant as well. Finally, the effect of EB on performance, erosion, and morphology is explained by means of solvent–nonsolvent affinity, water permeation, and the rate of phase inversion. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Compositions with different amounts of modifiers were obtained and tested for their impact strength, flexural strength, and resistance to crack propagation. The latter was assessed by measuring the critical stress intensity factor in a three‐point bending mode. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the sample fracture surfaces. It was found that the addition of 2% montmorillonite or 5% polyamide resulted in the best improvement of the impact strength and the critical stress intensity factor relative to the unmodified epoxy resin. However, the flexural strength and toughness measured under three‐point bending mode was found to increase to a lesser extent. Hybrid compositions containing specific combinations of both modifier and nanofiller not only exhibited a higher impact strength and resistance to crack propagation but also displayed a synergistic effect in relation to the fracture energy. The results indicate that the improvement in mechanical properties of the epoxy resin was due to the formation of a heterogeneous morphology resulting from phase separation of the polymeric modifier. From the scanning electron microscopy and thermal analysis, it appears that the toughening may arise from chemical reactions that have taken place between the epoxy resin and the polymeric modifier, which was partially solubilized in the resin matrix. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coatings based on a hybrid organic–inorganic epoxy system were prepared by a dual‐curing mechanism, via cationic photopolymerization in the first step at room temperature and a subsequent hydrolysis/condensation reaction of a trialkoxy‐silane compound (sol–gel process) at high temperature. To this end, a high T g epoxy resin (3,4‐epoxycyclohexylmethyl‐3′‐cyclohexenyl‐methyl adipate, UVR 6128) was added in increasing amounts to a precursor for the inorganic‐like phase (3,4‐epoxycyclohexylethyltrimethoxysilane, EETMOS). The mixture contained triphenylsulfoniumhexafluoroantimonate as a cationic photoinitiator. By this method, the strongly acid environment generated by the photolysis of the triarylsolfunium salt in the first step induces the hydrolysis of EETMOS alkoxy‐silane groups. The films produced in the first step of the process were thermal treated to promote the condensation reactions of the siloxane moieties. The kinetics of the reactions of photopolymerization and condensation was investigated. It was found that the presence of EETMOS increases both the polymerization rate and the final consumption of epoxy groups. Thermogravimetric analyses performed in air have revealed an increased stability of the hybrid coatings with respect to the films produced from formulations without EETMOS. A significant increase in surface hardness was also observed for the hybrid coatings. The thermo‐mechanical properties were found to be strongly affected by the temperature used in the thermally induced reactions in the second step. The hybrid coatings on a low‐density polyethylene substrate were found to decrease the diffusivity of oxygen and to increase the oxygen solubility within the coating. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Also, to investigate and evaluate the effective parameters on oil absorbency, cross‐linked dodecyl methacrylate (DDMA)–diphenylacrylamide (DPAA) and DDMA–butyl acrylate (BA) copolymers were synthesized. DDMA was copolymerized with different mol% of DPAA or BA and cross‐linked using azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator and various weight percentages of 1,4‐butandiol dimethacrylate, methylene bisacrylamide, or vinyl group–modified MWCNT cross‐linkers. The effects of monomer feed composition, cross‐linker concentration, and the hydrophobicity of the copolymer units on swelling properties of the cross‐linked copolymers were studied through the oil‐absorbency tests. It was found that in the reactions used vinyl group–modified MWCNTs act as cross‐linking agents for the free radical polymerization, carbon nanotubes (CNT) played the other roles, that is, as a comonomer and an adsorbent. The oil absorbents containing CNTs showed the highest oil absorbency (toluene, 42.6 g; crude oil, 36.0 g/g oil absorbent).

The superabsorbent hydrogels prepared were characterized by X‐ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; and the swelling behaviors of the hydrogels were also investigated. Results showed that the intercalation was successful. The water absorbency for poly(AA–AM/DMAEA–DB–MMT) was always higher than that of poly(AA–AM/CTAB–MMT) in the range of the OMMT content investigated. The amount of OMMT also influenced the water absorbency of the hydrogels, they reached the highest water absorbency of 1100 g/g for the former at the content of 10%, and 875 g/g for the latter at the content of 6% in distilled water, respectively. The water absorbency decreased with the increase in the concentration of saline solutions for all the samples. The swelling behavior of the hydrogels was dependent on the pH.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microcellular injection‐molding technology is capable of producing lightweight polymeric products. The foam morphology is determined by the injection‐molding parameters, and it has been observed that depending on the parameter variations, the cell structure may exhibit substantial morphological differences through the entire section along the melt flow direction of the injected part. The effects of varying injection‐molding parameters on foam morphology and thermal mechanical properties of a multiphase ethylene‐propylene block copolymer (EPBC) were tested on 5‐mm plaque specimens using a constant temperature profile. It has been found that injection speed does not have a significant effect on the thermal‐mechanical properties of the foam, whereas shot volume and mold temperature do have a significant influence. Low shot volume produces uniform density cellular structures and larger cores, whereas lower mold temperatures help maintain small cell sizes. Furthermore, the effect of the copolymer's crystalline phase on foam morphology has been observed. This study identifies the achievable foam morphologies and the thermal‐mechanical performance of cellular molded EPBC parts. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and fatigue life of SBR/NBRr blends with and without TOR were studied. Results showed that SBR/NBRr blends with TOR exhibited better thermal stability than SBR/NBRr blends without TOR. A DSC result showed that with incorporation of TOR into the SBR/NBRr blends, it alters the calorimetric profile particularly for SBR/NBRr/TOR (R05/TOR), which shows changes in the horizontal line from a high to low energy level along with a greater delta H value. The fatigue life of SBR/NBRr blends with the incorporation of TOR showed higher values than SBR/NBRr blends without TOR, particularly at 75/25, 65/35, and 50/50 blend ratios. The scanning electron microscopy images of SBR/NBRr blends with TOR illustrated that the failure surface became rougher with many tear lines compared to SBR/NBRr without TOR, indicating that a good interaction occurred between the NBRr and SBR matrix with the presence of TOR. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These resins were prepared from macroporous chloromethylated PS by adding different quantities of anisole in the Friedel–Crafts reaction; they had different adsorption selectivity toward β‐naphthol and vanillin from aqueous solution, and HJ‐J08 held the largest adsorption capacity toward vanillin. The isotherms of vanillin on HJ‐J08 were measured and fitted by the Freundlich equation, and isosteric adsorption enthalpies were calculated according to the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. The second‐order rate equation was shown to be suitable for fitting the kinetic data, and the intraparticle diffusion was the rate‐controlling step in the first stage. The breakthrough point of HJ‐J08 toward vanillin was 75 BV (bed volume; 1 BV = 10 mL) with the initial concentration of 1000 mg/L, and a flow rate of 6 BV/h, exhibiting an excellent adsorption property toward vanillin. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Highly hydrophobic and oleophobic coatings were prepared with the aid of a fluorinated acrylate (Fluowet AC 812) and hydrophobic‐fumed nanosilica particles. Nanoparticles were added for increasing the surface roughness and also to increase thermal and mechanical properties of the coatings. Coatings were applied on ABS (acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene) and HIPS (high impact polystyrene) substrates. As the fluorine and nanosilica contents were increased in the formulations, flame retardancy, hydrophobicity, and the oleophobicity of the coatings increased. Coatings were found to be highly thermally stable, highly solvent, and chemically resistant. The surface roughness of the coatings increased with the addition of hydrophobic‐fumed nanosilica particles. In addition, the relation between the surface energy and the contact angle of the coatings was investigated. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microspheres (MCs) of different polymers, such as poly(ether sulfone) (PES), polyetheretherketone with card, with and without pore formers, were prepared by the non‐solvent–induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The polymers were solubilized in different types of solvents, such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N ‐methylpyrrolidone, and γ ‐butyrolactone as a dispersed phase, whereas dodecane, isopropanol, water, and sodium dodecyl sulfate were used as continuous phases. The technique yielded asymmetric and symmetric porous, spongy, or finger‐like, spherical MCs having a diameter tailored by the monopore film pore size employed. The influence of polymer and pore former (polyvinylpyrrolidone k17), the continuous phase composition and operating membrane process conditions, and solvent uptake behavior of different solvents are studied in detail. The operative conditions and chemical compositions are correlated with the spherical nature, structural interaction, pore size, porosity, and morphology of the MCs prepared. Ternary phase diagrams were drawn for PES/DMF and PES/DMSO using different alcohols, such as butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. BET (Brunauer–Emmet–Teller) surface analysis also provided information about the surface of MCs. MCs with different diameters and porosities are obtained by controlling the concentration of the dispersed phase polymer concentration, used during the preparation, and diameter of the monopore film. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PMMA nanocomposites containing three different LDH concentrations (1, 3, and 5 wt%) were produced, and it was observed that all the nanocomposites with lower LDH concentration (1 wt%) showed a higher elastic modulus than PMMA. However, as the LDH concentration increased, the elastic modulus decreased for all the nanocomposites. It was shown that PMMA/(Zn/Al 2:1 stearate) containing 5 wt% of LDH in its composition exhibited a decomposition temperature about 97°C higher than pure PMMA. According to this study, it was found that it is possible to enhance some mechanical and thermal properties of PMMA using very low LDH concentrations (mass fraction of LDH equal to 1%). LDHs are inexpensive materials based on abundant metals with a simple synthesis method that has a low environmental impact. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The hybrids obtained were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopic analysis. Thermal properties of the samples were evaluated by means of thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetric measurements, showing the influence of type and amount of organosilicon compound on thermal properties of the hybrid materials. The samples obtained with siloxane containing fluoroalkyl groups as well as with mixed siloxanes revealed higher thermal stability than unmodified gelatin. Glass transition temperatures of the hybrids occurred at lower values than for gelatin, exhibiting the plasticizing effect of the applied siloxanes. Enthalpy values of the hybrids decreased, indicating the changes in the helical structure of gelatin caused by the introduction of siloxane.",

Therefore, the occurring shear rates have been calculated and compared with the data of a viscosity plot for a polyether ether ketone material.

Nonmodified nanoparticles were found to interact with the BMI/DDM matrix through hydrogen bonding, whereas the surface‐modified nanoparticles exhibited strong adherence to the polymer matrix through covalent bonding. Morphological analysis revealed that surface‐modified nanoparticles were homogenously distributed within the polymer matrix, whereas the pure silica filler formed large aggregates due to strong filler–filler interactions. Nanocomposites reinforced with surface‐modified silica nanoparticles showed significant improvements over pure silica, and improvements were also noted in the thermo mechanical properties and thermal stability of the neat BMI/DDM, such as the storage tensile modulus and glass transition temperature. A reduction in the coefficient of thermal expansion was also noted.",

These compounds are important for biological applications because of their biocompatibility and similarity to biopolymers.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Eucalyptus essential oil (EEO) mainly consists of a natural organic compound named eucalyptol (1,8 cineole). It is a potential anti‐inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial substance owing to its germicidal properties. Wound Dressing based on alginate fibers are also well known for caring of moderate‐ to highly exuding chronic and acute wounds. So, it was intended to load alginate with cineole to obtain a natural antibacterial fiber. EEO was loaded to a spinning dope of alginate. EEO‐doped alginate fibers were fabricated by wet spinning method, and then as‐spun fibers were consolidated in coagulation baths containing divalent cations. The cineol content of EEO, as its most active antibacterial agent, was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Fibers were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and their tensile mechanical properties were determined by a Shirley's strength tester. Antibacterial efficiency of samples was studied by measuring their zone of inhibition against a gram‐positive organism ( Staphylococcus aureus ) in accordance with American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATTC) test method 147. The cross section of EEO‐loaded alginate fibers was rounder and their tensile mechanical properties didn't decline significantly in comparison with unloaded alginate fibers. The presence of antibacterial activity observed for loaded samples and improved by increasing the EEO content of fibers. To consider the produced antibacterial activity and intrinsic properties of alginate, EEO‐loaded alginate fibers are proposed for occlusive or semiocclusive Wound Dressing. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Poly(vinyl alcohol) ( PVA ), chitosan and graphite oxide ( GO ), good biocompatibility, and nontoxicity, are green materials with potential applications in biomaterials.

Without addition of any organic cross‐linker, the dual‐network PVA /chitosan hydrogel was obtained, namely GO nanosheets as 2D cross‐linker and H‐bonding between PVA chains. For one thing, GO nanosheets induce the physical network formation through electrostatic interaction between positively charged PVA , chitosan, and negatively charged GO . For another, PVA chains can be connected by H‐bonding through freezing/thawing measurements, resulting in the formation of another physical network. To investigate the performance of the PVA /chitosan/ GO hydrogel, infrared spectrum, swelling test, thermal analysis, rheological study, and self‐healing tests were conducted. The result showed that PVA /chitosan hydrogel in the presence of GO is not only self‐healable, but also pH ‐responsive and temperature‐dependent.",

It is expected to improve stretchability, impact strength, tensile strength, and thermoformability for a larger market. So, in this research, the stretching methods were investigated in terms of dynamics and structure development for the biaxial stretching films. There are three different stretching methods which can produce PA6 films, namely the simultaneous biaxial stretching, the sequential biaxial stretching, and the double bubble tubular process. The physical properties of PA 6 film are very much influenced by the biaxial stretching process. But there are no reports which described the difference among the three stretching methods and film properties. For this reason, the higher order structure and stretching behaviors of the three stretching methods were studied. As a result, the sequential biaxial stretching showed strong stretched effect and molecular orientation in the transverse direction ( TD ) and poor film thickness uniformity, because the strong hydrogen bonds were created during the machine direction ( MD ) stretching and high stretching stress in the TD stretching was required. In the simultaneous biaxial stretching, the molecular orientation was equal both in the MD and in the TD of the stretched plane. The double bubble tubular process produced well‐balanced film and equal orientation in any direction in terms of the phase difference in the plane of film. The biaxially oriented PA6 film having good stretchability and high physical properties was also investigated.",

    "abstract": "Temperature stability is critical to the consistency of product quality in the injection molding process, and it is very necessary to improve the temperature control accuracy under dynamic conditions. However, due to the large time delay, strong coupling, and the dynamic characteristics existing in the system, it is not an easy task to achieve precise temperature control in the injection molding process. In this paper, a new intelligent temperature compensation control strategy for the injection molding process under dynamic conditions is proposed in order to solve two key problems in the compensation control strategy: the compensation time and compensation quantity. A data-based feedforward iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm is designed to learn the optimal compensation time. Once the optimal compensation time is learned, a deep Q-learning algorithm which combined Q-learning with an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to learn the optimal compensation quantity. An experimental platform is designed to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve temperature control accuracy under dynamic conditions. Meanwhile, the product consistency has also been improved.",

In this work, in order to prepare green, low-cost and high-efficient catalysts under mild conditions, we chose biomass-based chitosan as raw material and prepared a new solid acidic catalyst by an acid functionalization method. FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TGA, BET, neutralization titration and other analytical methods were used to characterize the catalyst. The results showed that CS-SO 3 H morphology exhibited a sphere of about 10 μ m diameter, and the acid density was as high as 3.81 mmol/g. The catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity in the esterification of oleic acid and methanol, which is a model reaction of the pre-esterification process in the preparation of biodiesel from feedstocks with high acid values. Under the optimum reaction conditions (15/1 methanol/oleic acid mole ratio and 3 wt% catalyst dosage at 75°C for 3 h), the yield of methyl oleate can reach 95.7%. Even if the mass of oleic acid in the reactant increased to 20 g, solid acid showed good catalytic performance, and the yield of methyl oleate was 94.4%. After four times of reuse, the yield of the catalyst can still reach 85.7%, which indicates that the catalyst has good catalytic activity and stability, and has potential application prospects.",

Experimental results show that the die pressure has little effect on output, which is significantly different from that of single screw extruders. Oscillation pressure was introduced into the extrusion process by the dynamic convergent–divergent flow channel of the vane extruder. The oscillation frequency of melt pressure is four times of that of the rotor angular frequency. The die pressure has a little influence on the oscillation amplitude of melt pressure. The oscillation amplitude of melt pressure increases with the increase of rotor speed. The oscillation amplitude of melt pressure decreases along the extrusion direction.",

The analysis of the main electrical parameters such as zero‐bias barrier height (BH) (Φ Bo ), ideality factor ( n ), and interface states ( N ss ) was found strongly dependent on temperature and voltage. The obtained results show that, while Φ Bo increases, n decreases with increasing temperature. The plot of Φ app versus q /2 kT was drawn to show a Gaussian distribution (GD) of the BHs, and this plot shows two distinct linear regions. The Φ Bo and standard deviation ( σ s ) values were found from the slope and intercept of these plots for two regions as 1.16 eV and 0.161 V for the first region and 0.71 eV and 0.093 V for the second region, respectively. Such behavior is typical of a double GD (DGD) of the BHs due to the BH inhomogeneities at the metal–semiconductor interface. The slope and intercept of the modified (ln (I 0 /T 2 ) – q 2 σ 0 2 /2 k 2 T 2 ) versus q / kT plot gives the and ¯Φ Bo and effective Richardson constant ( A *) as 1.16 and 0.76 eV and 36.7 and 83.8 A/cm 2 K 2 , respectively. The value of the A * (36.7 A/cm 2 K 2 ) is very close to the theoretical value of 32 A/cm 2 K 2 for p‐Si. In addition, to interrupt the voltage‐dependent activation energy, the ln( I s / T 2 ) versus q / kT plot was drawn in the voltage range of 0–0.3 V in 0.05 V steps. All of experimental results confirmed that the BH or E a values depend on the temperature as well as bias voltages.",

This was done by subjecting substrate I as a starting substrate to acid hydrolysis to obtain three levels of hydrolyzed pregelled starch having different molecular weights (substrates II–IV). The latter were graft copolymerized with various amounts of methacrylamide monomers using an Mn(IV)‐citric acid redox pair for initiating grafting to obtain copolymers having different graft yields. The flocculation efficiency was followed by estimating the transmission (%) and weight removal (%) of the flocculants. The grafted pregelled starches were characterized by estimating apparent viscosity, intrinsic viscosity, and elemental analysis. The major factors affecting the flocculation process such as the flocculent dose, pH of the flocculation medium, and molecular weight as well as the extent of grafting were studied in detail. It is observed from the obtained results that the flocculation efficiency of the prepared copolymers (a) increases by increasing the flocculants dose to reach a peak value then decreases thereafter; (b) increases by decreasing the pH values from 8 to 6; (c) increases by decreasing the molecular weight of the parent starch and follows the following order: substrate IV &lt; substrate III &lt; substrate II &lt; substrate I; (d) increases by increasing the extent of grafting within the range studied; and (e) poly(methacrylamide)‐graft copolymers derived from hydrolyzed pregelled starch (substrates II–IV) show a higher flocculation efficiency than polyacrylamide as a synthetic flocculant. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The second step was carried out by plasma polymerization of preadsorbed reactive monomers on the surfaces of dried pretreated films. The effects of pretreatment time length and monomer concentration were studied on AAc graft amount. The surface of the modified PU films were characterized using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR‐FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and water drop contact angle measurements.

During optimization, an innovative adaptive Kriging surrogate modeling strategy is applied to substitute the computationally intensive numerical simulation of the injection molding process. The system consists of two main stages. In the first stage, the Taguchi optimization method, the analysis of variance, and the signal-to-noise ratio are employed to find the significant process parameters. The most influential factors’ domains will be divided into two subregions equally in the next step. The Kriging surrogate model is developed to obtain the mathematical relationship between the warpage and process parameters based on the fractional factorial design. A parallel efficient global optimization, named subregional efficient global optimization (SEGO), is proposed. SEGO algorithm is continued till the convergence accuracy is satisfied, and the sufficiently accurate Kriging surrogate model is established. In the second stage, the nondominated sorting-based genetic algorithm II is used to search for the pareto-optimal solutions for two objectives. Numerical result shows that the pareto-frontier is well identified with a small number of simulation runs. The proposed approach can help engineers obtain optimal process conditions and achieve competitive advantages of product quality and efficiency.",

Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) studies showed that the modified membranes with heating melting temperatures in the range 112.5–113.8°C were more crystalline than the unmodified membranes due to the presence of cyclodextrin derivatives on the interfacial layer.

The PA ‐ TFC membranes had a lower water uptake percentage due to their enhanced crystallinity. However, these materials had a higher water permeate flux due to the hydrophilic nature of the modified membranes enhanced by the rich hydroxyl groups on the CD s.

Epoxy blends were prepared by physically mixing the epoxy resins with various concentrations of LPNR . The structure, thermal, mechanical properties and morphology of the epoxy blends were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, impact behavior, and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the inclusion of 5 phr LPNR reached the maximum value in impact strength of the modified epoxies and the presence of LPNR enables the epoxy resins to fracture in a pattern more akin to ductile materials than in case of the neat epoxy which shows features of brittle rupture. The agglomeration of rubber particles decreased the toughness of epoxy resins modified with more LPNR . Meanwhile, the nearly unchanged glass transition temperature of LPNR epoxy samples illustrated weak interfacial adhesion existed between the rubber phase and epoxy matrix due to low compatibility and feeble combination between them. The thermal stability of modified epoxy resins went down because of the existence of LPNR domains inside the matrix. Overall, the LPNR should be further investigated to improve its compatibility and reinforce its combination with the epoxy resins to become a particularly efficient toughening agent because of its cheaper resource and contribution to environmental protection.",

Cationic dyes such as Crystal violet ( CV ) and Methylene blue ( MB ) were used for testing the adsorption property. Factors influencing adsorption such as pH , contact time, concentration were investigated by batch experiments. Adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms were employed to illustrate the hydrogel‐dye interaction. The results showed that the best parameters for the adsorption of dyes were pH = 6 and contact time 2 h. The adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo‐second‐order model with multi‐step diffusion process. Both Langmuir and Redlich‐Peterson isotherms were well agreed with the experimental data. The maximum adsorption capacities of CV and MB on AA / VMT hydrogel were 2575.2 and 2674.0 mg g −1 , respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural rubber is the most common material for dynamic applications. Its limited service temperature leads to search alternative elastomeric materials for related areas. In this study, natural rubber, traditional ethylene propylene diene rubber ( EPDM ), and a new grade EPDM with modified structural properties have been evaluated by means of tensile properties, characteristic temperatures, cross‐link density, isothermal and nonisothermal relaxation behaviors with temperature scanning stress relaxation ( TSSR ) method. Linear molecular structure of the alternative EPDM elastomers provided improved tensile strength and isothermal stress relaxation behavior. Small amount of process oil addition also improved their service temperatures due to better processing conditions. Annealing study showed that strain‐induced crystallization is one of the important factors controlling service conditions of EPDM . Besides, TSSR technique was concluded to be a fast and powerful technique for measuring cross‐link density and for predicting service temperatures of natural rubber and EPDM elastomers.",

A novel approach toward modification of surface of TFC RO membrane using surfactant (anionic, cationic, and nonionic) has been presented. Anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, increased the water flux of TFC RO membrane up to 142% when TFC RO membrane was exposed to sodium hypochlorite solution of 2,000 mg/L for 2 hr followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 hr at pH 11. However, surface modification by cationic surfactant, that is, cetrimonium bromide resulted in decreased water flux. Boron rejection decreased to 87.31% when cetrimonium bromide of 500 mg/L was exposed after 2,000 mg/L sodium hypochlorite at pH 11 because of positive charge on the membrane surface. Nonionic surfactant Triton X‐100 exposure lower than critical micelle concentration, that is, 100 mg/L for 1 hr after sodium hypochlorite exposure of 2,000 mg/L for 2 hr, resulted in increased water flux of about 22%, however, on increasing surfactant concentration more than critical micelle concentration, that is, 4% with the same sodium hypochlorite pre‐exposure, resulted in 47.5% decline in water flux. Thus, surfactant can bind the top barrier layer of polyamide membrane to alter its performance.",

The sequence and proportion of wall materials were compared and optimized based on the stability of the emulsions and citral content in the microcapsules. MC / CTS / ALG was the best wall material for citral microencapsulation. Formulation comprising 1.5 ml citral, 0.8 g MC , 1.0 g CTS , and 6.0 g ALG had the best entrapment of citral, resulting in citral unit content of 46.4 mg/g and the encapsulation efficiency of 82.2%. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy images expressed distinct spherical core–shell structure of the microcapsules. Citral microcapsules absorbed water during storage, which resulted in particle size increase and cracks in the microcapsules surface. Water absorption properties in common used environments (open in air, sealed plastic bag, glass bottle) were investigated. CoCl 2 microcapsules were used to intuitively express the water absorption through the color change. The results are referential for industry to select proper wall materials and storage conditions for spice microcapsules to increase the shelf life of relevant foods.",

Under such background, this paper aims to explore the effects of the application of the nonprestressed and prestressed basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars on the flexural performance of the beams made of the laminated bamboo and reconstituted bamboo materials. Two series of four-point bending tests were thus conducted. In the first series of tests, the pure laminated bamboo beam and the laminated bamboo beam applied with nonprestressed BFRP bar were compared. Test results showed that the ultimate load and deformation capacity of the laminated bamboo beam was improved due to the existence of the BFRP bar. In the second series of tests, the reconstituted bamboo beams applied with nonprestressed and prestressed BFRP bars were compared. It is found that the ultimate load of the reconstituted bamboo beam was not improved by the application of the prestressed force. The further analysis related to the prestress loss demonstrated that the prestress loss before the release of the prestressed BFRP bar could reach up to 31.8–37.3% compared with the design initial prestressed stress. The prestress loss caused by the elastic deformation of the bamboo beam can be neglected. For all tested specimens, the plane section assumption was acceptable and the position of the neutral axis of the beam gradually moved down with the increase of the applied load.",

HA hydrogel can be produced from HA molecules via crosslinking. Physical crosslinking by noncovalent bonds is preferable rather than chemical crosslinking using a crosslinking agent to prevent unintended interactions in a biological environment and reduce inflammation caused by reaction by-products. In this study, HA was modified with two types of complementary single-stranded DNA obtained by digestion of pUC118 vector with the restriction enzyme Bsp1286I. When both of HA-DNAs were mixed, hybridized complementary strands acted as crosslinking points to form hydrogels. Shearing stress was applied to mix these DNA-conjugated HA solutions. As a result, a stiff hydrogel with an elastic modulus of about 100 Pa was obtained. The gel thus obtained would be facile to handle as an injectable gel that gains its structural properties from the shear stress applied through injection with a needle. In addition, DNA crosslinking points can be used for hybridization of the hydrogels with other biopolymers, cleavage with restriction enzymes and dissociation by thermal denaturation.",

A molecularly imprinting polymer with high performance for recognizing thymol was prepared by a novel surface molecular imprinting technique. First, silica nanoparticles were modified with γ ‐methacyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (KH‐570) as a support material. Afterward, surface molecularly imprinted polymers (SMIP) were obtained through polymerization with methacrylic acid as the functional monomer and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate as the cross‐linking agent. The produced polymers were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The SMIP were obtained with the average core shell thickness of 17 nm, an average pore diameter of 3.9 nm, and the high specific surface area of 282.3 m 2 g −1 . The adsorption properties were revealed by batch binding experiments. The results indicated that the SMIP had higher binding capacity for thymol than its nonimprinted polymers. The selectivity of the SMIP obtained was clarified by using thymol and structurally related compounds. The selectivity coefficient of SMIP for thymol with respect to competition species obtained was 2.44, which revealed SMIP had good selectivity and site accessibility for thymol. A kinetic binding study showed that adsorption capacity of SMIP increased continuously with time and reached saturation adsorption at 90 min.",

All nickel complexes, activated with Methylaluminoxane, exhibited high activities for ethylene oligomerization ( TOF = 1.92–4.93 g/mol Ni h) and showed good selectivities for the longer chain oligomers produced (36.35–60.33%). When activated with ethylaluminum dichloride, it was found that a tandem process occurred in which ethylene oligomerization was followed by Friedel–Crafts alkylation of the reaction solvent, toluene. On increasing the pressure of ethylene and Al/Ni ratio, the catalytic activities of precatalyst increased and the processes became more selective for the shorter oligomers. Not only the polymerized parameters but also the length of alkyl chain of the ligands influenced the catalytic activities and selectivities for the longer chain oligomers. The catalytic activities and selectivities for the longer chain oligomers declined with the increase in length of alkyl chain of ligand.",

The uncrosslinked and cross‐linked CS/CC biocomposite films with SAL were prepared through solvent casting method. The SAL is used as cross‐linking agent in biocmposite films. The effect of CC content and SAL on the tensile, thermal, biodegradation properties, and morphological study of CS/CC biocomposite films are investigated. The tensile strength and elongation at break of CS/CC cob biocomposite films decreases, but modulus of elasticity increases with increasing CC content. However, the addition of SAL showed 59.47% and 25.18% of improvement in average tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of cross‐linked CS / CC biocomposite films, respectively, as compared to uncrosslinked biocomposite films. The cross‐linked biocomposite films exhibited higher thermal stability than uncrosslinked biocomposite films. Moreover, the cross‐linked biocomposite films with SAL cross‐linking agent showed lower weight loss in enzyme and soil biodegradation as compared to uncrosslinked biocomposite films. As a comparison, the cross‐linked biocomposite films with SAL showed the highest properties compared to others cross‐linking agent such as glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin as reported in our previous study.",

To demonstrate the feasibility of mPEG ‐ CS ‐ PLL as a protein carrier, bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was used as a model protein and encapsulated in the mPEG ‐ CS ‐ PLL nanoparticles by electrostatic binding. The system showed very high encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity for BSA which was up to 78% and 42%, respectively. Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ), transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ), and zeta potential study were further used to measure the size, morphology, and Zeta potential of the nanoparticles. The results indicated that the nanoparticles were spherical with a homogeneous size below 300 nm, and the system was positively charged about +21.78 mV . Moreover, the protein cumulative release from the protein delivery system could reach to 82.5% after 54‐h incubation in PBS ( pH 7.2) at 37°C. Cell viability tests against L929 cells showed that the cytotoxicity of mPEG ‐ CS ‐ PLL polymers was very low, which was favorable to practical applications. It can be suggested from the above results that the mPEG ‐ CS ‐ PLL can be used as a safe and effective carrier for protein delivery.",

Moreover, the isothermal crystallization of polyethylene chains has been evaluated in the quiescent and shear‐induced conditions. In quiescent crystallization, adding 1 wt% nanofiller improves the crystallization rate, whereas an increment in the organoclay loading retards the crystallization process. However, an opposing effect of nanoparticles is observed in the shear‐induced crystallization. The findings show that the incorporation of 5 wt% nanoclay in good dispersion state considerably accelerates the shear‐induced crystallization process. This influence is found even for very weak shear flow fields. The synergistic effects of nanoclay addition and shear field presence on the crystallization process are of major significance particularly for polyolefin products, which are commonly manufactured by using melt processing methods.",

However, this material undergoes an exothermic reaction in the curing stage, which can cause a thermal disturbance in the frozen soil subgrade. To minimize the influence of the thermal disturbance of the polyurethane polymer grouting material in the repair of the frozen soil subgrade, an experiment was conducted to reduce the heat of the curing reaction under the influence of different proportions of a foaming agent, high-boiling point solvent, catalyst, and prepolymer. According to these test results, a proportioning scheme for the low exothermic polymer grouting material was formulated. The results indicated that the curing reaction temperature threshold of the polyurethane polymer grouting material was negatively related to the proportion of physical foaming agent (HCFC-141b) and high-boiling point solvent and positively related to the proportion of water weight. In the three stages of rapid temperature rise, slow temperature rise, and constant temperature, the rate of the temperature rise of the low exothermic polymer grouting material was lower than that of the common polymer, and the curing temperature threshold was 30.34% lower at a value of 101°C. At a density of 80 kg/m3, the compressive strength and tensile strength of the low heat release polymer grouting material were lower than those of the common polymer grouting material, thereby ensuring the excellent performance of polyurethane foam and providing a theoretical reference for the rapid repair of frozen soil roadbed diseases.",

Soybean flour (SF) was added to promote the growth of mycelia, which could bind the bagasse fiber matrix. The main materials were whole bagasse (B) and depithed bagasse (DB). The SF weight ratios to bagasse were 1 : 1 (SF1) and 1.5 : 1 (SF1.5). Therefore, the studied specimens were labeled B-SF1, DB-SF1, B-SF1.5, and DB-SF1.5. All biofoam cups were analyzed for their physical properties (water absorption and porosity), mechanical properties (puncture and compressive strengths), biodegradability, and thermal properties (thermogravimetric analysis).

In batch adsorption studies, the effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, initial metal ions concentration, and temperature on the removal of heavy metal ions were investigated. The adsorption capacity of the composite varied with changing parameters, and the maximum removal efficiency obtained for Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cr3+ was 95%, 88%, and 70%, respectively, at pH 6 with 60 ppm of each metal ions concentration and an adsorbent dosage of 1.0 g L−1.

A PolyJet, UV-cured 3D-printer system was used to fabricate the various TPMS scaffold models using three polymer materials with high, medium, and low stiffness properties. All TPMS models had the same volume fractions of the three polymer materials. Final models were printed into cylinders with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 8 mm for mechanical testing. The models were subjected to compressive and shear testing using a dynamic mechanical analysis rheometer. All samples were tested at physiologically relevant temperature (37°C) to provide detailed structural characterizations. Microscopic imaging of 3D-printed scaffold longitudinal and cross sections revealed that additive manufacturing adequately recreated the TPMS functions, which created anisotropic materials with variable structures in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Mechanical testing showed that all three TPMS 3D-printed scaffold types exhibited significantly different shear and compressive properties (verifying anisotropic properties) despite being constructed of the same volume fractions of the three UV-printed polymer materials. The gyroid and diamond scaffolds demonstrated complex moduli values that ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 times greater than the modified gyroid scaffolds in both shear and compression. Control scaffolds printed from 100% of each of the three polymers had statistically similar mechanical properties, verifying isotropic properties.",

This widespread use is not only harmful to humans but also to the ecosystem as synthetic plastics disrupt ecological balance and deplete petroleum-based oil resources. Researchers and manufacturers are continuously addressing this problem by developing bio-based alternatives that provide numerous advantages including structural flexibility, biodegradability, and effective barrier properties. However, the high cost of production and unavailability of equipment for batch processing impede the potential for widespread manufacturing. Natural fibers mixed with bio-based adhesives derived from plants provide one of the biggest potential sources of bio-based materials for the food container industry. Not only does this address the issue of high raw material cost but it also has the potential to become sustainable once processing steps have been optimized. In this review, the current findings of several research related to the production of bio-based disposable food containers, packaging, and composites made from bio-based materials and bio-based adhesives are critically discussed. Several properties and characteristics important to the production of food service containers and primary packaging, as well as the existing challenges and future perspectives, are also highlighted.",

These nanocomposites are designed to actively prevent the growth of bacteria by including antimicrobial agents such as functional groups or nanoparticles. In the present article, copper oxide nanoparticles were synthesized via the green method using the solution method. The grafting of N‐ethyl piperazine (NEP) to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer was carried out to obtain NEP–PVC polymer using solution polymerization technique and further reacted with CuO nanoparticles to obtain polymernanocomposite which was characterized using FTIR and 1 H‐NMR, SEM, TEM, DLS, and XRD. The comparison in the antibacterial activity of nanocomposite and the synthesized polymer was carried out to determine its efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using the spread plate method. Our findings indicate that NEP–PVC‐based nanocomposite after incorporating copper oxide nanoparticles has enhanced the antibacterial properties over NEP–PVC polymer, henceforth a promising candidate to be used in medical devices, food packaging, and surface coatings.",

Each temperature profile, through the preform thickness, was computed from processing conditions by solving the energy equation with radiation as the heating source. The computed temperature profile was verified by measuring the inside and outside preform surface temperatures using infrared thermocouples. Bottles were then blow molded with various temperature profiles and measurements were carried out on samples cut from the sidewalls. Thickness distributions and axial ratios were determined as were changes in mechanical, optical, and barrier properties. It was found that optical anisotropy through bottle wall thickness was minimal when the inside preform surface was at a higher temperature than the outside surface. Densities of the bottle sidewalls were found to be higher for bottles blow molded at higher average temperatures and there were small increases in density for bottles blown with the preform inside surface at a higher temperature than the outside surface. Haze measurements showed that, to obtain optically clear containers, bottles with an inside hoop ratio of 5.25 should be blown with an inside surface temperature of at least 100°C. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The variation of graft weight with radiation dose, intensity of radiation, and irradiation environment was investigated. In the case of the preirradiation method, irradiation in air produced up to 30% graft weight compared to only 20% obtained when the irradiation was conducted in nitrogen environment. In this method the graft copolymerization reaction was initiated by reactive species having different life times, some of which were very long. In simultaneous irradiation and grafting method, the graft weight passes through a maximum value (∼15%) with radiation dose and graft weight limited due to excessive homopolymerization. A comparative study on the mechanical properties of samples grafted by both preirradiation and simultaneous irradiation and grafting methods was carried out. The results showed that the method of grafting has significant influence on the mechanical properties of grafted jute. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Solvent extraction of ground SMC with acetone, methylene chloride, chloroform, or chloroform : benzene (1 : 1 vol) yielded low quantities of a gummy, viscous extract. Hydrolysis of the extracted SMC sample under strong alkaline conditions was also studied. A unit structure was postulated for the hydrolysate based upon elemental and molecular weight analysis. Pyrolysis of both extracted and unextracted SMCs in nitrogen at 500°C and in air at 400°C yielded organic oils. These oils were characterized for their calorific values. The products of pyrolysis consisted of mainly aromatics along with some oligomers. The extract and the oil from pyrolysis appear to be compatible with epoxy systems. Their use as an extender for epoxy systems, while that of the inorganic residue (glass fibers and CaCO 3 ) as a filler for epoxy system, have been explored. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyethylene is one of the most widely used corrosion‐protection thermoplastic coating materials that protects steel by providing a barrier to oxygen, water, and corrosive ions and performs very well. In order to further improve medium density polyethylene (MDPE) properties with regard to cathodic disbondment (CD), i.e., the loss of adhesion that takes place in the presence of cathodic protection (CP), various blends with functionalized polyethylenes containing polar functional groups such as maleic anhydride‐grafted‐polyethylene (MAH‐ g ‐PE) and other thermoplastic elastomers such as EPDM have been formulated to increase CD performance. Using compression molding and strew coating, the above modified polyethylenes have been applied on steel plate and pipe, respectively. The CD performance and 90° peel strength (dry and wet) of these formulations are investigated in this study. It is observed that dry bond strength does not correlate with CD performance. The improvement of CD performance for compression‐molded materials and strew‐coated samples is demonstrated. Also discussed, for comparison, is the performance of MDPE applied by a commercially relevant fluidized bed technique. Wet adhesion strength is shown to be an important parameter in assessing the CD performance of coatings. The disbondment mechanism of failed polymer surfaces has also been investigated using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which allows us to monitor the mass transfer of the sodium cations along the crevice during CD. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

By contrast with a sharp decrease of Ω v (by 16 orders of magnitude upon addition of a few percent of SF), the increase of thermal conductivity was much less dramatic. The thermal conductivity k of the composites was found to be proportional to volume loading, increasing by a factor of 1.8 on addition of 20 vol % of SF, independently of temperature and MPP presence.

These pipes displayed low levels of lamellar orientation and a skin‐core gradient in morphology. The hydrostatic pressure performance (ductile failure regime at 23°C) of the pipes was observed to depend on morphology, which was inferred by the systematic dependence of the failure times on the tensile behavior of the pipes. It was also found that pipes annealed at 80°C prior to testing displayed 400% longer failure times; annealing was found to increase the crystallinity of the pipe only marginally. Consequently, this performance improvement was attributed to relaxation of some of the frozen‐in residual stresses in the pipe. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) were used as initial materials with dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) as catalyst. The reaction was first examined in a batch reactor as well as in an internal mixer in order to obtain the kinetics and temperature/torque evolution trends during the formation of PUIR, respectively. For the specified screw speed and temperature profile of the extruder, a working domain can be recommended for the reactive extrusion, in terms of NCO/OH ratio ( r ) and catalyst concentration ( C ), to reach a sufficient extent of reaction. The effects of screw speed and temperature profile on the residence time parameters of the reaction mixture were investigated. It is found that the axial mixing and the RTD behavior of the reaction mixture in the extruder can be well represented by the axial dispersion model. For the reaction condition of r = 3, C = 2%, and barrel temperature profiles of 75–150°C or 90–165°C, the optimum screw rotation speed for complete NCO conversion is 20 rpm.

    "abstract": "Abstract Water‐assisted injection‐molding technology has received extensive attention in recent years, due to the lightweight of plastic parts, relatively low‐resin cost per part, faster cycle time, and flexibility in the design and manufacture. However, there are still some unsolved problems that confound the overall success of this technology. One of these is the water “fingering” phenomenon, in which the water bubbles penetrate outside designed water channels and form finger‐shape branches. This study has investigated the effects of various processing parameters on the formation of fingering in water‐assisted injection‐molded thermoplastic parts. Both amorphous and semicrystalline polymers were used to mold the parts. The influence of water channel geometry, including aspect ratio and fillet geometry, on the fingering was also investigated. It was found that water‐assisted injection‐molded amorphous materials gave less fingering, while molded semicrystalline parts gave more fingering when compared to those molded by gas‐assisted injection molding. For the water channels used in this study, the channels with a rib on the top produced parts with the least water fingering. Water fingering in molded parts decreases with the height‐to‐thickness ratio of the channels. The water pressure, water injection delay time and short‐shot size were found to be the principal parameters affecting the formation of water fingering. In addition, a numerical simulation based on the transient heat conduction model was also carried out to help better explain the mechanism for the formation of fingering in water‐assisted injection‐molded thermoplastics. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymer blending has been typically regarded as a mixing process rather than a structuring process so polymer blends and composites are not necessarily optimized with regard to structure, properties, and composition. In this article, a new smart blending technology is described whereby melt components and solid additives are more controllably organized into micrometer‐scale and sub‐micrometer‐scale shapes and arrangements to improve properties or impart functionality to extruded plastics. Chaotic advection is an enabling recent subfield of fluid mechanics for smart blending. It provides a method to controllably stretch and fold melt domains and evolve a multilayered structure leading to derivative morphologies, or indirectly manipulate solid additives. Recent advances in fluid mechanics have thereby been implemented to reconsider how blending is done. A variety of structured plastic materials are producible with a single smart blending device with no device alterations. Several examples and their improved physical properties are shown or discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is found that some blends exhibit higher oscillatory shear moduli and drawdown force than the individual pure components, demonstrating that relaxation mechanism with longer characteristic time appears in the blend. The anomalous rheological behavior is detected more clearly for the blends with autoclave‐LDPE than those with tubular‐LDPE. Furthermore, the number of short‐chain branches in a linear polyethylene has no influence on the rheological properties of the blends, suggesting that the phase separation will not be responsible for the anomalous behavior. It is also found that blends of autoclave‐LDPE and tubular‐LDPE show no synergetic effect. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A capillary rheometer and a single‐screw extruder have been utilized to study the effect of the additive on the extrudate distortions. Maleated syndiotactic metallocene polypropylene was also used as an adhesion promoter in mPP/wood flour composites. At loadings of 50 wt% wood flour in the mPP, the extrudates come out of the die with significant tearing and surface roughness. The surface rupture mechanism is similar to that of sharkskin in neat polymers; however, the defect is much more exaggerated in the case of wood fiber‐filled composites. It was found that TPSE at low concentrations (1 wt%) was able to reduce or even completely eliminate extrudate surface tearing. Increasing the extrusion speed yielded better results. Addition of a coupling agent also provides improvement in the extrudate appearance. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A functionality test that provides static and dynamic friction between rounded and cylindrical parts moving one inside the other gives us data not obtainable from the earlier techniques.

These two essential oils themselves were also examined. The aim of this study is to recycle PS without a melting process and without using petroleum‐derived solvents. The relationship between chemical structure of the terpenes and their dissolving power for PS is investigated through the solubility parameter and apparent activation energy for dissolution. α‐Terpinene and its positional isomers on a CC bond have high solvent powers for PS, whereas bicyclic terpenes are inferior in this regard even though they have similar solubility parameters to that of α‐terpinene. It is suggested that the bulky and/or hydrophilic structures in the solvent molecule prevent the dissolution of PS. Simple steam distillation of solutions of PS in the terpenes gave recovery of more than 97% of the PS and terpenes. The present solvent systems cause little degradation to PS and are promising for the recycling of PS using sustainable solvents. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this preliminary work, a new process is examined for manufacturing hollow parts from continuous fiber‐reinforced thermoplastic polymer. The new process combines the basic idea of bag forming (or bladder‐assisted forming) with the rotation of the mold for the processing of thermoplastic matrix composites. A pressurized membrane is used to compact the composite on the inner wall of a mold, which is placed inside a forced convection oven. The mold is removed from the oven for the cooling stage. The process was initially developed by using a thermoplastic pre‐preg obtained using yarns of commingled E‐glass fibers with isotactic polypropylene (iPP). A preliminary characterization of the thermoplastic composite showed that the material can be consolidated with pressures as low as 0.01 MPa, which is readily achievable with the process of this study. The design of the mold and membrane was carried out on the basis of both structural analysis of the aluminum shell and thermal analysis of the mold. The mold thickness is of great importance with respect to both the maximum pressure allowed in the process and the overall cycle time. Molding was performed on stacks of three and six layers of yarn, varying the applied pressure between 0.01 and 0.05 MPa and maximum temperature of the internal air between 185°C and 215°C. The composite shells obtained under different processing conditions were characterized in terms of physical and mechanical properties. Mechanical properties comparable with those obtained by compression molding and vacuum bagging were obtained. The maximum values obtained are 12.1 GPa and 290 MPa for the flexural modulus and the flexural strength, respectively. Furthermore, the results obtained show that mechanical properties improve with increasing the pressure during the cycle and with the maximum temperature used in the process. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effects of temperature, initiators, catalysts, and ligands on styrene bulk ATRP were investigated in detail. Results indicated that the initiator activity for a given monomer needs careful matching to bring about a match of the chain‐initiation and chain‐propagation rates. The higher activity is not necessarily the better. Thus, the less reactive monomer, styrene, was efficiently initiated by 1‐phenylethyl bromide (1‐PEBr), which only has a moderate initiator activity. Similarly, the catalyst system had to be carefully matched to achieve a real controlled/living radical polymerization. Controlled/living bulk ATRP of styrene was achieved by using 1‐PEBr as initiator, copper(I) bromide as catalyst, and N,N,N′,N′′,N′′ ‐ pentamethyldiethyllenetriamine as ligand at 90°C. After 4 h, the monomer conversion reached 51.8%, the practical molecular weight of polystyrene coincided well with the theoretical molecular weight of polystyrene, and the molecular weight distribution was 1.15. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Detailed understanding of the bubble transformation during foaming of nonpressurized polymer melts provided an accurate basis for predicting the morphological structure and macroscopic properties of foams produced by rotational molding. The experimental results are based on visualization studies using a hot stage microscopy setup. The cellular structure developed during the foaming was analyzed for its bubble density, bubble size, and statistical parameters considering the combined effect of these two factors. It was found during this investigation that the foaming mechanism comprises four distinct stages. It included two major stages of bubble nucleation, primary nucleation in interstitial regions, and secondary nucleation in the polymer melt. Statistical analysis of the developing foamed structure revealed that primary nucleation in the interstitial regions was the controlling stage in determining the final cellular structure. Subsequently, the nucleation stages were followed by bubble growth and bubble coalescence/shrinkage. The microscopic observations were complemented by actual rotational foam molding experiments. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mass production of tires as well as their storage or elimination is a real environmental problem. Various methods for recycling of tires are currently used, such as mechanical grinding, which separates vulcanized rubber, steel, and fibers from tires. Rubber is, then, used in several industrial applications such as flooring, insulations, and footwear. This paper focuses on a new application for old used tires (ground tire rubber, GTR). Tire dust and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) have been mixed, and the maximum accepted concentration of GTR can be attained while keeping dielectric, thermal, and mechanical properties within acceptable limits, and therefore their possible industrial application will be in manufacturing of, for example, dielectrics for capacitors, low‐voltage electric fences or electrical cable pipes, and trays. Actually, tire dust with particle sizes &lt;700 µm has been classified into three different groups depending on the particle sizes ( p &lt; 200, 200&lt; p &lt; 500, and p &gt; 500 µm). Afterward, ABS has been mixed with different concentrations of GTR, i.e., 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% and 70%, to establish its properties through thermal, mechanical, and dielectric tests. Finally, the fracture surfaces of the composite samples have been evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Multilayer films consisting of a core layer of nylon 6 sandwiched between two linear low‐density polyethylene layers were produced using a semi‐industrial cast film extrusion line. The core film was produced at different draw ratios from neat nylon and nylon/clay nanocomposite resins. The objective was to assess the replacement of neat nylon with a nylon/clay nanocomposite for the core layer of a multilayer film. Rheological experiments were carried out to characterize the resins and study the aspects of the extrusion process. It was observed that clay platelets could restrict chain mobility and intensify thermal degradation in melt processing; however, that could be balanced to some degree with a polycondensation reaction that increases the chain length and molecular weight. The crystalline structure of the films was examined by X‐ray, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared measurements. The clay inclusion favored the γ‐phase crystalline phase, which showed a lower melting point. Increasing the draw ratio from 6.5 to 13 during the extrusion process did not have a significant impact on the orientation of either nylon or nylon/clay in the core layer. The physical and mechanical properties of the films were studied and discussed. Replacement of nylon with the nylon/clay nanocomposite in the core layer did not yield a notable improvement in the tensile properties of multilayer films. However, the oxygen barrier property was improved by 48% when the nylon/clay nanocomposite was used as the core layer. The haze property was not affected by either changing the draw ratio or using the nanocomposite instead of nylon. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The fiber length did not significantly change irrespective of the presence of MAPP after compounding and injection molding. However, the tensile strength of PP /fiber showed significant improvement after MAPP addition. The interfacial shear strength between PP and fiber increased with the addition of MAPP . Examination of the failure surface of a dumbbell specimen after tensile testing confirmed that the fiber highly orientated in the flow direction in the PP / MAPP matrix. The tensile strength enhancement was attributed to the improvement of the interfacial shear strength between PP and fiber. Moreover, in the injection molding process, there was high orientation of the fiber in the flow direction when there was MAPP . We concluded that the presence of MAPP causes increased orientation of the fiber.",

Meloxicam ( MLX ) was selected as a model drug and buccal films were designed by using the solvent casting technique. A central composite rotatable design ( CCRD ) was used as a statistical tool to design and optimize the film formulations. No noticeable interaction was found between the drug and polymer when they were subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ). Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) revealed the smooth surface of the film and uniform mixing of drug and polymer. X‐ray diffractometry ( XRD ) was carried out to observe crystalline and amorphous nature of meloxicam. Differential scanning calorimetric ( DSC ) analysis was used to investigate the thermal behavior of free drug and drug‐loaded formulation. The prepared film showed good mechanical property as folding endurance was found to be greater than 100 in all formulations. The cumulative drug release was found to be more than 80% in initial at dissolution time of 5 min, when the prepared films were subjected to dissolution studies in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Thus, it can be concluded that the hydrophilic polymer and plasticizer have definite impact on formulation and characteristics of rapidly dissolving buccal films and have the ability to prepare a suitable immediate release buccal film of meloxicam.",

The GCA ‐P synthesized from fatty acid of palm oil was used to enhance adhesion at the filler–matrix surface interfaces. The results reveal that PP / CPH composites containing 40 phr filler loading and GCA ‐P exhibited higher processing torque and power law index ( n ). Higher melt viscosity was recorded at higher filler loading, owning to filler agglomeration and more effective filler‐matrix adhesion in the presence of GCA ‐P. As a result, higher energy was required to compound PP / CPH composites, which could be attributed to the increase in activation energy ( E a ) at higher melt viscosity.",

In this new configuration, one single‐tip screw element intermeshes with another two‐tip screw element at a speed ratio of 2. A numerical simulation of the three‐dimensional flow field in this new kind of conveying system, as well as in the conventional twin screw configuration, was carried out using the finite element method ( FEM ) and the mesh superposition technique ( MST ) provided by the commercial CFD code POLYFLOW . The purely viscous fluid is assumed to obey the Bird–Carreau constitutive model. Based on the predicted flow field in the domain FEM mesh, post‐treatment codes have been developed to predict the mixing details where standard fourth‐order Runge–Kutta schemes were used. Flow patterns and mixing dynamics were presented in terms of the mixing evolution of the particle group released from different initial positions and the variation of the variance index, mixing index, strain tensor magnitude, and their time histories. Trajectories of the particle groups were captured successfully, and an obvious difference with regard to flow pattern and mixing was found for different types of screw geometries. The numerical results showed that mixing was highly dependent on the initial position of the particles and that the nontwin screw configuration had better distributive and dispersive mixing abilities than the conventional twin screw configuration.",

The results showed that PUA coating could well cover the surface of the three kinds of materials. However, the coating performances varied among these substrates due to their different chemical and morphological surfaces. Due to the densified structures, small pores, and improved hydrophobicity of bamboo scrimber, it was difficult for PUA coating to wet and penetrate into the substrate, where the smaller contact angle and penetration depth were obtained compared with bamboo. In contrast, heat-treated one had better hydrophilicity and smaller contact angle with PUA coating than pure bamboo scrimber. Therefore, the coating performance of heat-treated bamboo scrimber was better with lower average roughness value.

Investigations on mechanical and wear characteristics of red mud epoxy based homogeneous and their functionally graded materials (FGMs) developed with an intent of probable application in tribological systems are presented. The influence of significant operational parameters, material parameters, and their subsequent influences among themselves are explored. A specially designed experimental series is performed on a pin-on-disk machine with three different sliding velocities 105, 209, and 314 cm/s under three different loading conditions of 20, 30, and 40 N and compares the experimental results with the reported theoretical wear model. Artificial neural network approach is also applied to the wear data for subsequent validation. The comparative study indicates that although the homogeneous composites and FGMs exhibit relatively inferior mechanical properties, the sliding wear performance of the FGMs is better than homogeneous composites. It is also found that out of all synthesized composites FGMs exhibit the maximum impact strength and tensile modulus, which clearly indicates that the gradation achieved because the centrifugation technique enhances the crack arresting capability of the materials. The measured Young's moduli of homogeneous composites and FGMs were compared to standard theoretical prediction models. The measured moduli values showed good harmony with those predicted from Halpin–Tsai and Kerner models. Transmission electron microscopy microstructures confirm the continuous graded dispersion of red mud particles in the matrix.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate an approach, using an ink‐jet printing system, to sustain the drug release by incorporating hydrogel microspheres within Lutrol F127. Various concentrations of Lutrol F127 and calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) were examined by rheology to determine the optimum combinations to use for injection and then blended with inkjet‐printed alginate microspheres. Drug release (FITC‐Dextran) from Lutrol F127 alone reached completion in less than 24 h. Release from alginate spheres alone showed a burst release and reached 100% in 6 h. Interestingly, the incorporation of microspheres within Lutrol F127 allowed a more sustained release profile and a slower burst release. By varying the quantity of microspheres, concentration of alginate, or ionic cross‐linking ratio, the release profile can be adjusted to suit the desired application.",

Their structures were characterized by FTIR, 1 H NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analyses. Their antimicrobial activities against three types of bacteria ( Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Escherichia coli ) and against three crop‐threatening pathogenic fungi ( Aspergillus fumigatus , Geotricum candidum , and Syncephalastrum racemosum ) were investigated. The results revealed that these derivatives are effective in inhibiting the growth of the tested bacteria and fungi as indicated from the inhibition zone diameter and minimum inhibitory concentration. The antibacterial activities of these derivatives were more effective against Gram‐positive bacteria than Gram‐negative bacteria. These derivatives were investigated as thermal stabilizers for rigid poly(vinyl chloride) at 180°C in air by measuring the rate of dehydrochlorination and the extent of discoloration. The results reveal the greater stabilizing efficiency of the investigated derivatives as shown by their longer thermal stability periods ( Ts ) and lower dehydrochlorination rates in relation to dibasic lead carbonate, cadmium–barium–zinc stearate, and n ‐octyltin mercaptide industrial stabilizers. The stabilizing efficiency increases with the introduction of electron‐donating substituent groups in the aromatic ring of the stabilizer molecules. Moreover, the investigated stabilizers impart better color stability for the degraded samples as compared with the reference stabilizers.",

Effect of immobilization conditions was investigated. The maximum obtained immobilization yield is 27 units g −1 while the maximum expressed activity is 12 µmol min −1 g −1 . The optimum pH of the free enzyme was observed at 5.2, whereas the optimum pH of the immobilized one was schiffed to 4.4. The optimum temperature for both the free and immobilized forms was recognized at 60°C. A change in the temperature profile of the immobilized enzyme below 60°C was observed when response to the elevation temperature was less than that to the free counterpart. The K m and V max values of the free and immobilized β‐galactosidase were found to be 52.03 and 123.1 mM, and 6.12 and 9.98 µ mol/min, respectively. Lactose hydrolysis, 500 mL of 100 mM concentration, was studied using 400 units of either free or immobilized enzymes at pH 6.0 and 60°C. Almost 80% hydrolysis percentage has been obtained after 6 h hydrolysis time with immobilized enzyme compared with 63% hydrolysis percentage obtained after 2 h for the free counterpart. Investigation of the operational stability at 40°C shows that the immobilized enzyme kept its activity for 5 h over 10 successive lactose hydrolysis cycles, which provides potentials for practical application in milk and whey hydrolysis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Polymer metal complexes, poly‐[DHPF‐M(II)Cl 2 ], were subsequently prepared with Co(II) and Ni(II) ions. The synthesized polymers were characterized by elemental and spectral analyses. The polymer metal complexes were evaluated as catalyst precursors for ethylene oligomerization, using methylaluminoxane as an activator. Different Al/M [M = Co(II) and Ni(II)] ratios were investigated at two different ethylene pressures. Poly‐[DHPF‐Co(II)Cl 2 ] ( C 1 ) and poly‐([DHPF‐Ni(II)Cl 2 ] ( C 2 ) were isolated as blue and green solids, respectively. Complex C 2 was found to be a more effective precatalyst than C 1 in the presence of a cocatalyst. Thus, C 2 exhibited the maximum activity of 1.92 × 10 6 g mol −1 (Ni) h −1 bar −1 with an Al/Ni ratio of 3000:1 at room temperature, whereas C 1 exhibited a maximum activity of 1.87 × 10 6 g mol −1 (Co) h −1 bar −1 with a 5‐atm pressure of ethylene. Upon increasing the Al/Co ratio at 1 atm pressure of ethylene, the catalytic activity of precatalyst increased and the process became more selective for higher oligomers. The catalytic activity and selectivity with 1‐decene using C 1 were 3.16 × 10 5 g mol −1 (Co) h −1 bar −1 and 72%, respectively, with 5 atm ethylene and an Al/Co ratio of 300:1. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To obtain the best optimized product, nine different formulations were developed using a central composite rotatable design. Avicel PH‐102, Magnesium stearate, and croscarmellose sodium were taken as independent variables. Micromeritic properties of powder blend showed excellent flow properties and were within USP limits. Tablets were compressed and before coating the core was tested for weight variations, hardness, thickness, friability disintegration, and dissolution. Tablets were film coated using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 5cps, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, and Instacoat blue, and again tested for the weight variations, assay, and single point dissolution. Three different dissolution media, i.e., 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) and phosphate buffer pH 4.5 and 6.8, were used for calculating the percentage release of Febuxostat and their release pattern was compared with an innovator brand by using the model‐independent methods such as similarity ( f 2 ), dissimilarity ( f 1 ), and model‐dependent methods such as first‐order, Hixson Crowell, and Weibull methods. The results revealed that Trial‐06 showed the maximum similarity, i.e., 81.18, 75.15, and 67.19 in three different pH dissolution media. Dissimilarity factor was also comparable in Trial 06, i.e., 5.21, 11.27, and 6.01 at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8, respectively. Model‐dependent approaches showed the maximum r 2 values for Trial 06, i.e., greater than 0.900 for all models in the above‐mentioned pH, whereas the overall release kinetics followed the Weibull model. Selected formulation was kept at 40 ± 5°C and 75 ± 2% relative humidity for accelerated stability studies, and no specific change was observed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, plastic film is essential in our daily lives. Among them, polypropylene has good physical properties, for example, tensile strength, impact strength, and transparency. Recently, it was found that the stretchability of polypropylene ( PP ) is improved by blending a small amount of low modulus polypropylene ( LMPP ) which is a low tacticity polypropylene. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of blending LMPP , which has different characteristic of resin such as tacticity and molecular weight, on PP and to study the mechanism of the structure formation in a biaxial stretching process. The blending of LMPP to PP reduces the spherulite size and increases the thickness of the amorphous phase in the lamella without changing the thickness of the crystal phase, namely the melting temperature. LMPP blends also reduced the yield stress during the stretching process and increased the stress buildup ratio. For these reasons, it improved film thickness uniformity of biaxially stretched film and reduced film break during the high production line. Furthermore, as the stretchable temperature window was widened to the low‐temperature side, the thickness uniformity was improved in the wide stretchable temperature. As a result, improving the stretchability and the film thickness uniformity of PP were achieved by blending LMPP to PP .",

The aim of this study was to find out the viscous and elastic parameters which can predict the foaming properties of PET . It is found that the foams of strain hardening PET have high expansion ratios and fine cell morphologies. This is correlated with the contribution of strain hardening to the improvement of melt strength and failure strain during elongational experiments. Basing on the fact that foamability of a material is governed by its strain hardening (a pure elastic behavior), a viscous parameter (complex viscosity), and an elastic parameter (loss tangent) obtained from dynamic shear rheology are well linked to the expansion ratios of foams. These two parameters formed an optimized viscoelastic window, which is suitable for foaming. This means the foamability of PET can be determined by viscous and elastic parameters without consideration of molecular constitution.",

Atomic force microscopy is used to study the distribution and surface morphology of MIP-silica hybrid particles. The responsive properties are studied by exposing the synthesized MIP-silica hybrid material to standard amlodipine drug solution and consequently monitoring the decrease in drug concentration. The control material, i.e., nonimprinted polymer- (NIP-) silica hybrid particles, exhibits much lower response during the drug rebinding assay suggesting the lack of functionality due to the absence of imprinting effects. The selectivity of MIP-silica hybrid particles is evaluated by examining the aspirin uptake that shows lower absorbance shifts for aspirin solution compared to amlodipine. It indicates a higher sensitivity of MIP-silica hybrid particles toward targeted pharmaceutical drug recognition and also exhibits their potential for drug assay in multiplex biological samples. Furthermore, MIP-silica hybrid particles used in the drug rebinding assay can be recovered and regenerated for subsequent tests without losing recognition properties.",

Six different types of foams viz. Highly elastic foam K5040, standard PU foam N5063, bonded polyurethane foam R100, viscoelastic foam V5020, self-extinguishing foam KF5560, and foam rubber were used. Short-term and long-term (24, 48, 72, 672 hours (28 day)) measurements were done to differentiate the role of primary emissions (present in new products) and secondary emissions (due to chemical reactions in material or slowly released due to the porous structure of material). The samples were collected using a small-space sampling chamber at a temperature of 23°C and a humidity of 50% depending on the aspect of time. The concentrations of VOC and TVOC were identified and quantified using a Gas chromatography–Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) based method. Based on the VOC measurements, the standard room concentrations were simulated to estimate the human health risk assessment for all six types of foams. The results of simulations suggest no possibility of human health risk for the very long period (28 days), as the estimated values were found to be much below the prescribed limits.",

To enhance the distinction between defective and defect-free region and eliminate the influence of the measurement noise and nonuniform background of the thermal image generated by PT, a number of thermographic data analysis approaches have been proposed. However, these traditional methods only consider the correlations among the pixel while leave the time series correlations unmodeled. In this paper, a sparse moving window principal component thermography (SMWPCT) method is proposed to incorporate several thermal images using the moving window strategy. Also, the sparse trick is used to provide clearer and more interpretable results because of the structure sparsity. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the defect detection experiment of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic specimens.",

The experimental results show that the flame-retardant cable can be ignited and continuously burnt at a certain wind speed, but the combustion can be restrained at high wind speed. The combustion speed of the flame-retardant cable is affected by the fire load and ventilation speed. The combustion droplets can change the shape of the flame, which can consequently ignite other combustible materials.

PAEK-COOH with a poly (aryl ether ketone) backbone endows superior thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, while PBI-4NH 2 serves as both a proton conductor and a crosslinker with basic imidazole groups to absorb phosphoric acid. Moreover, the composite membrane of PAEK- cr -PBI blended with linear PBI (PAEK- cr -PBI@PBI) was also prepared. Both membranes with a proper phosphoric acid (PA) uptake exhibit an excellent proton conductivity of around 50 mS cm -1 at 170°C, which is comparable to that of the well-documented PA-doped PBI membrane. Furthermore, the PA-doped PAEK- cr -PBI membrane shows superior mechanical properties of 17 MPa compared with common PA-doped PBI.

The resulted disks were then loaded by caffeine, a moderately soluble model drug, using soaking method. The swelling and the drug release experiments were carried out in enzyme‐free simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The release experiments showed that with the addition of MMT, the burst effect is well controlled, and the barrier property of nanocomposite hydrogels is improved. The effects of some compositional parameters including maleic acid to acrylamide (MA/AAm) molar ratio (MA R ), weight percent of MMT (MMT%), cross‐linker/AAm molar ratio ( C R ), and also the influence of pH of medium on the equilibrium swelling ratio ( Q ) as well as caffeine release behavior of disks were studied by Taguchi method. The results indicated that shifting the pH value from 1.2 to 7.4 leads to a greater Q . The Q value and the release percentage ( P %) increased with increasing the MA R in the structure of disks at pH 7.4. The amounts of P % and Q in both external media decreased with increasing both MMT% and C R . Mathematical behavior of release process was well represented by Peppas Power law model (at short times) and a two‐dimensional Fickian mass transfer model (at long times). The caffeine release behavior in both media was corresponded to the non‐Fickian transport mechanism.",

Wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that exclusive stereocomplex‐type poly(lactide acid) (sc‐PLA) with relatively high crystallinity could be obtained at lower (0°C) temperature. During solution mixing process, increasing stirring speed within range 0–200 rpm was conductive to the formation of sc‐PLA. However, excessive stirring speed gave rise to a decrease in sc‐PLA production. During solvent evaporation process, addition of shaking could effectively improve formation of sc‐PLA, wherein crystallinity of sc‐PLA approached the maximum value as shaking speed reach 100 rpm. These suggest that lower temperature and appropriate external force are positive to the formation of sc‐PLA in PLLA/PDLA blends.",

This paper provides a novel strategy for constructing refractory and thermostable PLA composites using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) chemically modified with ammonium polyphosphate (APP). XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, and TEM confirm that the goal of LDHs has been successfully prepared. The thermal stability and combustion behavior of PLA composites were evaluated by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry tests (CCT). The crystallization behavior and tensile performances were also examined. The results showed that the incorporation of 15 wt% MgAlY-APP-LDHs practically makes the PLA composites reach the UL-94 V-0 grade. There were 43% and 20% reduction in the PHRR and THR of PLA/15APP-LDHs respectively due to the catalytic effect of Y elements and barrier effects of LDHs, which was a major performance against fire hazards. Furthermore, the increase in crystallinity and the decrease in mechanical strength of PLA composites are attributed to the nucleation of LDHs. In short, this research introduces the production of multifunctional PLA composites through APP intercalation of LDHs, which are deemed as prospective candidates for the next generation of sustainable plastics products.",

An effective hybrid intelligent control approach with less computing resources for real-time implementation based on the deep learning (DL) method to mimic the classical model predictive control rule is developed to deal with the tracking control of the injection speed. The proposed method utilizes the gated recurrent unit neural network to learn and predict the optimal time series control process data produced by the traditional model predictive controller. The benefits of this approach over the conventional optimization method are illustrated through simulation results, which show that the convergent DL-based controller can effectively avoid the complex calculation in the control process of IMMs and meet the requirements of more robustness and resist environmental uncertainty to a certain level and can be potentially implemented in embedded hardware much more efficiently and conveniently with a smaller memory footprint and faster computation time.",

    "abstract": "With a deeper understanding of the aging process, injectable dermal fillers have revolutionized cosmetic dermatology and plastic surgery. These minimally invasive treatments address signs of aging, such as wrinkles, fine lines, and volume loss. The market for injectable dermal fillers expands yearly, with each product offering unique compositions that influence therapeutic outcomes, handling properties, and potential adverse effects. Fillers are generally classified into three major types: temporary, semi‐permanent, and permanent. Temporary fillers, including hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (COL)‐based options, provide reliable correction but typically have limited longevity. Semi‐permanent and permanent fillers, made from synthetic materials like poly‐L‐lactic acid and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), offer extended durations of neocollagenesis. This review focuses specifically on COL‐based fillers, discussing both FDA‐approved products and those still in the research stage.",

    "abstract": "Crosslinking agarose with bisoxiranes and epihalohydrins has been explored for years and is widely applied in the manufacturing of chromatography beads as industrial standard. Nevertheless, the effect on the molecular structure of agarose and the resulting consequences when used as chromatographic adsorber are poorly investigated. Agarose beads modified with 1,4‐butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) and epichlorohydrin (ECH), respectively, were characterized regarding their pore size and diffusion coefficients. Modification with BDDE led to reduced pore sizes, whereas no influence could be observed when using ECH. After functionalization as cation exchanger, BDDE‐ and ECH‐modified beads were analyzed among others regarding their binding capacity of lysozyme and γ‐globulin. Therefore, the hypothesis of crosslinking‐induced diffusion limitation, especially with BDDE, could be further strengthened. Finally, the data were described by calculating the static binding capacity and diffusion coefficient using a cubic grid model and Ogston model, respectively. Overall, those simplified models describe the data quite accurate, whereas the deviation of the model from the static binding capacity is 4% ± 17%, from the diffusion coefficient of the BDDE‐ or ECH‐modified beads 1% ± 16% and from the effective diffusion coefficient of the further sulfonated and column packed beads 11% ± 27%.",

The primary problem faced by plastic converters is the presence of superficial paint. In this study, we evaluate the implementation of chemical methods with varying conditions to remove paint from used bumpers thermoformed with polypropylene, with the aim of valorizing the plastic waste from these bumpers. We examine the various process variables, such as reagent concentration, temperature, time, and pH. Additionally, we analyze procedures to quantify the paint content in the different recycled samples and use this as a tool to compare the effectiveness of different paint removal processes.",

To evaluate the prediction accuracy and capability of the proposed method, three different algorithms, namely Levenberg–Marquardt (lm), BGFS quasi‐Newton (bfg), and scale conjugate gradient (scg), were included in the proposed model. The generated models were validated by comparing the experimental and ANN results, which showed good quantitative agreement. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using the R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values, which indicated that scg exhibited the best performance with an R 2 of 0.9655 and an RMSE of 0.0223. The relative contribution plot of the ANN models showed that packing pressure had a stronger influence than mold temperature, filling time, and melt temperature.

This study aimed to investigate the potential of Ethiopian highland bamboo Arundinaria alpina for NC extraction by using acid hydrolysis. An experimental design incorporating response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to identify the optimal hydrolysis process parameters for NC extraction. The optimum conditions for NC extraction were a reaction time of 60 min, temperature of 40°C, and acid concentration of 61.40 wt%, with a yield of 43.15%. Bamboo and extracted NC were characterized for their chemical composition, particle size distribution, and crystallinity, using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The resulting NC had a particle size of 79.64 nm. XRD analysis revealed the crystallinity indices of the bamboo and its corresponding NC was 44.60% and 74.07%, respectively.

In this study, we designed and evaluated four scaffold models with different architectures (regular Voronoi (Rv), irregular Voronoi (Iv), Star (S), and Vintiles (V) structures). Additionally, the scaffolds were designed with four different porosities (50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%), and 16 scaffold models were designed and manufactured using the three‐dimensional (3D) printing (3DP) method. The models were fabricated using two photosensitive resins (50% PLA‐Pro resin and 50% P‐CROWN [zirconia and ceramic]). Thus, the models’ mechanical properties were tested using compression tests. The results showed porosity plays an essential role in scaffold mechanical behavior. Moreover, the architecture was effective in the mechanical performance of the models. The elastic modulus of the models was 4–30 MPa, which is close to trabecular bone mechanical properties. The S‐50 model showed a maximum stress of 17.75 MPa, which was 20 times higher than the S‐80 model. Similar results were visible in other groups of scaffolds. In all four groups, 50% and 80% porosity scaffolds showed the highest and lowest mechanical strength, respectively. The results of this study showed that the Voronoi structure mimics bone morphology with a stochastic porosity and demonstrated a mechanical property similar to the scaffold with regular structures, which confirms its compatibility with bone tissue engineering. The outcomes of this study shed more light on scaffold design and fabrication for bone defects.",

Their performance can be further enhanced through the incorporation of various additives designed for specific applications. In the present study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), recognized for their high mechanical properties, were employed as a reinforcing agent. CNCs were incorporated into the epoxy resin at loading ratios of 0.0625%, 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5% to produce the nanocomposites. According to the obtained results, the lowest reductions observed in flexural and tensile strengths were 13% and 16%, respectively, while the highest increases in flexural and tensile modulus were 18% and 50%, respectively. Morphological analyses revealed that CNCs were not homogeneously distributed within the matrix, particularly at higher concentrations, where agglomeration likely contributed to the observed declines in mechanical performance. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated a slight improvement in thermal stability at lower CNC loadings; however, thermal stability diminished at higher CNC concentrations. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the neat epoxy exhibited the highest crystallinity index (CI, 62%), which progressively decreased with increasing CNC content, resulting in a more amorphous nanocomposite structure.",

In order to improve the flavor release ability of menthol and to achieve a temperature‐controlled release of menthol, chitosan (CS) and polycaprolactone (PCL) are used as raw materials to prepare nanofibrous membranes by electrostatic spinning and menthol‐loaded nanofibrous membranes are subsequently prepared by incorporating a menthol flavor. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), XRD, and solid‐state NMR are applied to characterize the morphology and chemical structure of the nanofibrous membranes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to test the thermal stability and release characteristics of the menthol‐loaded nanofibrous membranes. The gas chromatography (GC) assay shows that the CS/PCL nanofibrous membrane has a menthol loading of 57.64% and can gradually release menthol from 85 to 260°C, thus, achieving a temperature‐controlled release of menthol. A 14‐day stability test shows that the nanofibrous membrane retains menthol up to 40.23% and cytotoxicity experiments confirm their good biocompatibility and biosafety. The method of embedding menthol proposed in this paper can offer the possibility of controlling the temperature to release menthol and providing potential ideas for the application of menthol in food and pharmaceuticals.",

This work aims to offer a computational evaluation of the mechanical and thermal performance of an ankle‐foot orthosis (AFO). A thorough three‐dimensional (3D) model of the AFO was built, and meshing with more than 5000 components was executed to guarantee that the simulation is correct under temperature and fatigue stress conditions. Whereas PP and TPEs have ultimate tensile strength (UTS) values of 32 and 20 MPa, respectively, CFRP boasts the highest mechanical strength with a UTS of 340 MPa and a modulus of elasticity of 25 GPa. With its greatest modulus of elasticity, CFRP shows the best mechanical strength among the materials. Although TPEs showed notable distortion, thermal simulations showed that CFRP kept dimensional stability under heat. CFRP improved fatigue life by more than 30%, compared to PP and TPEs. CFRP is thus the substance most suitable for usage under high degrees of stress over a long length of time. Under physiological stresses, the enhanced general structural stability and 27% reduction in peak stress from the optimal design are guaranteed. These results underline the need for choosing composite materials in terms of enhancing the performance of AFOs as well as their lifetime and heat resistance in orthopedic uses. This guarantees the orthosis keeps its structural integrity and fit throughout usage, therefore improving patient comfort and functional support.",

The purpose to apply the silver nitrate and rPET nanofiber mat is to enhance the performance properties of packaging materials like mechanical strength, thermal insulation, moisture resistance, and antibacterial properties.

The membranes were fabricated using a solvent casting method with varying mass ratios of NA:TCH (0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1) and subsequently cross‐linked with calcium chloride. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis demonstrated that the membranes were structures without visible NA crystals, indicating good compatibility between the antimicrobial agents and the polymer matrix. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results suggested that the interactions between the bioactive compounds and the ALG–CMC matrix were relatively weak. The incorporation of antimicrobial agents did not cause significant changes in the swelling behavior (~603%–636%), weight loss profile (75%–77%), tensile strength (~22−24 MPa), and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR; 1.3–1.5 mg/cm 2 ·h) of the membranes.

The performance of the developed method was verified by observation of morphology development in a polypropylene/polyamide-6 blend system along a screw section. A difference in morphology development caused by a variation of the screw rotational speed was observed. Furthermore, drop deformations in partially filled screw sections could be detected. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv in Polym Techn 16: 1–10, 1997",

    "abstract": "Abstract A chemical modification method has been developed to convert lignin into lignin–styrene graft copolymers. The graft products are macromolecular surface active agents because, within each molecule, a hydrocarbon sidechain has been grown off of a natural oxyphenylpropyl backbone. Surface activity of the graft copolymers was indicated by their capacity to form stable emulsions between incompatible fluid phases and to adhesively bond to wood surfaces. Dynamic contact angle measurement using the Wilhelmy plate technique showed that the graft copolymers changed the contact angle of water on wood from 50° to 110°. Coating birch wood ( Betula papyrifera ) with lignin–styrene graft copolymerization product increases the water contact angle and the binding strength of polystyrene on the wood. Lap shear strengths increased 56%, from 1826 to 2840 kPa, when the wood was coated with a graft copolymer containing 51.7% lignin. Binding was tested by coating the birch with a solution of graft copolymer, drying the wood, injection molding polystyrene onto the surface of the wood, and pulling the polystyrene off the wood surface in a lap shear brace. These properties of the copolymers were used to design a process for forming wood‐thermoplastic composites. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The surface composition and surface morphology of the hybrid film were studied extensively. Attenuated total reflectance spectra of infrared analyses showed an enrichment of fluorine‐containing polymer and silica particles on the surface. Using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Ar + etching, it was confirmed that a higher concentration than the calculated value of fluorine element was found on the surface of the fluorinated hybrid film, and the amount of silica increased from the very surface to the near surface. The fluorinated alkyl side chains of the fluorinated polymethacrylate were found to orient toward the surface. It is inferred that the silica particles prevent the migration of fluorine‐containing chains for some kind of effect. A comparison of surface topography between the fluorinated PUA film and the fluorinated PUA/SiO 2 hybrid film was carried out using atomic force microscopy. Finally, the surface property of the hybrid coating was also determined by contact angle measurement. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract We have taken blends of a bitumen with three homopolymers that produce systems softer than the bitumen, and to each have added small quantities of different semicrystalline polyolefins. The intention is to discover whether these will form an extensive network system within a blend with a low T g in which crystallites create the cross‐links, as may happen with the isotactic polypropylene present in some atactic polypropylene systems. Such thermoplastic cross‐links might provide a useful feature for certain uses, such as in built‐up roofing membranes. These were found only within one blend based upon the polybutadiene, in two blends based upon chlorinated polyethylene, but in none based on the Lycra ® , whose blends with LLDPEs and the HDPE flowed below the crystal melting temperature. The E ′′ plots indicate the presence of many loss processes within the blends at low temperatures: the tan δ plots show other processes active up to 200°C within the soft matter. The behavior we discovered suggests that the properties of binary polymer blends are not associated solely with the components, but that, when the material is stiff or after heating, certain polymer—bitumen interactions may also be significant, and are sensitive to slight differences of structure between LLDPEs, even when present at the 3.4% level. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the ever growing and more complex demands on the properties of polymer materials, raw material producers and plastic processing industries are more and more interested in the continuous synthesis and modification of polymers. In this article the production of polystyrene and styrene–isoprene copolymers by anionic s‐butylithium initiated bulk polymerization in a co‐rotating close intermeshing twin screw extruder is described. In spite of high reaction temperatures of above 200°C the polystyrene stays “living,” which makes it possible to modify it in the melt by adding more monomers. The following processing methods were developed and analyzed: (1) homopolymerization of styrene; (2) copolymerization of styrene–isoprene monomer mixtures; (3) sequential polymerization of styrene and isoprene. The polymerized material resulting from the above‐mentioned processes differed considerably in structural features and final properties depending on the process parameters. As for homopolymerization of styrene, the influence of the process parameters screw rotation speed and screw geometry on the range of molecular weight distribution was investigated. Products made according to the two copolymerization methods were analyzed with regard to their structure and mechanical properties. The tests revealed that for sequential copolymerization the temperature in the polymerization zone has a decisive influence on the product quality. The influence of the screw rotation speed is less important. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The effect of composition of the composites on tensile strength, Young's modulus, tensile toughness, elongation, and impact strength was determined through two 2 3 factorial rotatable designs. The results of this investigation show that both the m‐phenylene dismaleimide‐modified polypropylene precompounded sawdust as well as solid‐state modified maleated polypropylene can be successfully used to prepare sawdust‐filled polypropylene composites with good tensile strength. On the whole, this property improved compared to that of unfilled polypropylene. According to the analysis of factorial design, the optimum composition to prepare a composite with highest tensile strength within the experimental range was 30–40 wt% phenolic resin coated sawdust together with 4–6wt% solid‐state modified maleated polypropylene; while the product composition for the worst design was a combination of high amount of phenolic resin modified polypropylene with phenolic resin coated sawdust. The experimental design also concluded that effect of compositions on impact strength of composites was not significant in most of the cases. Overall, the empirical models constructed in this study provided a good approximation to actual experimental measurements; we are encouraged to extend this approach to processing conditions for manufacturing these composites. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Blends of high viscosity polypropylene (PP) and low viscosity low density polyethylene (LDPE) were prepared in the Brabender batch intensive mixer. The rheological mismatch of these immiscible blend components resulted in coarse blend morphologies and poor mechanical properties. By reacting these blends with 1800 ppm Lupersol 101 peroxide at 180°C, the morphology became much finer and, at 50/50 weight ratio, assumed co‐continuous phase structure. As a result, the mechanical properties improved significantly. The above observations are attributable to the fact that the peroxide reaction at this level of concentration removes the rheological disparity of the blend components, a condition that is more favorable for efficient dispersive mixing. It has been frequently stated that the scale and uniformity of dispersive mixing affects the uniformity and controllability of reactions occuring in molten blends. This work shows, for the first time, that reactions with peroxides alter the blend morphology in a beneficial manner. The two phenomena are, therefore, mutually dependent. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

This report assesses the rotomoldability of two‐layer polyethylene foamed parts. The polymeric material used in this study was linear low‐density polyethylene and the foaming material was an endothemic chemical blowing agent. Two different molding methods, by powder and by pellet, were used to mold the multilayer foamed parts. Rotational molding experiments were carried out in a laboratory scale uniaxial machine, capable of measuring internal mold temperature in the cycle. Characterization of molded part properties was performed after molding. Optical microscopy was also employed to determine the bubble distribution in foamed parts. The final goal of this study was to investigate how the blowing agent and processing conditions can influence the process of rotational molding and the final product quality. It was found that the rotational molding of two‐layer polyethylene foams produced parts of better impact properties, as well as fine outside surfaces. In addition, rotational molding of foamed parts by pellets saves the cost of powder grinding, but is counteracted by uneven inner surfaces. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

These functions have a varying number of parameters and offer different behaviors with increasing complexity. Three of the functions are tested with the experimental data of two grades of polycarbonate. The tests show that these functions may be suitable for different sets of experimental data.

The need for new polymeric materials with tailored properties has driven the interest of industry and academia toward polymer blends. Vegetable oils are known to possess varying amounts of triglycerides having different unsaturation in their chains. Blending of commercial polymers with vegetable oil derived polymers is, therefore, expected to show synergetic behavior in terms of compatibility, physical, and mechanical characteristics with the latter. In an attempt to develop a biodegradable packaging material, blends of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and castor oil epoxy (COE) were synthesized in the weight ratios of 70/30, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60, and 30/70 by a microwave method. The effect of COE component as well as microwave irradiation on the compatibility and microstructural properties of the blends was investigated using spectral, viscometric, thermal, and morphological techniques. We observed tremendous improvement in mechanical properties after microwave irradiation for 120 s in COE/PVA 70/30 blend due to optimum cross‐linking through hydrogen bond formation among the blend components. These results were supported by the SEM as well the TEM data. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 30: 96–109, 2011; View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

The procedure for forming the backbone (GMA–MMA) consisted of two polymerization steps; step 1 was performed under excess solvent and step 2 involved the introduction of additional monomer except solvent owing to the high degree of polymerization at a minimum solvent. The use of these separate steps during GMA–MMA polymerization improved the degree of conversion (DC) during polymerization optimization. The DC was estimated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectroscopy. The behaviors of AA and GMA in the copolymer were interpreted on the basis of the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and the molecular weight ( M w ).The hardness and flexibility of the film were monitored with respect to the molar ratios of GMA/MMA and AA/GMA, respectively; the optimized molar ratios of GMA/MMA and AA/GMA were 1.6 and 1.8, respectively.

Dialdehyde starch ( DAS ) was used as a cross‐linking agent for the materials. The structure of the obtained materials was studied using infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope imaging. The properties of the 3D materials such as density, porosity, swelling ability and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that 3D composites made from collagen, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid with magnetic particles are hydrophilic with a high swelling ability (up to 2,646%). Cross‐linking of such biopolymeric materials with DAS alters the swelling degree and porosity of materials. The cross‐linking process has no significant effect on the density of the materials. The addition of magnetic particles to Coll/ CTS / HA materials decreases its swelling ability (1,795% for material containing 30% of magnetic particles) and increases the density of the studied materials. 3D materials based on Coll/ CTS / HA with magnetic particles are rigid and inflexible. With the increasing content of magnetic particles in the polymer blend, the Young's modulus decreases. 3D material with magnetite particles can be used in biomedical applications, such as tissue repair and drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research evaluates performance of an acrylamide‐based polymer which can be used for displacing reservoir oil. Three associated polymeric systems were proposed based on hydrolyzed polyacrylamide ( HPAM ), reported PAAHO , and the novel synthesized and characterized functionalized copolymer PAAHAI . Polymer solution behaviors were used to examine the changes in viscosity when the polymer was applied under certain reservoir conditions. PAAHAI showed a higher resistance and tolerance to temperature and salt content than HPAM and PAAHO . The antimicrobial degradation rates of PAAHAI could reach up to 13.2% and 21.7% for Bacillus sp. PAH ‐2 and Pseudomonas sp. LP ‐7, respectively. The inhibition efficiency of PAAHAI could reach as high as 93.08% in 1M HC l at 25°C. These results indicate that PAAHAI can be suitable for application in enhanced oil recovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Considered that unsaturated polyester resin ( UPR ) as one of the most commonly used thermoset materials often exhibit severe fire hazards, graphene can be used to act as barriers to enhance the flame retardancy of UPR . However, graphene easily shows irreversible aggregation when being introduced into polymer matrix, which limits its further application in industry. In this work, we synthesized a novel organophosphorus oligomer ( DHP ), which contained double bond and multivalent phosphorus (−1 and +5) with highly effective flame retardancy, onto graphene oxide via in situ atom‐transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ). Then, the obtained graphene‐ DHP was incorporated into UPR matrix by curing. The homogeneous dispersion of graphene‐ DHP in UPR matrix was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). The addition of 2.0 wt% graphene‐ DHP significantly improved the flame retardancy of UPR /graphene‐ DHP nanocomposites, which was demonstrated by the peak of heat release rate ( PHRR ) decreased by 41.79%. Moreover, it is found that graphene‐ DHP in nanocomposites cannot only act as barriers, but also catalyze the char formation in condensed phase as well as capture free radicals in gaseous phase. This work provides a feasible approach to combine graphene and phosphorus‐containing flame retardant and would also trigger more scientific interest in exploiting new type nanocomposites for flame retardants.",

The mechanical and electromagnetic properties were measured with an electronic tensile testing machine and a network analyzer, respectively. Results indicate that CIP was oxidized by oxygen in the aging process and produced reactive oxygen species, which catalyzed the cross‐linking of VMQ . The increased cross‐linking density changed the mechanical properties and enhanced the thermal stability of the CIP / VMQ composite‐absorbing material. Thermal aging gradually penetrated the surface and proceeded into the interior of the material. The microwave‐absorbing properties deteriorated after hot‐air aging.",

FTIR analysis showed that clay particles altered the shape of the observation band of RPP , indicating the presence of a chemical interaction between the clay and RPP matrix. The increased storage and loss moduli indicated that the Tunisian clay had a reinforcing effect on the RPP matrix. In differential scanning calorimetry analysis, crystallization temperature (Tc) increased with clay content, indicating that the addition of Tunisian organoclay accelerated the crystallization of the RPP matrix. The slight decrease in melting temperature (Tm) with increasing clay loading could be due to PP ‐g‐ MA , which affects the mobility of macromolecular chains.",

Such mPE nanocomposites were compounded in a twin‐screw extruder followed by injection molding. The effects of SEBS elastomer and SiC p additions on the structure, thermal and mechanical behavior, and fracture toughness of mPE composites were studied using X‐ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heat deflection temperature (HDT), tensile test, Izod impact, and essential work of fracture (EWF) techniques. XRD and POM results showed that SEBS and SiC p additions reduce the crystallite thickness and spherulite size of mPE. DSC and HDT measurements revealed that SiC p addition promotes nucleation of HDPE crystals and markedly increases the range of elevated temperature over which mPE hybrids maintain adequate stiffness. Tensile test results showed that SEBS reduces the Young's modulus and yield strength of mPE, whereas SiC p stiffens and reinforces the mPE/SEBS blend. The Izod impact test was conducted at liquid nitrogen temperature. The impact strength of mPE/SEBS/SiC p hybrids improved dramatically with increasing SEBS content. EWF results obtained at room temperature showed that the specific EWF of mPE/SEBS blends and mPE/SEBS/SiC p hybrids also increases with increasing SEBS content. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The dielectric constant values have been found to be lower for fiber‐filled systems than for the gum.

    "abstract": "Abstract Several researches and developmental work efforts were made to synthesize what is called tailored polymeric materials with new characteristics based on pregelled starch through a number of processes, which in turn entailed several chemical treatments. This was done by subjecting the pregelled starch as a starting substrate to acid hydrolysis to obtain pregelled starch having different molecular sizes. The latter were carbamoylethylated using acrylamide and sodium hydroxide at different duration, and then grafted with different monomers using potassium permanganate/citric acid redox system for initiating grafting. Furthermore, harnessing of the newly tailored pregelled starch‐derived products as sizing agent of cotton textiles was studied systematically. It is shown from the data that (a) the extent of carbamoylethylation expressed as N% increases by increasing the extent of hydrolysis and duration; (b) the graft yield expressed as mmol monomer/100 g sample of different monomers onto carbamoylethylated pregelled starch and carbamoylethylated hydrolyzed pregelled starches increases by increasing the extent of carbamoylethylation and the degree of hydrolysis, and follows the order: methacrylamide &gt; methacrylonitrile &gt; methacrylic acid; and (c) cotton fabrics sized with grafted carbamoylethylated hydrolyzed pregelled starch acquire higher mechanical properties, i.e., tensile strength, elongation at break, and abrasion resistance values than hydrolyzed pregelled starches, carbamoylethylated pregelled starch, and carbamoylethylated hydrolyzed pregelled starches. Using the above tailored modified pregelled starch‐derived products in sizing of cotton textiles contributed to the reinforcement of the cotton textile after sizing to over come the forced loss in fabrics/yarns during spinning process, as shown above. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

De‐PDPA pellets were doped with hydrochloric acid at various doping ratios. PDPA and its blends with polyethylene oxide (PEO) added at various ratios were successfully fabricated into fibers by electrospinning and cast into films. The De‐PDPA pellet doped at the doping ratio of 100 has the highest electrical conducitivity sensitivity toward methanol vapor. The electrical conductivity sensitivity of the PDPA electrospun fiber is relatively lower than those of the D‐PDPA cast films under methanol vapor. The methanol vapor induces a higher degree of crystallinity in the conductive polymer matrix and resultant higher electron mobility.

Nano‐silica is an inorganic compound with a surface area of 200 m 2 /g, and it has a hygroscopic property so that the presence of nano‐silica in membrane can increase properties of membrane. The SPS ‐ LS ‐ SO 2 membranes were prepared by casting polymer solution and membranes were characterized by functional groups analysis, water uptake, ion exchange capacity ( IEC ), proton conductivity, methanol permeability, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and surface morphology. The results show the increase of nano‐silica composition in SPS ‐ LS ‐SiO 2 membranes, the IEC , water uptake, proton conductivity increase, but a pore size of membrane decreases. On the other hand, it can maintain the mechanical strength of membranes. The SPS ‐ LS ‐SiO 2 membranes with nano‐silica composition of 2%–5% (w/w) have the same properties with Nafion ® 117, especially in proton conductivity at the same treatment and measurement conditions, and its methanol permeability is about 28%–35% smaller than that of Nafion ® 117 (2.09 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s), so this SPS ‐ LS ‐SiO 2 membrane could be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cell ( DMFC ) application.",

In the present study bio‐based polyurethane have been synthesized from the vegetable oil i.e., dehydrated castor oil, 1,4‐butanediol and isophorone diisocyanate in presence of a catalyst by solution polymerization method. Then polyurethane nanocomposites were synthesized using different amount of nanoclay (C30B) (1, 3 and 5 wt%). The synthesis of polyurethane and its nanocomposites were confirmed by FTIR and XRD analysis. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength (2.2–4.5 MP a), elongation at break (299%–435%) hardness (46–70) and abrasion resistance (351–201 mg/1,000 cycles) increased with the increase of nanoclay content. The initial thermal degradation temperature found to increase from (220 to 290°C) with the increase of nanoclay content in the nanocomposites. The nanoclay was interacted with the hard segment of the matrix polymer as reflected from the atomic force microscopy studies. Weathering study revealed that nanocomposites have higher weather resistance capacity than pristine polyurethane. It can be concluded that the prepared nanocomposites might be good outdoor topcoat materials.",

A freeze–thaw process was employed to cross‐link the polyvinyl alcohol chains and a calcium chloride solution was used to cross‐link the acylated chitosan mixture in the presence of honey to precipitate out a flexible and tough hydrogel. The CaCl 2 content was optimized for the best results which was 0.1 mass%. The characterization such as mechanical, thermal, water content, and cell culture studies of all the synthesized double‐network hydrogel systems were investigated. In the presence of the acylated chitosan and honey almost all the investigated properties of the samples were improved. The formulation was optimized using deferent amount of CaCl 2 . Mechanical testing of the optimized formulation displayed a maximum value of 0.55 MP a and 310% for tensile strength and elongation at break. Swelling studies indicated that optimized formulation hydrogel absorbed much water as compare with honey‐free hydrogels due to increased amounts of network connectivity and higher hydrophilicity. Thermal analysis of the samples indicated that synthesized double‐network hydrogel network also decreased thermal stability and showed synergistic effects on the improvement of char residues. In addition, cell culture studies showed an appropriate biocompatibility behavior without showing any sign of cytotoxicity.",

It was demonstrated that large agglomerates were not observed indicating the uniform distribution of modified silica throughout the PDMS matrices. It is noted that the ethanol diffusivity and the water contact angles were both increased remarkably, being beneficial to the preferential permeation of ethanol through the membranes. The pervaporation results showed that the addition of the two types of modified silica nanoparticles dramatically enhanced both the permeability and selectivity of hybrid membranes. Compared to APTS, silica modified by TSED at the concentration of 4 wt. % resulted in the optimum pervaporation membranes with the maximum separation factor of 12.09 and the corresponding permeation flux of approximately 234.0 g·m −2 ·h −1 in a binary aqueous mixture at 40°C containing 10 wt. % ethanol.

The presence of ATBN coating on EGN particles was characterized by using multiple analytical tools such as X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X‐ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, and scanning electron microscope. The level of ATBN coating of the EGN particles strongly depended on the coating concentration, and it was clearly demonstrated. The characterization results were consistent with each other, indicating that the elastomeric coating of EGN with ATBN was performed successfully. The 1 wt% EGN coated with 10 wt% ATBN incorporated into epoxy increased the toughness of epoxy by 18%. It turns out that the elastomeric coating of EGN with ATBN effectively contributed to toughen epoxy with a very small amount of 0.1 wt% ATBN compared to the epoxy. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The commercial Bis‐GMA contained restorative material 3M ESPS Filtek TM Z250 was used as a control. The results showed that GEC‐66% had higher DC and WS, comparable shrinkage and solubility, and less cytotoxicity, when compared with Z250. Though FS of GEC‐66% was lower than that of Z250, it still met the ISO requirement for polymer‐based restorative materials. All of these proved that GEC‐66% had potential to be used in clinic.",

Furthermore, the SFCM/UP composite was prepared by rolling and molding techniques. Effects of SFCM content on mechanical and wear properties of the UP composites were studied. Structure and properties of the in situ SFCM/UP resin and its composites were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared, polarized optical microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and other methods. The results showed that the addition of SFCM by in situ polymerization significantly improves the thermal stability of UP: The decomposition temperature ( T d5 ) of SFCM/UP in situ resin, at thermal weight loss of 5%, is increased by 16°C compared to that of the pure UP resin. On a condition that the SFCM content was 2%, the impact strength, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of SFCM/UP composites are higher than those of UP composites by 41.08%, 52.52%, and 32.31%, respectively. Moreover, the addition of SFCM significantly enhances the wear properties of unsaturated polyester composite at 200°C; the volume wear rate of SFCM/UP composite is lower than that of UP composites by 64%, indicating SFCM could significantly strengthen and toughen UP composites.",

The blending of nanoparticles did not affect the optical properties of the two materials as indicated by the UV–vis absorption spectra. The photoluminescence spectra of the blend nanoparticles reveal an efficient charge separation reflected by the quenching of the P3HT emission band by the PCBM. The quenching efficiency increases as the content of the PCBM increases. Good layer morphologies were obtained from casting the blend nanoparticles. The layer morphology was further improved by thermal annealing as indicated from the atomic force microscopy results.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Applying stress in the fiber axis direction during the prestabilization process is the best method to control entropic relaxation. Evaluation of entropic stress is necessary for exact determination of required imposed stress. Accordingly, in this paper three types of special‐grade polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers with different physical‐mechanical properties and morphological characteristic are studied. To determine thermal‐induced entropic stresses, we use the thermomechanical analysis method from room temperature to beginning of chemical reactions under certain stresses. It is shown that three thermophysical behaviors including the first return, second return, and sans return occurs under certain stresses during the thermal process. There are distinct temperatures for the first and second return behaviors, in which fibers return to primary length after shrinkage or elongation. These temperatures depend on imposed stress during prestabilization. We found that if no elongation or fiber shrinkage occurs in a specific stress and temperature, it shows that imposed stress is equivalent to thermal entropic stress. Changes in shrinkage as a function of temperature for various external imposed stresses are also observed. According to our findings, the onset of entropic stress strongly depends on the orientation index of the paracrystalline region. The maximum entropic stress occurs in the rubbery flow region in amorphous phases and can be obtained from a derivative of the second‐order polynomial trend line of the entropic stress–temperature diagram.",

Dry carbon fabrics were covered with electrospun veils and then infused with an unmodified epoxy resin to prepare reinforced laminates.

The compounding process based on three extrusions without filtration led to a filter pressure value ( FPV ) reduction of about 84% and a relative color strength ( RCS ) increase of about 50% with respect to the standard production process (i.e single extrusion). The thermal stability of the prepared compounds was evaluated by rheological test, viscosity measurements, and end group analysis, and it was found that a triple extrusion without filtration promoted thermo‐oxidative matrix degradation.

    "abstract": "Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a common plasticizer in industrial production. Recently, environmental problems caused by microplastics have drawn wide attention. As the microplastics have a large specific surface area, the release rate of the plasticizer from the microplastics to the environment is accelerated. The DEHP in the wastewater enters the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along with the urban pipeline. After DEHP enters the WWTPs, it may affect the anaerobic fermentation with waste activated sludge (WAS) as raw material. So far, there has been no study on the effect of DEHP on anaerobic fermentation of WAS. Our study focused on the impact of exogenous DEHP on WAS anaerobic fermentation, and the results showed that DEHP mainly affects the solubilization stage of sludge anaerobic digestion, but has no significant effect on other stages. It does not affect the total yield and composition of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). However, DEHP inhibited the solubilization process of WAS anaerobic fermentation, which was mainly manifested by the changes of soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide in the system. The results of the analysis of microbial communities revealed that the addition of DEHP did not change the diversity of microbial communities, but caused a change in the abundance of microbial organisms. DEHP reduced the abundance of acetogen bacteria and increased the abundance of methanogens. This work provides some insights into WAS fermentation systems in the presence of DEHP and helps to gain a better understanding of the potential environmental hazards of microplastics.",

XRD, SEM, and TEM characterization studies revealed CTF-CN to be amorphous and composed of ultrathin 2D sheets. CTF-CN possessed strong absorption at visible wavelengths, with UV-vis measurements suggesting a band gap energy in the range 2.7-2.9 eV. A 5 wt.% Pt/CTF-CN was found to be a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen production, affording a rate of 487.6 μ mol g -1 h -1 in a H 2 O/TEOA/CH 3 OH solution under visible light. The photocatalytic activity of CTF-CN was benchmarked against g-C 3 N 4 for meaningful assessment of performance. Importantly, the 5 wt.% Pt/CTF-CN photocatalyst exhibited excellent thermal and photocatalytic stability. Further, as a nitrogen-rich porous 2D material, CTF-CN represents a potential platform for the development of novel electrode material for fuel cells and metal ion batteries.",

However, the studies of the effect of fiber polymer on the dynamic performance of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is still very limited.

The experimental results showed that the air void content and slump value decreased with the increase of replacement percentage of RCA and fiber contents. Adding PPs provided a more negative effect on the slump of RAC than BFs. The mixtures containing 0.2% PPs and BFs both obtained the highest flexural strength. The addition of PPs was more effective than BFs in improving the damping ratio of RAC, and the mixtures containing 0.3% PPs and BFs both obtained the highest damping ratio. Compared to the RAC without addition of fiber, the charge passed of specimen with addition of PPs approximately increased by 45%, while the specimen with addition of BFs approximately increased by 30%, when the fiber content was 0.3%. This study demonstrates the potential of using fiber to promote the dynamic properties of RAC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transparency and color of polyethylene film layered packages change with the number of layers. When polyethylene layer thickness is between 50 μm and 200 μm, each additional subsequent layer in the package leads to an abrupt change in color and transparency. Polarized light optical effects can be used to manufacture packaging films and labels with forgery protection. A significant influence of the scaling factor on the latent effect and optical properties of the film package is demonstrated for one to six layers with the total thickness of 200 ± 50 μm. Prior thermal treatment of individual layers before they are assembled into a package or assembled package heat treatment change the laminate color. This allows hidden marking and recording text or graphics on the multi‐layer films, not visible under normal lighting conditions, but appearing when viewed in polarized light, or through the polarizer. The paper demonstrates obtaining bright colored decorative or packaging materials, along with light filters for advertising and information displays, which change color with the viewing angle. New materials can be prepared using standard industrial equipment and widely used polymers. By changing the location of the film polarizers, the number of layers and the film thickness, laminates vary in brightness and color from blue to red.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we used 4,4′‐diphenylmethane diisocyanate ( MDI ), polycaprolactone diol ( PCL ), and 4‐(1,1,1,3,3,3‐hexafluoro‐2‐(4‐hydroxyphenyl)propan‐2‐yl)phenol ( HFP ) to synthesize novel biodegradable F‐containing polyurethanes ( HFP / PU s). Among which PCL is a biodegradable soft segment and HFP is a fluoro chain extender. According to FT ‐ IR and XPS spectroscopies, there is a strong hydrogen bonding interaction between F‐ (in CF 3 ) and – NH groups in the HFP / PU s. For the HFP / PU s, the initial decomposition temperature, glass transition temperature ( T g ), dynamic T g , tensile strength, Young's modulus, and chemical resistance increase with the content of HFP unit or hard segment. This behavior is due to the increase of rigid hard segment and the interaction between CF 3 and ‐ NH groups in the HFP / PU s. On the contrary, HFP / PU containing more HFP has lower value of elongation at break. In addition, the AFM images show that the HFP / PU containing higher HFP content exhibits more humpy protrusions and is more rugged. The results of in vitro erythrocyte adhesion tests indicate that the average quantity of erythrocytes adhered on HFP / PU surface decreases with increasing HFP or fluorine content. So fluorine element with low surface free energy is helpful for HFP / PU s to be used as biomedical materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The microstructure evolution of partial miscible polylactide/poly(butylene carbonate) ( PLA / PBC ) blend during annealing, including the variation in crystalline structure of PLA and PBC , the morphologies of PBC particles, and the relaxation of chain segments in the amorphous region of PLA , is investigated in detail. Based on the significant difference in melting temperature, phase separation arises as a result of the occurrence of crystallization of PLA and is further enhanced due to the crystallization of PBC . The glass transition temperature T g of the PLA phase in the phase separation blend is significantly higher than that of the pure PLA due to increasing crystallinity. The increasing annealing time resulted in enhanced phase separation, as reflected in the harsher morphology, the decrease of molecular dynamics, and the reduction amount of the amorphous domain. It can be verified by the interaction parameter C values at various annealing conditions from the yield stress data. Therefore, blend is aptitude to elongation decrease and the toughening micromechanism changes, while the plastic deformation is the important energy dissipation process for quenched PLA / PBC blend. Debonding of the PBC particles followed by plastic void growth of the PLA matrix is the major toughening micro‐mechanisms for phase separation blend.",

    "abstract": "Polymeric foams have characteristics that make them attractive for different applications. However, some foaming methods rely on chemicals that are not environmentally friendly. One of the possibilities to tackle the environmental issue is to utilize supercritical carbon dioxide ScCO2 since it is a “green” solvent, thus facilitating a sustainable method of producing foams. ScCO2 is nontoxic, chemically inert, and soluble in molten plastic. It can act as a plasticizer, decreasing the viscosity of polymers according to temperature and pressure. Most foam processes can benefit from ScCO2 since the methods rely on nucleation, growth, and expansion mechanisms. Process considerations such as pretreatment, temperature, pressure, pressure drop, and diffusion time are relevant parameters for foaming. Other variables such as additives, fillers, and chain extenders also play a role in the foaming process. This review highlights the morphology, performance, and features of the foam produced with ScCO2, considering relevant aspects of replacing or introducing a novel foam. Recent findings related to foaming assisted by ScCO2 and how processing parameters influence the foam product are addressed. In addition, we discuss possible applications where foams have significant benefits. This review shows the recent progress and possibilities of ScCO2 in processing polymer foams.",

The results showed that the introduction of carboxyl groups did not affect the structure and thermal properties of PPS. The composites exhibited good mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 65 MPa~97 MPa and flexural strength of 112 MPa~154 MPa.

They were insoluble in some organic solvents, such as NMP and DMF at room temperature, and they exhibited excellent chemical resistance. The dielectric performance results showed that with the increase of frequency, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss gradually decreased, the dielectric constant of PPS-2COOH/LGF/BN (15) was 3.9, and the dielectric loss of PPS-2COOH/LGF/BN (15) was 0.01.

Due to the large production and use of this plastic, its waste represents one of the most critical environmental problems. The purpose of this study is to convert PET waste into a valuable material. The consumed PET was transformed into a precursor to synthesize a polyionic liquid (PIL) that was used for dehydrating crude oil emulsions. To do so, the consumed PET was converted to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). First, BHET and tetraethylene glycol were reacted separately with thionyl chloride, obtaining the corresponding alkyl halides, bis(2-chloroethyl) terephthalate, BCET, and TEC, respectively. Next, the obtained alkyl halides, BCET and TEC, were reacted with 1,5-pentanediamine, yielding a polymer (BTP). Finally, BTP was reacted with acetic acid to produce the corresponding PIL (BTP–PIL). The structure and thermal stability of BTP–PIL were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. The dehydration performance of PIL and the original polymer was investigated using the bottle test method, including several factors such as demulsifier dose, brine content, temperature, and settling time. Results indicated that PIL achieved high performance in dehydrating crude oil emulsions.",

Filaments of 4D auxetic reentrant TPU/PLA samples were 3D printed, and their shape-memory characteristics were assessed at temperatures of 60°C (corresponding to the glass transition temperature of PLA), 70°C, 80°C (matching the melting temperature of the soft segment of TPU), and 90°C. The properties of TPU/PLA samples differ based on the PLA to TPU ratio, with an increase in TPU content resulting in a higher shape setting temperature but a shorter shape recovery time. For the TPU/PLA 5 : 5 sample, setting at 70°C and recovering at 85°C is the most suitable condition for shape recovery, whereas for the TPU/PLA 7 : 3 sample the best conditions are setting at 80°C and recovering at 95°C. In the case of TPU/PLA 9 : 1, shape setting is possible at 90°C, and shape recovery is fastest at 95°C. A 4D structure of TPU/PLA could be achieved based on shape memory testing by temperature stimulation of 3D printed auxetic c TPU/PLA samples.",

The solid‐state rolling process is well‐established for semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, but its application to segmented, two‐phase polymers like thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) which features physically cross‐linked systems and excellent physical and mechanical properties, remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the rolling of TPU under various conditions to address viscous relaxation and achieve maximum thickness reduction, producing thin sheets. The rolling characteristics were assessed by measuring the thickness changes of rolled specimens of two TPUs with different hard phase fractions, alongside thermoset polyurethane (PUR) with chemical cross‐linking for comparative analysis. The results showed that the TPUs exhibited little plastic deformation at room temperature. The cold rolling test, conducted at a rolling speed of 0.5 m min −1 with a nominal reduction of 85%, indicated that the permanent reduction ratio was less than 35% for both TPUs. However, when the rolling speed was increased to 3 m min −1 , the permanent reduction ratio increased to 67% and 60% for TPU ShA90 and TPU ShA85, respectively. This result indicates that at high rolling speeds, the thermal condition tends to change from isotherm to adiabatic in the rolling test. The maximum reduction ratio of 70% was achieved at a nominal reduction of 85% for TPU ShA90 at higher rolling temperatures and speeds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the impact of using grafted hair as reinforcing agent for making composites has been studied and compared with composites using virgin hair. For this purpose, the composites have been prepared via compression molding using a thermoplastic resin, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), as matrix, and virgin or grafted human hair (HH), HH act ‐ g ‐PMMA_1.75, and HH act ‐ g ‐PMMA_2, with 56% and 78% of grafting percentages, respectively, were taken as reinforcement material, and their properties have been compared. The hair weight fractions in composites were varied from 15% to 60%. The SEM micrographs of the fractured surface of the tensile specimen of virgin HH‐reinforced PMMA composites show hair pullouts. In contrast, in graft copolymer‐reinforced PMMA composites, failure mainly occurs at the hair and not at the hair–matrix interface, showing better adhesion. This was supported by AFM images in which a decrease in surface roughness for grafted hair‐reinforced composites was observed. The PMMA composites with grafted hairs showed improved mechanical properties than PMMA in contrast to composites with virgin hairs in which there was loss of tensile strength. On addition of 15% of HH act ‐ g ‐PMMA_1.75, the tensile strength raised by 21.86%, while in the case of HHact‐ g ‐PMMA_2 graft copolymer, the tensile strength was increased by 87.44% w.r.t virgin HH. The hair content up to 45% showed improvement in mechanical properties; however, further increase in hair content leads to a decrease in the mechanical strength. Dynamic analysis also showed an increase in storage ( E ′) and loss modulus ( E ′′), enhanced with the increase in hair concentration and reached the maximum for the 55:45::PMMA:hair ratio. The increase in E ′ and E ′′ was more when grafted hairs were used as the reinforcing agents. As compared to composites with virgin HH, an increase of 57–98% for E ′ and 46–80% for E ′′ was observed for composites with HH act ‐ g ‐PMMA_1.75. Similarly, for HH act ‐ g ‐PMMA_2 hairs, an increase of 49–102% in E ′ and 45–98% for E ′′ was observed. The present work thus shows that the use of grafted hairs results in the enhancement of adhesion of hair and matrix resulting in the improved properties.",

    "abstract": "The use of glass fiber‐reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars is an innovative approach to replace traditional reinforcement of steel into concrete structures. GFRP bars provide notable benefits like corrosion resistance, electromagnetic neutrality, higher tensile stress by weight ratio, sustainability, and cost‐effective construction reducing maintenance cost. However, challenges like brittleness, reduced ductility, and lower elastic modulus limit their practical applications. This research examines the flexural behavior of GFRP‐reinforced concrete beams using experimental and numerical methods. Nonlinear finite element analysis (FEM) was performed in ABAQUS, employing a three‐dimensional deformable model, concrete damage plasticity (CDP) theory, and detailed material properties for concrete, steel and GFRP. Four‐point flexural load conditions were simulated, and mesh sensitive analysis was conducted to ensure model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated that GFRP‐reinforced beams had higher load‐bearing capability, but wider cracks and larger deflections compared to steel‐reinforced beams. Failure of flexural members primarily due to concrete crushing was observed. Numerical simulations closely exhibited experimental load deflection performance, stress distributions, and failure patterns with accuracy variation of ~10%–16%. This study highlights the potential of FEM for correctly simulating the performance of GFRP‐reinforced concrete beams and comparing the numerical outcomes with experimental studies. It was observed that GFRP‐reinforced beams had 20% more load‐carrying capacity compared to steel‐reinforced beams based on grade of concrete and size of reinforcement. Deflection values for GFRP‐reinforced beams were higher compared to steel‐reinforced beam leading to requirements for serviceability considerations. The outcome of the study exhibited the potential of GFRP as a superior reinforcing material for specific applications.",

The complex dielectric constants of the specimens within the frequency range of 500–6000 MHz were measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) equipped with the open‐ended coaxial probe. Based on the experimental data, relationship equations for the dielectric constant and conductivity as functions of density were constructed. Compared to conductivity, the dielectric constant was found to be less affected by frequency. By incorporating the results of engineering mechanics tests while using density as an intermediate medium, a mechanical performance index model based on dielectric properties and conductivity was developed. The study found that there are linearly increasing relationships with different increments between the bending strength, unconfined compressive strength, tensile strength, shear strength, shear modulus, and the dielectric constant and conductivity.

Though plant‐based biopolymers have limited thermal stability, poor mechanical properties, and variable printability, limiting their industrial use. This review seeks to overcome such limitations by examining the intersection of plant biotechnology and polymer engineering, with a particular focus on the optimization of biopolymer performance through genetic engineering, recombinant DNA (rDNA) technologies, and new processing technologies. A multicriteria decision‐making (MCDM) approach, integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms, is suggested to enable optimal material selection based on printability, biodegradability, and mechanical properties. The research consolidates knowledge from recent developments in genetic modification, enzymatic polymerization, and artificial intelligence (AI)–based computational modeling to demonstrate improved polymer characteristics, such as improved tensile strength, improved interlayer adhesion, and improved thermal resistance. The main findings highlight the revolutionary role of AI‐aided design loops, digital twins, and biofabrication in the achievement of scalable and high‐performance biopolymers. Future research directions focus on integrating synthetic biology, autonomous laboratories, and closed‐loop recycling systems toward achieving eco‐efficient and next‐generation additive manufacturing platforms.",

Physical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the fibers were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile testing. Results showed that alkaline treatment enhanced fiber purity, crystallinity, and thermal stability, with 5% NaOH offering the best compromise between strength and flexibility. Crystallinity index (CI) reached 64.06%, and tensile strength improved significantly (276.98 MPa for CPF5 compared to 116.88 MPa for untreated fibers). Thermal degradation onset increased by 13.5°C compared to retted fibers. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests confirmed statistically significant improvements. Although no composites were fabricated, the thermal and mechanical properties of treated CPF suggest compatibility with thermoplastic matrices such as polypropylene and PLA.

    "abstract": "Continuous basalt fiber‐reinforced polypropylene (BFRP) composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties, chemical stability, and environmentally friendly characteristics, making them one of the most promising types of composites. However, basalt fibers’ (BFs) smooth and chemically inert surface leads to poor interfacial bonding between the fibers and resin, significantly hindering their rapid development. Most existing fiber surface treatment methods are conducted discontinuously, making them unsuitable for the continuous online production of composites. This study developed an online plasma continuous fiber surface treatment device to integrate fiber surface modification with preparing continuous BFRP composites using the melt impregnation method. Orthogonal experiments were conducted to assess the influence of plasma discharge power, treatment distance, and gas pressure on the effectiveness of fiber surface treatment. Additionally, the working gas type’s impact on basalt fiber (BF) modification was explored. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mechanical property tests were employed to comprehensively evaluate the surface morphology and chemical composition of the treated fibers, as well as the mechanical properties of the composites. The results revealed that the surface roughness (Ra) of the fibers treated under optimal process parameters increased by 34% compared to the control group. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the BFRP composites increased by 104%, the tensile strength of standard samples improved by 10.28%, bending strength increased by 9.47%, and impact strength rose by 18.19%, all compared to the control group. These findings indicate that plasma treatment technology can be effectively applied to online fiber modification, significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of the composites.",

    "abstract": "Anti‐cut fabric is a type of personal safety protection material that can protect the human body from injuries caused by sharp objects, such as knives. It not only holds significant application value in military and police security sectors but is also widely used in civilian fields. Therefore, developing anti‐cut fabrics that are both lightweight and possess excellent protective performance is of great importance in addressing the potential dangers posed by sharp tools. This study utilized ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), aramid 1414 (Kevlar), stainless steel filament (SSF), and polyamide (PA) as raw materials to design and fabricate eight types of yarns and their plain–woven cut‐resistant fabrics by modifying core yarn structures. Through a series of experiments, the cut‐resistant properties of fabrics with different core yarn structures were systematically investigated, followed by comprehensive evaluations and theoretical analyses. Testing results revealed that the characteristic cutting forces of B P , B K , C P , and C K specimens were 1535.78 gf, 1687.61 gf, 1731.56 gf, and 1902.54 gf, respectively, meeting the A4 grade requirements of the ANSI/ISEA 105‐2016 standard. In contrast, the A P , A K , D P , and D K specimens exhibited characteristic cutting forces of 1460.20 gf, 1494.56 gf, 962.63 gf, and 1347.57 gf, complying with the A3 grade specifications. The findings indicate that twisting a single core yarn component can effectively enhance the fabric’s cut resistance. This research provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for the design and development of high‐performance cut‐resistant textiles.",

To enhance the control capacity over the post‐filling process, adding compression to the conventional injection molding process opens a flexible channel for pressure control. This study experimentally investigated the effects of adding compression on the thermal‐mechanical history and on the quality of molded parts. An instrumented molding machine with a compression mechanism was used. Molds for rectangular plate and circular disk were equipped with a movable cavity wall and shut‐off mechanism. The thermomechanical history during the injection compression molding was identified with the aid of a PC‐based data acquisition system. The quality of parts was evaluated by flatness, deviation from mold dimensions, and birefringence. It has been found that the thermomechanical history of the melt under injection compression molding follows a quadrilateral‐shaped path over the p‐v‐T diagram. The control capacity over post‐filling is enhanced. It thus can produce parts with better dimensional control with less frozen‐in orientation than those from conventional injection molding. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The study was designed to focus on the mixers' performance in the mixing of immiscible polymers in the molten state. Two independently controlled melt streams were fed to the mixer and the evaluation of the mixer performance was based on the following criteria: (i) the processing characteristics, namely the pressure drop/rise across the mixer for specific machine and material operating variables; and (ii) the resulting quality of mixing as determined by image analysis of phase morphology on samples collected at the die. The mixing performance was judged both qualitatively, in terms of spatial material distribution, as well as quantitatively, by analysis for the size of the dispersed phase. The blending tests were conducted using three pairs of LDPE/PS systems having different rheological properties. In addition to the experimental work, the flow in the Maddock mixer was simulated using a commercial finite element package (FIDAP). The calculations were done using the experimental conditions and the properties of a pure LDPE phase.

Mechanical properties of the injection moldings are often reduced by weldlines, because the fibers at weldline regions orient perpendicularly to the flow directions. We have reported that weldline strength is improved by “back‐flow” during the holding stage. In this article, we have attempted to adapt the SCI (Simultaneous Composite Injection) molding method to improve weld strength of FRTP injection moldings. The back‐flow is expected to occur when there is a difference of holding pressure between two cylinders of the SCI molding machine. The effect of pressure difference between two injection cylinders on the back‐flow phenomena is discussed for fiber reinforced polycarbonate. It is clear that the strength reduction by the weldline can be suppressed down to negligibly small levels in SCI molding. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Melting in screw extruders has been studied extensively, starting with the experimental studies of Maddock and Street in the 1950s. These workers observed a melting model with the solid particles all clumped together in a solid bed. A thin melt film separated the solid bed from the extruder barrel; most melting took place between the solid bed and the melt film. This melting model is termed the contiguous solids melting model, CSM; it is the model most often observed in single screw extruders. It was first analyzed theoretically by Tadmor in the early 1960s. Another type of melting that has been observed by several workers has separate, solid particles floating in a melt matrix. This melting model is termed dispersed solids melting, DSM; it has been observed in twin screw extruders, reciprocating single screw compounders, and some regular single screw extruders. It has been observed experimentally that melting through DSM occurs much more efficiently than through CSM. However, there has been little work published on a quantitative description of dispersed solids melting. Here the theory of CSM as well as DSM is developed with closed-form analytical solutions. The melting characteristics of the two models are compared. It is shown that dispersed solids melting can be substantially more efficient than contiguous solids melting. This opens up interesting areas of investigation. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The flow behavior of polycarbonate (PC) blended with three kinds of polyolefins (LDPE, HDPE, PP) was studied at 260°C using an Instron Capillary Rheometer. Flow behavior of the blends was found to be very different from that of the individual components, and significant viscosity reductions were observed for blends consisting of 5% and 15% polyolefins. In particular, the viscosity of PC/HDPE was found to be much lower than that of the parent viscosity at a shear rate below 100 1/s. For pure components, a crossover of PC viscosity was observed at high shear rate for HDPE and PP. Interfacial slippage in the blends has been suggested as the flow mechanism by which a substantial reduction in the melt viscosities of either component takes place upon the addition of a small amount of the other. A new method was proposed to evaluate the relationship between the characteristic slip factor of the blend and the viscosity of the mixture. A single master curve was obtained, i.e., σ m /α AB = a · p ± b , where σ m is the shear stress at the matrix, α AB the slip factor, p the viscosity ratio, and a, b the constants. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Microwave curing has been shown to be a viable alternative to conventional thermal curing of polymers on the basis of significant reaction rate enhancements. Proper understanding of the microwave cure reaction kinetics has been hindered by the lack of an adequate basis relating the process to conventional thermal analysis methods. The rate enhancement obtained in microwave curing is shown to have been obtained from the decrease in the lag time prior to initiation of cross-linking, as well as, a decrease in the effective cure time. Phenomenologically, the shortening of the cure time is no different from a shortening achieved by a higher curing temperature, thereby providing a basis for relating the microwave cure process to thermal curing. This article attempts to relate the test results for both thermal and microwave curing by obtaining a temperature equivalent value using a phenomenological logarithmic approach. Results show that the equivalent temperature can be elucidated using a logarithmic plot of the cure times and the glass transition temperature. The values of the equivalent temperature so obtained were also consistently and significantly higher than the actual sample temperature during cure, confirming microwave curing to differ in mechanism from thermal curing. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Experiments were carried out on an 80‐ton injection‐molding machine equipped with a high‐pressure nitrogen‐gas injection unit. The materials used were general‐purpose polystyrene and polypropylene. A plate cavity with a gas channel of various geometries (trapezoid, semicircle, and rectangle) across the center was used to mold the parts. After molding, the lengths of gas penetration were determined. The hollowed core ratio by the gas was also determined. A numerical analysis was carried out to find out the temperature distribution of the polymer melt inside the gas channel. It was found that the sink mark of molded parts decreases with the length of gas penetration. Molded parts using trapezoidal gas channel had the longest gas penetration length. In addition, a thermal contraction model was proposed to predict the gas penetration volume inside the parts.

In the first part of this series on the processing characteristics of PET/PEN blends, we investigated the applicability of reaction kinetics to predict the critical transesterification temperature during processing and the influence of the equilibrium melting point of the miscible blends on the critical transesterification temperature. In the present work, we have studied both the rheology and degradation kinetics of the blends as a function of material composition. Melt viscosity loss was measured as a function of time and temperature. Activation energies for degradation were calculated from experimental data. Results show that blends containing a minimum of 10% PEN by weight are as stable as PEN in terms of thermal and thermal‐oxidative degradation. Addition of low amounts of PEN to PET causes a depression in melt viscosity. A critical composition of 10% PEN by weight is required before an increase in blend viscosity is observed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The blends are immiscible owing to the differences in the polarities of the component polymers. Thermal studies using a differential scanning calorimeter showed that the blending does not change the crystallinity and non-isothermal crystallization behavior of PBT. The tensile strength and modulus showed gradual decrease with increase in VLDPE content. The impact strength, however, was found to increase marginally with increasing VLDPE content. The examination of fractured surfaces using scanning electron microscopy indicated a two-phase morphology with spherical domains of VLDPE dispersed in PBT matrix. Addition of ethylene-based compatibilizers resulted in significant improvements in the mechanical properties through modification of phase morphology and interfacial adhesion. The effectiveness of the compatibilizers has been explained on the basis of possible interaction between the reactive groups present in the compatibilizer and the polymer.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chemical and physical processes are attracting increasing attention from plastics processors. The reasons for this are basically twofold. On the one hand, more and more processors are recognizing that the quality of their products is highly dependent upon physical processes (cooling, temperature control, blending, etc.) and, on the other hand, new methods of physical and chemical treatment are being developed which are bringing improvements in quality and hence, virtually inevitably, greater profitability in production. This technology has made its impact both on discontinuous processing (reaction injection molding), on cable and pipe extrusion, and on the direct polymerization of tapes and films. The formulations that can be applied here are monomer casting systems. A prerequisite for the industrial utilization of this system is a process analysis of the reaction molding compound processing in a parallel‐running twin screw extruder to allow the influence of the process parameters on product quality (e.g., molecular weight) to be clarified and the polymerization to be integrated into other processing sequences, such as panel extrusion. The modification of tried and tested plastics through blending with other polymers, however, can also change the properties of the material in such a way that cost‐intensive plastics can be replaced or even new fields of application can be opened up. The attainable properties are just as much a function of the individual components and their percentage content as they are of the blending technique, as investigalions on a corotating twin‐screw extruder have shown. The melting zone takes on primary significance, since it is here that both the homogenization and desired or undesired high shearing takes place. The crystallization of semicrystalline plastics also has a considerable influence on product quality. To date this has been influenced by the selective addition of nucleiproducing foreign substances. A new process substitutes electron‐irradiated granules for these nucleating agents, such that the drawbacks of the foreign particles (toxicity, notch effect, and optical impairment) are eliminated. The effectiveness of this measure is reflected in better mechanical characteristic values. These both allow a higher product quality and a shortening of cooling time and hence higher productivity. Modijication of material properties through subsequent crosslinking represents the state of the art in rubber and polyethylene extrusion for cables and pipes. Special peroxides and the application of microwave energy make it possible to crosslink extrudates (pipes, profiles) made of HDPE and EPDM. The kinetics of crosslinking are explained, taking the example of crosslinking with peroxides. It is seen that the process technologv has to be adapted to the compound in terms of residence time and temperature. Under these conditions the microwave energy crosslinking plant operates with considerably shorter plant lengths and hence with lower energy losses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A simplified semianalytical equation, used successfully in food freezing/chilling time prediction, is proposed as a potential simple alternative for cooling time prediction in injection molding of polymer parts, amorphous or semicrystalline. This equation is based on a convective boundary condition for the mold‐part interface and requires information on the thermal contact resistance (TCR) or thermal contact conductance (TCC) at this interface, as well as information on the initial and final product temperatures, the mold surface temperature, and the thermal properties of the part. Eighty‐five data points for four polymers, Polystyrene (PS), Polycarbonate (PC), Polypropylene (PP), and Polyethylene (PE) were generated with C‐MOLD™, a commercial injection molding design software, and the performance of the proposed equation was tested. The % mean error and its standard deviation (SD) in cooling time prediction were, respectively, −11.61 and 2.27 for PS, −6.04 and 2.13 for PC, −7.27 and 6.55 for PP, and −8.88 and 2.93 for PE. It was also shown that the accuracy of the proposed equation is not affected significantly by the exact knowledge of the TCC, provided that the latter is not smaller than 1000–2000 W m −2 K −1 . Since in this comparison all necessary temperatures were obtained from C‐MOLD™, methods of using the proposed equation independently were tested. The use of the inlet melt temperature as the initial product temperature increased the % mean error by mostly 1.5% while its SD remained practically the same. By incorporating a literature based heat balance method in the proposed equation, it was possible to use it as a stand‐alone predictor of polymer cooling time. The % mean error and its SD calculated this way were, respectively, −9.44 and 0.97 for PS, −9.44 and 0.83 for PC, −14.22 and 5 for PP, and −20.12 and 1.38 for PE. The proposed equation, at least in a preliminary stage, can be used successfully to predict the cooling time of the selected semicrystalline or amorphous polymers with the accuracy being higher for amorphous polymers. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The constitutive equation used is a realistic integral model of the K‐BKZ type which can describe the viscoelastic memory characteristics of polymer melts. Viscosity and first normal stress data of typical PS and HDPE melts at 200°C are employed along with a feed ratio used in actual experiments found in the literature. Our results reveal important viscoelastic effects that could not be predicted by previous inelastic simulations. In particular, when the outer layer is more elastic than the inner layer, an enhanced extrudate swell is observed relative to the opposite configuration at the same flow rate, even if the outer layer is less viscous than the inner layer. In terms of a dimensionless stress ratio S R measured on the die wall, the more elastic material at the outer layer results in a higher S R value than that of the opposite configuration at the same flow rate. On the other hand, when the outer layer is less elastic than the inner layer, a reduced extrudate swell is observed relative to the opposite configuration at the same flow rate even if the outer layer is more viscous than the inner layer. When compared at the same S R value, however, our results show that the inelastic swell mechanism proposed by Tanner still applies qualitatively, i.e., a more viscous outer layer will result in larger extrudate swell than the opposite configuration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Infrared radiation plays a large role in many areas of plastics processing, whether in the heating of thermoplastics for purposes of subsequent forming or in noncontact temperature measurement. This paper sets out to deepen our understanding of the plastics‐specific problem associated with infrared radiation. First of all, a brief outline is given of the necessary fundamental physical principles, before going to to discuss measurement results in terms of the radiation‐related properties of plastics. The influence of pigmentation and crystalline structures is investigated, together with the temperature dependence of absorption behavior. Linking up the radiator characteristics and absorption properties of plastics, a physical model is then presented which can be used to calculate energy efficiency and temperature homogeneity in the heating of plates. The results are presented in diagrams. In addition, the special problems of infrared heating in stretch blow molding are examined. Here, we attempt to attain a high level of penetration into the thick‐walled parisons by means of short‐wave radiation and thereby guarantee uniform and rapid heating. A program for establishing the intensity distribution of radiation on a semifinished product has been developed for geometerical configurations generally found in thermoforming machines and this will run on a personal computer. It will allow the optimization of uniform or deliberately nonuniform temperature distributions over the surface. If the stretching process is to be selectively influenced, it is essential to have knowledge not only of the temperature distribution in the semifinished part but also of the stretching behavior of the material. A highly informative testing procedure was developed to this end, which reveals the suitability of the material in question for a stretching process. A further section covers the infrared temperature measurement frequently applied in plastics processing for process analysis, monitoring, and control. The different types of measuring devices and their advantuges and drawbacks are discussed here. An analysis is also conducted of disturbance variables and possible means of correction are indicated.",

The temperature and the diameter of fibers can be applied in many fields such as fiber formation modelling, cooling rate behavior (Nusselt number), and rheological investigations (apparent extensional viscosity) of polymers. The online measurements along the spinline were carried out with an infrared camera during the melt spinning process. Two different experiments were designed and carried out to find the correction factor, i.e., the emissivity. The results show that the emissivity correction factor depends on the polymer type and the fiber diameter. Usually the diameter of the fibers is measured by an instrument or by direct velocity measurements invoking the continuity equation. In this new approach the diameter is found directly by the evaluation of the measured temperature. Therefore only one apparatus, namely an infrared camera taking snapshots, is required to find the fiber diameter. The key of this method can be seen in the temperature difference between the fiber and the environment. A mathematical procedure was developed to estimate the diameter of the fiber from the distribution curve. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The incorporation of fillers into LLDPE, whether calcite or calcite/zeolite hybrid fillers, does not alter the T m of LLDPE, but slightly reduces the T m of PP. The melting peak area representing the heat of fusion of the crystal decreases with fillers; the effect of the calcite and the hybrid filler would be the same. The impact strength, Young's modulus, and yield stress of the calcite and the hybrid filled LLDPE increased, indicating a reinforcing effect of the fillers. In addition, the filled LLDPE decreases in elongation at break (EB) and ultimate tensile strength. However, the hybrid LLDPE composite exhibits slightly higher Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength than the calcite one, while the same values of impact strength and yield stress were observed. In the PP system, the Young's modulus is enhanced, whereas the rest of the mechanical properties were reduced. From SEM photomicrographs of the hybrid filled composites, the tensile fractured surface of LLDPE dumbbell bar exhibits tearing surfaces while the composite shows formation of air holes and cracks in the LLDPE and PP system, respectively. Because of improved Young's modulus, yield strength, impact strength, and morphological observation along with substantial extension, the filled LLDPE composite with calcite/zeolite hybrid fillers is worth using for micro‐porous film applications. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Implanted metal ions show direct evidence of compound formation on the surface. Chemical changes in the surface region have been observed by Raman spectroscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy.

Reactive surfactants were used to significantly improve the stability of emulsion. More interestingly, reverse core/shell structure was investigated when the organic silicon was added in the late period of polymerization. The effects of the emulsifier, initiators, dosage of organic silicon, and monomer's content on conversion and graft efficiency were studied in detail. Moreover, the stability of emulsion was investigated by the values of zeta potential (ζ) and coagulum. More importantly, the thermal performance and stability of PSI/PA composite latex was studied by the glass transition temperature ( T g ). The results showed that there are appropriate values for all factors to obtain high conversion, graft efficiency, and excellent stability: The dosage of surfactant was about 0.44 g, the dosage of VA‐044 was about 1000 mg kg −1 , the dosage of organic silicon was about 15%, and the monomer's content was about 30%.

To optimize and predict the CA of electrospun fiber mat, response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) are employed and a quantitative relationship between processing variables and CA of the electrospun fibers is established. It is found that the solution concentration is the most important factor impacting the CA of electrospun fiber mat. The obtained results demonstrated that both the proposed models are highly effective in estimating the CA of electrospun fiber mat. However, more accurate results are obtained by the ANN model as compared to the RSM model. In the ANN model, the determination coefficient ( R 2 ) and relative error between actual and predicted response are obtained as 0.965 and 5.94%, respectively. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a pore‐forming agent on the structure and performance of the CSP/BPU composite scaffolds were investigated. The morphology and structure of the composite scaffolds were verified via scanning electron microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and porosity measurement. The performance of composite scaffolds was characterized by determination of the swelling ratio, measurement of the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), mechanical test, and degradation experiment. The result showed that all CSP/BPU scaffolds were asymmetric with a skin layer near the top surface and a porous supporting solid matrix. The porosity and average pore size of CSP/BPU scaffolds exhibited a maximum value at 5 wt% PVP. The crystallinity and the lamellar thickness ( L ) of composite scaffolds decreased with increasing PVP content from 0 to 8 wt%. The swelling ratio of CSP/BPU scaffolds also exhibited a maximum value as PVP increased to 5 wt%, which suggested that swelling ratios were controlled by the porosity, whereas, with increasing PVP content, the WVTR of CSP/BPU scaffolds increased and the tensile properties and degradation rates showed a decreasing tendency. Consequently, through adjusting PVP content, CSP/BPU scaffolds prepared by immersion precipitation phase transformation could be a potential material that could be applied in skin tissue engineering. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The release was unaffected by dissolution medium pH and agitation rate but significantly altered by changing osmolality of dissolution medium. Release kinetic was shifted from first‐order to zero‐order with the increased osmagent amount. SEM indicated the formation of pores on the surface of Opadry ® CA after dissolution.

The gel fraction results demonstrated that a cross‐linked substance was formed in the composites in the presence of both TMPTA and fibers following irradiation and the maximum gel fraction of PET matrix reached 16 wt%. In addition, the obvious improvement of interfacial adhesion was confirmed by the morphology changes in fracture surface, from which the disappearance of pull‐out holes and plastic deformations of polymeric matrix were observed. As a result of the compatibilization of PET matrix and basalt fibers, both the mechanical strength and the thermal resistance were enhanced, and the optimum amount of TMPTA was 1–3 wt%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tests have been conducted to investigate the influence of temperature, stress, and crazing for polyethylene methacrylate ( PMMA ) creep life. Creep life decreases with stress in a logarithmic relation, and rupture strains increase with decreasing stress. To assess the creep life of PMMA , the Larson–Miller parameter is first introduced to correlate stress and temperature with rupture time. The important role of crazing in polymer material damage, especially, the craze density and craze growth rate in the stable creep stage, is demonstrated. The craze initiation time is related to the tensile strength and to the stress and temperature at the elastic limit, and the craze initiation time can be predicted by an empirical model subsequently presented in this paper. Based on the connection between craze growth and creep rupture time, thereafter, a modified Monkman–Grant model is presented to predict creep life. The curve of craze density over creep time has the same two distinct stages as the curve of strain over time. In the final sections, a critical assessment of creep damage is also presented to provide a convenient method to predict residual life using only craze density.",

In this study, a series of superfine metal powder (SFM)/nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)-polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microcellular foaming materials were prepared with NBR-PVC as matrix and SFM as modifiers by employing the method of molding foaming. Analysis on the morphology of cross section, pore size, and pore distribution possessed by SFM/NBR-PVC was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as the image processing software of Image-Pro. Then detailed discussion on the effect of SFM with different mass fractions in the matrix on the foaming quality was provided. In the meanwhile, the performance of sound insulation was tested by four-channel impedance tube system. The results show significant improvement for foaming quality and sound insulation performance of NBR-PVC microcellular foaming material through the addition of SFM. In comparison with the pure NBR-PVC materials, the microcellular foaming material exhibits the best performance of foaming quality and sound insulation when the SFM content in matrix is 30 wt%. It is shown that the average pore diameter and the foaming capacity decrease by 60% and 31%, respectively, while the surface density increases by 131%. In the meantime, the sound insulation index of SFM/NBR-PVC microcellular material increases by 7.2 dB to 30.5 dB, which conforms to the requirements of new lightweight sound insulation materials in modern time. Finally, the mechanism of the optimization conducted for sound insulation performance after the addition of SMF is explained.",

The increased temperature enhances the kinetic energy of water molecules that leads to great surface diffusion coefficient and small work of adhesion.

With the vane extruder and the visualization VPCU device, the melting phenomenon of high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) pellets under different operation conditions was investigated. It was shown that the positive displacement conveying mechanism and mandatory deformation of particles made the melting evolution in vane extruders totally different from screw extruders. The length of solid conveying and melting zone in vane extruders was much shorter, and the island‐sea melting model was formed instead of Tadmor's melting model. Plastic energy dissipation, friction energy dissipation, and viscous energy dissipation were very important sources of heat energy for polymer particles melting in vane extruders. The eccentricity of VPCU, leading to the compression and deformation of particles, was a decisive factor in polymer melting in vane extrusion. Owing to the eccentricity, mechanical energy was dissipated into heat via the deformation of HDPE particles and the thermo‐mechanical history was shortened remarkably. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize this autonomic healing system. Self‐healing capabilities were confirmed by mechanical testing (load–displacement, engineering stress–engineering strain, and true stress–true strain dependences) recorded at very slow elongation rates (0.01 mm/s).

It was found that in both epoxy/CTBN blend and epoxy/clay/CTBN nanocomposites, the diffusion coefficient initially increased with an increase in CTBN content, with a maximum value registered for the systems containing 15 phr of CTBN. With a further increase of CTBN, the diffusion coefficient was found to decrease. The variation of solvent uptake with CTBN content depends on both the amount of dissolved rubber in the epoxy phase and the phase morphology associated with each composition. The high acetone uptake in 15 and 20 phr CTBN‐loaded system was found to be reduced dramatically by the incorporation of 3 phr nanoclay. Owing to the presence of high aspect ratio clay platelets, the diffusion of acetone undergoes a more tortuous path in epoxy/clay/CTBN nanocomposites than in epoxy/CTBN blends.

The effect of ionic comonomer concentration on the equilibrium swelling, mechanical behavior, and swelling–deswelling kinetics was investigated to find materials with satisfactory swelling and elastic properties. The increase in the ionic comonomer AMPS content increased the equilibrium swelling of copolymer hydrogels. Using the Flory–Rehner theory, the equilibrium swelling behavior of P(DMAEMA‐ co ‐AMPS) hydrogels was successfully investigated and the effective charge density of the resulting copolymer hydrogels was calculated as an adjustable parameter. Scaling rules were derived for the ionic group content to explain the observed swelling behavior of P(DMAEMA‐ co ‐AMPS) hydrogels. The kinetics of copolymer hydrogel swelling as well as the mechanism of diffusion was investigated by dynamic swelling measurements at different pH values. The dominant physical mechanism controlling the water uptake of P(DMAEMA‐ co ‐AMPS) copolymer hydrogels was analyzed, and the diffusion coefficients were determined.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antioxidants are customarily used in elastomer compounds to enhance the service life of vulcanizates enduring high temperatures, but proper selection and dosage of the antioxidant is critical to obtain maximum beneficial effect. In this study, the effectiveness of several commercially available antioxidants on the performance of a resin‐cured bromobutyl rubber ( BIIR ) vulcanizate was investigated. The antioxidants investigated belonged to different chemical classes such as p‐phenylene diamine (antioxidant 4010 NA ), secondary amine (antioxidant 445), quinoline (antioxidant RD ), and phenolic (antioxidants BHT , 1010, and 2246). The physicomechanical properties of the BIIR vulcanizates containing the various antioxidants were tested at room temperature, at higher temperatures, after subjecting to heat aging, and after storage. The results show that the physicomechanical properties of the BIIR vulcanizate severely deteriorate when antioxidant 4010 NA is used. Among the other antioxidants used, the phenolic‐type antioxidant BHT is found to be better for the resin‐cured BIIR vulcanizate of this study.",

This study compares the wear resistance of multiwalled carbon nanotube‐reinforced UHMWPE composite with conventional orthopedic grade UHMWPE currently used in total knee replacements. Defined by previous studies, 1.25 wt.% multiwall carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT ) were incorporated into UHMWPE to fabricate UHMWPE ‐ MWCNT composites by solution blending, achieving an even distribution in the polymeric matrix. UHMWPE ‐ MWCNT samples were manufactured by compression molding and sterilized with γ‐rays. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed a uniform distribution of the MWCNT s. The volumetric wear was reduced by 86.9%, and the indentation depth in creep testing decreased 68%. The composite displayed superior wear behavior producing less wear debris than conventional materials.",

First, the formation temperature of 20–70°C was simulated using self-made test equipment. N,N-Dimethylaniline (DMA), N,N-dimethylp-toluidine (DMT), and hydroquinone were selected as accelerators to determine gel time and heat release peak. The gel time of an anchorage agent is strongly influenced by accelerant and temperature. When DMT, DMA, and hydroquinone were added at the same temperature, the gelation time increased; with increasing ambient temperature, the gelation time of the anchorage agent decreased. The peak exothermic value of the curing reaction was less affected by the accelerator, and the peak exothermic value of the anchoring agent increased with the increase in ambient temperature. Then, the compressive strength of the anchorage agent, maintained at 20, 50, and 80°C for 1.5, 6, 12, and 24 h, was measured. We found that the compressive strength of resin anchorage agent decreased significantly with the increase in temperature, and the addition of DMT can improve the compressive strength of resin anchorage agent slightly at the same temperature conditions. Finally, through Fourier transform infrared scanning analysis, we determined the intrinsic causes of the influence of temperature and accelerator on the gelation time and compressive strength of the anchorage agent. Through SPSS fitting analysis, an empirical formula for predicting gelation time based on ambient temperature is proposed. Our findings provide a basis for reasonable mixing time and support design optimization of anchorage support in deep stratum in high-temperature geothermal environments.",

We prepared SDs containing the poorly water-soluble drug AG by the freeze-drying method. The SDs were manufactured from two different polymers, PEG4000 palmitate and PEG8000 palmitate. The physicochemical properties of the AG-SDs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, dissolution testing, and so on. We found that AG-PEG4000 palmitate-SD and AG-PEG8000 palmitate-SD were similar in the surface morphology, specific surface area, and pore volume. Compared with the AG-PEG4000 palmitate-SD, the intermolecular interaction between PEG8000 palmitate and AG was stronger, and the thermal stability of AG-PEG8000 palmitate-SD was better. In the meanwhile, the AG relative crystallinity was lower and the AG dissolution rate was faster in AG-PEG8000 palmitate-SD. The results demonstrate that the increasing PEG molecular weight in the PEG palmitate can improve the compatibility between the poorly water-soluble drug and carrier material, which is beneficial to improve the SD thermal stability and increases the dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drug in the SD.",

Tensile strength and surface gloss were chosen to measure macroscopic properties of the molded parts.

The tensile strength of RHCM parts reached the maximum at the mold heating temperature of 60°C.

T1- and T2-weighted images and their corresponding signal intensities were obtained at 1.5 T. A decreasing trend in signal intensities with an increase in nanoparticle concentration in colloids and along the gradient was observed in T2-weighted images. The hyperthermia capability was also evaluated by measuring temperature rise and calculating specific absorption rates (SAR). The SAR of the colloids at 259 kHz, 327 kHz, and 518 kHz were found to be 156 W/g, 255 W/g, and 336 W/g, respectively.

Starting with the initial design for the mold cavity, the procedure optimizes the wall thickness distribution at user‐defined area sections within prescribed tolerances. A unit‐square parameterization technique is applied that uses mean‐valued coordinates and a second‐order polynomial thickness distribution. Three different optimization algorithms—an evolutionary algorithm, a surrogate‐based response surface method, and a direct search method—are considered, and the optimization performances of these algorithms are evaluated for a warpage demonstrator and real industrial part.

The epoxide functionality of semi‐IPN hydrogel microspheres is also utilized to isolate inorganic nanoparticles, using Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles as an example, simply by blending the hydrogel and magnetic (Fe 3 O 4 ) dispersions. The presence of strained oxirane ring derived from GMA segment induced high affinity for semi‐IPN hydrogel microspheres toward magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and eventually reduced the colloidal stability.",

Free radical copolymerization of N , N ‐dimethylacrylamide and allylamine forms a functional chelating group, which is grafted onto MNPs using (3‐mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane as the novel adsorbent. The grafted MNPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The optimum pH for sorption of the metal ion was 4. The sorption capacity of the functionalized MNPs was 38.61 mg/g. The chelating sorbent was reused for 11 cycles of sorption–desorption without a significant change in sorption capacity. The functionalized MNPs showed good adsorption of Cr(VI) as evidenced by the dimensionless separation factor of 0.529. The equilibrium sorption data for Cr(VI) onto the polymeric sorbent was analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson models. The equilibrium adsorption data indicated that the Langmuir and Freundlich constants were 0.01 and 0.486, respectively, at pH 4 and 25°C. In the Redlich–Peterson model, g equaled 0.98, indicating that the Langmuir isotherm is the best model. Removal from the industrial wastewater sample in the presence of other metal ions was successful with an average removal of 82.22% of hexavalent chromium.",

In addition, attapulgite (AT)/PU nanocomposites are prepared by adding AT into PU matrix. The structure and morphology of AT/PU nanocomposites are examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS). The TEM results show that AT maintains its rod‐like structure in the PU matrix. The FT‐IR results show that there is no significant change in the FT‐IR spectrum after a small amount of AT is added into the PU matrix. The XRD results show that the main crystallization peaks of AT become more apparent with increasing AT content, and the EDS results show that the intensity of the Si peak also increases with increasing AT content. In addition, the mapping shows that AT nanorods are poorly dispersed when the AT content reaches 5 wt%. The thermal and mechanical properties of the AT/PU nanocomposite with an AT content of 2 wt% are optimal, and when the AT content surpasses 5 wt%, an aggregation phenomenon occurs, resulting in reductions in the thermal and mechanical properties of the AT/PU nanocomposite. The contact angle test and atomic force microscopy results show that the surface of the nanocomposite becomes more rough and hydrophobic with increasing AT content. The scanning electron microscopy observations of the hydrolytic degradation of the AT/PU nanocomposites show that their hydrolytic degradation was affected by the test temperature, test time, and AT content. The moisture absorption test shows that the moisture absorption of the AT/PU nanocomposite increases with increasing AT content and ambient humidity.",

The comparative values of the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and electrical conductivity of PVC/CNT nanocomposite in the presence and absence of PVC beads were described. The results showed that the EMI SE values and electrical conductivity values of PVC/CNT nanocomposite had increased compared to those without PVC beads. After the addition of PVC beads, both values of the EMI SE and electrical conductivity had also increased with the increasing of the amount of PVC bead on the PVC/CNT nanocomposite, and the PVC/CNT nanocomposite in the presence of PVC bead showed high EMI SE value (22.6 dB at 4.0 wt% CNT loading in the presence of 70 wt% bead) and high conductivity value (5.31×10 −2 S cm −1 at 1.0 wt% CNT loading in the presence of 70 wt% bead) at low CNT loading. Thus, PVC beads effectively play a major role in enhancing the EMI SE value and electrical conductivity value of the nanocomposite. To check the bead region and solvent‐dried CNT region in the nanocomposite, morphological studies have been done and morphological studies of the PVC/CNT nanocomposite supported the two‐phase regions in the composite and the selective dispersion of the CNT in the solvent‐dried phase has been clearly observed.",

The potential thin film showed successful sensor behavior and demonstrated gradual and reversible sensing change in the pH range of 2.0–11.0. Visual and Lucid color change of the thin film was observed at inclined pH value; fuchsia color at pH 1–3, purple color at pH 6–8, and blue color at pH 10–11. Structural identification of the thin‐film sensor provided evidence of physical adsorption of cyanidin on the surface of PAN via epichlorohydrin coupling agent as prevailed by FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, the thin‐film sensor demonstrated thermal stability up to 105°C, as onset degradation temperature, as verified by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and its first derivative (DTG) techniques. Moreover, the pH‐sensing change of the 1‐mm‐thick thin film was checked by UV‐Vis technique. The oligomer formation of cyanidin, mediated by epichlorohydrin, lead to the formation of stable and successful adsorption on the surface of PAN with uniform and soft appearance. The concept of the reversible stability and response time of the thin film sensor were also proved. The cyanidin‐based PAN conjugate sensor act as a novel environmental‐friendly sensor with the following specifications: low cost, easy fabrication, high sensing capacity, appropriate reversible stability, and response time specifications. Such exquisite specifications of the thin‐film sensor adapt it to put into service in optoelectronics and microelectronic devices.",

The EDX analysis and surface area measurement confirmed that ZN ‐Et OH catalyst had better active center distribution than that of ZN ‐ THF . Thus, the ZN ‐Et OH catalyst could retard the effect of hydrogen and show higher activity with increased hydrogen pressures. However, catalytic activity was lower with high hydrogen pressure. Moreover, polymerization time also has an influence on activity. Both catalysts showed the similar result where an increase in polymerization time can improve yield of polymer, but it decreased activity. In addition, it is seen that the increase in hydrogen pressure leads to decrease the melting temperature for polyethylenes, but it increases the crystallinity.",

A series of p( MEMA ‐co‐ IA ) microgels were prepared by modified free‐radical suspension polymerization using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross‐linker. Characterization was performed through FTIR , TGA , DSC , XRD , DLS and SEM . pH responsiveness was evaluated by equilibrium swelling studies in phosphate buffer solutions of different pH values ( pH 1.2, 4, 6.5, and 7.4) with constant ionic strength. To demonstrate the potential use of microgels for drug delivery, esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate ( EMT ) was loaded as model drug and in vitro dissolution studies were performed. FTIR and thermal analysis confirmed the formation of cross‐linked p( MEMA ‐co‐ IA ) microgels. XRD indicated dispersion of drug into the network at molecular level. SEM illustrated smooth, round and uniformly distributed microspheres. A remarkably higher swelling at higher pH values ( pH 6.5 and 7.4) compared to pH 1.2 demonstrated the pH ‐responsive nature of the microgels. All the formulations showed pH ‐dependent drug release following Higuchi with non‐fickian mechanism of drug diffusion. In light of the results obtained from this study, it was concluded that p( MEMA ‐co‐ IA ) microgels have potential to release drug in controlled manner responsive to pH of the external environment.",

These wood‐based biopolymers have garnered significant focus in recent years due to their environmental friendliness and vast potential across many different fields. A full factorial design with three independent variables (layer height, printing speed, and heat treatment exposure time) at three levels was considered. The research explores printing speeds higher than the speed ranges typically investigated in the existing scientific literature on FDM 3D printing of wood‐based polymers. Additionally, in this study, heat treatment is proposed as a post‐processing operation to enhance certain crucial proprieties such as surface quality, hardness, mechanical strength, and accuracy. The findings reveal that heat treatment has a positive influence on the investigated output parameters. Notably, 3D printed samples subjected to heat treatment exhibit an average decrease of 112.1% in surface roughness for a 5‐min exposure time and 121.73% for a 10‐min exposure time. The surface hardness of the samples also improved after applying the heat treatment. The part hardness improved with an average of 0.65%. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between layer height and surface quality, hardness, printing speed, and tensile strength. Notably, printing speed contributed significantly to the variation in tensile strength, accounting for 52.77% of the parameter’s variation. These insights shed light on the optimization of 3D printing processes for wood‐based biopolymers, paving the way for enhanced performance and applicability across diverse fields.",

The use of 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) as an ionic liquid solvent facilitated the dissolution of cotton, enabling the creation of a spinning dope containing cellulose and polyester fibers. Successful spinning of bicomponent fibers ensued, followed by comprehensive fiber evaluation. The dissolution of cotton was achieved with [EMIM][Ac], and spinning trials were conducted to devise a suitable method for regenerated cellulose. Tensile tests on the produced cellulosic fibers clearly demonstrated an increase in tensile strength with higher cellulose concentration. The introduction of polyester fibers to the spinning dope, comprising [EMIM][Ac] and cotton, posed challenges to the entire spinning process. Tensile tests on the resulting bicomponent fibers revealed a decrease in tensile strength compared to pure regenerated cellulose fibers. This reduction was attributed to increased voids and irregular polyester fiber distribution, corroborated by microscopy images and a wicking test. It was concluded that the quantity and length of polyester fibers significantly influenced the tensile strength of the bicomponent fibers, with lower concentrations and shorter fibers resulting in higher strength.",

Tensile strength testing revealed an initial increase in Young’s modulus with 5% and 10% EFC concentrations, followed by a decrease at higher concentrations, attributed to agglomeration effects. Flexural strength (FS) exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing EFC content, while flexural modulus (FM) showed improvement up to 20% EFC loading. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis highlighted the distribution of collagen particles, with agglomeration observed at higher concentrations. Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated alterations in hydrogen bonding with the addition of EFC. Thermal analysis revealed a reduction at onset degradation temperature with EFC incorporation, attributed to poor dispersion and agglomeration effects, alongside a slight enhancement in thermal stability at higher concentrations.

The various factors that affect hydrogel synthesis, such as the amounts of CMC, monomers, initiator, and crosslinker, were evaluated. In the optimized formulation, the weight ratio of monomers to CMC is 7, the molar ratio of monomers to each other is 1, and the crosslinker is used as 3 molar percent of monomers.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the hydrophobicity of chitosan through acylation enables the encapsulation of water‐insoluble drugs within the polymeric carrier cores. In this study, hydrophobically modified chitosan was synthesized by reacting low‐molecular‐weight chitosan with acyl chloride (C18–C24) using an agitation method under mild conditions. The structure of acylated chitosan was analyzed using FTIR and 1 H‐NMR spectroscopy. The degree of substitution (DS) varied between 56% and 69% for different long‐chain N‐acylated chitosan, with N‐stearoyl chitosan (ChC18) exhibiting the highest DS. The incorporation of capecitabine (CAP) into extended acylated chitosan increased particle size and decreased zeta potential. N‐lignoceroyl chitosan (ChC24) exhibited the highest zeta potential value of −27 mV for 0.2 mg of CAP, indicating that the most extended acyl group was the most stable in the suspension. Transmission electron microscope images revealed that all acylated chitosan particles were spherical, with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm, and existed as stand‐alone entities, indicating excellent stability in suspension. The loading of CAP increased in particle size but did not alter particle shape, except for ChC24, which exhibited agglomeration. SEM images revealed that the individual arrangement of particles in CAP‐ChC18 made it more stable than other acylated chitosan. In contrast, the formation of clusters in CAP‐ChC24 can be attributed to strong hydrophobic interactions. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that there is no nitrogen atom in ChC18, which means that the acyl group is oriented inward and bound to the stearoyl group via van der Waals forces. At different drug weight‐to‐carrier ratios, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of CAP with varying acyl group lengths ranged from 85% to 97%. The drug loading (DL) capacity and EE increased as the amount of drug in the carrier increased. However, the length of the acyl group did not significantly affect DL and EE, even when the carrier‐to‐drug ratio was consistently maintained. Sustained release was observed in CAP‐loaded ChC24, indicating a significant influence of the extended chain on chitosan.

    "abstract": "Optimization of the compatibilizer concentration in polymer blends has generally been achieved through an indirect correlation with property improvements. In this article the evolution in particle size with percent interfacial modifier (emulsification curve) is used to quantitatively assess the state of the interface under a wide range of processing conditions in ABS/polyamide-6 (nylon-6) blends. This type of dependence can yield important information concerning the state of the interface of a given blend, including the concentration of compatibilizer necessary for interfacial saturation. To illustrate the applicability of an emulsification curve to polymer processing equipment, a comparison is made between the twin-screw extruder and the single-screw extruder. In order to simulate a wide processing performance range no additional mixing devices were used to enhance mixing on the single-screw extruder. The twin-screw extruder therefore represents the case of good mixing and the single-screw extruder represents that of poor mixing. Finally, for the good mixing case, the impact strength has been analyzed in order to observe its behavior at the critical concentration for interfacial saturation as well as the effect of dispersed phase composition. The size of the dispersed domains reveals important differences between the compounding effects of the single-screw as compared to the twin-screw extruder. A compatibilizing agent renders such a blend more homogeneous by reducing the particle size of the dispersed phase. It was also found for the single-screw extruder that the interface is not saturated and the phase size equilibrium value is not obtained even at high levels of interfacial modifier. The higher efficacy of the twin-screw extruder in migrating the modifier to the interface is clearly demonstrated through the use of the emulsification curve. The impact strength of material prepared by twin-screw/injection molding shows a significant increase at a modifier concentration, which correlates well with the critical concentration for interfacial saturation of interfacial modifier from the emulsification study. The impact strength of an optimally compatibilized system as a function of dispersed phase composition displays a maximum impact strength around 50% ABS in the co-continuous morphology region. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymer blends containing nylon‐6 of different molecular weights (MW) and polypropylene (PP) were prepared by using a twin screw extruder in order to examine the effects of molecular weights of nylon and the influences of different types of compatibilizing agents on the phase morphology and the properties. The morphology of the resulting blends was characterized by using both scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope and the properties measured included Izod impact strength, melt flow index (MI), flexural modulus, and heat distortion temperature (HDT). It was found that the molecular weights of the nylon matrix had a significant effect on the phase morphology. The fracture surface of the low MW nylon blend demonstrated a uniformed phase morphology with the dispersed PP particles of dimensions in the range of 1 μm in diameter embedded in the nylon matrix, suggesting an improved compatibility as compared with the high MW nylon system, even though these two constituents were incompatible in nature. Three different types of compatibilizers, including maleic anhydride modified PP (MA‐g‐PP), acrylic acid modified PP (AA‐g‐PP), and ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (EGMA), were used to examine their effects. It seemed that blends compatibilized with MA‐g‐PP exhibited the most homogeneous phase morphology and superior mechanical properties among the three. In the blends containing low MW nylon as the matrix phase, the Izod impact strength was shown to have increased by about 40% as compared with the noncompatibilized blend, while a 20% increase of the impact strength was measured in the high MW nylon system. The effects of nylon's molecular weights and the compatibilizers were also studied in systems of PP/nylon blends reinforced with silane‐treated glass fibers. It was shown that the properties of the composites relied on the phase morphology which, in turn, was affected by both the molecular weight of nylon and the compatibilizing agents. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported recently that mixing in a single-screw extrusion process can be greatly enhanced due to the chaotic flow induced by spatially periodic barriers inserted in the screw channel. This new screw was named the \"chaos screw,\" because mixing produced by this new screw is chaotic in nature. It is of great importance to establish a systematic method in designing such a chaos screw, with the objective of achieving a uniform and efficient mixing. In this study, we numerically studied the effects of design variables on chaotic flow by means of a Poincare section and attempted to quantify the mixing in terms of a mixing measure proposed in the literature, namely the Lyapunov exponent. It is well known that Lyapunov exponents have a spatial, Gaussian distribution for systems without islands. As a measure of mixing, however, a \"distribution\" does not seem to be adequate for use in industrial engineering applications. Thus, we propose two new types of representative deformation measures as new chaotic mixing measures: σz and σt, which are termed modified Lyapunov exponents, representing the exponential stretch rate of a relatively long material line along the downchannel direction and with respect to time, respectively. It was found that the modified Lyapunov exponents are almost identical to the material line chosen for their computation, and are thus reliable measures to represent the overall mixing as a kind of domain-averaged Lyapunov exponent. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The average impact strength and percentage of ductile failures decreased with increasing composition of polysulfone and polyetherimide. The tensile test results indicate that a relationship exists between the percent composition and the yield strength for the blends with the blends showing an improvement in tensile strength. The ballistic testing results show that a possibly linear relationship exists between the percent composition and the critical velocity for complete penetration.

Effects of compression-related parameters, including delay, speed, pressure, time, and distance, are also investigated. ICCM extends the moldable area with an expanded cavity during short-shot filling. The process improves dimensional accuracy in the lateral direction. However, surface conformity to the cavity is not better than conventional injection molding due to a significant orientation difference in injection- and compression-filled zones.

    "abstract": "The effect of two elastomers and a newly developed plastomer on rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of their blends with a commercially available recycled polyethylene were studied. The results show effective improvements in engineering properties of the recycled polyethylene (PE). Low percentages of these modifiers give rise to higher elastic properties of the blends. Addition of all modifiers resulted in decreases in crystallinity and in melting point of the blends. Depending on modifier type the intensity of the changes was different. It is concluded from infrared spectra of the blends that no chemical interaction occurs during melt mixing of the ingredients. These improvements are attributed to morphological changes and physical interactions between modifiers and PE matrix. In melt state, as the modification percentage increases and depending on the nature of modifier, the resulting blends show different rheological behavior: EPDM447 constantly increases the viscosity and elasticity of the corresponding blends; EPDM541 is almost ineffective; and EXACT™ 4041 decreases and then increases these properties, depending on its concentration in the blend. The results presented in terms of weighed relaxation time spectra show different behaviors depending on the additive. For all modifiers, the 7% modification was always found to have the most pronounced effect on almost all properties of the blends. It was also found that EPDM447 shows the best effects on different properties of the recycled PE. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 17: 127–143, 1998",

It is shown that the melting progression of polymer pellets in corotating twin‐screw extruders is different from that in single‐screw extruders. Screw configuration, screw speed, and feed rate are three decisive factors in polymer melting. Based on the melting phenomena, a new melting mechanism, island‐sea melting model , was defined. It was found that island‐sea melting model is an important mechanism to realize high efficiency melting progression. The state of polymer, the degree of fill, and the structure of kneading blocks are factors in determining the energy consumption of kneading blocks in melting zone. The conveying of polymer pellets in kneading blocks, in which pellets were compressed and deformed, consumed much more energy than the conveying of polymer melt. This indicates that the control of the deformation of polymer pellets in corotating twin‐screw extrusion is a useful concept in developing new screw elements for high efficiency polymer melting. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Properties of short and especially long fiber reinforced thermoplastics highly depend on fiber length distribution in the processed material and local fiber orientation in the processed part. Good mechanical performance is achieved, if overall mean fiber length is high and fiber orientation is well adapted to the external stress situation. If non optimized processing parameters are applied, a decay in mean fiber length and unfavorably orientated fibers in areas of high stress may result. Knowledge of morphological parameters provides quantitative information about the injection molding process and the design of the cavity. Recent advances in automated methods of measuring fiber length and spatial fiber orientation, which are based on image processing systems, reveal even small differences in morphology. Measuring spatial fiber orientation on polished cross‐sections by means of an image processor is a newer concept, that allows fast and quantitative description and optimization of the mold filling process. Some examples show the performance of the method; the measured fiber orientation is used to model thermal expansion and Young's modulus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plastic energy dissipation (PED) of polymer particulates is, essentially, the energy dissipated during large and repeated plastic deformations of compacted polymer particulates while still in the solid state. PED is higher or much higher than VED, the viscous energy dissipation source of polymeric melts, because the stresses necessary to plastically deform viscoelastic polymer solids are orders of magnitude higher than the stresses needed to support viscous flow. In the last few years our group has demonstrated experimentally the dominant role which PED plays in the heating/melting of solid polymer (compacted) particulate beds in compounding processing equipment, such as twin‐screw extruders and counterrotating continuous mixers/melters, in which the deformation of solid polymers is mandatory. We have also developed simple empirical methods of predicting the total axial distance needed for melting a given polymer in specific processing/compounding machines and processing. conditions, as well as the melting rates, all based on the mechanical energy dissipated during solid particulate compression. This work explores the more complex issue of how the PED behavior of single‐component polymers may affect the PED (and the heating/melting) behavior of multi‐component polymer blends. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A chemical link between the elastomer and the epoxy resin was promoted employing tolylene diisocyanate (TDI). In the first step, HTPB and TDI (in excess) reacted forming urethane links, and after increasing the temperature and adding a catalyst, TDI–HTPB reacted with epoxy resin forming oxazolidone links. The reactions were followed by FTIR and chemical analysis. The final cured materials contained up to 10 phr of elastomer. Impact resistance increased with elastomer concentration up to 5 phr of HTPB, which was present as rubber particles with average diameter ranging from 1 to 4 μm. Higher concentrations of HTPB resulted in larger particles and gave lower impact values.

The techniques described in this study include methods for measuring particle size distribution, particle shape characteristics, static and dynamic angles of repose, powder shear strength, and angle of internal friction. All powders examined had similar particle size distribution profiles, with distributions skewed to the coarser, −35 mesh size particles. The static and dynamic angles of repose were quite similar and the latter were essentially independent of the volume fraction of powder in the rotating cylinder and of the speed of rotation of the cylinder. All powders had shape parameters–elongational ratio, chunkiness, circularity, and roundness–that were essentially similar and independent of particle size, and the compressibilities of the bulk powders were not strongly dependent on powder bed height.",

The influence of loaded TMPTMA wt% and irradiation doses on the physico‐mechanical properties reveal that the gel content is higher for polyethylene‐rich blend and reaches its maximum values at 30 kGy. Moreover, incorporation of TMPTMA monomer was found to positively influence the gel content of all samples under investigation. On the other hand, the mechanical strength increases on increasing the irradiation dose and attains its highest value at 20 kGy; a more pronounced effect was observed due to incorporation of TMPTMA into isotactic polypropylene (iPP) than LDPE samples at low irradiation doses. However, higher irradiation doses have a deleterious influence on iPP or iPP‐rich blends. In addition to the physico‐mechanical properties, the influence of TMPTMA loading as well as irradiation doses on heat shrinkage parameters of the neat polymers and their blends have also been studied. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Numerical simulation of heat transfer involving convection and radiation shows significant temperature differences between the inside and outside film surfaces, which gradually decrease and eventually become negligible near the frost line. The differences are influenced by the magnitude of local heat transfer coefficients.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed primary complex formation between carbodiimide‐activated carboxylic acids on the protein with protein amino groups. As a result of temperature‐induced conformational changes in PNIPAAm grafted onto the protein backbone, these protein hydrogels show significant morphological changes in response to temperature. The structural changes of the gels in response to temperature were assessed using scanning electron microscopy, and the effect of temperature on their balance of hydrophobicity was found using turbidity measurements. Composite pore‐filled membranes formed by impregnating glass fiber filters with the polymer mixture prior to gelation were used to determine permeability changes in response to temperature using both low (riboflavin) and intermediate (lysozyme) molecular weight diffusates. Clear correlation was found between changes in morphology, turbidity, and gel permeability as the gel temperature was increased from 24–37°C. In the case of permeability studies, significant transport of lysozyme only occurred at temperatures above the lower transition temperature of the hydrogel, suggesting the gel was acting as a mechanical “valve'' to control flux. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract An experimental route for investigating polymer crystallization over a wide range of cooling rates (from 0.01 to 1000°C/s) and pressures (from 0.1 to 40 MPa) is illustrated, using a method that recalls the approach adopted in metallurgy for studying structure development in metals. Two types of experimental setup were used, namely an apparatus for fast cooling of thin films (100–200 μm thick) at various cooling rates under atmospheric pressure and a device (based on a on‐purpose modified injection molding machine) for quenching massive samples (about 1–2 cm 3 ) under hydrostatic pressure fields. In both cases, ex situ characterization experiments were carried out to probe the resulting structure, using techniques such as density measurements and wide‐angle x‐ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns. The cooling mechanism and temperature distribution across the sample thickness were analyzed. Results show that the final structure is determined only by the imposed thermal history and pressure. Experimental results for isotactic polypropylene (iPP), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyamide 6 (PA6), and syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) are reported, showing the reliability of this experimental approach to assess not only quantitative information but also a qualitative description of the crystallization behavior of different classes of semicrystalline polymers. The present study gives an opportunity to evaluate how the combined effect of the cooling rate and pressure influences the crystallization kinetics for various classes of polymer of commercial interest. An increase in the cooling rate translates into a decrease in crystallinity and density, which both experience a sudden drop around the specific “crystallizability” (or “critical cooling rate”) of the material examined. The exception is sPS where competition among the various crystalline modifications determines a minimum in the plot of density vs. cooling rate. As for the effect of pressure, iPP exhibits a “negative dependence” of crystallization kinetics upon pressure, with a decrease of density and degree of crystallinity with increasing pressure, owing to kinetic constraints. PA6 and PET, on the other hand, due to thermodynamic factors resulting in an increase in T m with pressure, exhibits a “positive dependence” of crystallization kinetics upon pressure. Finally, recent original results concerning sPS have shown that the minimum in the density vs. cooling rate curve shifts toward larger cooling rates upon increasing pressure. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Also, electrical ( AC conductivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and complex impedance) and magnetic properties were investigated for all nano composite samples. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of polymer nano composites. Moreover, the absorption bands of polyaniline were shifted in the presence of the three different ferrites, confirming the presence of interactions between the different phases in all composites.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this work, a solvent‐free microsphere‐templating process was developed to fabricate porous elastomers. The process starts with preparation of a porous wax template by thermal sintering at a temperature close to the wax melting temperature. Then, low‐viscosity monomers for elastomeric polyurethane were cast into the wax template. Finally, after casting and curing of the elastomer, the wax component was removed by mechanical forces (centrifuge or squeezing) to produce a porous elastomer. With this process, polyurethane scaffolds with a co‐continuous porous structure were successfully prepared. The optimal sintering temperature for the wax template was attained about 4°C below the wax peak melting temperature, leading to a stable process for joining wax microspheres into a three‐dimensional porous template. Mechanistic approaches were found to be effective for extracting wax in the cast polyurethane; more than 90% of wax can be simply removed by mechanical squeezing above the wax melting temperature. After wax removal, the polyurethane demonstrated a morphology with micropores interconnected by microchannels, indicating the interconnectivity of the porous structure. Tensile tests showed that the resulting porous material is highly deformable and elastic, exhibiting typical properties of polyurethane elastomers. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rheoviscometric properties of low and high substituted carboxymethyl starch (CMS) 2 wt% aqueous solutions and their dispersions with sodium, calcium, and organomodified montmorillonite (MMT) have been investigated. The influence of MMT type and content on viscosity of CMS (degree of substitution, DS, 0.90)/sodium MMT aqueous dispersions, their stability, and transparency during storage up to 18 months has been investigated. Moreover, the methods of MMT dispergation in low substituted CMS solutions (DS 0.15), that is, mechanical stirring or mechanical and ultrasonication stirring on viscosity have been compared. It resulted in higher viscosity when using the latter mixing procedure (7000 and 9250 mPa·s, respectively, at 1 rpm for CMS (DS 0.15)/7 phr calcium MMT). In addition, thermal resistance of native starch and both CMS with different DS values has been investigated. The results are important as far as commercial applications of CMS solutions or dispersions with MMTs are concerned. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Supercritical fluid (SCF) dosage is one of the most important parameters for the microcellular injection molding process. Current fierce market competition calls for high part quality and consistency, which places stringent requirements on the accuracy and repeatability of the SCF dosage and the dosing system. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN)‐based SCF dosage control strategy was proposed. An ANN model was constructed and utilized to predict the coming SCF pressure drop in the current injection molding cycle, which is a dominant factor and major source of uncertainty of the SCF dosage. Precompensation to the SCF delivery pressure can then be made according to the prediction to achieve a repeatable SCF pressure drop and thus a repeatable SCF dosage for every injection molding cycle. The result shows that this control strategy can be successfully implemented and that it leads to significant improvements in dosage consistency and part quality. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study addresses the characterization of nano and hybrid poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)‐based composites obtained by injection molding process. The aim is to demonstrate the effect of adding various nanoclay amounts on the morphology and mechanical behavior of unreinforced and glass fiber (GF) reinforced PET matrices. Also, it addresses the possibility of preserving the mechanical response of the composites while decreasing the amount of GF. Nanocomposites were prepared by adding 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 wt% of montmorillonite to the unreinforced PET matrix; hybrid composites were also prepared by adding the aforementioned nanoclay amounts to the 20% GF reinforced PET (PET20). A 35% GF reinforced PET was used as a reference material for the mechanical properties comparison. X‐ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the characteristic (001) peak of the nanocomposite obtained by extrusion shifted to the lower angle region stating an intercalated structure. The subsequent injection molding process altered the morphological structure of the composites, reducing the basal distance for small loadings of nanoclays. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the addition of nanoclay increases the degree of crystallinity and decreases the cold crystallization temperature of both PET systems. Full exfoliation of the nanoclay was not attained but the nanoparticles dispersion in combination with their intercalated morphology improved the mechanical properties of PET composites optimally for 1% of incorporation. The envisaged mechanical properties of PET20 were improved (initial modulus ↑22%, stress at yield ↑14%, and strain at break ↑4%) for the aforementioned optimal value of incorporation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Influence of the casting thickness, coagulation bath temperature, evaporation time, and casting solution temperature on membrane performance and morphology was investigated. The flat‐sheet membranes prepared by immersion precipitation technique were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Membrane performance was evaluated by estimation of flux and rejection using blue indigo dye suspension as the feed. The results showed that by increasing the casting thickness, flux was initially improved due to the formation of more macrovoids. However, a further thickness increment leads to lower flux due to establishment of higher resistance against the water flow. Effect of the coagulation bath temperature and evaporation time on membrane morphology was particularly correlated to the temperature difference between the coagulation bath and the casting solution. For similar temperature of casting solution and coagulation bath, higher flux was observed for shorter evaporation time. However, higher flux was obtained for longer evaporation time when the temperature of casting solution and coagulation bath was dissimilar. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Here, a novel ternary semi‐interpenetrating polymer networks (semi‐IPNs) were prepared by introducing poly (ethylene glycol), (PEG) into acrylamide/sodium acrylate, (AAm/SA) hydrogels. Water uptake and dye sorption properties of AAm/SA hydrogels and AAm/SA/PEG semi‐IPNs were investigated as a function of chemical composition of the hydrogels. Inclusion of hydrophilic monomer in the acrylamide hydrogels caused high swelling capacity and better absorbency for cationic dye molecules. FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of different repeating units in the semi‐IPNs. For swelling characterization, swelling experiments were performed in water at 25°C, gravimetrically. Some swelling and diffusion characteristics were calculated for different semi‐IPNs and hydrogels prepared under various formulations. AAm/SA hydrogels and AAm/SA/PEG semi‐IPNs were used in experiments on sorption of water‐soluble cationic dye such as “ Janus Green B '' (JGB). For sorption of JGB, the polymeric systems were studied by batch sorption technique at 25°C. Hydrogels and semi‐IPNs developed in this study may serve as a potential device for super water retainer and sorbent for removal of some agents and dye molecules. The utilization of these types of materials, in pharmaceuticals, agriculture, biotechnology, environment, separation, purification, and immobilization makes hydrogels more popular. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coupled polymer/composite parts were obtained for adapting a bladder‐molding technique previously developed for the production of hollow components with continuous fiber‐reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites. The internal layer (bladder side) is made up of an unreinforced thermoplastic polymer, linear low‐density polyethylene (LLDPE), and the external one (mold side) is made up of a thermoplastic matrix composite based on isotactic polypropylene (PP) and E‐glass fabric. The adhesion between the two layers is achieved by applying pressure (&lt;1 bar) through a silicone bladder. The composite/polymer interface was characterized by the evaluation of the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) (between composite and unreinforced polymer), flexural stiffness, and short‐beam strength analysis. The experimental mechanical properties were compared with model results, derived on the assumption that perfect adhesion exists between the two layers. A good agreement between the predicted and experimental mechanical properties was observed. As indicated by double notch shear tests used for the IFSS evaluation, good adhesion between LLDPE and PP matrix composite was achieved during processing. The results reported confirm the suitability of the method for a double‐layer structure fabrication. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effect of reaction variables, including the amount of cross‐linking agent and initiator, the weight ratio of both (AA + TMAAC) to KGM and AA to (AA + TMAAC), neutralization degree of AA, bath temperature, as well as reaction time, on the water absorbency of the superabsorbent polymer was investigated. The maximum water absorbency of the optimized product was 550 g/g for distilled water and 60 g/g at a 0.9 wt% aqueous NaCl solution. Moreover, the effect of the pH of the solution on the water absorbency of the copolymers was studied. The results showed that water absorbency was maximum at the acidic and alkaline conditions. The water absorbency at the isoelectric point was relatively low.

The solvent properties of sc‐CO 2 are adjusted in such a way that it acts as a pressure‐adjustable porogen. All the reactions were carried out at pressures of 70–320 bar and a temperature of 75°C with an agitation speed of 700 rpm.

Similarly, the pore diameter of the particle was observed to be increasing with an increase in pressure and to reach a maximum value (209 nm) at pressure 200 bar. The diameters of the microspheres and the pore size were controlled by varying the pressure of CO 2 inside the reactor during the polymerization process.

A solution of peracetic acid can be used to degrade colored compounds in bloodmeal, yielding a light yellow material. This causes an increase in β‐sheets in the protein's secondary structure, but the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) and triethylene glycol ( TEG ) reduced α‐helical and β‐sheet content, thereby increasing random coils. Without SDS , chains were less capable of folding into these structures, preventing sufficient intermolecular interactions and chain entanglement, leading to low specific mechanical energy input ( SME ) during extrusion, and poor consolidation. The whiteness of molded samples showed no correlation with SME during extrusion or the degree of consolidation after extrusion; however, they were observed to have a higher level of whiteness with increasing TEG content and should be considered as a secondary process not directly linked to extrusion. Increasing the amount of water during extrusion increased the Young's modulus (E) by facilitating formation of new interactions, while increasing TEG decreased E as a result of plasticization. The action of SDS on destabilizing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions was beneficial to extrusion, although it had no further effect during injection molding. TEG had virtually no effect on tensile strength, although it was required for flow and facilitated the formation of strong interactions after water had been evaporated during conditioning.",

In this respect, the present work deals with the manufacture of custom‐built Poly Lactic Acids ( PLA s), which are designed to be compostable, suitable for food contact and are characterized by a good compromise between mechanical properties and thermal stability. A commercial grade PLA was, therefore, compounded in a twin‐screw co‐rotating extruder by the use of specific additives: maleated and glycidyl methacrylate PLA s as compatibilizers/chain extenders and microlamellar talc as mineral filler/nucleation promoter. After pelletizing, the resulting compounds were melt‐processed by injection and compression molding. Differential scanning calorimetry, flexural tests in static machine and top‐hat cylindrical flat indentations were performed to evaluate the thermal and mechanical response of the molded components. The experimental findings show that crystallization of the PLA can be controlled by fine‐tuning the compound formulation as well as by properly setting the processing parameters. In addition, achievement of the appropriate crystallization degree in the polymer can lead to molded components, which exhibit improved mechanical strength and high thermal stability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to design a matrix transdermal patch of ketoprofen and allopurinol for the possible treatment of arthritis with reduced side effects. For this purpose, a bilayer matrix transdermal patch was prepared with an immediate release layer of Methocel containing ketoprofen while secondary sustained layer composed of allopurinol with combinations of Eudragit RL 100 and Methocel. The patch was studied for swelling index in distilled water and was found to increase with an increase in concentration of hydrophilic polymer. The in vitro dissolution was conducted in USP dissolution apparatus II using phosphate buffer saline ( pH 7.4) as dissolution medium at 37 ± 2°C. Based on in vitro dissolution studies, KA 1 BL (99.65% release in 10 hr) was selected for ex vivo permeation studies through Franz diffusion cell using excised abdominal skin of albino rats, and using clove oil and menthol as permeation enhancers. The optimized formulation KA 1 BL ‐M 3 released 69.37% drug over 12 hr and followed zero‐order kinetics with anomalous release mechanism. The patch had uniform distribution of components as per digital microscopic analysis.",

P ( MMA ‐co‐ MAH ) was synthesized by grafting maleic anhydride ( MAH ) onto methyl methacrylate ( MMA ). Microstructure, water‐absorbent properties, and mechanical properties of WSR were investigated. The results showed that P ( MMA ‐co‐ MAH ) boosted the dispersibility between CPN a AA and CPE and led to the increase in Shore A hardness, tensile strength, tensile stress at 100%, and water‐swelling behavior, whereas the elongation at break and weight loss were decreased with P ( MMA ‐co‐ MAH ) content. When the content of P ( MMA ‐co‐ MAH ) reached 8 phr, the tensile strength, hardness, and water‐swelling ability of dry‐state WSR exhibited a maximum value and the percentage loss ratio of CPN a AA reached a relatively low value.",

The novelty of the research is the use of extrusion process in the preparation of composites containing two different fillers: carbonyl iron powder (CIP) as magnetic filler and carbon black (FEF, N550) as reinforcing one. So far, the process of extrusion has been used to prepare magnetic composites without filler that improve mechanical properties. It is worth mentioning that the polymer matrix (ethylene-octene copolymer, EOR) offers excellent performance in extrusion applications. In this research, two methods of magnetic composites preparation were reported: traditional, during two-roll mill, and a new one using extrusion process. It was found that the usage of new processing technology allowed forming more homogenous dispersion of particles in elastomer matrix and oriented polymer chains, resulting in an improved rheometric characteristic, increased crosslink density, and decrease of the storage modulus (Payne effect). Based on both static/dynamic mechanical properties and damping properties under the influence of compression stress, the positive influence of extrusion process on material characteristics was confirmed. Moreover, all composites proved very good magnetic properties and resistance to thermooxidative ageing.",

The effect of T-ZnOw on MCC/PP-g-MA/rPP composite was investigated by mechanical testing, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Addition of T-ZnOw enhanced the mechanical properties of composites with tensile and flexural strengths increasing by 10% and 6%, respectively. SEM studies showed an improvement in the compatibility of fracture surfaces, which was evident from the absence of gaps between fillers and rPP. Additionally, initial thermal decomposition temperature and maximum weight loss temperature of T-ZnOw/MCC/PP-g-MA/rPP composite were both higher than those of MCC/PP-g-MA/rPP composite. Thermal degradation kinetics suggested that T-ZnOw has a weak catalytic effect on MCC, resulting in the early degradation of MCC and adhesion to the surface of rPP. Because of the presence of inorganic whiskers, the remaining weight percent was more than that of other composites at the end of the reaction. Crystallization temperature of the T-ZnOw/MCC/PP-g-MA/rPP composite was almost 3~5°C higher than that of MCC/PP-g-MA/rPP composite and close to the crystallization temperature of pure rPP.",

To determine the effects of the enzyme action, we analyzed the energy required for refining, related yield, and the dimension, deformation, and morphology of the fibers. We found that, with the xylanase pretreatment, the refining energy was reduced by 4%, with the yield of fibers being maintained at &gt;85%. In addition, the fiber bundles were defibered further, resulting in reduced average length of the fiber. Furthermore, the fiber widths increased because of the improved swelling effect of the xylanase pretreatment. However, in some instances, the fine elements were reduced. With a low enzyme dosage, the fiber coarseness decreased remarkably and, because of the swelling and softening effects of the xylanase pretreatment on the mulberry branches, the fiber kink ratios and curl were reduced. Additionally, the mulberry branch tissue was loosened, facilitating fiber separation. In view of these findings, the biomechanical process could be a potentially green and efficient process for the manufacturing of mulberry branch fibers.",

The DE was significantly influenced by pH of extraction solution, extraction time, and temperature through the analysis of variance. In addition, the values of DE reduced with the increasing of extraction temperature, lapse of time, and decreasing of pH value.

Significant improvement of both elastic and storage modulus (ca. four times higher than pure hydrogel) is observed in this approach.

Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrated an increase from 0.02 to 0.11 mS cm –1 with infused MWCNT. The MWCNT‐infused hydrogels demonstrated a 400% increase in deswelling capabilities during an applied electrical stimulus compared to a noninfused hydrogel. In conclusion, infusing the MWCNT into the hydrogel increased its electrical conductivity, which allows the hydrogel to deswell more rapidly with an applied electrical bias without compromising its mechanical or swelling properties.",

With an increase in the concentration of PMMA in the solution from 18 to 26 w/v%, the mean diameter of nanofibers increased from 73 ± 16 to 968 ± 97 nm. The results demonstrate that the use of thinner PMMA nanofibers results in a lower limit of thermal conductivity and better thermal insulation performance that means lower radiative conductivity. It can be related to a higher specific surface of thinner PMMA nanofibers that means more surface area for radiative scatter and absorption lead to lower conductivity. With increasing surface density of PMMA nanofibers web, the thermal conductivity was reduced and water vapor transmission rate and thermal insulation ability were improved. Higher porosity percentage and smaller pore sizes in the web with higher surface density could result in lower thermal conductivity.",

Diffusion coefficients of the 6 and 12 wt% CNF-reinforced films were lower than that of the blank film. Incorporation of CNF enhanced the thermal stability of the films by shifting the onset of degradation to a higher temperature and also by increasing the char residue.",

Results revealed that incorporation of amidoacid‐functionalized Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle into the polyamide improved the thermal and combustion properties of polyamide compared to the neat Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles.

The prepared nanocomposites with different concentrations of MWNT were characterized by various properties such as morphology, hydrophobicity, electrical, thermal, and rheological properties. The morphology of nanocomposite was changed from smooth to nano‐pin‐like with the addition of MWNT . The varied concentration of MWNT led to differing hydrophobicity of nanocomposite. Increasing the loaded amount of MWNT in the nanocomposite led to decreased electrical resistivity up to 3.1 × 10 3 Ω cm because of percolation of the MWNT in the polymer matrix. In addition, we investigated the enhancement of thermal performance (10% of lower crystallization peak) of the prepared nanocomposite.

The PCM used was the mixture of liquid and solid paraffin. To get an optimal combination regimen, orthogonal experiments of four factors and three levels were used. All samples were examined by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ). Their cyclic endothermic and exothermic phase change latent heat were observed and calculated. Then, the most reasonable and effective experimental conditions were chosen to prepare the I‐ PCM and O‐ PCM with the best heat storage and release capacity. These clays were then characterized by diffusion‐oozing circle method, thermogravimetric ( TG ) analysis, scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ), X‐ray diffraction ( XRD ), Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy, and other testing methods. The diffusion‐oozing circle results showed that O‐ PCM was almost extremely stable compared with that of I‐ PCM according to the leakage circle. In XRD analysis, expansions of the spacings in the plane were observed for all O‐ PCM s. This indicated that the intercalation of surfactants and paraffin molecules in the galleries of MMT was successfully achieved. TG ‐ DTG analysis of these clays illustrated that all O‐ PCM s could be suitable for industrial applications due to their high thermal stability. DSC analysis illustrated that O‐ PCM samples possessed a more stable structure together with better heat storage and release capacity compared with that of I‐ PCM samples.",

Although the results do not match, due to the invalidity of the Cox–Merz rule for such composites, both types of measurements indicate that increasing the filler concentration results in significantly higher viscosities and increased shear thinning. The errors associated with the use of a conical die due to viscous dissipation are assessed through computer simulations. They are small for relatively small throughputs (small pressure drops). The experimental results for viscosity are compared to predictions of the Einstein–Batchelor equation for suspensions of spherical particles, the Guth–Simha equation, and the empirical Krieger–Dougherty correlation, for filler loadings of up to 70% by weight. The comparison indicates that reasonable approximations of the consistency index of the power law viscosity model are possible through using the above expressions for loadings up to perhaps 40–50% by weight.",

Herein, we report a facile method for improving the impact-peel and adhesive strengths of epoxy resins via the incorporation of two different types of polyether amines (monoamine-based and diamine-based prepolymers). A comparative study was performed to investigate the potential advantages of incorporating a prepolymer into an epoxy resin matrix. It was discovered that the incorporation of a diamine prepolymer significantly improved the impact-peel strength of the epoxy resin system at low (-40°C) and room (23°C) temperatures. For 15 wt% adhesive loading, the diamine prepolymer-based epoxy system demonstrated a 130% (low temperature) and 32% (room temperature) higher impact-peel strength than the monoamine prepolymer-based epoxy system. Moreover, the 15 wt% diamine prepolymer-based epoxy system exhibited a significantly improved shear strength (~36 MPa) and T-peel strength (260 N/25 mm) owing to the effectively reduced crack propagation and cohesive interactions between the epoxy molecules. Our results suggest that the modification of epoxy resins with an appropriate amount of mono and diamine-functionalized elastomers provides a novel route for the development of highly efficient adhesive materials for various applications.",

To intuitively observe the fracture process of the CFRP composites, the digital image correlation system was employed. It is verified that the moderate addition of GO can improve the stress concentration of the CFRP composites during the deformation process. In addition, the reinforcing mechanism is investigated by analyzing the fracture surface of the modified epoxy resin and the CFRP composites. The results indicate that GO can make the cracks deflect or bifurcate along with the epoxy resin which closes to graphene, resulting in synergistically improved mechanical and interfacial properties of the GO-modified CFRP composites.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the flame retardancy of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and maintain its excellent foamability, nanosilica (nano-SiO2), and zinc diethyl hypophosphite (ZDP) were selected as synergistic flame retardants, and pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) was used as a chain extender to carry out flame retardant and chain extension modification of PET simultaneously. The flame retardancy and flame-retardant mechanism of modified PET were characterized by limiting oxygen index, vertical combustion test, thermogravimetric analysis, and SEM. Dynamic rheological test and DSC were used to analyze the rheological and thermal properties. The foaming ability was also studied by batch foaming experiments. The test results indicated that nano-SiO2 and ZDP had a synergistic effect, which could significantly improve flame retardancy of PET. The vertical combustible grade of modified PET reached V-0 grade, and the limiting oxygen index increased from 21% to about 30%. The role of nano-SiO2 on the flame retardancy of PET was mainly to increase compactness and strength of the carbon layer, which could block combustible gas produced by the pyrolysis of PET and resist dripping behavior. At the same time, the addition of nano-SiO2 increased the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of PET. Otherwise, nano-SiO2 could act as a bubble-nucleating agent and improve the foaming ability of modified PET. When the addition amount was 1 wt%, not only did the maximum foaming ratio increase but the foaming temperature zone was also widened from 225°C-235°C to 225°C-250°C. Finally, a flame-retardant PET system with good foaming property was proposed.",

    "abstract": "Drilling in synthetic fiber-reinforced polymer composites is facing challenges due to their anisotropic, inhomogeneity, and abrasive machining behavior. The joining of composite parts using fasteners is commonly done by the drilling, and the generated heat is one of the main causes to damage the drilled hole in the composite. Moreover, the quality of drilled hole is crucial for joining parts effectively. The paper presents the design, fabrication, and drilling of a hybrid fiber-reinforced polymer (HFRP) based on insulative coating. These composites were fabricated using vacuum infusion molding (VIM) and coated with different thicknesses to investigate the influence of drilling parameters and associated damages. Cutting speed, feed rate, and coating thicknesses were varied, and a full factorial design of the experiment was formulated. High-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit was used to drill the coated composite and test samples, and delamination factor and surface roughness were measured. ANOVA and full factorial response optimizer were used to evaluate the influence and optimum drilling parameters. The delamination factor (DF) at the entry and surface roughness were found to decrease with the increasing cutting speed. However, the DF at the exit showed the opposite. Coating thickness influenced the delamination at the entry whereas delamination at the exit has been found insignificant. For drilling HFRP composite with 1 mm coating thickness, 3000 RPM spindle speed and 0.08 mm/rev feed rate were found optimum parameters in minimizing surface roughness and delamination damage. However, 6000 RPM and 0.02 mm/rev were found optimum parameters for drilling HFRP composite with 1.5 mm coating thickness.",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed changes of the recycled PLA’s surface tension and crystallization degree in a greater extent than in the newly prepared film, revealing better incorporation of the recovered composite into the PLA matrix. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy showed the formation of C–O–Ti bridges between composite and PLA both in new and recycled film. Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the new and recycled film decreased by 33% and 45%, respectively, in comparison with reference PLA. The curd cheese was successfully stored in the recycled packaging; the organoleptic characteristics of cheese wrapped in recycled film were superior in comparison with the new film.

    "abstract": "Abstract Given the tight competition in the area of plastics for medical applications, the requirements for consistent quality, standardized, safe, and low‐cost medical components have become a big challenge for molders. The survival of injection molding companies for medical applications depends strongly on the success of design, manufacturing, and marketing strategies that different companies have established to meet these requirements. Very often, the design and manufacturing operations to produce medical plastics for the health‐care market have to be adjusted on a daily basis in order to satisfy increasingly strict, government‐regulated, biomedical requirements in addition to all the other pressures expected in this market. As a result, molders of medical plastics are always seeking more systematic ways to improve product quality and produce more at a minimum cost. This brings an advantage to those processors that can combine high‐tech molding with low‐cost production. In this article, based on the open literature, we present a review of the latest activities (last decade) in the field of injection molding of medical plastics together with some comments on modern injection molding processes that can be used. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

However, the exact value of the stress for viscoelastic liquids at the synthetic inlet is a priori unknown. In this article, we present the application of the “free boundary condition” to the inlet stress, which avoids the necessity of specifying an a priori unknown value of stress at the synthetic inlet. To apply the free boundary condition, the process must be cast and studied as a two-point boundary value problem by finite elements. To verify the admissibility and accuracy of the free boundary condition, the same process is cast and studied as an initial value problem, directly solvable by a DGEAR subroutine. The initial value problem is cast in a matrix form that allows analytic investigation of admissible solutions: With the upper convected Maxwell model, the fiber can only slim monotonically with the downstream distance, whereas with the Giesekus model there may be cases of initially increasing and subsequently decreasing diameter, i.e., extrudate-swelling. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An investigation was undertaken on the application of the three‐dimensional solubility parameter method to predict miscibility of polyblends. The three‐dimensional method attempts to account for the combined effects of dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding interactions between molecules. This study focused mainly on the miscibility of blends of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with homopolymers as well as with copolymers. The three components of solubility parameters were calculated from the group contributions of the structural units of the polymers. By comparing the parameters of different PVC blends in two categories, PVC/homopolymer and PVC/copolymer blends, the miscibility trend of PVC blends was revealed. The three‐dimensional solubility parameter approach successfully predicted the miscibility of several homopolymers. For copolymers, the chance of miscibility was increased because of the ability to adjust the solubility parameter through composition. This was reflected in a smaller distance between the solubility parameter of copolymer and that of PVC. Experimental results reported in the literature confirmed this conclusion. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Proper use of this technology has enhanced engineers' capability in handling all aspects of the molding process and has been proven to benefit both productivity and product quality. However, while CAE can serve as a powerful tool to help engineers make rational engineering decisions, it is by no means a panacea for solving all molding problems. The viability of CAE packages depends heavily not only on the scientific principles and numerical methods used for developing the software, but also on the reliability of the input data such as material properties and process conditions. This article discusses the state‐of‐the‐art of the technology with an emphasis on simulations of latest innovations in injection molding.

    "abstract": "This article describes the outcome of an investigation into the rotational molding of liquid plastics. Three liquid plastic systems were assessed: (1) a nylon block copolymer, Nyrim; (2) two grades of polyvinyl chloride plastisol, Acrol DS409A and Hydro PRC/65/0307/9270; and (3) two grades of polyurethane, Hyperlast 7850506 and Hyperlast 7853184. Initially, resin flow behavior was assessed in the uniaxial rotation mode. Characteristic flow regimes were identified for each liquid. The onset and duration of a particular regime depends on the initial viscosity of the liquid, its repooling behavior, and its curing profile. For a particular material, the finished part appearance (hydrocysts, bubbles, fault-free, etc.) depends on the mold rotation speed and material shot size, as well as mold geometry. A fault-free operating criterion is presented for the uniaxial rotation of liquid plastics. Uniaxial rotation tests are useful for predicting general trends in biaxial rotation of liquid plastics. The most important factors in determining the state of a finished part made by biaxial rotation are: (i) resin initial viscosity and curing profile; (ii) mold rotation speed; (iii) shot size; and (iv) mold shape. An ideal viscosity profile for a rotational molding liquid resin, based on information gained from both uniaxial and biaxial rotation tests, is proposed. The rheology of each material was also examined and the profiles observed were related to the molding behavior of each liquid. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The model process presented here belongs to the first category: It is proposed dissolution of the starting material, reprecipitation, thorough washing of the polymer obtained, and drying. With regard to the solvent mixtures involved, these are separated by distillation for further reuse. The technique is applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) molding compound, recycled as model starting material. The following criteria are considered: (a) precipitation of the polymer in an acceptable form; (b) maximum “waste” concentration; (c) maximum solution/nonsolvent volume ratio; and (d) maximum extent of poly(methyl methacrylate), solvent, and nonsolvent recovery. On the basis of these criteria, toluene/ n ‐hexane proved to be the most satisfactory solvent/nonsolvent system. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Here, free radical polymerization occurs with an unusual but widely applicable polymer precipitation phenomenon. Local heating is observed in the vicinity of the radical sites, which results in the controlled rate of propagation with a decrease in the rate of radical–radical termination reactions. In the case experiments, the existence of hot spots in the reactor fluid is shown to occur. There is also evidence of slowdown of the growth of polymer radicals after initiator decomposition. The polymer radicals, shown to have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, continue to grow at a controlled rate long after all the initiator molecules have decomposed. The addition of a second monomer results in the formation of a thermoplastic elastomer triblock copolymer. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reactive molding process of thermosetting materials is an area where advanced computer simulations can provide useful information to detect molding problems prior to the mold making. Examples of such problems are premature gelation, undesired weld‐line locations, and air traps. However there is a lack of suitable software that would allow the modeling in a fully three‐dimensional (3‐D) space for such reactive systems. A new approach for the 3‐D simulation of reactive molding process is presented in the paper. In the filling stage fluid dynamics and heat transfer are modeled within a system of resin and a mold, combined with appropriate viscosity and curing reaction models. During the curing phase only heat transfer and curing kinetics are taken into account. The presented approach was verified by comparing computational results for a cylindrical test to experimental measurements and was successfully applied on a real industrial process in manufacturing of a medium voltage combi sensor. The selected results of such simulations are also presented in the paper. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate in detail the adsorption performance of poly(2‐hydroxyethylmethacrylate–methacryloylamidophenylalanine) [p(HEMA–MAPA)] beads. The metal‐complexing comonomer MAPA was synthesized by reacting methacryloyl chloride with phenylalanine. Spherical beads with an average size of 150–200 μm were obtained by radical suspension polymerization of HEMA and MAPA, conducted in an aqueous dispersion medium. The beads had a specific surface area of 19.1 m 2 /g, and were characterized by means of swelling studies, FTIR, and elemental analysis. Beads with a swelling ratio of 68% and containing 3.2 mmol MAPA/g were used for the removal of heavy metal ions. Adsorption experiments were conducted with the MAPA‐functionalized beads involving the heavy metal ions cadmium, arsenic, chromium, mercury, and lead. Metal adsorption was found to be dependent on the characteristics of the solution (i.e., medium pH and metal concentration) and the type of metals to be adsorbed. We have obtained adsorption capacities equal to 669.4 mg/g for Hg(II), 584.4 mg/g for Pb(II), 268.4 mg/g for Cd(II), 204.1 mg/g for As(III), and 115.2 mg/g for Cr(III). The adsorption capacities on molar basis were in the order of Hg(II) &gt; Pb(II) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; As(III) &gt; Cr(III). Adsorption of heavy metal ions from synthetic wastewater was also studied. The adsorption capacities were 24.5 mg/g for Cd(II), 16.9 mg/g for Cr(III), 144.4 mg/g for Hg(II), 90.9 mg/g for Pb(II), and 8.0 mg/g for As(III) at 0.5 mmol/l initial metal concentration. Naturally, depending on the desired goals,the beads containing metal could be regenerated for appropriate disposal. Our results suggest that p(HEMA–MAPA) beads are good metal adsorbers and have a great potential for environmental protection. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is well known that blade geometry significantly affects the performance and efficiency of partially filled internal mixers. Intermesh type blades with very long tips are regarded as effective alternatives to almond‐shaped blades used in more traditional tangential rotor mixers. However, using long tip blades results in the formation of long and very narrow sections between the chamber wall and the blade in these mixers. These narrow sections may act as bottlenecks, disrupting flow and mixing of highly viscous compounds in the mixing of elastomers with fillers. Therefore, to avoid costly and time‐consuming trial‐and‐error procedures, the design of long tip blades requires careful quantitative evaluation of their performance. In this article, a computer model, based on the finite element method for the simulation of mixing in twin‐blade intermesh type mixers, is presented. This model represents transient, nonisothermal, non‐Newtonian flow and mixing of a polymer–filler compound in a free surface regime consisting of incompressible and compressible parts. Mixing dependent variations of compound viscosity are also taken into account. To incorporate all of the described realistic aspects of the mixing process in the geometrically complex domain of intermesh type mixers, the developed model is based on a novel and robust solution algorithm. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

A systematic experimental study involving a matrix of two independent variables (extruder throughput rate and screw rotational speed) was conducted on two different size twin‐screw extruders using a styrene copolymer and carbon black. Several process parameters were examined including melt temperature at the die, motor power, residence time distribution, and carbon black concentration in the extrudate. The residence time distribution data were fit to a three‐parameter plug flow/stirred tank model to obtain a time delay, a time constant, and a mean residence time for each extrusion condition. At low screw speeds, as utilized in many compounding processes, the mean residence time dropped only slightly with increasing screw diameter (for comparable screw length/screw diameter ratios). The carbon black concentrations as measured in the extrudate pellets were within ±5% of mean value, indicating that the extruder damped out the high frequency noise caused by feed rate fluctuations in the individual polymer and carbon black feeders.",

Sinkmarks occurring on the surface of molded parts caused by inappropriate mold design and processing conditions is one problem. In this report, an L'18 orthogonal array design based on the Taguchi method was conducted to minimize the sinkmarks of injection‐molded thermoplastic parts. The polymeric materials used were general‐purpose polystyrene and low‐density polyethylene. A plate cavity with various ribs was used for molding. Experiments were carried out on an 80‐ton reciprocating injection‐molding machine. After molding, the sinkmarks on the surface of molded parts were characterized by a profile meter. For the factors selected in the main experiments, the corner geometry and the width of the rib were found to be the principal factors affecting sinkmark formation in injection‐molded thermoplastics. A rib of an undercut geometry and a small width produces parts with the least sinkmark. Experimental investigation of an injection‐molding problem can help illuminate the formation mechanism of sinkmarks so that steps can be taken to optimize the surface quality of molded parts. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

This behavior was proportional to the amount of SEBS‐g‐MA that was added for samples having up to 10%, rubber, while additional amounts seem to have no further effect.

More specific, the influence of melt temperature and indentation location (closer or further from the sample edge parallel to the injection direction and across the weld line) has been followed on polycarbonate (PC) and polystyrene (PS) glassy samples. For both polymers at lower melt temperatures, a strong H decrease (between 15 and 50%) followed by a sharp increase in a narrow distance (around 0.10 mm), is observed. When the melt temperature increases up to 300°C (for PC) and 270°C (for PS), a much smaller H decrease is observed in the central part of the samples. However, closer to the tensile bar edges (2 mm) the weld line remains undetectable by microhardness measurements.

The possibility of manufacturing sPSU films by a continuous extrusion process is examined. The use of a plasticizer (polyethyleneglycol, PEG) is essential to decrease the glass transition temperature of the material in order to make it processable in the melt state. However, the acidic character of sPSU induces significant degradation of the sPSU/PEG mixtures even at low temperatures (120°C), necessitating the use of high amounts of PEG to perform the extrusion of sPSU film. In these experiments, 30–40% of plasticizer had to be used to successfully produce a film, but a high level of porosity was produced in the membrane after removing the PEG. Although porosity significantly improves the proton conductivity of the membranes, in a fuel cell, the fuel crossover also increases as a result. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a strategy to control cavity pressure profile during the cooling phase. In order to do this, a controlled variable parameter was defined to be the time constant τ of the pressure profile. This parameter can be used effectively to control the shape of the cavity pressure over the cooling cycle. The coolant flow rate through the mold was used as the manipulated variable. A predictive control system was designed and implemented successfully to allow monitoring and control of τ at several setpoints τ sp resulting in good and effective cavity pressure control. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The impregnation of a glass woven fabric with an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate copolymer (PET‐ g ) matrix was investigated using a finite element (FE) model for interbundle and intrabundle flow of the matrix. Micrographs of samples obtained by film stacking of PET‐ g to impregnate the glass fabric have confirmed the occurrence of interbundle and intrabundle flow, taking place as separate steps. On the basis of this evidence, two different mechanisms for the fiber impregnation were postulated. The first flow process is associated with a macroscale interbundle impregnation, whereas the second is associated with microscale intrabundle impregnation. Two different FE models were developed to simulate the microscopic and macroscopic flow of the matrix, considering a large number of different random fiber arrangements. Both models could account for the non‐Newtonian rheological behavior of the thermoplastic matrix. The microscale impregnation of fibers was simulated by using randomly spaced and nonoverlapping unidirectional filaments. The effect of the number of filaments and the number of random distributions necessary to achieve an adequate accuracy of the method was assessed. The results obtained from the simulation showed that at low pressures, the polymer melt exhibits Newtonian behavior, which makes it possible to predict the tow permeability by the Darcy law. A more difficult situation arises at high pressures because of the non‐Newtonian behavior of the melt. This requires the introduction of a value for the permeability that is also dependent on the rheological properties of the melt. The same non‐Newtonian behavior of the matrix was observed for macroscale impregnation of bundles. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The AGB was synthesized by reacting Na + ‐bentonite with (3‐acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane. The graft yield measured by thermogravimetric analysis was ca. 24%. Different concentrations (0, 1.0, 2.9, and 4.9 wt%, designated as CPAAm/AGB‐0, ‐1, ‐3, and ‐5, respectively) of AGB were then added to the in situ inverse emulsion copolymerization of acrylamide and [2‐(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride to produce the CPAAm/AGB nanocomposites. The nanocomposites improved the flocculation of the GCC suspension model significantly in an AGB concentration‐dependent manner. Dynamic drainage analysis revealed a decrease in dewatering time and turbidity from 11.2 s (pure CPAAm) to 8.7 s and from 349 to 33 NTU, respectively, at the same concentration (0.3 wt%) of nanocomposite. The results of the fabrication of handsheets revealed significant improvement (up to 2–8%) in the total retention yield and ash retention yield with increasing AGB concentration at the same GCC content. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effects of the chloroprene type, particle size, particle concentration, and electric field strength on the electrical properties, the storage modulus sensitivity, and the dielectrophoresis force were studied. Chloroprene W provides the highest storage modulus sensitivity at 55% and is chosen as the matrix. The electrical conductivity and the dielectric constant of the blends increase with an increasing concentration of PANI nano/large particles. The storage modulus of the blends (with and without the electric field) increases linearly with the PANI content. The maximum storage modulus sensitivities of the blends with PANI nano and large particles at E = 2 kV/mm are 73% at 0.01 vol% and 63% at 0.1 vol%, respectively. The dielectrophoresis force of all specimens increases monotonically with increasing electric field strength. The blends with PANI‐nano and large particles at 0.01 vol% generate higher dielectrophoresis forces than those of the pure chloroprene W. For the 0.1 vol% of PANI nano and large particles, the resultant deflection angle and dielectrophoresis forces are lower than those of the 0.01 vol% systems and the pure chloroprene W, presumably due to the diminishing resultant dipole moments generated with increasing PANI concentration. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mechanical properties, thermal resistance, and oil resistance of XNBRP‐filled NR were determined after various loadings of XNBRP were added. Results clearly show that the presence of XNBRP not only leads to increased compound viscosity but also causes deterioration of the mechanical properties, e.g., tensile strength, tear strength, abrasion resistance, rebound resilience, as well as compression set at elevated temperature. This is mainly attributed to the reduced cross‐link density and the poor interfacial adhesion between NR and XNBRP. However, both oil and thermal ageing resistances are found to improve continuously with increasing XNBRP loading. Such improvement is obvious when 20 phr of XNBRP is loaded. Although the rubber becomes softer after oil immersion, it is surprisingly found that the modulus at high strain of the swollen rubber is greater than that of the unswollen one. The network tightening effect is proposed to explain the results. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 30: 183–190, 2011; View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

The organomodified clay and irradiated rubber/clay samples were characterized using X‐ray diffraction (XRD), energy‐dispersive X‐ray (EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). EDX and TGA data confirmed the modification of clay particles using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The XRD patterns of the as‐prepared nanocomposites showed an indication of the presence of exfoliated clay layers at lower clay content whereas a phase‐separated (agglomeration) of organomodified clay layers was present at higher clay content. XRD data of unmodified clay/EPDM composites (EPDM–CCs) indicated that the rubber chains are not intercalated into the silicate galleries, that is, unmodified clay particles are simply incorporated into EPDM matrix in agglomerated states. EPDM–CNs and SBR–CNs nanocomposites show an exfoliated and/or a mixture of intercalated/exfoliated structures at lower (3–5 phr) and higher (10 phr) clay contents, respectively. TGA studies showed that the organomodified clay/rubber nanocomposites show a higher thermal stability in comparison with the unmodified clay/rubber composites. The improvement in the thermal properties is attributed to the organomodification of clay particles as well as the intercalation of rubber chains within silicate layers. In addition, EPDM–CNs nanocomposites exhibit a higher thermal stability than EPDM–CNs nanocomposites. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A new interfacial modifier containing silicon and phosphorus has been developed to improve the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of ethylene‐vinyl acetate ( EVA )/alumina trihydrate ( ATH ) composites. The EVA / ATH composites were prepared via blending EVA pellets with different kinds of ATH particles. The results showed a synergistic effect of phosphorus‐containing silane coupling agent ( DOSA ) and ATH particles on the flame retardancy of EVA composites. When compared with pure EVA of 19.1, the limiting oxygen index ( LOI ) value was increased to 31.4. This was the result of the formation of a charred layer and the enhanced compatibilities between inorganic particles and polymer matrix. The experimental results also showed that the modified ATH particles by using synthesized DOSA led to an increase in mechanical properties. The improvement on the mechanical and thermal properties of EVA composites was mostly attributed to the better dispersion ability of the modified ATH particles in the polymer matrix and a synergistic effect between the DOSA and ATH particles. The char‐formation ability of EVA composites has also been analyzed and the synthesized DOSA has shown a positive effect.",

Micro hardness testing and ball‐on‐disk wear test results showed that both hardness and wear resistance increased with an increase in the crystallinity of PEEK . It is observed that the annealed samples showed the highest wear resistance when compared with the water‐quenched samples which is attributed to the increased crystallinity in the case of the annealed samples.",

Using a shift factor, we could superimpose G of an SBR blend and an NR/SBR (1/9) blend onto a single master curve. In contrast, G of NR was split into two master curves. Although the master curve of G for the NR/SBR (3:7) blend was split, increasing the cross‐link density threefold made it possible to superimpose it onto a single master curve. Strain‐induced crystallization of NR in the NR/SBR blend did not occur as a result of decreasing the NR content, increasing the cross‐link density, or removing fatty acids. Together, these findings indicate that strain‐induced crystallization of NR plays an important role in the mechanical properties of the blend.",

So, in this research, blends of poly(m‐xylene adipamide) ( MXD 6) to PA 6 which are immiscible were investigated in terms of dynamics and structure development for biaxial stretching films. For this reason, the higher order structure and stretching behaviors of the blends were studied. As a result, blends of MXD 6 to PA 6 which had cylindrical structures improved the properties of easy straight cut and high barrier, but did not have good stretchability and film thickness uniformity. For these reasons, they were studied to develop the biaxial stretching film of polyamide which improved stretchability and film thickness uniformity.

Heavy calcium carbonate (Ca CO 3 ) and glass fiber ( GF ) were selected as two fillers to incorporate into polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) matrix in this work by taking consideration of their low cost and wide sources. Fillers were first modified with paraffin through wet and dry modification technique, and then PTFE /Ca CO 3 binary composites and PTFE /Ca CO 3 / GF ternary composites were prepared through die pressing and sintering process. Infrared spectroscopic analysis and compatibility test were used to investigate structure changes of the fillers before and after modification.

Results revealed that both dry and wet modification methods would improve the elongation at break and tensile strength of PTFE /Ca CO 3 binary composites, and wet modification method was more efficient in enhancing the mechanical properties than that of other ways. Large differences in mechanical strength appeared between the wet modification and unmodified method for binary composites when Ca CO 3 content reached 30 wt%. Moreover, the elongation at break for composites with 30 wt% of Ca CO 3 through wet modification can still exceed 200%. Vicat softening temperature of PTFE /Ca CO 3 binary composite with 15 wt% of wet‐modified Ca CO 3 was increased by 138.5% than that of PTFE /Ca CO 3 binary composite with same content of unmodified Ca CO 3 .",

In particular, the PVDF / ETFE (10/90 wt%) blend irradiated with different dose exhibited better thermal stability and mechanical properties than pure ETFE . X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrated that the fluorinated composite system underwent cross‐linking and degradation reactions as a result of HF elimination and the formation of unsaturated structures and hydroperoxide species. Furthermore, the melting property of irradiated samples changed from liquid‐like behavior to pseudo‐solid‐like behavior. The degree of crystallinity of irradiated samples was found to increase at the range of 0–30 kG y and then clearly decreases with further increase in the irradiation dose.

The obtained results allowed for creation of a product which can later be used in manufacturing biologically active dressing materials. The implementation of the laboratory scale showed that there is a possibility of upscaling the procedure to make it suitable for the needs of industry. Problems and risks associated with the transition to an industrial scale, such as process temperature control, time of the reaction and the method of isolation of product (emptying the industrial reactor from the reaction mixture), have been presented and discussed. The results of the tests showed the interdependence between the stages of production process, both in laboratory and in industrial scale. The realization of the presented project enabled solving the problems arising both from the preparation to the synthesis, carrying out the process itself, and obtaining the final product. An important factor in this case was to obtain the same physicochemical properties of the final product on both laboratory and industrial scale. The tests of biodegradation of butyric–acetic chitin copolyester in fresh human plasma and blood serum confirmed that two enzymatic degradation processes occur due to the presence of the enzymes in these body fluids. At the same time, enzymatic hydrolysis of ester bonds and enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycoside bonds of the main polysaccharide chain take place.",

Eventually, the specific energy consumption of the eccentric rotor, which was regarded as energy consumption evaluation index in the melt conveying process, could be calculated. The results showed that for different parameters, the eccentricity had the greatest impact on the specific energy consumption. With the increase in eccentricity, the energy consumption per unit melt transported decreased, and the extrusion output increased. The same tendency occurred for changing the pitch of the eccentric rotor, but the effect on the specific energy consumption was slight. When increasing the rotor speed and the rotor radius, the specific energy consumption increased.

    "abstract": "Abstract The polyol ester derived from palm oil polymers is a promising material for utilizing it as a polymeric drug carrier due to its natural and biocompatible properties. In this study, the palm oil‐based diol is used as a precursor for developing the polyol ester via the transesterification‐alcoholysis reaction of the diol with triethanolamine and lithium hydroxide. Preliminary results showed that the polyol ester displayed high hydroxyl value at 182.51 mg KOH /g with the yield reached more than 90%. Meanwhile, its molecular weight was around 5,000 Dalton. The appearances of ester (C–O) between 1,300 and 1,000 cm −1 in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra have confirmed the hydrolyzable ester structure of the polyol ester. Consequently, the δ H ‐ and δ C ‐ NMR spectra also confirmed the presences of the ester proton (i.e., ‐ COO – CH 2 ‐) and the ester carbons (i.e., ‐ CH 2 CH 2 CO (O)C‐, ‐ CH 2 COO ‐, ‐ CH 2 C(O) OC ‐). Thermogravimetric analysis of the polyol ester displayed three stages of maximum decomposition temperature ( T max ): 203.56°C, 362.79°C, and 481.91°C. Differential scanning chromatography (DSC) analysis indicated that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) of the polyol ester was found between −3.27 and 7.5°C. As a result, the analyses affirmed that this polyol ester is a hydrolytically degradable polymer due to the presence of its hydrolyzable ester bonds. Its low molecular weight and low‐melting biodegradable properties could show a faster degradation compared to the higher molecular weight synthetic polymers. Thus, the characteristic of the developed polyol ester demonstrates promising physicochemical and good thermal properties, which makes it a potential candidate for a polymeric drug delivery system.",

In this research, first ZIF ‐8 was synthesized, and its structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ), and X‐ray diffraction ( XRD ) methods. The membrane was made by phase inversion process, and its morphology was investigated by SEM , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ), and water contact angle. The results of the SEM reveal that the amount of finger‐like structures and porosity in the nanocomposite membrane increased compared to the pure membrane. The water contact angle measurement showed that the membrane hydrophilicity is increased through addition of the ZIF ‐8 nanoparticles. The increase in hydrophilicity leads to the increase in water flux and decrease in fouling. Surface roughness is reduced by addition of the ZIF ‐8 nanoparticles, which causes attachment of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) protein on the membrane surface more difficult. Therefore, fouling declined, and stability and durability of the membrane are increased. The results showed the increase in pure water flux and BSA rejection with increasing the ZIF ‐8 loading up to 3 wt%, and then, it is slightly decreased by addition of 4 wt% ZIF ‐8. The pure water flux reduction was due to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles at 4% content and blockage of pore membrane. The pure water flux of the ZIF ‐8/ PVB membrane at 3.0 wt% loading is increased to 107%, compared with the pure PVB membrane.",

In this paper, three kinds of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were synthesized from bittern using a coprecipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results showed that the three kinds of LDHs(MgAl-LDHs, MgFe-LDHs and MgAlFe-LDHs) were successfully synthesized.

The CCT results showed that the heat release rate (HRR) of all three kinds of EVA/LDHs composites significantly decreased compared with that of pure EVA, and the EVA/MgAl-LDHs composites had the lowest PHRR value of 222.65 kW/m 2 . The LOI results showed that EVA/MgAl-LDHs composites had the highest LOI value of 29.8%. The SDT results indicated that MgAl-LDHs were beneficial to smoke suppression.

Our study indicates that HMPAM polymer has strong interaction with both silica and asphaltene. The adhesion force of HMPAM on silica was stronger than that on asphaltene surface. Consistently, the adsorption of HMPAM was also greater on silica surface, with a more rigid layer formed on the surface. For HMPAM/silica system, the attractive interaction and the strong adhesion are mainly driven by the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction. For HMPAM/asphaltene system, it is mainly due to hydrophobic interaction between the long hydrocarbon chains of HMPAM and asphaltene. Furthermore, continuous adsorption of HMPAM was detected and multiple layers formed on both silica and asphaltene surfaces, which can be attributed to the hydrophobic chains of HMPAM polymers. This work has illustrated the interaction mechanism of HMPAM polymer on hydrophilic silica and hydrophobic asphaltene surfaces, which provide insight into the industrial applications of hydrophobically modified polymer.",

    "abstract": "Borehole-sealing solidified material plays a significant role in improving sealing quality and enhancing gas drainage performance. In this study, the MTS815 electro-hydraulic triaxial servo test system and MR-60 NMR test system were adopted to conduct triaxial compression control experiment on the coal sample material, concrete material, and new solidified sealing material, respectively. This paper aims to analyze the difference of support effects, porosity, and stress sensitivity between those materials. Experimental results show that under the same stress condition, the stiffness of traditional concrete solidified material is the largest, while the new solidified material is the second, and the coal sample material is the smallest. Compared with the traditional concrete solidified material, the new solidified sealing material has better strain-bearing capacity and volumetric expansion capacity under each confining pressure in the experiment. The axial strain and volume increment of new solidified material is higher than those of the traditional concrete solidified material at the peak stress. Meanwhile, the confining pressure has a certain hysteresis effect on the postpeak stress attenuation. Fracture has the strongest stress sensitivity in three pore types, and its T 2 map relaxation area has a larger compression than adsorption pore and seepage pore under the same pressure. The relative content of seepage pore and fracture in the new solidified material is less than that of coal and concrete samples, and the stress sensitivity of the new solidified materials is weaker than that of coal and concrete materials, thence, new solidified material will have better performance in borehole sealing. Outcomes of this study could provide guidance on the selection of the most effective sealing materials for sealing-quality improvement.",

    "abstract": "In order to ensure the intactness of pressure-measuring boreholes and the accuracy of gas pressure determination, pregrouting treatment with polymer materials is frequently applied to bedding drilling in coal mines. However, the existing polyurethane materials are of high viscosity, low permeability, and poor safety, bringing great difficulties to their field promotion and application. In view of this problem, after optimization and experiments, polylactide polyol/polyether polyol 4110/isocyanate was determined as the target system. Bio-based benzoxazine (Boz-F), red phosphorus, and melamine with a mass ratio of 2 : 1 : 2 were used as the flame retardant, which then underwent mechanical modification by hollow glass bubbles. Finally, the pregrouting material with low viscosity and high permeability was compounded, and its interaction with coal was experimentally studied. The results show that compared with traditional polyurethane, the new material increases the effective consolidation distance in the coal seam by 40% on average. Its permeation radius is also larger than the calculated radius of the plastic softening zone of a borehole. In addition, the strengths of coal-new material consolidated products with different ratios fully surpass those of coal-polyurethane material consolidated products. The enhancement of compressive strength and bending strength is up to 153% and 161%, respectively. The field application indicates that after pregrouting treatment of boreholes in the coal seam with the new material, the borehole formation rate reaches 100%. Therefore, the new material is safe and practical for gas pressure measurement through bedding drilling on site.",

Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) were employed to map the relationship between the process parameters and the standard deviation (SD) depicting the RWTU. Comparison assessments of three models (RSM, ANN, and ANN-GA) were carried out through some statistical indexes.

In the first step, polyaniline (PANI) film was electrodeposited on the 316L substrate from a solution of 0.1 M aniline and 0.5 M sulfuric acid in absolute ethanol by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. In the second step, the copper particles were electrodeposited on the PANI film from CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O 0.01 M precursor prepared in a KCl 0.1 M solution by the CV method. In the third step, Cu particles were partially oxidized to CuO by the CV method in a NaOH 0.1 M electrolyte to form a Cu-CuO core-shell structure supported on the PANI film. The as-prepared electrode (Cu-CuO/PANI/316L) was used to detect glucose in a NaOH 0.1 M solution. The Cu-CuO/PANI/316L sensor exhibited a linear range of 0.1–5 mM ( R 2 = 0.995) with a detection limit of 0.1 mM (S/N = 3) and high sensitivity of (25.71 mA·mM −1 ·cm −2 ). In addition, no significant interference was observed from sucrose, maltose, lactose, and ascorbic acid. The results showed that the polyaniline-supported Cu-CuO core-shell structure has the potential to be applied as an electrode material for the nonenzymatic glucose sensor.",

The structure of ASA particles was confirmed by FTIR. TEM results demonstrated that the particles with different morphologies of multilobe shape, complete core-shell and dumbbell shape were obtained depending on the cross-linker amount. It was found that the toughening efficiency reached the highest when the ASA particles had complete core-shell structure and the shell composition was close to that of the SAN matrix. It was ascribed to the fact that the complete shell layer and similar shell composition provided sufficient interfacial adhesion and transferred stress to induce larger matrix deformation, so that the notched impact strength increased accordingly. Moreover, the notched impact strength of SAN/ASA blend was improved without significantly sacrificing tensile strength when adding 30 wt% ASA particles with the size of around 400 nm. SEM results of the impact-fractured surfaces revealed that irregular fluctuation and numerous microvoids occurred. It was deduced that the toughening mechanism was attributed to the crazings and cavitation of particles. Therefore, this study paved a way of toughening the resin by adjusting the microstructure of the particles including morphology, composition, and size.",

    "abstract": "The increasing intensity of coronavirus (COVID-19) spreading emphasizes the significant development in home food production to reduce the incoming socioeconomic impact from soaring food prices, supply chain fragility, and severe economic crisis. This preliminary study was initiated to demonstrate the possibility of using electrospun fibers as a potential substrate in the application of seed germination activity. The drive of this preliminary study was to integrate the electrospun nanofiber-based material in exploring the current surge in home food production via seed germination in order to introduce cheap source of food without being distracted by the pandemic impact in general. Mung bean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) was chosen as it is easy and fast to sprout. Four samples of poly (ε-caprolactone)- (PCL-) based fibers were prepared by means of electrospinning technique, with the optimized flow rate between 0.05 and 0.20 ml/min at a fixed distance of 10 cm needle tip to collector. Mung bean seeds were allowed to germinate on the fabricated electrospun PCL fibers for 96 hours. Our observations include germination percentage, seedling weight, radicle length, and plumule growth. The highest radicle length and plumule length of seedlings were 27.8 mm and 6.7 mm, respectively. There were no inhibitory effects on seed germination and minimal structural fragmentation of smaller diameter electrospun fibers as revealed by FESEM. These results show that the seeds were able to germinate on electrospun PCL fiber substrate, owing to the properties of high surface area and excellent fluid water uptake of PCL fibers.",

    "abstract": "Acrylic polymer is a superabsorbent for water and widely used in diapers, in which its swelling behavior can be significantly affected by several factors, i.e., the time, temperature, pH, and salt concentration, and thus the product performance in the applications. In this work, the water absorption behavior of acrylic superabsorbent polymers by each of these individual factors was investigated. The results showed that the water absorbency increases with the pH in the range of 2 to ~7 and decreases when the pH continues to increase. However, it decreases with the increases in NaCl concentration in the solution. Moreover, more water can be absorbed by the acrylic polymers at the higher temperature. Based on a previously developed kinetic swelling model and the information from the above investigations, a semiempirical model for predicting the swelling behavior of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) under different conditions has been developed. Data showed that the model can predict (with a relative error of &lt;4.5%) the amount of water absorbed by acrylic SAPs under different swelling conditions. The model would be very helpful to the practical application in both product design and its performance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The oxidative aging of bituminous binders affects the performance and durability of pavements. In the case of polymer-modified binders, aging involves both bitumen and polymers and has a strong impact on the whole architecture of the material. Rheology may help in understanding these structural changes, and interesting information may be obtained by analysing the evolution of apparent molecular weight distributions. This was demonstrated with a bituminous binder modified with a poly(styrene-butadiene) block copolymer and subjected to prolonged artificial aging. Isothermal frequency sweep tests were used to construct master curves of the phase angle and magnitude of the complex modulus. The master curves were then used to calculate relaxation spectra and apparent molecular weight distributions of the binders, as well as simulated temperature sweep tests. A comparison of the behaviour of the base and modified bitumen highlighted the role of the polymer in aging. Polymer degradation significantly damages the elastomeric network, yet the residual polymer chains still interact with the bitumen molecules and reduce their oxidative aging. The apparent molecular weight distributions were deconvoluted to create an aging index specifically developed for polymer-modified bitumen.",

It was revealed that not only the CaCO 3 type and loading amount but also the stretching type has an enormous effect on breathability performance. In addition, the quality of porosity, that is, the amount of interconnecting pores, was determined to play an important role in breathability. And, the interdigitation stretching process offers the potential for a better breathability at reduced processing costs.",

Results reveal that covalently conjugation has unconspicuous effect on optical performance, and FWPU shows similar fluorescence intensity to fluorescer RSW except for a red shift of about 10 nm in maximum absorption wavelengths. Further study finds that there is a positive correlation between the concentration of fluorescer and the fluorescence intensity of FWPU; however, the opposite effect is obtained when the concentration exceeds 1 × 10 −5 mol/L, which is attributed to the concentration self‐quenching. Although high temperature will decrease the intensity of fluorescence, the fluorescence components in FWPU shows high resistance to fluorescence quencher and thermal decomposition as a consequence of chemical combination with the polymer chain.",

New nitrogen containing heterocyclic azo compounds have been synthesized by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a catalyst having a particle size of 15 nm. AuNPs play an important role in the coupling reaction to produce new heterocyclic azo pigments. These azo pigments were tested to solubility, light fastness, and durability. These synthesized nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic pigments were characterized by melting points, UV–vis, FT‐IR, and 1 H NMR spectroscopy for their characteristics and structural features. After analysis, these pigments at lower concentrations were blended with the n ‐butyl acrylate– co ‐methyl methacrylate ( n ‐BA‐ co ‐MMA) polymer. These blended pigments were coated on a simple silica glass surface by following the simple deep and dry method. The coupled azo pigment shows excellent binding strength with poly( n ‐BA‐ co ‐MMA) acrylic polymers.",

The tri‐ether compound was characterized by NMR and FTIR techniques. The MgCl 2 ‐supported titanium catalysts were incorporated with varying amounts of 1‐methoxy‐2,2‐bis(methoxymethyl)butane as the internal donor (ID) and also without the internal donor were synthesized, and then the prepared catalysts were characterized. The concentration of titanium, magnesium, and chloride were determined by spectrophotometry and by complexometric and argentometric titration, respectively. The polymerization of propylene was carried out with the prepared catalysts in conjunction with triethylaluminum as a cocatalyst and hydrogen as a chain transfer agent, with and without cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane as the external donor. The effects of a new internal donor on MgCl 2 ‐supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts for propylene polymerization were investigated, and then these results were compared to the obtained polypropylenes results, which were obtained using the conventional Ziegler–Natta catalyst containing diisobutyl phthalate as the internal donor. The highest isotacticity, melting temperature, and crystallinity degree of polypropylene were obtained using Cat‐D with an ID/Mg molar ratio equal to 0.44, and the highest catalytic activity is related to Cat‐B with an ID/Mg molar ratio equal to 0.22. The Ziegler–Natta catalysts incorporated with various ID/Mg molar ratios of 1‐methoxy‐2,2‐bis(methoxymethyl)butane were synthesized. The polymerization of propylene was carried out with the prepared catalysts. The highest catalytic activity is related to Cat‐B with an ID/Mg molar ratio equal to 0.22. The catalyst with an optimum ID/Mg molar ratio equal to 0.44 is a favorable catalyst for polymerization of propylene.",

The polymer matrix carries rigid, conjugated, quinonoid blocks; they are tiny semiconducting graphene sheets, whose organization creates micropores. The reaction involves Friedel–Crafts alkylation and the subsequent dehydrogenation of ‐ CH 2 ‐ and – CH ‐ bridges by the catalyst, FeCl 3 . Heating the reaction product between 500 and 600°C completes dehydrogenation of residual bridges. Their FTIR spectra and DRS UV ‐Vis spectra confirm such results. As a result of heating, the absorption maximum shifted toward longer wavelength, and absorbance was raised. It absorbs light like semiconducting graphene covering the entire ultraviolet, visible, and partly near infrared region. The band gap of synthesized materials is close to 1.2 eV . All the HCP s are amorphous and showed CO 2 capture close to 6 wt% at room temperature. The obtained materials are hydrophobic and decompose above 300°C in air atmosphere.

    "abstract": "The vibration attenuation mechanism of shear thickening fluid- (STF-) filled sandwich structures was investigated in this study. Structural equivalent damping, stiffness, and mass increased simultaneously with the increase in the volume fraction of shear thickening fluid. However, the damping ratio decreased and natural frequency increased with the increase in structural mass. Thus, the damping ratio was not a monotonically increasing function of the volume fraction of STF. A modified shear strain model of the damping layer was developed based on the following conditions: (1) under the condition of small strain, shear thickening fluid was regarded as linear viscoelastic material, and (2) the warpage of the sandwich beam was considered during deformation and the influence of STF on the shear strain of sandwich beam. According to the modified shear strain model of the damping layer, the shear thickening occurred at 1 Hz to 20 Hz during vibration. Therefore, the resonance point of the structure shifted to the left. The predictions were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The results demonstrated that shear thickening fluid improved the vibration damping performance of the sandwich structure, while the thickening ability was not the higher, the better.",

    "abstract": "By introducing low-entanglement UHMWPE, the mechanical properties of polyolefins are improved to varying degrees. For polypropylene, the lack of interaction between UHMWPE and polypropylene results in an unsatisfactory reinforcement effect, and the disentangled state makes it easier for the particles to form defects driven by a chain explosion. In contrast, regarding polyethylene and elastomer containing ethylene segments, low-entanglement UHMWPE plays a better role in reinforcement. A series of measurements including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheological measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and mechanical measurement were used to investigate the mechanisms for the different enhancement effects. It originates from interdiffusion and entanglement forming of polyethylene segments across the interface, endowing the material with different aggregated and defect structures. For instance, EPDM possesses a higher optimal dosage of UHMWPE particles reflected in good interfacial interdiffusion with UHMWPE particles, leading to significant optimized mechanical performance.",

Existing models for quality prediction have a limited accuracy that is not adequate to deliver desired quality targets of three defects per million. Moreover, these quality control strategies often require large amounts of training data, while also becoming invalid with external process changes. This study compares the performance of three different models for prediction of the injection pressure: a conventional neural network, tuned on experimental data; a simulation network, trained on simulated data and fine-tuned on experimental data; and a hybrid network, which combines the training of neural networks with analytical knowledge of the molding process. The results indicate that the hybrid neural network performs especially well for a small number of training points. In particular, for training points ranging between one and four, the sum of squared errors (SSE) for a hybrid network is 13% to 33% of the SSE for a conventional network, and approximately 45% of the SSE for a simulation network. In addition, the hybrid network also shows the fastest convergence rate among the three models. However, as the number of training points increases, the conventional neural network outperforms all other models. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 18: 19–31, 1999",

For gaining a better understanding of the flow phenomena that take place during these operations, computer simulation can be used; however, due to the complexity of the moving boundaries in the twin screw extruder this is not an easy task. Using the boundary element method (BEM), which is the method of choice for moving boundary problems, the flow field, pressures, stress, and strains can be computed at every time step. With this information, the quality of mixing can be determined quantitatively and allows the engineer to modify the geometry of the screws for optimal mixing conditions.

In regard to the viscosity calculations, a very convenient and straightforward method, especially for molten materials without die swell, is presented. All the sample melts showed slight tension thinning; that is, the elongation viscosity decreased along with the strain rate. It was also found that the elongation viscosity of the GF-filled polymer may increase along with the fiber content up to a critical value, and then drop if more fiber is added.

However, the process involves additional gas‐related parameters to control the molding process. The interaction between melt and gas makes the gas‐assisted process complicated. To make satisfactory parts, the material, the mold, and process parameters determine the “moldability” of a specific system. The concept of “molding areas” on the critical plane can be extended from thermoplastic injection molding to GAIM. This research is devoted to the development of a proper moldability diagram for GAIM. The first part of this study employs gas‐related parameters to define the molding area. The second part is devoted to identifying the relative importance of process parameters. The results show that melt temperature and short shot are the two factors which most significantly affect the GAIM process.

    "abstract": "The fiber-spinning process is an important industrial operation to manufacture synthetic fibers. The process occurs under free-surface conditions, and the final properties of the fiber are characterized by the extensional properties of the polymer. Specifically, the non-isothermal response of the polymer in uniaxial extension dominates the process. The fiber-spinning process is analyzed by means of a unidirectional approach because the thickness of the fiber is very small with respect to its lateral dimension. The analysis accounts for the prehistory of the material inside the die, based on purely extensional strains. For viscoelastic polymer melts, the constitutive equation must be able to describe adequately the rheological behavior of the polymer in extensional flow. A good candidate for such modeling is the K-BKZ integral constitutive equation, with a spectrum of relaxation times, which captures well the nonlinear viscoelastic response of polymer melts. The non-isothermal response is taken into account with a temperature shift factor utilizing the Morland-Lee hypothesis. The present work includes effects due to gravity, inertia, and air drag, where applicable. Simulation results are compared with experiments on polypropylene (PP), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) melts at low and high speeds. Results are also compared with previous simulations. It is shown that in some cases the extrudate swell at the spinneret exit must be taken into account to accurately predict the drawing forces, which makes a fully two-dimensional analysis a necessity for such operations. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "This article discusses the formation of extruded thermoplastic foam sheet due to expansion of supersaturated physical blowing agent while it exists from a high-pressure flow region into atmospheric surroundings. Swarms of tiny gas cavities of unstable nature are formed and gas diffusion virtually promotes expansion, the rate of which has a strong dependency upon degree of supersaturation. However, foam sheet cooling causes increase of rheological properties to prolong the sheet formation period, during which gas molecules close to the sheet surface tend to migrate onto the surface and evaporate away from the surface to reduce foaming efficiency. The viscoelastic \"cell\" growth model was modified to incorporate the gas loss from the sheet surface. Foaming efficiency appears to be dependent upon blowing agent/resin ratio, foam thickness, and nucleation density (#/cc). The simulation results predicted by the model show a good agreement with experimental data for polyethylene foam with low-percentage difluorochloromethane (HCFC-22) blowing agent. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although gas‐assisted injection molding (GAIM) eliminates sink marks and prevents warpage, many problems are encountered during gas‐assisted filling owing to gas–melt flow interactions. Large voids created by gas penetration during gas‐assisted filling result in degraded rigidity. To avoid gas‐assisted filling, the shot weight is increased to 100%. Gas is injected after the cavity is completely filled. The so‐called “full‐shot gas‐assisted injection molding” process is investigated in this paper. The effects of the processing conditions and rib geometry on the behavior of gas penetration are systematically investigated. High melt temperature and a short gas injection delay time are found to increase the length of gas penetration during full‐shot GAIM. Wide ribs and ribs with fillets cause the gas penetration length to decrease. Although the mechanisms of gas penetration for short‐shot and full‐shot GAIMs are not identical, the resulting penetration patterns of the gas void shape are similar.© 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Precision injection molding of thin‐wall parts has become an important concern in 3C (computer, communication, and consumer electronics) plastics industry. Previous studies in precision injection molding control focused on the injection screw, the hydraulic system control and the associated operations.In the present study, the influence of relevant parameters, including injection speed, melt temperature, mold temperature, filling–packing switchover, and packing pressure, on the mold plate separation under different clamping pressures was investigated as part of precision molding control. A two‐cavity tensile test specimen mold equipped with four linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs) on mold exteriors and across the parting surface was used for experiments. A PC‐based monitoring system was also built to detect the mold separation signals. Mold separation can also be identified from part weight variation and exhibits relevant correspondence with part weight. It was found that because of the high injection speed required for thin‐wall molding, mold separation is not negligible. In all situations, mold separation decreases with increasing clamping pressure. As melt temperature and mold temperature increase, mold separation increases, resulting in an increase of part weight. Similarly, when packing pressure and injection speed increase, mold separation also increases. Earlier switchover from filling to packing can decrease mold separation as well as part weight. Among all parameters, packing pressure exhibits the greatest influence on mold separation and the associated part weight change. Variation of melt temperature and mold temperature also changes the gate freezing time and the associated packing pressure distribution and mold separation. The influence also becomes larger when molding thin‐wall parts as compared with conventional injection molded parts because of the larger injection pressure required for molding. Simulations also show good correspondence with experimental measurements. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The model is able to satisfactorily describe the effect of processing variables such as temperature and degree of reaction during the curing of the composite under different conditions (curing temperature and heating rate).

Because the acid form of sPSU is not suitable for melt‐phase processing, the use of the salt form of the polymer was considered, as sulfonate groups are much less reactive than sulfonic acid groups. This form of sPSU makes it possible to use an extrusion process with the help of a suitable plasticizer, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG). The residual porosity of the film, induced by removing the soluble PEG with water, was found to improve the proton conductivity of the membrane. The membrane fabrication process has a prominent effect on the final properties of the film. For the same composition, a solvent‐casting procedure can produce membranes with proton conductivity twice as high as that attainable with a melt‐phase process. However, extruded membranes exhibit a greater longevity than do cast membranes. At the same time, the proton conductivity of extruded membranes is less dependent on the ion‐exchange capacity of the polymer. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Degree of conversion, volume shrinkage, and water sorption of various HMPF/TEGDMA formulations were measured and compared with a 50:50 bis‐GMA/TEGDMA formulation. The results illustrated that, with increasing content of HMPF in HMPF/TEGDMA system, the double bond conversion of the cured resin increased and volume shrinkage decreased. Its water sorption increased with increasing content of HMPF when the content was less than 50% and decreased with an increase in HMPF when the content was more than 50%.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyurethane matrix composites based on fiber‐interlayered carbon fabric laminates were prepared by compression molding to assess the feasibility of this approach, when using a highly reactive resin as matrix. The polyurethane matrix was prepared using the excess isocyanate to enhance the rigidity of the system through additional crosslinking. The fiber‐interlayered laminates consisted of different amount of short fibers between two carbon fabrics. Three composites containing, respectively, 12%, 18%, and 26% wt/wt total carbon fibers were produced for this study. Thermal and IR spectroscopic analysis were performed to select the most suitable thermal curing conditions for the matrix. The results showed that 70°C represents the minimum curing temperature required to carry out the reactions between polyol and isocyanate groups at an economical rate. In this condition, a multistep reaction occurs to consume the excess isocyanate. Mechanical strength of the composites was measured by three‐point bending tests, and the data were analyzed by the Weibull statistical method. Fiber content in the interlayer is a critical parameter in the manufacture of these types of composite materials. Composites with 13% and 21% wt/wt short fibers in the interlayers (giving a total carbon fiber content of 18% and 26% wt/wt) exhibit a wider cumulative distribution of strength data due to the restrictions that they impose on the flow of the resin, thereby resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution of resin throughout the samples. A composite with 12% total carbon content (7% wt/wt short fibers) exhibits a narrower cumulative distribution, denoting a greater reliability relative to the manufacturing method used in this study. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Lotader ® 2210, which is a random terpolymer of ethylene, butyl acrylate, and maleic anhydride, was used as the impact modifier for polyamide 66 blends as well as polyamide 66 based nanocomposites. The best dispersion level, highest mechanical properties, highest viscosity values, and smallest elastomeric domain sizes were obtained for the mixing sequence in which all the components forming the ternary nanocomposites were compounded simultaneously. Incorporation sequence of either the organoclay or the impact modifier into the polymeric matrix was varied in the other mixing sequences, and this resulted in poorer distribution of the organoclay platelets and elastomeric domains in the matrix owing to insufficient shear intensity applied on the components in a single extrusion step. Toughness values of the ternary nanocomposites were improved compared with the binary nanocomposites upon addition of the impact modifier into polymer–organoclay combination. It was concluded that the compounding sequence of the components plays a significant role in the dispersion of organoclay and the properties of the nanocomposites, because it directly affects the interaction between the different phases. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aims to illustrate the importance of accurate material property data in the numerical simulation of injection molding by elucidating the effects of variation in material properties on warpage prediction. In addition, it presents an adaptive optimization method based on the Kriging surrogate model that has been developed to intelligently determine the optimal processing parameters for minimizing warpage in a box‐shape part with different and stepwise wall thicknesses. The Kriging surrogate model is a statistics‐based interpolation technique that provides the approximate functional relationship between the performance variables of interest, like warpage, and the factors affecting them, such as the processing parameters. Based on optimal processing parameters, the sensitivity of warpage prediction to two of the most important material properties—shear viscosity and the pvT (pressure–specific volume–temperature) relationship—were analyzed. It is well known that the material property model constants used for numerical simulation can sometimes vary significantly due to inherent experimental measurement errors, the resolution of the testing device, and/or the way the curve fitting is performed to determine the model constants. The results showed that hypothetical and yet reasonable variations in the shear viscosity model constants and in the pvT relationship could significantly affect the magnitude of warpage prediction. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The polymers were characterized by FT‐IR spectroscopic method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed good thermal stability (10% weight loss temperatures are in the range of 340–370°C). The obtained poly(urethane‐urea) elastomers also exhibited good mechanical properties with tensile strength of 10–22 MPa and elongation at break of 600%–1100%. It was found that a high content of 2‐amino‐3‐hydroxypyridine moiety within the hard segments of the linear poly(urethane‐urea) leads to decreased mechanical properties (such as the stress at break). Aside from the effect of the chemical cross‐links, the cross‐linker structure enhanced or disrupted the physical cross‐links, which determined high variation of the mechanical properties. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) offer some attractive possibilities in the field of medicine such as magnetic separation for purification and immunoassay and hyperthermia treatment of cancer. Hyperthermia uses the thermal energy adsorbed by magnetite NPs to kill cancer cells. Concerns regarding esophageal cancer treatment by hyperthermia are related to the development of an advanced film as a polymeric stent cover for hyperthermia. In this paper, we tried to confer the hyperthermia function to the stent cover by the composition of magnetite NPs with a silicone rubber film. Herein, we fabricated the hybrid composite of magnetite NPs and a silicone matrix with a uniform particle dispersion. Forty percent of magnetite NPs could be dispersed in silicone matrices, which was confirmed in the scale of hundreds of nanometers by transmission electron microscopy. The composition could be possible via the surface modification of magnetite NPs with oleic acid in the silicone rubber, which was identified by the analysis of FT‐IR. Plasma treatment of the composite film transforms the hydrophobicity of the film to the hydrophlicity. The hyperthermia effect of the composite film increased temperature from 36 to 42°C. Moreover, our manufacturing strategy could readily control the thickness of the smooth composite film, facilitate large‐scale synthesis, and enable multifunctionalization. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Single‐screw extrusion experiments were carried out to study the extrusion characteristics of HDPE–wood composites. Three screw geometries (A, B, and C) were used, and the effects of screw speed on output, melting, and pressure profile were studied. Screw A had a much higher compression ratio than screws B and C, which directly affected the melting behavior of the polymers. Screws B and C had the same compression ratio; however, screw C had the same metering capacity as screw A. Therefore, by comparing screws B and C, the effect of feed depth on the solid conveying capacity was investigated. It was found that while screw B had higher outputs than both screws A and C as expected, screw C had a much lower output than screw A for highly filled resins even though they had the same metering capacity. For HDPE, screws A and C showed the same output as expected. Further examinations of the pressure profiles and melting profiles from screw extraction experiments confirmed that screw C showed a severely starved solids conveying capacity for wood‐filled resins, which limited the total outputs. Comparing the outputs and pressure generations between theoretical predictions and actual experimental results, it was evident that due to the inaccurate assumption of fully filled channels common in single screw extrusion, both outputs and pressure generations in the extruders were overpredicted. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The simulation results are validated against experimental data obtained from 10 different runs of an industrial injection molding machine processing two different polymers–‐ high‐density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate. It is observed that the simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data. This outcome demonstrates the utility of the developed mathematical model and simulation approach.

Results prove that the model can be used not only to predict the flow features during the expansion of a multi‐component foam, but also to determine the locations and the size of the air vents to avoid air bubbles trapped during the solidification process. It appears that the distribution of the vent holes must be evenly balanced around the cabinet cavity, where the larger holes must be located at positions far from the injector. To prevent the formation of large air voids, which cannot reach the vent holes by the action of gravity, there must be additional holes located on the lower surfaces of the cavity to purge the air trapped.",

The optimal combination of the impact parameters is determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm. The injection molding of a typical interior trim part of a car, i.e., the seat belt cover plate, is used as an example to demonstrate the method. The two most troublesome problems in this process—the sink marks and warpage—are multiobjectively analyzed using the established method, and the optimal combination of impact parameters that minimized the defects is determined. The errors of the sink marks and warpage between the experimental and theoretical values were 7.95% and 0.2%, respectively. The optimized parameters were tested in actual injection molding.

    "abstract": "The dual function of a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) bar working as reinforcement and impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) anode for reinforced concrete structures has been proposed and researched in this paper. The ICCP tests with different current densities and polarization durations were first conducted for the concrete with high chloride content. After the ICCP application, pull out tests were then performed to investigate the bond behaviors of CFRP bars. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the new-type ICCP system with the CFRP bar as the anode on corrosion protection. The ICCP system provided electrons to the steel bar continuously and brought the potential of the steel bar down to the immunity region. Under the anodic polarization with a large current density of 100 mA/m 2 , the CFRP bar-concrete interface presented acidification and the chemical adhesion on the interface was decreased significantly. However, for cases in the experiment, the ICCP application had an insignificant influence on the ultimate bond strength.",

EGAIM of a crystalline polymer product was investigated in this study, and the influences of process parameters on the sink marks were discussed based on experiments. An isotactic polypropylene (iPP) product was fabricated by EGAIM under different process conditions. A uniform design was applied as an experimental design to investigate the influences of the process parameters on the sink marks.

    "abstract": "Injection compression molding is an injection molding process with the addition of a compression stage after the injection. This process is useful for the injection molding of precision parts. A stable and controlled manufacturing process is needed to guarantee reliability of complex products, and usually process optimization is achieved by experimental and time consuming approaches. However, for being competitive a minimal market time is a very important requirement and computer simulations can help to optimize the process at the only expense of computational time. This paper reports and discusses for the first time the results of a 3D finite element simulation of reactive injection compression molding (RICM) by commercial software for the production of rubber diaphragms. In particular, the stages of mold filling dynamics and material curing are analyzed and the results verified with experimental tests. To get an accurate representation of the process, the rheological behavior, thermal properties, and kinetic behavior during curing of the real rubber compound were described by mathematical models. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a capillary rheometer are employed to characterize the rubber material in order to achieve an appropriate curing reaction and viscosity models, respectively. The computations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that reliable information on material viscosity and curing kinetics can play a key role in making well-founded predictions and avoiding trial and error methods.",

The adhesive in use for these purposes should be compatible with the chemical and physical properties of paper and should present good aging characteristics. In this study, we conducted a set of experiments with paper samples on which fructan-based biopolymer Halomonas levan (Hlevan) was applied for the first time and compared with glucan-based adhesive starch. Adhesive-applied samples were initially prepared by the application of different historical recipes of sizing and ink. Then, they underwent accelerated thermal aging. Chemical and physical changes of paper samples (crystallinity, pH, and color) were analyzed. Finally, Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify dominating factors affecting sample behavior with applied adhesives. This study demonstrates the aging characteristics of Hlevan on cellulose-based materials. The results showed that there is a color shift from blue to yellow for all samples after aging, but it is more pronounced for some samples with Hlevan. In addition, Hlevan is slightly less acidic than starch in all cases and acted as a plasticizer for a specific kind of sizing material. The methodology of this research is also efficacious in terms of understanding the interaction of paper media with the adhesives and their effects on aging.",

    "abstract": "Mucoadhesive microspheres are one of the most promising novel techniques for drug delivery. Mucoadhesive systems offer a sustained drug release method, thus enhancing drug absorption in a site-specific manner. Microspheres have very small sizes and provide efficient carrier capacities. Mucoadhesive systems therefore play a vital role in drug delivery systems. Mucoadhesion is a two-step procedure, and its mechanism can be explained by combining theories of wetting, mechanical interlocking, electronic transfer, adsorption, fracture, and diffusion interpenetration, as deemed suitable. Mucoadhesive microspheres offer added advantages of reliability, safety, specificity, prolonged action, delayed release, and enhanced activity along with a very few disadvantages. These systems can be prepared by emulsion cross-linking, single emulsion, ionotropic gelation, phase inversion, spray drying, solvent removal, and hot melt methods. The resulting microspheres are characterized using a number of parameters such as size, surface, efficiencies, and release studies. Mucoadhesive microspheres have been developed for oral, buccal, nasal, ocular, rectal, and vaginal applications with systemic as well as local effects. They give a chance to deliver the drugs which were not possible to administer by oral route. This review article gives an overview of mucoadhesive microspheres, their pros and cons, preparation methods, characterization, application, and recent developments.",

    "abstract": "Different kind of discontinuous baffles, which had the larger geometric ratios and higher height than the previous ones, were inserted in the unwound channel of a single-screw extruder to generate chaotic mixing in the screw channel. The periodic unit of the flow channel was modeled as a dynamic system of complex duct flow. The finite-volume method was used to solve the three-dimensional flow of purely viscous, non-Newtonian fluid obeying the power law constitutive model. Lagrangian particle calculations along with the statistical methods were performed by a fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme. The effect of the baffle's geometric ratio on the mixing kinematics was investigated numerically. Poincare sections were applied to reveal the different patterns and sizes of the KAM tori. Period points were analyzed on the lines of the perturbative theory. Distributive mixing was then visualized by the evolution of passive tracer particles initially located at different positions. Shannon entropy index and cumulative residence time distribution (RTD) were then used to evaluate the statistical results. The growth of the tracer's interface with time was also obtained to reveal the intensity of the chaotic mixing. The cases with the geometric ratios being 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 had the similar RTD performance, with shorter mean residence time and the narrower broadening of RTD. Among all the test cases, case B with a geometric ratio equal to 0.5 had the best mixing ability. The results also imply there is likely an optimal baffle geometric ratio between 0.5 and 0.6 that can achieve more efficient mixing.",

Nanodiamond particles are used to effectively and uniformly disperse the carbon nanotubes in the polymer matrix, leading to a very homogenous mixture. The results showed that microwave absorption of nanocomposites increases with the increase in MWCNTs concentration in 11–17 GHz frequency range. The maximum loss of –28 dB was obtained at 14 GHz. The bandwidth corresponding to the reflection loss of −10 dB is 4.5 GHz. The mechanical properties are also improved after incorporating MWCNTs and DND in the composite. The tensile strength has been increased by ∼113% after the addition of 1.0 wt% MWCNTs and 0.1 wt% DND. The morphological investigation demonstrated that coating of MWCNTs on the surface of the woven glass fibers in the presence of DND resulted in uniform dispersion of nanotubes throughout the matrix with the formation of connected networks that helps in electrical conduction and load transfer between the nanofillers and the matrix. The role of MWCNTs and DND particles in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite laminates is explained.",

It is seen that the four different defect types in the current experimental setup— irregular residual wall , void , double wall , and no residual wall —are either formed by different mechanisms or by the same mechanism of which the extent decides on the actual defect type. The current insights into the occurring part defects are used in the second part of this study to explain the influence of process and material parameters on the defect occurrence in a reference experiment. The presence as well as the extent of a formation mechanism is here further linked to the water and/or polymer properties/conditions, which exist during water penetration. The water and melt temperature, water holding pressure, and the presence of nucleating agents in the polymer melt were therefore varied within the predefined reference setting. The influence on the nature and location of the part defects was investigated with a qualitative defect analysis. It is found that the proposed definitions and mechanisms are able to explain experimentally observed changes in defect occurrence physically, with which the existing indistinctness in the literature can be elucidated as well.",

The pressure‐induced melt removal melting was the dominant melting mechanism in the solid‐rich stage. The theoretical model of the pressure‐induced melt removal mechanism was established. The melting percentage was defined to evaluate the boundaries between the solid‐rich melting stage and melt‐rich melting stage. The melting percentage is proportional to a three‐quarters power of the temperature at stator's inner surface, a quarter power of solids’ pressure, as well as inversely proportional to the rotating speed of rotor.

In uniaxial tensile measurements, PP-A exhibited higher yield strength and lower elongation at break.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present study, two new kinds of modified poly(glycidyl methacrylate‐ co ‐maleic anhydride) hydrogels have been prepared and studied as pH‐sensitive drug carriers. At first, poly(glycidyl methacrylate‐ co ‐maleic anhydride) (PGMA‐ co ‐MA) was prepared via free‐radical polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate and maleic anhydride in the presence of benzoyl peroxide as an initiator. Then the copolymer was modified with two different kinds of amino‐containing compounds, 2‐aminopyridine and 4‐aminobutyric acid. Samples were characterized by FT‐IR and TGA analysis. Besides, the water‐swelling behavior was studied to determine the approximate swelling capacity. Then as a model, Cefotaxime drug was loaded on both hydrogels, and the release studies were carried out at different pH values (3, 7, and 8, respectively). It was concluded from the results that the amino acid–modified hydrogel has a more controlled release rate than the aminopyridine‐modified hydrogel. But generally, both of these hydrogels showed acceptable response to different pH values and can be employed as pH‐sensitive drug carriers.",

A new type of dicarboxylic acid (DA) containing ether and aliphatic moieties was successfully synthesized via a solvent‐free reaction. Then a new PA with high solubility in common organic solvents was synthesized from a direct reaction of 4,4‐diamino diphenylmethane and the DA. Silver nanoparticles were embedded within the PA chains through using a silver/ammonia complex [Ag(NH 3 ) 2 ] + . The formation of nano silver was confirmed by X‐ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. The effect of Ag nanoparticles on thermal properties of the prepared nanocomposites was studied by the thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the thermal properties of the nanocomposites were improved as compared with the neat PA. The antibacterial capability of the PANCs was studied by the disk diffusion method against Escherichia coli , which suggested that the PANCs can be considered as good antibacterial agents.",

We measured the I ‐ V characteristics of the devices under different stresses. The stress ranges from 0 to 510 kPa and the voltage ranges from 0 to 5 V. The resistance of the devices is very sensitive to the applied stress. The piezoresistive coefficient is far larger than 10 −4 /Pa when the working voltage ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 V and the stress ranges from 160 to 510 kPa, whereas the current seems to change linearly with pressure and with a considerable fluctuation. This uncertainty in piezoresistance measurement may have originated from the viscoelasticity of P3HT, including a significant creep and a slow restoration after a deep compression, which has been confirmed by the results of the nanoindentation test. In general, P3HT could be used in tactile sensors, which need more sensitivity rather than accuracy.",

In this study, curcumin was encapsulated into PELA fibers (Cur@ PELA ) for drug delivery via electrospinning. It was found that the shrinkage ratio, porosity, water absorption and water contact angle of Cur@ PELA fiber membrane could be changed by heat treatment with different heating temperature (45°C, 50°C) and heating time (5 min, 10 min, 20 min). Moreover, the release rate of curcumin from Cur@ PELA fibers was influenced by the porosity, water absorption and water contact angle of the drug‐loaded membrane. Heat treatment is thought to be a novel method to control release of drug from electrospun PELA fibers.",

Dispersion of Ba SO 4 in unsaturated polyester resin was prepared before impregnating it on glass fibers. These laminated composites were then subjected to analyze different mechanical and thermal properties. Mechanical properties of the composites were observed to be increased by increasing the Ba SO 4 loading up to 4 wt.%, beyond this a decreasing trend was observed. Flexural strength and flexural modulus of Ba SO 4 ‐infused glass fiber‐reinforced polyester composites increased up to 70.9% and 67.9% at 4 wt.% of Ba SO 4 , respectively. Tensile strength (77 MP a) and tensile modulus (2023.4 MP a) of these composites were also augmented up to 4 wt.% of Ba SO 4 , after that concentration these properties were also observed to be decreased. Impact strength and hardness of these composites have also been improved significantly in the same trend as compared to the control sample. Thermal stability as a function of temperature was also enhanced by increasing the Ba SO 4 concentration up to 4 wt.% after which thermal stability decreased. Fractography of these composites was evaluated by optical microscopy. Hence, Ba SO 4 in optimum concentration was proved a striking filler for the improvement of mechanical and thermal properties of glass fiber‐reinforced polyester composites for high strength and high temperature applications.",

Vibration transmission in ultrasonic bonding process through polymer workpiece was related to the interfacial fusion, which could be used for in situ monitoring. In this article, experimental platform was established to study the vibration transmission. Experiments were carried out to measure the vibration transmitted from horn onto the high‐frequency dynamic force sensor installed in the anvil. According to the peak‐to‐peak value of dynamic force, the whole bonding process could be divided into rising and falling phases. Interfacial fusion corresponding to ultrasonic transmission was also studied. From experimental results, when the peak‐to‐peak value change rate rose to 130%, some area on the surface starts to melt. When it fell down back to 60%, glass transition occurred with the melt spread gradually over the whole interface. When it fell down to 30%, defects of overflow and bubble began to generate as polymer got into viscous flow state. When the change rate reached 10%, the bubbles burst into smaller ones like floccules as the fluidity of polymer was enhanced further under continuous ultrasonic load. The experimental results gave a deep understanding in the formation of interfacial fusion and the generation of defects.",

The synthesis of POA coatings was carried out under cyclic voltammetric and galvanostatic conditions from an aqueous solution of oxalic acid. It has been observed that the formation of POA coatings on LCS occurs after the passivation of its surface via the formation of polycrystalline iron oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ·2H 2 O) interphase. The formation of iron oxalate interphase is confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, glancing angle x‐ray diffraction (GAXRD) measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Uniform, granular, and strongly adherent dark green POA coatings were obtained on the LCS substrate by ECP of O ‐anisidine. These coatings were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), potential–time ( E–t ) curves, UV‐visible absorption spectroscopy and SEM. The potential–time curve is characterized by an induction time before the ECP of O ‐anisidine. The induction time is found to be dependent on the applied current density. The optical absorption spectroscopy study reveals the formation of conducting emeraldine salt phase of POA. Our results reveal that the oxalic acid is a suitable medium for the ECP of O ‐anisidine on the LCS substrate and it favors the formation of emeraldine salt (ES) phase of POA. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

It was observed that compaction resulted in changes only in the physical structure, leading to destruction of the smaller/less stable crystallities. The thermal treatment at high temperatures led not only to physical changes involving crystal growth and perfection but also to chemical changes in the structure, resulting in modification of crystallization behavior. The extent of change was found to be different for PPS in the powder form and in the pellet form, which is explained on the basis of the restricted diffusion of air in pellet form as compared to the powder. Such changes observed in the samples were also dependent on the type of sintering medium. The sintering in presence of nitrogen did not show significant changes in the crystallization or melting behavior. Thus, the structure development in solid‐state processing of PPS was influenced by the sintering time, temperature, and sintering medium, leading to physical and/or chemical changes.",

In this work, we present a new method of generating nanosized polymer particles by polymerizing the monomer in an environment that precipitates the polymer above the lower critical solution temperature.

    "abstract": "Abstract Plastic energy dissipation (PED) of individual polymer pellets as well as of densified polymer particulate assemblies may be the dominant heating/melting mechanisms in intermeshing corotating twin‐screw extruders (Co‐TSEs). In the present paper, the amount of PED is evaluated by conducting the uniaxial unconfined compression experiments on both molded cylindrical polymer samples and polymer particulate assemblies. The compression experiments were extended to a much higher deformation (strain) range. The results of this work clearly demonstrate the significant contribution to melting from even a single deformation of individual pellets. One severe deformation of PP pellets can provide almost one sixth of the energy required for their melting. For PS pellets, one severe deformation alone can provide sufficient energy to heat up the pellets to above their glass‐transition temperature. On the other hand, the mechanical energy input during the compressive deformation of particulate assemblies is much lower than that of solid polymer samples, depending, to a great extent, on the degree of the particulate densification/void ratio of the particulate system. There are two types of PED in the melting section of Co‐TSEs, localized PED of individual pellets in the partially filled kneading section and global PED of consolidated particulate assemblies in the fully filled section. The mandatory deformation of solid particulates, caused by the interaction of kneading paddle pairs, and the associated PED for both individual pellets and consolidated particulate assemblies, provides very efficient heating/melting of polymer feedstock in Co‐TSEs. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The mixing quality was quantified by calculating the variances of the light intensity of the bitmap files cropped from the films taken at the screw length of 15D and 17D of a 45‐mm screw diameter single‐screw extruder. Temperature and screw speed were the two variables studied. While temperature and back pressure were found to have little effect on the mixing quality, screw speed was demonstrated to be a major factor responsible for the mixing fluctuation observed during extrusion. In fact, screw speed and mixing fluctuation appeared to have a relationship that the higher the screw speed, the bigger the fluctuation (i.e., poorer quality of mixing). The experimental results also revealed that the secondary flight of a barrier screw might be essential to improve the quality of mixing. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "To minimize the brittleness of polylactic acid (PLA), the epoxidized rubber seed oils (ERO) or epoxidized ester rubber seed oils (EERO) are blended with PLA. The mechanical properties of ERO bioblend are higher than that of EERO bioblend and significantly improved compared to that of the PLA sample. Elongation at break is increased by 9.1 times, and impact strength and tensile toughness improved by 139% and 1370%, respectively. The morphological study showed the microdroplets of epoxidized oils distributed in the ERO bioblend are much smaller than those in the EERO bioblend. This means that the ERO is better compatible with PLA, and both ERO and EERO are partially miscible with PLA. This compatibility is confirmed by the decrease in the glass transition temperature, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><msub><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>g</mtext></mrow></msub></math> , from 65.7 to 60.5°C. The TGA analysis shows a sharp increase in an initial decomposition temperature (from 261.8 to 311.9°C) meaning an improvement in thermal properties. The NMR analysis proves that the epoxidized vegetable oils are linked to PLA chains, so both the melt flow index and an acid value of ERO or EERO bioblend decrease while the thermal stability is improved. The NMR peak area of some signals shows that the ERO is more attached to PLA, proving better compatibility of ERO with PLA, resulting in higher mechanical properties of ERO bioblend. The plasticizing effect of plasticizers is not dependent on the oxygen-oxirane content of the epoxidized oil but is strongly influenced by the acid value. Overall results show that both ERO and EERO can be used as a biodegradable, renewable plasticizer to replace petroleum-based plasticizers for PLA. In addition, the successful modification of PLA by using ERO or EERO promotes the use of this polymer as a potential material for researchers working on PLA applications.",

In this regard, each polymeric material necessitates a different set of process conditions. To this end, testing was done to determine the most suitable process parameters for a new commercially available polymer (Laser PP CP 60), from Diamond Plastics GmbH. It was established that the material requires slightly different settings from those provided by the supplier for the values for the removal chamber temperature, building chamber temperatures, and laser power to achieve the best mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength). The preliminary testing indicates that the process parameters that yielded the best mechanical properties for the laser PP CP 60 powder were 125°C, 125°C, 0.15 mm, 250 μm, 4500 mm/s, 34.7 W, 1500 mm/s, and 21.3 W for the removal chamber temperature, building chamber temperature layer thickness, hatch distance, scanning speed fill, laser power fill, scanning speed contour, and laser power contour, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Plastic pallets are essential devices for the transport of industrial products within containers and can be made from recycled plastics to be more environmentally friendly. However, numerous thin reinforcing ribs are required to mold such large-size pallets, thereby requiring a large-scale injection-molding machine. Many filling gates can reduce the welding lines to enhance the structural strength of the pallet to achieve injection molding using a lower locking force machine. This study simulated the production of recycled polypropylene plastic pellets using a 3500-ton super-large injection-molding machine and the Moldex3D package to derive the flow analysis of the moldability. The PTC Creo software is used to construct plastic pallets ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>1100</mn> <mtext> </mtext> <mtext>mm</mtext> <mo>×</mo> <mn>1100</mn> <mtext> </mtext> <mtext>mm</mtext> <mo>×</mo> <mn>140</mn> <mtext> </mtext> <mtext>mm</mtext> </math> ), filled by twelve gates using a baffle cooling system. During the four-stage filling of the sequential valve gate system, the flow front spreads from the central gate to the four corners of the pallet, decreasing the number of welding lines, with an average filling pressure of 19.23 MPa by a sequential valve gate scheme which is approximately 65% of the concurrent valve gate opening scheme. The maximum clamping force by this sequential valve gate opening scheme in the molding of plastic pallet is 874.6 tons, only half of the one by concurrent valve gate opening scheme. The average welding angle was 85.7° in the concurrent valve gate opening scheme, with smaller angles than that of the sequential gates controlled scheme. The maximum temperatures during the filling by the two schemes with the concurrent valve gates opened and the sequential gates controlled were 230.5 and 232.5°C, respectively. The sequential valve gate opening scheme’s warpages are smaller than the ones by the concurrent valve gate opening scheme. The warpages of the pallet by the sequential valve gate system are smaller than the ones by the concurrent valve gate system. A higher temperature of the cooling channel and a medium level of cooling time result in lower warpage of the pallet.",

We started by exploring the temperature thresholds with thermal and redox initiation, the effect of initiator concentration, and the kinetic characteristics of microemulsion polymerization at different temperatures. Then, as for the differential microemulsion polymerization, extensive investigation was made into the effects of the volumetric flow ratio, the prepolymerization time, the initiator concentration, and the solid content of the initial microemulsion. Finally, we compared the differential microemulsion polymerization with the soap-free emulsion polymerization in the slug flow. The striking advantages in the polymerization rate, the average particle diameter, and the size distribution reflected higher density of particle nuclei, larger specific surface area of particles, and the pivotal effect of the persistent particle nucleation in the microemulsion polymerization.",

The influence of fiber content on the orthotropic stiffnesses and strengths of the unidirectional composite was experimentally determined; then, these orthotropic properties were the input data for the prediction, by means of the classical lamination theory, of the tensile effective properties of several PP/Twaron laminates. Good agreement was found between the predicted and experimental tensile data of the laminates. A previous publication focused on the modeling of the nonlinear behavior of PP/Twaron laminates; consequently, the results from the present work proved that the whole mechanical response of thermoplastic laminates PP/Twaron can be simulated by means of macroscopic models originally developed for thermosetting composites. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The nanocomposites were found to degrade during polymerization. This degradation increased diethylene glycol concentrations and reduced melting temperatures. It also increased carboxyl and decreased hydroxyl end group concentrations from normal PET values, which caused reduced rates of nanocomposite solid‐state polymerization. Cloisite 30B had the best affinity with PET as a result of the hydroxyl groups present in both PET and the organic clay modifier.

These phenomena are affected by barrel and screw design, the type of material being processed, its granulometry, and the technological parameters of the extrusion process. Studies were carried out on the dependency of the output and selected mechanical properties of a plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) extrudate on rotational speed of the screw, the width of the feed opening, and the length of the pellets of input polymer. It was found that the parameters tested were affected to the largest extent by the screw‐rotational speed. A fivefold increase in screw‐rotational speed resulted in a few hundred percent increase in the output and a several dozen percent increase in the yield strength of the extrudate, with the highest value obtained for pellets whose length was close to their diameter. Reduction of the width of the feed opening from 1.0 to 0.6 D resulted in a slight increase in the yield strength and tensile strength. High output, yield strength, and tensile strength values of PVC are most readily achieved at high screw‐rotational speed, the smallest width of the feed opening, and the length of pellets close to their diameter. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The developed apparatus allows simulating and predicting the delamination of the polymer coating from the steel substrate. The effect of certain test parameters such as a peel angle and peel speed was discussed. The durability of the retained assembly was equally investigated by considering an accelerated hygrothermal aging. The interfacial damages after conditioning and peel tests were characterized. Using two peeling angles of 90° and 180°, no significant difference was observed in terms of peel responses. The interface behavior seems to be not sensitive to the peel angle. However, an increase in the peel rate induces an increase in the peel strength. The characterization of the interface exhibits two mechanisms: The delamination process of the polymer coating is characterized by cohesive and mixed rupture, respectively, at low and high peel rates. Studying the effects of aging and coating defects on the interface behavior displays a continuous loss of adhesion of the polymer coating especially when it presents physical defects. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This method permits the accurate measurement and evaluation of dimensional changes, core changes, and gel growth. All tablets displayed greater dimensional expansion in water than in HCI. The fastest and greatest swelling was exhibited in water, whereas, in contrast, the greatest erosion was observed in HCI. Chitosan/Polyox tablets exhibited greater expansion, swelling, and gel growth than the equivalent chitosan/Ethocel tablets. The thickness of the gel layer in chitosan/Polyox tablets, particularly, increased considerably with time up to 8 h, indicating that the development of a thick and durable gel barrier is a characteristic necessity for the preparation of sustained drug release delivery systems. In addition, the differentiation of the above‐mentioned characteristics in relation to changes in pH values also gives useful information about sustained release preparations made from these polymers, since it is well known that the gastrointestinal tract is characterized by a range of pH values. In general, the polymer mixtures studied comprise a useful and promising combination of materials for the development and manufacturing of sustained release devices based on these polymers. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The additive contents (≤ 1% by weight) and process conditions for the production of fibers have been optimized to obtain a satisfactory level of MWNTs dispersion for all systems, as confirmed by electron microscopy observations. Structural investigations performed on fibers with varying content and aspect ratio of nanotubes made it possible to relate the observed changes in properties, such as dynamic mechanical behavior and mechanical properties, to the crystalline structure of the polymer in terms of size, main distance between the crystalline lamellae, and orientation. The results have revealed unexpectedly large increase in elongation at break‐in fibres containing MWNTs, even though these exhibited a slight increase in the stiffness of the fibers.

Pyrrole was oxidatively polymerized in dimethylformamide in the presence of P(AN‐ co ‐BuA) matrix to produce polypyrrole (PPy) composites. Composite thin films were produced by solution casting onto smooth glass surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared–attenuated total reflectance analysis of thin films revealed the presence of PPy in the composite structure. Electrical impedance measurements were conducted to reveal the electrical conductivity change due to increasing PPy content. Enhancing the flexibility of PPy structures, as a composite film composed of PPy, could find substantial utility in the application of PPy products. BuA in a copolymer structure with AN improved the mechanical properties of the resulting copolymer by compensating the mechanical disadvantages of PPy. The butylacrylate containing matrix provided better electrical conductivity and stability than polyacrylonitrile, and the presence of butylacrylate enhanced the electrostatic interaction with PPy. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Poly(dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) based on the urethane acrylate oligomer was synthesized using hydroxyl‐terminated PDMS, isophorone diisocyanate, and 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate. This oligomer was synthesized to increase the hydrophobicity of coatings. Hybrid formulations were applied onto polycarbonate plates and irradiated with UV light. Coatings’ performance was investigated with thermal, mechanical, morphologic, and antibacterial analyses. It is observed that the thermal stability of UV‐cured films is improved with the incorporation of the sol–gel precursor. It is shown that the nanosilver addition to hybrid coatings leads to significant enhancements in antibacterial property in vitro. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Swelling performances of the different gels as a function of cross‐link density of the gels, dipole characteristic, structure, and chemical composition of solvent were studied. Swelling and deswelling kinetics of the gels in some suitable solvents were also studied. An attempt has been made to utilize the deswelling characteristic of the swelled gels in slow and sustained release of volatiles as required in fire starters/fire gels or fragrance release. Swelling of the gel was maximum with 2 mol% of cross‐linker beyond which, it decreased. It was also dependent on the H‐bonding ability, dipole characteristic, chemical structure, and viscosity of the solvent. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The mechanical properties and water absorption were studied before and after being exposed to gamma irradiation from 25 to 200 kGy. The tensile strength increased with RHA up to an optimum filler loading (20 phr) and (30 phr) for a silica‐filled NBR composite. The tensile strength for the irradiated composite filled with 30 phr silica increases with an increase in irradiation doses up to 100 kGy. The presence of silica filler phase that has a higher electron density than the polymer matrix will likely result in an increase in cross‐linking or scissioning and better dispersion in the matrix. Water absorption studies indicate that the irradiated NBR composite filled with silica has lower water absorption rather than the composite filled with RHA. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Chemical composition of the modified acrylate colloid was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry ( FTIR ). The thermal performances were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetry ( TG ). Furthermore, surface hydrophobicity of the latex film was examined by measurement of water absorption and water contact angle. Results indicate that the modified acrylate colloid has highest monomer conversion rate and lowest coagulation percentage when the mass fraction of emulsifier was 4% and mass ratio of SDBS to OP ‐10 was 1:2, mass fraction of initiator was 0.3%, mass percent of HFMA was 6%, and the amount of BZMA was 2%. Benzene ring‐containing monomer is effectively participated in the reaction and has improved the thermal performance and surface properties of copolymer colloid.

Second, the nitro group of this compound was converted to an amino group via reduction in the presence of hydrazine hydrate. In the last step, the reaction of this compound with 4,4'‐diflouro benzophenone led to the synthesis of a novel ether keto diamine. Characterization of all materials was carried out by conventional spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. A series of new polyureas was prepared via the polymerization reaction of the synthesized diamine with three commercially available diisocyanates including 4,4'‐diphenylmethan diisocyanate, toluene‐2,4‐diisocyanate, and isophoronediisocyanate in N ‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone. The resulted polyureas were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The inherent viscosities of these polyureas ranged from 0.59 to 0.62 dL/g measured at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL. The resulting polyureas were soluble in dipolar aprotic solvents. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicated that their glass transition temperature values were between 171 and 198°C and at the 10% weight loss of polymers, glass transition temperature was about 325–368°C showing improved thermal stability in comparison with common polyureas. Thermal stability features of the polyurea were also confirmed by means of the pyrolysis‐gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method.",

In the first method, castor oil (CO) and toluene‐2,4‐diisocyanate (TDI) molar ratio is CO/TDI : 1/1 with varying amounts of the SPI content. In the second method, the molar ratio of TDI is calculated by considering the –OH groups of both CO and SPI. We made the assumption that, in the first method, SPI acts as a filler and in the second method SPI is one of the coreactants in PU formation. The mechanical properties of the fabricated PU/SPI green composites are evaluated; and it is found that the tensile strength increases up to 8 wt% of SPI, and a further increase in SPI leads to reduction in the tensile strength. The small angle x‐ray scattering profiles have been used to evaluate the arrangement of amorphous (A) and crystalline (C) regions in the PU/SPI green composites in a scale of about 700 Ǻ by considering the variation in scattered intensity with scattering angles ranging from 0.3° to 1.5°. For this purpose, a linear paracrystalline model is used. In this study, the exponential distribution of phase lengths gives a good agreement between the measured and computed data on the basis of a linear paracrystal model. It is observed that there are significant changes in the distribution of phase lengths due to changes in the composition and chemical structure of PU/SPI composites obtained by methods 1 and 2.",

The resultant NRP particles were almost spherical with a diameter of less than 10 μm. The mechanical properties of NRP, in terms of the modulus, tensile strength, and hardness were greater than that for conventional block rubber (STR). Moreover, the addition of silica filler (25 phr) yielded better mechanical properties when prepared by spray drying (Si/NRP) than by the conventional silica‐filled block rubber (Si/STR).

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The polyaniline–polyvinyl alcohol (PANI–PVA) composite conductive coatings were prepared by using PVA as the base material and doping with hydrochloride (HCl), dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA), and aminosulfonic acid (NH 2 SO 3 H) aqueous solution. The influences of mass ratio between PANI and PVA, acid content, oxidant (ammonium persulfate, APS) content, reaction time, and drying temperature of film on the conductivity of coating film were studied. The result shows that in case the mass percentage of PVA is 40% and the drying temperature of film is 80℃, the conductivity of coating film has the highest conductivity. In case C(HC1) is 0.5 mol⋅L −1 , the reaction time is 6 h, and n (APS/An) is 1.0, the maximum conductivity of HCl–PANI–PVA coating film is 1500 S⋅m −1 ; in case C(DBSA) is 1.0 mol⋅L −1 , the reaction time is 8 h, and the n (APS/An) is 2.0, the maximum conductivity of DBSA–PANI–PVA coating film is 710 S⋅m −1 ; in case C(NH 2 SO 3 H) is 1.0 mol⋅L −1 , the reaction time is 6 h, and the n (APS/An) is 2.0, the maximum conductivity of NH 2 SO 3 H–PANI–PVA coating film is 200 S⋅m −1 . Among these PANI–PVA composite conductive coatings, the conductivity of HCl–PANI–PVA coating film is the highest. At the same time, the structure and conductive mechanism of composite materials were characterized and analyzed through infrared and ultraviolet spectrum and scanning electron microscopy.",

To develop dispersion and interfacial compatibility of ZrO 2 NP s with PVP matrix, at first the surface of NP s was modified with citric acid and vitamin C. Then, the novel NC s were fabricated by adding various amounts of modified ZrO 2 NP s in the PVP matrix. All of the steps were performed with ultrasonic irradiation as a safe method. The obtained NC s were investigated by different techniques. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results indicated interactions between the NP s and modifier agents. Thermogravimetric analysis results illustrated that the thermal stability of NC 7 wt% in comparison to the pure polymer was enhanced. The surface topography and morphology of the NC s were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The results showed that the nanofiller were homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrix. Finally, the incorporation of the modified ZrO 2 NP s influenced the UV –Vis absorption of the pure PVP .",

The results of the complex permittivity shows that the E‐glass/epoxy composites filled with GnPs and xGnP s have superior dielectric properties as compared to that of MWCNT s‐filled composites. However, calculations and simulations of reflection loss (RL) have predicted poor microwave absorbing strength of GnPs and xGnP s composites as compared to that of MWCNT s. The calculations of AC conductivity and skin depth show that GnPs‐ and xGnP s‐filled hybrid composites have very large AC conductivity and short skin depth, which can suppress the ability of the composites to absorb electromagnetic waves. The decrease in wt.% of GnPs below 1.0 has improved the microwave absorption in hybrid composites.",

At present, filters used for hemodialysis are manufactured only in certain countries, and all other countries must rely on imports. In this study, polyethersulfone (PES), which has excellent blood compatibility, was used as the main material to develop hemodialysis membranes for hemodialysis filters, and these hemodialysis membranes were prepared by adding a hydrophilic polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and varying the type of nonsolvent during the manufacturing process to improve the toxin removal rate and biocompatibility. The addition of PVP was confirmed through attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and the structure of the membranes depending on the nonsolvent was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. The contact angle results indicated that the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was improved as the concentration of PVP increased. The results of the toxin filtration efficiency experiment using urea, creatinine, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) confirmed removal rates of 58.8% and 56.87%, respectively, and a protein loss of less than 8%. Also, cell viability was over 90% at the PVP concentration of 2% or higher.

    "abstract": "Solution styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and silica filler have attracted a significant attention because of their superior properties in cured rubber mixtures used in automobile tire industry. One of the challenges ahead of using these materials is the hard dispersion of silica with its polar surface in SBR nonpolar rubber. In the present study, the synthesis of styrene-butadiene rubber by solution polymerization method with polymer chain modification using copolymer functionalization was performed. For this purpose, two materials, namely, aminopropyl triethoxy silane (APTES) and tetraethoxy silicate (TEOS), were employed to improve the silica dispersion in the mixture. The results of postsynthesis structural tests show the successful placement of functional groups on the polymer chain. The results of mechanical, dynamic, and imaging analyses of the cured mixtures showed an improvement in the APTES-containing samples rolling resistance, wet surface grip, and abrasion resistance by 39%, 18%, and 17%, respectively, due to having stronger physical and chemical bonds with silica and also the usage of end agents in the polymer chain. The samples containing TEOS had also better results than the conventional SBR rubber. In addition, a sample containing emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber was prepared to compare its properties with those of the solution SBR. Another SBR sample containing silane coupling agent was also prepared to investigate its performance compared to that of the agents placed on the polymer chain. The abrasion resistance, rolling resistance, and wet grip of the coupling agent containing sample showed 2%, 10%, and 30% improvement, respectively, which were very close to those of the sample containing the TEOS agent. In this work, various techniques including, rheometry, wear, rolling, hardness, bound rubber content, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were employed to analyze the synthesized rubber.",

    "abstract": "Recently, reinforced polymeric composites prepared from natural fibers have received a significant interest among the researchers because of its appreciable sustainability, environmentally friendly, and low cost. However, one particular issue, that is, hydrophilic property, still needs to be addressed for its successful applications. Since the hydrophilic tendency of natural fibers is extremely undesirable, it leads to the quick degradation of fiber-based polymer composites. Hence, the fiber property, hydrophilic nature, is influenced by the presence of noncrystalline and voids part of these fibers that significantly influences the polymer matrix adhesion. Hence, it is very important to understand the water absorption behavior of reinforced fiber composites. In this study, a crop residual material specific to Ethiopia, teff straw (Eragrostis tef), was used as fiber material. The fiber was treated with 1% NaOH followed by 1% CH2=CHCOOH at room temperature for improving the bonding strength between the fiber and polymer, which leads to suppress the water absorption. The investigation on mathematical model for water absorption property at different fiber loadings (4%, 8%, 12%, 16, and 20%) was carried out, and the analysis on the kinetic behavior of water absorption was also investigated. In addition, the response surface-based statistical modeling which correlates water absorption, fiber loading, and time has been analyzed.",

Tensile, bending, and dynamic mechanical analyses were used to figure out the mechanical properties of the composites. Fiber composites and glass-fiber composites were found to have higher density and mechanical properties than abaca fiber-based composites. This is because resin did not get into the cell cavity of the fiber’s inner tissue structure. The abaca fiber composites that worked the worst were those in which the fibers were pulled out while the fibers on the surface were torn. The fiber-reinforced epoxy circumferential composite interface junction in the twisting abaca fiber circumferential composite was found to be more flexible and have a higher glass transition temperature than any of the other composites (6000 MPa). We found that twisting abaca fiber-naval ordnance laboratory and twisting abaca fiber-prepared circumferential composite had the lowest frequency dependence and performance variability. To improve composite properties, both the outside and inside structures of twisting abaca fiber need to be fixed. There is also a rise in fiber-to-resin contact and a rise in fiber surface area.

This study explored the grounding characteristics and temperature field distribution of mining tires during driving as well as the relationships between the maximum temperature and tire inflation pressure, load, and speed. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element models of mine tires were established. Steady-state rolling simulation analysis was conducted based on inflation and static load simulations. Temperature field simulation analysis was conducted with the tire section as a research object. The accuracy of the finite element model was verified. Analysis results demonstrated that the grounding contact area decreased with an increase in charging pressure and increased with an increase in load. With an increase in inflation pressure, the maximum normal grounding stress increased in the middle part of the tread and decreased near the shoulder. The maximum normal grounding stress continuously deviated in the shoulder direction with an increase in load. Temperature field analysis indicated that the tire had the maximum temperature at the binder position, where the first belt layer was connected to the second belt layer, which corresponds to the maximum stress position in the steady-state rolling simulations. Tire temperature increased with driving speed. The maximum temperature increased with an increase in tire deflection, whereas the deflection decreased with an increase in inflation pressure and increased with an increase in load. Speed had the greatest influence on the maximum temperature, followed by load, with inflation pressure having the smallest influence. The results of this research can be used to improve the service life of mine tires to improve productivity and reduce costs.",

In this work, the authors studied the possibility of using the fat-and-oil industry wastes in the formulations of a tyre reclaim and a modified tyre reclaim. Extended physical and mechanical tests of experimental rubbers led to the conclusion that it is most expedient to use the fat-and-oil industry wastes in the formulation of rubber compounds for production of sleeper pads for railroad tracks, since when using a tyre reclaim and a modified tyre reclaim, the indicators of rubber properties practically do not change and comply with control standards.",

The effect of the molecular structure on the mechanical and thermal properties has been evaluated in terms of the types of soft/hard and polyol, ranging from 6/4 to 9/1 ratio values. With the increasing of PCL content, the thermal properties of the ISB-TPU have enhanced gradually. When the range from PCL was 6/4, the tensile strength has achieved the maximum value in comparison with that of the PTMG block. Elongation at break has increased with the increase of hard segment concentration, due to the superior interaction between ester groups and urethane groups. The obtained ISB-TPUs can be a promising resin for soft, flexible, and biocompatible application fields.",

    "abstract": "The additive manufacturing (AM) of elastomeric parts based on high-viscosity reinforced rubbers has increasingly become a topic of scientific research in recent years. In addition to the viscosity, which is several decades higher during processing than the viscosities of thermoplastics, the flowability of the compound after the printing process and the necessary chemical crosslinking of the printed component play a decisive role in producing an elastic, high-quality, and geometrically stable part. After the first technological achievements using the so-called additive manufacturing of elastomers (AME) process, the knowledge gained has to be transferred first to concrete industrial parts. Therefore, in this study, the cure kinetics of a conventional rubber compound are tailored to match the specific requirements for scorch safety in the additive manufacturing of an industrial 2-component rod seal based on an acrylonitrile butadiene rubber O-ring in combination with a thermoplastic polyurethane as the base body. Experimental tests on a test rig for rod seals demonstrate the functionality of this additively manufactured 2-component rod seal.",

In the present work, by focusing on the specified scale-up to keep resin temperature unchanged, a new scale-up procedure has been proposed. It is shown that a new heat-removal-related parameter is necessary to describe, exactly, laboratory operation status. Scale-up criteria are delivered in an orthodox way, starting from extruder heat balance and also including a heat-removal parameter and a non-Newtonian index, which specify extruder conditions and polymer characteristics. The solution of this procedure can be easily obtained visually or numerically.

Extensive studies based on both macro- and micromechanical analyses are used to develop new insights into the behavior of composites. In this respect, finite element modeling has proved to be a particularly powerful tool. In this article, we present a Galerkin scheme in conjunction with the penalty method for elasticity analyses of different types of polymer composites. In this scheme, the application of Green's theorem to the model equation results in the appearance of interfacial flux terms along the boundary between the filler and polymer matrix. It is shown that for some types of composites these terms significantly affect the stress transfer between polymer and fillers. Thus, inclusion of these terms in the working equations of the scheme preserves the accuracy of the model predictions. The model is used to predict the most important bulk property of different types of composites. Composites filled with rigid or soft particles, and composites reinforced with short or continuous fibers are investigated. For each case, the results are compared with the available experimental results and data obtained from other models reported in the literature.

The polymer was then subjected to multiple extrusion cycles for the purpose of studying the effects of the extent and temperature of reprocessing on its chemical stability. The relative effectiveness of the various restabilization recipes used was also examined. The process‐induced material degradation is primarily due to chain scission, which causes an average molecular weight reduction; its progression was monitored by measuring the decrease in viscosity. It is determined that degradation increases linearly with the extent of reprocessing while its activation energy is roughly equal to 30 kJ/mol. A simple model is built and used to quantitatively evaluate the potency of each additive used; it presumes that the protection of each individual stabilizer may be explicitly factored out in a product expression. These results suggest useful ways of optimizing stabilization according to the particular processing and product requirements. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Ethylene‐α‐olefin copolymer rich blends displayed finer morphologies, better tensile, heat seal, and optical properties and less extrudate swell. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The samples were aged at 55, 70, 85, and 100°C for different time periods up to 600 h. The change in molecular structure and formation of oxygenated and unsaturated groups during thermo‐oxidative degradation were investigated by infrared spectroscopy. Viscosity‐average molecular weight (M̄ v ) was found to decrease at slower rate in the initial hours of ageing, whereas on prolonged ageing, it decreased at a faster rate. In some blend samples, the tensile strength and elongation at break initially increased up to certain hours of ageing, and then decreased while in some blends both tensile strength and elongation‐at‐break varied differently. Increase in percent gel content supports the formation of cross‐links between the molecular chains. Thermal stability of the samples also decreased with ageing time and temperature. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Antimicrobial activity of prepared samples, as well as neat gelatin and gelatin–siloxane hybrid as a reference, was investigated using a modified agar diffusion method against several bacterial strains ( Aeromonas hydrophila , Bacillus subtilis , Escherichia coli ) and opportunistic fungus (yeast species Candida albicans ). Prepared gelatin–siloxane films were characterized using FT ‐ IR , thermal and SEM analysis. Mechanical properties and swelling behavior of the samples were also investigated. The influence of type and amount of organosilicon compound used for modification of gelatin, as well as type and concentration of applied active agent on antimicrobial activity, was determined. We observed higher antimicrobial activity for all synthesized gelatin–siloxane hybrids than for unmodified gelatin with lysozyme, nisin, and EDTA prepared as comparison. Moreover, samples obtained with siloxane containing fluoroalkyl groups (S2) showed higher resistance to microbial agents than hybrids with S1 siloxane. Hybrid films showed also better water stability than neat biopolymer.",

Water released from CaC 2 O 4 ·H 2 O made the silane‐grafted UHMWPE cross‐link. In particular, no catalyst was added in the cross‐linking step. Fourier Transform Infrared results confirmed that the silane has been grafted onto the UHMWPE chain successfully and the grafting index varied with the dosage of the initiator. With the increasing of CaC 2 O 4 ·H 2 O content, the gel ratio increased and average molecular weight of the cross‐linked UHMWPE decreased, which proved that the cross‐linked UHMWPE can be prepared by this method. Moreover, there existed different cross‐linked network structures (loose and tight networks) in the samples with the same gel ratio.",

SEM demonstrated irregular granular morphology of the polymer with high porosity similar to polyaniline ( PANI ). The size distribution of POT salts was analyzed using Nano Measurer 1.2.5 software from scanning electron micrographs. The semicrystalline nature, with crystallite size and d‐spacing in the range of 21.4–30.2 nm and 4.93–4.99 Å, respectively, was confirmed from XRD .

The small crystallite size, high thermal stability, and high values of the activation energy of degradation reveal that DBSA is an efficient dopant for POT and imparts interesting characteristics to this otherwise less thermally stable polymer. The fast rate of electron transfer of POT , as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveals its high electrochemical activity toward electrolyte. Potentiodynamic polarization measurement of POT ‐coated stainless steel showed large anodic potential shift as compared to uncoated stainless steel, illustrated good anticorrosion performance.

Then, the BSSPCM s were prepared based on an self‐curing and organic solvent‐free process, using trimethylolpropane tris(1‐aziridine propionate) as the cross‐linking agent. The chemical structure, crystalline properties, phase change properties, thermal stability, and reliability were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and accelerated thermal cycling testing, respectively. Solid–solid phase change behavior was testified by the leakage test. The biodegradation experiment was conducted to prove the biodegradability of solid–solid PCMs. The results indicated that BSSPCM s had a similar crystalline structure to PEG , and the crystal size was smaller than PEG . The phase change temperature of BSSPCM s was in the range of 25–65°C, and the latent heat of phase change materials ( PCM s) was about 103–108 J/g. Moreover, the extent of supercooling of BSSPCM s was reduced. Thermogravimetric analysis and accelerated thermal cycling test results confirmed the considerable thermal stability and reliability of BSSPCM s. The prepared PCM s also exhibited a good biodegradability in the natural environment.",

GO was grafted with PEG and added to PUR by mechanical blending. The polyethylene glycol-g-graphene oxide (MGO) was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The PUR/MGO composites were tested by tensile testing machine, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that PEG was successfully grafted onto the surface of GO and the grafting rate was about 37%. The grated PEG did not affect the crystalline structure of GO. The addition of MGO could improve the thermal stability of PUR vulcanizate. After the addition of GO, the glass transition temperature ( T g ) of vulcanizate was shifted to higher temperature. However, the T g of vulcanizate reinforced by MGO was shifted to lower temperature. The strength and toughness of vulcanizate were significantly improved by adding MGO. The reason was that the hydrogen bond interactions between MGO and PUR were destroyed and the hidden length was released during the strain process. A lot of energy was consumed, and thus the strength and toughness of PUR vulcanizate were improved.",

    "abstract": "Soft sensor techniques have been widely adopted in chemical industry to estimate important indices that cannot be online measured by hardware sensors. Unfortunately, due to the instinct time-variation, the small-sample condition and the uncertainty caused by the drifting of raw materials, it is exceedingly difficult to model the fed-batch processes, for instance, rubber internal mixing processing. Meanwhile, traditional global learning algorithms suffer from the outdated samples while online learning algorithms lack practicality since too many labelled samples of current batch are required to build the soft sensor. In this paper, semi-supervised hybrid local kernel regression (SHLKR) is presented to leverage both historical and online samples to semi-supervised model the soft sensor using proposed time-windows series. Moreover, the recursive formulas are deduced to improve its adaptability and feasibility. Additionally, the rubber Mooney soft sensor of internal mixing processing is implemented using real onsite data to validate proposed method. Compared with classical algorithms, the performance of SHLKR is evaluated and the contribution of unlabelled samples is discussed.",

Subsequently, gas permeation study was conducted on the DDR3 membrane in CO 2 separation from small gas molecules and it was found that the permeance of H 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and CH 4 decreased in the order of H 2 &gt; CO 2 &gt; N 2 &gt; CH 4 , according to the increase in kinetic diameter of these gas molecules.

Copolymeric carrier of A. vulgaris seed mucilage-co-AAm was devised by using acrylamide (AAm) as a monomer, methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinker, and potassium persulfate (KPS) as an initiator through free radical polymerization. Different formulations of A. vulgaris-co-AAm were devised by varying contents of polymer, monomer, crosslinking agent, initiator, and reaction temperature. Copolymeric structures were characterized through XRD analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, TGA and DSC analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Porosity, gel fraction, and Vildagliptin loading capacity of copolymers were also established. Swelling and in vitro drug release studies were conducted. XRD evaluation showed the alteration of the crystalline structure of Vildagliptin into an amorphous form. FTIR analysis confirmed the successful grafting of AAm to A. vulgaris seed mucilage backbone. Porosity was increased with increasing polymer concentration and reaction temperature while it was decreased with an increasing amount of AAm, MBA, and KPS. Gel content was decreased with increasing polymer concentration and reaction temperature while it was increased with an increasing amount of AAm, MBA, and KPS. Acute oral toxicity of copolymeric network was done in animal models to evaluate the safety. Copolymers showed the same swelling behavior at all pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8, and 7.4. Vildagliptin release from copolymer showed a cumulative trend by increasing polymer content and reaction temperature, while a declining trend was observed with increasing contents of monomer, crosslinking agent, and initiator. Sustained release of Vildagliptin was observed from copolymers and release followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. From the acute oral toxicity studies, it is evident that newly synthesized copolymeric carriers are potentially safe for eyes, skin, and vital organs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The influence of the layered silicate clay platelets on the nitrogen permeation properties of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR)/nanoclay nanocomposites has been investigated. Nanocomposites of HNBR modified with different percentages of the organoclay are processed through various routes. Commercially available organoclay (CLOISITE 15A) and various silane‐coupling agents are used to improve the dispersion of the nanoclay in HNBR. A total of 10 different formulations of nanocomposites are manufactured. The addition of the organoclay has resulted in a significant enhancement of the nitrogen barrier properties of the manufactured nanocomposite. The mechanism of the reduction in the permeability is explained through the changes in the morphology and its bond to the filler. These changes are confirmed through examination of the morphology using x‐ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. There has been a drastic reduction up to 55.7% in nitrogen permeability. The reduction in gas permeation in HNBR is attributed to uniformly exfoliated clay platelets. Finally, three different permeability models, namely, the Nielsen model, modified Nielsen model, and Cussler model, have also been considered to predict the permeability behavior of nanocomposites with different volume filler fractions. The experimental values of gas permeability have been compared with theoretical models. It is observed that the modified Nielsen model closely matches with the measured permeation behavior. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of addition order of the components for ethylene–glycidyl methacrylate (E‐GMA) copolymers and two types of organoclays (Cloisite® 15A and Cloisite® 30B) on morphology and mechanical properties of polyamide‐6/elastomer/organoclay ternary nanocomposites were investigated by x‐ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, melt flow index (MFI) measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and tensile and impact tests. Four different addition orders (All‐S, PI‐C, PC‐I, and IC‐P) were applied through melt blending in a twin‐screw extruder. All‐S indicates that the elastomer, the organoclay, and polyamide‐6 were compounded in the extruder simultaneously, and the resulting compound was extruded once more. The other symbols represent the components for the two extrusions. P, I, and C stand for polyamide‐6, elastomer, and organoclay, respectively. The first two ingredients were compounded in the first extrusion, and the resulting compound was mixed with the third component in the second extrusion run. For polyamide‐6/ Cloisite® 15A/E‐GMA nanocomposites processed by PI‐C and IC‐P addition orders, stacked silicate layers were observed in the TEM micrographs. On the contrary, the nanocomposites with Cloisite® 30B gave the best result in terms of intercalation/exfoliation in the IC‐P sequence. Generally, for Cloisite® 15A containing ternary nanocomposites, the All‐S addition order gave the highest impact strength, tensile strength, and Young's modulus owing to potential interactions between the functional groups of the three components. For polyamide‐6/Cloisite® 30B/E‐GMA ternary nanocomposites, the PC‐I mixing sequence produced the highest Young's modulus. For these nanocomposites, impact and tensile strengths and elongation at break were relatively insensitive to the mixing order. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent time, the quest for renewable materials for the development of packaging items is constantly increasing. The class of polylactic acids ( PLA s) is the most promising one, although a broader scale commercial expansion of these polymers cannot leave unceasing enhancement of their functional properties aside, especially toughness and thermal stability. Similarly, continuous innovation in prototyping competitive easy‐route solutions for material processing is another key to successful industrial applications of PLA s. In this respect, this study deals with the design and formulation of innovative custom‐built PLA s for injection and compression molding, which are compostable, suitable for food contact, and characterized by a good compromise of mechanical properties and thermal resistance. Therefore, a commercial grade PLA was modified by reactive compounding extrusion with maleic anhydride ( MAH )‐grafted PLA ( PLA ‐ MA ) and glycidyl methacrylate ( GMA )‐grafted PLA ( PLA ‐ GMA ) and micro‐lamellar talc. Material structure and thermal response of the compounds were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and Fourier transform‐infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ). The experimental findings show that material structure and, especially, crystallization of the PLA can be controlled by fine‐tuning the compound formulation. In addition, achievement of the appropriate crystallization degree in the polymer can lead to compostable composite materials with good thermal stability. Accordingly, the custom‐built PLA formulations feature the potential to expand significantly the fields of application of compostable biopolymers, thus posing a valid alternative to both durable not compostable bioplastics and conventional plastics in injection and compression molding process.",

However, the applications of the dye are limited due to its poor aqueous stability, aggregation tendency, and lack of selectivity. To address these issues, we have developed PEG and azidotriglycerol based dendronized polymers using Novozym 435 as a biocatalyst under solvent free conditions. The resulting polymer having azido and hydroxyl functionalities available in the backbone were further grafted with alkyl chains and polyglycerol dendrons using esterification and ‘Click’ chemistry approach. These polymers form stable micelles at micromolar concentration. All the polymers were characterized from their spectral data and their tendency to encapsulate cyanine 3 dye studied using UV ‐Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity study of the polymers performed against A549 cell lines suggests them to be nontoxic up to a concentration of 500 μg/ml.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the fabrication procedure of polymeric membranes using nonsolvent induced phase inversion technique, thickness and weight of the polymeric cast film change rapidly. The only available guideline just presents a qualitative criterion for thickness change in which “penetration of the denser species into the film and the elimination of the lighter ones from film to coagulation bath” have been related to the densification of the cast solution and its thickness reduction. While it is well‐suited for cellulose acetate/acetone/water ternary system, it is not applicable to our investigated systems, that is, polyethersulfone/n‐methyl‐pyrolidine/water and polysulfone/N‐methylpyrrolidone/water. Thus, here the thermo‐kinetic behavior of NIPS process was discussed, and then a thermodynamic model was developed, in which only initial cast film and final membrane properties were used as inputs. Two new simple suppositions were derived and examined. The use of thermodynamic modeling approach results in desirable estimation of overall changes, and the proposed suppositions also can be reliably used for prediction of changes in mass and thickness experienced by cast film NIPS process. It was shown that without the implication of some serious assumptions, it is impossible to derive the old supposition from theoretical concepts. It was also found that the interpretation of film thickness reduction in literatures cannot be validated. Using the presented theoretical concept, one can obtain an overview of the decrease and/or increase in thickness and/or weight of final fabricated membrane prior to any experimental investigation.",

Using a standard recipe, the chemical kinetics and the numerical implementation have been first validated against the experimental values of the filling time and the density of the final foam. Thereafter, 11,763 different initial conditions are calculated. The results put in evidence that the filling time can be reduced without any significant change in the precursors of the rigidity of the foam. The final temperature of the foam has always remained lower than the limiting temperature so that thermal material deformations in the walls of the cabinet can be avoided. Increasing the physical blowing agent mass fraction beyond the standard recipe does not appear to be a useful option.",

Characterization of novel synthesized matrices includes intrinsic viscosity, 13 C‐CP/MAS solid‐state NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, DSC, SEM, TGA, UV, and elemental analysis. In vitro release studies of 5‐ASA were performed in simulated gastric medium (pH 2) and simulated intestinal medium (pH 7 and 7.4). The release rate of 5‐ASA from OAT‐ g ‐PMMA matrices was found to be slower than oatmeal in simulated gastric media. However, the reverse trend was observed in simulated intestinal medium.

In this study, a methodology for determining the optimum parting direction (PD) considering mold‐manufacturing factors such as tool accessibility and the amount of material to be removed is presented. The methodology starts with an accessibility analysis in which a three‐dimensional part is discretized, and candidate PDs are selected based on maximizing the accessible area, that is, the area that can be machined with a single workpiece orientation or setup. Then, the rough machining process is considered, and an optimum PD that minimizes the rough machining time for both the cavity and core plates is selected. The methodology is applied to four different automotive components: a mirror cover, an interior panel, a pillar, and a fender splash shield.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Enhanced compatibility for blends of polycarbonate with high‐density polyethylene has been achieved with the addition of 5 wt% compatibilizers composed of 1 : 1 mixtures of phenoxy and the sodium ionomer of an ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer at two different levels of neutralization. Both components of the compatibilizer have been found to be capable of reacting with the polycarbonate phase to produce branched polymer chains. These impart a degree of compatibilization in polycarbonate/high‐density polyethylene blends, however at higher levels of sodium in the compatibilizer the polycarbonate phase undergoes crosslinking reactions, causing severe embrittlement. Compatibilization effects are confirmed by morphological examinations, dynamic rheological data, and dielectric loss spectra. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The dispersive melting mechanism, named by us, is of great practical utility. A six‐block physical model is first proposed for the dispersive melting mechanism in the present study. Then nonisothermal non‐Newtonian mathematical models for the dispersive and Maddock melting mechanisms are developed. It has been demonstrated that the dispersive melting model has a number of advantages over the Maddock melting model: the mechanical power consumption can be decreased; the polymer temperature profile is more uniform and its average temperature is lower. Furthermore, melting can be accelerated and hence the total melting length shortened. © 1993 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

In particular, bridged amido complexes can be used to integrate defined long-chain branches into the macromolecule. These complexes lead to homogeneous branched polyethylenes (HBPEs). These long-chain branches provide various new properties. Polymer blends of these polymers with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were manufactured in a twin-screw extruder and characterized by their thermal, mechanical, and processing properties. The HDPE/HBPE blends with low and high comonomer content in the HBPE have been studied over the total range of composition of the blend components, and the influence of the octene content of the HBPEs on the properties of the mixtures was shown for two different blend compositions. Furthermore, the properties of the blends for HDPE and long-chain branched HBPE were compared with HDPE blends of polyethylenes without long-chain branching but similar molecular parameters in relation to the HBPE. The differences were discussed on the basis of the density of the tie-molecules of the polymers. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv in Polym Techn 16: 135–145, 1997",

The information provided by this statistical design of experiments (DOE) method is extensive and highly organized. For the current study, a 25 full factorial model was based on five parameters at two levels of variation. With this model, the effects of injection speed, melt temperature, mold temperature, hold pressure, and cooling time on part properties were investigated. The properties measured were tensile modulus, tensile yield strength, tensile ultimate strength, and Gardner and Izod impact strengths.

    "abstract": "Abstract Screw design for single screw extruders is a subject often surrounded by a certain degree of mysticism; in fact, by many people it is considered to be a black art. Others approach screw design from a mathematical point of view and determine the screw geometry from mathematical simulation of the extrusion process. Neither approach works very well. Our understanding of the extrusion process has improved considerably over the last 40 years. As a result, screw design certainly cannot and should not be considered a black art, because doing so would basically ignore all the progress made in the development of improved understanding of the extrusion process. On the other hand, relying only on mathematical modeling to achieve the desired extruder performance is not entirely appropriate, simply because the extrusion theory has not developed to the point that extruder performances can be predicted with 100 percent accuracy. The correct way to approach screw design is to combine extrusion theory and practical experience. As long as the extrusion theory is not fully developed, there is no substitute for practical experience. In this paper a practical approach to screw design is developed, with a minimal use of extrusion theory, to facilitate wider implementation of this approach. The design of the solids conveying, plasticating, melt conveying, and mixing zones of the extruder will be described based on a discussion on what physically happens to the material as it progresses along the extruder screw. It will be shown that the appropriate screw design is strongly dependent on the flow properties of the material to be extruded as well as the amount of pressure that has to be developed by the screw. This means that the screw design cannot be analyzed without consideration of the die that will be used at the end of the extruder. The design of the die, the melt flow properties of the polymer, the throughput rate, the melt temperatures, and the screen pack determine the amount of pressure that has to be developed by the screw. Therefore, the screw design that is appropriate in a regular extrusion operation is usually not optimum when a melt pump is used, because in the latter case the screw only has to develop a small amount of pressure.",

Injection molding was carried out to produce preforms with good optical clarity. The difference between the processing temperature and the equilibrium melting point of the materials, their crystallizability, and their levels of transesterification are major factors controlling optical clarity in the preforms. Free blow experiments were conducted on the injection‐molded preforms to study changes in the blow‐up ratio (BUR) as a function of molecular weight, blend composition, level of transesterification, and the difference between the orientation temperature and the glass‐transition temperature ( T – T g ). Results indicate that for a given value of intrinsic viscosity and T – T g , the blends will require higher stretch ratios than that of PET to achieve equivalent levels of strain‐induced crystallization. The BUR for a given blend composition is independent of the degree of randomness after a critical level of transesterification has been achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Experiments were performed with five test fluids including two Newtonian fluids and three suspensions having yield stresses.

The fractional coverage increased monotonically as capillary number increased at low capillary number ( Ca &lt; 1), approaching an asymptotic value of 0.60 at high capillary number. The shape of the front and fractional coverage as a function of the capillary number could be obtained by numerical simulation based on a finite element method using Polyflow® software.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rotationally molded polyethylene (PE) blended in two ways (turbo blending and extrusion) with nucleating and nonnucleating pigments is structurally characterized by wide‐ and small‐angle x‐ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS, respectively), DSC and microhardness measurements. Morphological observations are performed by polarized light microscopy. The melting temperature and the degree of crystallinity (from both DSC and WAXS) remain essentially constant regardless of sample preparation and type of pigment. The same holds for the crystal sizes from WAXS and the lamella thickness from SAXS. Only the values of microhardness depend on the type of pigment, increasing about 10% when a nucleating type is used. The almost constant values of these properties, contrasting to the spherulitic morphology, are explained by the fact that the processing conditions in rotational molding are very favorable for crystallization. As a consequence, optimal crystalline structure is achieved, which masks significantly the effect of pigments and blending conditions on the crystallization behavior of polyethylene. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The processability of polymers by extrusion is closely related to the interface between the polymer melt and the die wall. The wall surface energy affects the flow of polymer melts in extrusion die. For the purpose of improving the processability in such a process, the effects of boron nitride (BN) powders on the rheological properties and the extrusion processability of metallocene‐ catalyzed low‐density polyethylene (m‐LDPE) have been investigated in this study. It is known that BN powders act as a solid lubricant, and lower the surface energy. Two kinds of BN particle, differing in crystal and agglomerate size, have been used and compared. The initial agglomeration of particles had little effect on the processing performance once the samples were made by twin‐screw extrusion. However, crystal size and size distributions significantly influenced the processability. Small crystal size and uniform size distribution were found to be more effective. Also, this improvement of processability was due to the increased slip velocity, not due to rheological property changes. The effect of a hot‐pressed BN die on the instability of capillary flow was also studied. A hot‐pressed BN die was quite effective in delaying surface and sharkskin defects and postponing gross melt fracture compared to a tungsten carbide die. A synergistic effect of processability improvement could be obtained when both BN powder and a hot‐pressed BN die were used together. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The possibility of improving the processing characteristics of a high‐viscosity engineering polymer alloy (PPO‐PA6,6) was explored through the addition of small amounts of a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (LCP). The thermal and rheological characteristics were examined for LCP contents up to 5 wt%. Inclusion of even a small amount of LCP (1 wt%) has resulted in a substantial decrease in the melt viscosity (∼50%) and in the possible lowering of the processing temperature of the PPO–PA alloy. Numerical simulation and experimental tests for the injection molding of a fairly complex component have shown that cavity filling occurs more rapidly when small amounts of LCP are added to the blend. Together with morphological examinations, these results have confirmed that LCP is thoroughly dispersed in the blend and acts as a true viscosity depressant, rather than behaving as an external lubricant. The resulting improvements in processing characteristics were also evident from the increase in the onset degradation temperature and the reduction in thermal expansion coefficient of the blends. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A combination treatment of UV irradiation and heat was performed in sequential steps. At first, the urethane diacrylate resin was cross-linked through UV irradiation and a pre-UV-cured film was formed. Then, the pre-UV-cured film was heat treated for curing the thermo-curable epoxy resin. As the thermal polymerization continued, LC droplets were formed and became embedded within the polymer matrix. PDLC films obtained from the polymer matrix with refractive indices in a range from 1.511 to 1.523 (1.517 ± 0.006) have optimal electro-optical properties. Films with a refractive index higher than 1.523 have high contrast ratio (CR), threshold voltage (Vth), and V90, whereas those with a low refractive index of 1.508 have low CR, Vth, and V90. In this study, we found that PDLC composite films with optimal compositions prepared by dual resins (UV/thermal) have good electro-optical properties. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The change of compatibility of poly(ethylene‐ co ‐vinyl alcohol) (EVOH)/LDPE blends induced byγ‐ray radiation was studied. Gel extraction experiment results show that the gel fraction of blends increases linearly with the content of LDPE and reaches a maximum at 100 kGy, because neat EVOH is difficult to cross‐link by irradiation. A comparison of theoretical and experimental gel contents indicates that some EVOH molecular chains enter the LDPE gel network. The peak at 3363 cm −1 on the Fourier transform infrared spectrum of pure blend gel is assigned to typical stretching of an OH bond, which indicates that a “graft” reaction occurs in the interface between EVOH and LDPE phases during the irradiation process. Mechanical property measurement results support such a structural change. The tensile strength of cross‐linked blends increases with absorbed dose first, reaches a maximum value at 150 kGy, and then decreases with dose. A similar trend can also be observed in bending tests. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 28:192–198, 2009; Published online in Wiley InterScience ( www.interscience.wiley.com ).

A better approach is to develop mathematical models to help select the conditions and parameters and predict the process performance. However, most of the models developed and used so far contain unrealistic geometrical and mathematical simplifications. The objective of this work is to develop a steady‐state three‐dimensional mathematical model to describe the flow of an incompressible polymer melt inside a helical geometry, which represents the polymer's true motion in extrusion and injection molding processes. The mathematical model is first developed in a natural cylindrical system. Transformers are then derived to obtain the model in helical coordinates. A novel feature of this work is the consideration of tapered screws, i.e., screws tapered either upward or downward along the direction of the flow. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this paper is to analyze how the viscosity of the resin/curing agent system and the vacuum level influence the morphology and the mechanical behavior of sandwich beams with composite faces (epoxy resin and glass fiber fabric named COMBI 900) and a PVC foam core. Four different sandwich structures were produced by varying the viscosity of the epoxy resin/curing agent at constant maximum vacuum pressure. Three further structures were manufactured by varying the strength of the vacuum with the resin viscosity maintained constant at the minimum level. Three point bending tests were carried out on all seven sandwiches. The analysis shows that although both parameters affect the mechanical characteristics of the structure, the viscosity of the resin system is clearly the more influential of the two. The morphological structure of the sandwiches was analyzed both by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and by muffle furnace ignition to calculate the percentage of fibers, matrices, and voids present in the different samples © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The examination of these characteristics will be helpful in the design of oral drug delivery systems with this polymer. It has been demonstrated that image analysis is a valuable technique, allowing the study of quantitative measurements of dimensional and core changes and gel evolution. The dimensional expansion changes of the chitosan lactate tablets were greater in water, and the crushing strength and the stirring effect affected these attributes to a limited extent. The fastest and greatest liquid uptake was observed in water, whereas the greatest erosion was observed in HCl. The thickness of the gel layer increased considerably with time up to the eighth hour, indicating the formation and development of a thick and durable gel, particularly in water. This is an essential characteristic for potential sustained drug release delivery. Consequently, this polymer appears to be a versatile material and a promising vehicle for the preparation of various oral sustained release medications and relevant devices. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Compared with citric acid‐doped PANI , D‐tartaric acid‐doped PANI shows higher specific capacitance (525 F/g at 1 A/g) and cyclic stability. The good electrochemical behaviors of D‐tartaric acid‐doped PANI might be attributed to the two carboxyl groups of D‐tartaric acid, which are beneficial to the oriented growth of PANI chains. The results demonstrate that compared with citric acid, D‐tartaric acid is a promising dopant for PANI used in supercapacitors.",

In recent years, there is a demand for composites material with lower dielectric constant higher loss factor for microwave application. This research, the effect of soda lime silica (SLS) on structural and complex permittivity of soda lime silica-high density polyethylene (SLS-HDPE) composites was conducted in order to explore the possibility of substituting RS-4050 with SLS-HDPE composites as a microwave waveguide terminations and dummy loads. Elemental weight composition of the SLS glass powder and HDPE was identified through scaling of different percentage of SLS and HDPE. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystallinity behavior of SLS-HDPE composites. The proposed SLS-HDPE composites material was studied at frequencies 8 to 12 GHz. The study was conducted using waveguide Agilent N5230A PNA technique. The effect of microwave frequency on complex permittivity properties for SLS-HDPE composites of different percentages of SLS and HDPE (10% SLS-90% HDPE, 20% SLS-80% HDPE, 30% SLS-70% HDPE, 40% SLS-60% HDPE, and 50% SLS-50% HDPE) were investigated. Results showed the diffraction patterns reveal good amorphous quality with a genuinely properties structure. The microwave frequency and composites percentages significantly influenced the complex permittivity (real and imaginary) properties of the composites. Moreover, the complex permittivity increased as the percentage of SLS filler increased in the host matrix HDPE as a result of increased in composite density due to less volume being occupied by the filler as the percentage increased. The complex permittivity of the smallest and largest percentages of SLS (10% and 50%) was (2.67-j0.05) and (3.45-j0.35), respectively. The study revealed that the best sample for waveguide application as microwave terminator is 50% SLS as it has the highest dielectric constant, highest loss factor, and highest loss tangent as compared to 10% SLS to 40% SLS. Also 50% SLS has the highest absorption properties as compare to 10% SLS, 20% SLS, 30% SLS, or 40% SLS. The XRD physical structure of the SLS-HDPE composites revealed the absorption characteristics of different percentages of the materials.

    "abstract": "Thief zones are highly permeable zones in oil reservoirs which affect the performance greatly during water flooding. The most effective way to prevent the invalid circle of thief layer is the injection of high-concentration polymer slugs. In this paper, the plugging effect of nano-micron polymer flooding on the thief zone is studied by experimental and theoretical analysis. The changes of water content and flow resistance were analyzed under different conditions. The result shows that the model presented here has good agreement with the experimental results. The displacement effect is the best when the thief zone is located on the upper part of the reservoir. And the water content will decrease with the increase of flow resistance after nano-micron polymer injection. Besides, the higher the polymer concentration, the more obvious the decrease of water content, and more effective the plugging. This study has provided a quick and reasonable guide in the later adjustment of water flooding development of carbonate reservoirs with thief layers.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the effective purification of PEGylated therapeutic proteins from reaction media has received particular attention. Although several techniques have been used, affinity-based strategies have been scarcely explored despite the fact that, after PEGylation, marked changes in the molecular affinity parameters of the modified molecules are observed. With this in mind, future contributions in the bioseparation of these polymer-protein conjugates are expected to exploit affinity in chromatographic and nonchromatographic techniques which will surely derive in the integration of different operations. However, this will only occur as novel ligands which are simultaneously found. As it will be mentioned, these novel ligands may be screened or designed. In both cases, computer-aided tools will support their identification or development. Additionally, ligand discovery by high-throughput screening (HTS) is believed to become a fast, economic, and informative technology that will aid in the mass production of ligands along with genetic engineering and related technologies. Therefore, besides analyzing the state of the art in affinity separation strategies for PEGylated molecules, this review proposes a basic guideline for the selection of adequate ligands to provide information and prospective on the future of affinity operations in solving this particular bioengineering problem.",

    "abstract": "Water scarcity and quality challenges facing the world can be alleviated by Point-of-Use filtration devices (POU). The use of filtration membranes in POU devices has been limited largely because of membrane fouling, which occurs when suspended solids, microbes, and organic materials are deposited on the surface of filtration membranes significantly decreasing the membrane lifespan, thereby increasing operation costs. There is need therefore to develop filtration membranes that are devoid of these challenges. In this work, nanotechnology was used to fabricate nanostructured polyamic acid (nPAA) membranes, which can be used for microbial decontamination of water. The PAA was used as support and reducing agent to introduce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with antimicrobial properties. The nPAA membranes were fabricated via thermal and wet phase inversion technique and then tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus following standard tests. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited excellent dispersibility and stability as indicated by the color change of the solution and increments of optical density at 415 nm for AgNPs and 520 nm for AuNPs. The wet phase inversion process used produced highly porous, strong, and flexible nPAA membranes, which showed well-dispersed spherical AuNPs and AgNPs whose rough average size was found to be 35 nm and 25 nm, respectively. The AgNPs demonstrated inhibition for both gram positive E. coli and gram negative S. aureus , with a better inhibitory activity against S. aureus . A synergistic enhancement of AgNPs antimicrobial activity upon AuNPs addition was demonstrated. The nPAA membranes can thus be used to remove microbials from water and can hence be used in water purification.",

Changes in the line density of the filament have a 10 times stronger effect than changes in E modulus or density.

Firstly, lentinan was extracted, purified, and analyzed. When the concentration of lentinan was in the range of 0.04–4 μ M, there was no obvious effect on the morphology of HUVECs. When the concentration reached 10 M, the cells were obviously contracted and necrotic. CCK-8 cell activity experiment showed that when the concentration of lentinan reached 4 μ M, the cell activity decreased significantly (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>), and it was in a dose-dependent manner. Then, the cells were divided into the control group (0 μ M lentinan), sepsis group, sepsis + lentinan 1.2 μ M group, and sepsis + lentinan 2 μ M group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that lentinan could significantly reduce the expression of TNF- α , IL-1 β , and IL-6 in sepsis endothelial cells (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>).

In terms of mechanism research, the mRNA and protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein in endothelial cells were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively. It was found that the expression of SIRT1, the upstream factors of endoplasmic reticulum stress in sepsis cells, was obviously inhibited (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>), and the expression of CHOP, GRP78, IRE1 α , and ATF6 was significantly increased (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>), However, the pretreatment of lentinan could significantly reverse the above changes (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M7\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>). Besides, lentinan could also reduce the expression of phosphorylated p65 protein (the activation marker of NF- κ b) and iNOS. Conclusion . When sepsis occurs, lentinan can protect endothelial cells from ERS inflammation and apoptosis induced by sepsis. Thus, lentinan is expected to be a new target for the treatment of sepsis-induced endothelial damage.",

It utilizes high-pressure water as a power to push a solid projectile to penetrate through the melt to form a hollow space. In order to investigate the penetration behavior of the projectile during the water injection stage of W-PAIM process, numerical simulation of the water injection stage of a W-PAIM pipe with straight and curved segments was carried out. A turbulent flow for the driving water was considered in the motion equation, and the dynamic mesh technology was used to deal with the moving solid projectile. The simulation results, including RWT and the flow fields, were compared with those of water-assisted injection molding (WAIM) pipe with the same outer dimensions. It was found that the residual wall thickness (RWT) of the W-PAIM pipe is much thinner than that of the WAIM pipe. The projectile has a crucial influence on the RWT. The pressure fields of W-PAIM and WAIM are very similar in both straight and curved segments. The velocity field and strain rate field near the penetration front in W-PAIM are quite different from those in WAIM due to the drag flow caused by the projectile penetration.",

To investigate the effect of tea polysaccharides (TPS) mediated by miR-375/SRXN1 axis on mice with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and proliferation and apoptosis of astrocytes (AS) conducted with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Methods . Mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and OGD/R-induced AS injury model were established; brain obstruction volume was measured by TTC staining; dry/wet weight ratio was used for measuring brain water content; hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) content in brain tissue was measured by H 2 O 2 assay kit; cell viability and apoptosis rate were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively; the expression level of miR-375 in OGD/R-AS was detected using qPCR; dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-375 and SRXN1; mRNA levels of miR-375, SRXN1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were measured by qPCR; the protein levels of SRXN1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were measured by Western blotting. Results . The volume of cerebral obstruction, brain water content and H 2 O 2 content in mice decreased gradually with the increase of TPS concentration. TPS treatment in vitro could effectively improve OGD/R-AS viability and reduce the apoptotic rate; overexpression of miR-375 inhibited AS viability but increased the apoptotic rate; TPS treatment resulted in a decrease in the expression of miR-375 in OGD/R-AS; MiR-375 targeted SRXN1 in AS; inhibition of miR-375 expression significantly upregulated SRXN1 levels; TPS treatment with simultaneous overexpression of SRXN1 significantly increased OGD/R-AS activity and reduced apoptosis; however, TPS treatment with simultaneous overexpression of SRXN1 and miR-375 resulted in no significant difference in cell viability and apoptosis rate compared with the control group.

Thus, the properly designed manufacturing processes, as well as properly controlled process parameters enable controlling properties of the final composite material. This paper presents the investigation of the effect of the initial manufacturing parameters on the structure and properties of the precursor polyacrylonitrile fibers containing two types of bioglass. By using a bioactive silicate modifier during the fibers spinning process, carbon biomaterials with modified properties can be obtained. Therefore, the incorporation of modifiers containing calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) into the carbon fibers matrix could contribute to the increase of its compatibility with the surrounding bone tissue. The significant part of the investigation concerned the application of the drawing distribution during the fibers spinning process. It is already known that the proper value of the total draw parameter allows obtaining fibers that are characterized by optimal specific strength values. The resulting fibers have strength of 34–46 cN/tex and elongation at break of 9–14%; which supports its processing into nonwovens for further carbonization processes. Furthermore, the porous and macroscopic structure in relation to the sorption properties of the obtained fibers has been investigated.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Makrofol BL 2‐4 is an extrusion film based on Makrolon polycarbonate. It is different from Makrofol DE as it comprises excellent die‐cutting performance combined with high light transmission and moderate light scattering properties. It is a polymeric solid‐state nuclear track detector, which has many applications in various radiation detection fields. Samples from Makrofol BL sheets were irradiated using different electron beam doses ranging from 20 to 300 kGy. It is worth mentioning that this report is almost the first one dealing with this topic of material changes using Makrofol BL 2‐4. The resultant effect of electron beam irradiation on the properties of Makrofol has been investigated using X‐ray diffraction, intrinsic viscosity, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, refractive index, and color difference studies. The results indicate that the electron beam irradiation in the dose range 50–200 kGy led to the dominance of cross‐linking, enhancing the properties of Makrofol.",

    "abstract": "A ladder-like polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) has been synthesized by reacting pyromellitic acid anhydride (PMDA) with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), yielding the corresponding poly(amic acid) (PAA). The as-prepared PAA was converted to an imide-functionalized PSSQ by thermal treatment at 220°C. The material was characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C and 29Si solid-state magic angle nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential thermogravimetric analysis. The findings give evidence that a ladder-like PSSQ is formed when PMDA reacts with APTES in a molar ratio of 1:1. Kinetic studies of the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) reveal that PMDA/APTES (molar ratio = 1:1) is capable of adsorbing MB whereas PMDA/APTES (molar ratio = 1:2) shows almost no MB adsorption capacity.",

The surface modification technique was the current scenario; hence, the protein adsorption principle is used for coating of collagen onto the surface of PLA microspheres. The study was conducted in two steps: (1) Lapatinib drug loaded PLA microspheres were prepared and characterized and (2) the drug‐loaded PLA microspheres were dispersed in a collagen solution, yielding the modified microspheres. The surface morphology of the prepared PLA microspheres was verified by using a scanning electron microscope, and it is concluded that the microspheres are spherical in shape. The PLA microspheres are studied through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and through the differential scanning calorimetry–thermal gravimetric analysis technique it is observed that there is no interaction between polymer and the drug. The in vitro release study of modified PLA microspheres was conducted at pH 7.4, and the results indicated that the adsorption technique can be the simple strategy to coat collagen on the surface of polyester implants to develop the stealth implant in shorter time with low cost technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graft copolymer of sodium alginate (SA) with N ‐vinyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (N‐VP) was prepared using potassium persulphate (PPS) as an initiator. The effect of monomer content on the percentage of graft yield was investigated. It was observed that N‐vinylpyrrolidone (N‐VP) content has remarkable influence on the percentage graft yield. SA and their graft copolymer (SA‐ g ‐VP) beads were prepared in various formulations using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a cross‐linking agent and acebutolol hydrochloride (ABHCl) as a model drug. Beads were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Chemical stability of ABHCl after encapsulation into beads was confirmed by FT‐IR analysis. Preparation conditions of the SA‐ g ‐N‐VP beads were optimized by considering the percentage entrapment efficiency, particle size, swelling capacity, and their release data. In vitro release studies of different formulations were performed at 37°C in an intestinal fluid atmosphere (pH 7.4). The effect of graft copolymer, cross‐linker and drug concentrations on the release of ABHCl was discussed. It was observed that ABHCl release from the beads increased with the increasing N‐VP upto 30%, and then decreases beyond this concentration. It was also observed that, as GA and ABHCl concentration increases, rate of drug release decreases. The highest ABHCl release upto 12 h was obtained is 98.5%% for beads cross‐linked with 0.5 mL GA containing 10% monomer and 10% ABHCl. From these studies, it was observed that SA on grafting with N‐VP showed variation in drug release profiles. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The mechanical properties of the rubber vulcanizate were measured and found to be affected by the blooming of the accelerator on the rubber surface, which also damaged the internal structure of the rubber. Below the melting point of the accelerator there was little or no reagglomeration and some migration of the accelerator, whereas above the melting point there were reagglomeration and extensive migration of the accelerator to the rubber surface.

The membrane was prepared by phase‐inversion process from casting solution containing PS polymer, dichloromethane solvent, and antioxidant MBEP as an additive. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (2 wt% concentration) was added in the casting solution as pore former. The membrane was characterized in terms of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry, oxidative‐induction time test, mechanical measurements and cross‐flow filtration for milk concentration, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From TGA, it is noted that volatilization of MBEP started before its boiling point (198°C), indicating that the antioxidant has interacted with the PS, and the results indicate that highest residual weight percentage was obtained for higher weight percent antioxidant filled membrane substantiating its higher thermal stability. From SEM images, it is observed that as MBEP content gets higher dispersion of particles in the membrane, the matrix becomes more homogeneous. The other results revealed that the addition of antioxidant MBEP produced a membrane with higher thermal stability. The presence of additive also affects the surface roughness, membrane morphology, and mechanical strength. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Copper metallization formed a more compact morphology with fine pores, resulting in piling up the air within the ultrathin nanoporous layers. The mechanism of thermal insulation of laminated nanofiber web metallized with copper could be illustrated as following: As deposited on the nanofiber webs, copper reflects the heat from the body back and the air stacked within the nanofiber layers, preventing the emission of heat flux out of the fabric. It was clearly found that metallization could maintain the inside temperature more highly than nonmetallized material by ca. 1.0–1.5°C. The results obtained from this study suggested the wide applications of metallization to protective and energy‐saving products such as garments, filters, and interior materials. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The structure and morphologies of the PMMA‐ g ‐PVA/Ag nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The complexation between Ag + and PVA and even PMMA, as well as the establishment of inter‐ and intramolecular attractions between polymer matrices, played an important role in the insertion and reduction of Ag + particles. XRD results showed all relevant Bragg's diffractions for the crystal structure of Ag + nanoparticles, and transmission electron microscopy findings showed well‐defined spherical morphologies. UV–vis studies apparently showed the characteristic surface plasmon band of Ag nanoparticles within the polymer matrices at 390–400 nm. The resistance responsiveness of the film samples to various organic vapors was investigated, and the responsive magnitude depends on the type and strength of an interaction produced by each solvent vapor on the material. The response dependence on initial resistances of the film samples was explored in the case of ether vapor. The response mechanism of the PMMA‐ g ‐PVA/Ag films to solvent vapors was explained on the basis of a swelling theory and an interaction between solvent vapor molecules and nanocomposites. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The heterogeneous catalyst gave moderate yields, whereas the reaction catalyzed by a homogeneous catalyst did not occur. The amount of carboxyl groups in the structure of MPS and unreacted carboxyl groups in the structure of the esterified MPS (EMPS) was found by using a chemical titration method for the determination of esterification yield. Some important reaction parameters were assigned to optimize the esterification process. FT‐IR, 1 H NMR, and thermogravimetric studies indicate that the esterification reaction was successfully realized for each alcohol in the presence of the heterogeneous catalyst. The results demonstrated that both the acylation reaction and esterification reaction can be carried out to obtain a significantly functionalized polymer. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The network consists of sigmoid hidden units and a linear output unit arranged in a feed forward backpropagation architecture. An optimal design is accomplished for 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 hidden neurons on a hidden layer with five different algorithms involving batch gradient descent, batch variable learning rate, resilient back propagation, scaled conjugate gradient, and Levenberg–Marquardt. The training data for ANN are obtained from experimental measurements. There were 22 inputs and three tristimulus color values L *, a *, and b * were used as an output layer. Statistical analysis in terms of root‐mean‐squared, an absolute fraction of variance ( R 2 ), as well as a mean square error is used to investigate the performance of ANN. The best result in terms of statistics is presented by the LM algorithm with 14 neurons in the designed ANN model. The degree of accuracy of the ANN model in reduction of errors is proven acceptable in all statistical analysis and shown in results. However, it was concluded that ANN provides a possible method in error reduction in specific color tristimulus values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Differential scanning calorimetry results demonstrated that although the thermal characteristics of the amorphous phase were unaffected by the fiber‐spinning process, the melting and crystallization behavior of the blends was altered by the elongation flow imposed during the melt spinning. The viscoelastic behavior of the PTT/PET blends was also studied by a steady shear rate and dynamic sweep rheological experiments before and after the spinning process. The induced morphology and crystallization reordering resulting from the fibrillation process are shown to have a remarkable effect on the complex viscosity profile of the PTT/PET fibers, particularly in the blend containing 30 wt% PET.

The isothermal heat flow against time was recorded for all formulations and the kinetic parameters were noted. It was observed that the rate of maximum polymerization as well as peak maximum time showed a general trend. However, the ultimate conversion as well as the conversion at maximum rate did not show any trend due to diffusional restrictions imparted by the increase in viscosity with conversion.

Different nano‐BSTZ contents were mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form the PVDF/nano‐BSTZ composites. The PVDF/nano‐BSTZ composite films were formed by using the nonvacuum screen printing method on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, and their thickness was approximately 2 μm. As the nano‐BSTZ content increased from 10 to 50 wt%, the specific capacitance of the PVDF/nano‐BSTZ composite films really increased. Three different mixing rules were used to predict the effective dielectric constants of the PVDF/nano‐BSTZ composite films, and the Bruggeman's effective medium approximation and the Lichtenecker logarithmic mixing rules fitted the measured results. For the printed PVDF/nano‐BSTZ composite films, the dielectric constants also decreased with increasing measured frequency and the loss tangents were all less than 5%.",

    "abstract": "Designing targeted-delivering and stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an appealing method, especially, targeting delivery of photosensitizers to mitochondria as the most sensitive cellular organelles to reactive oxygen species (ROS) could significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. In this study, we synthesized triphenylphosphonium bonded PEG-NH2 (TPP-PEG-NH2) and bridged to chlorin e6 (Ce6) via thioketal (TK) linkage to obtain red light-triggered, amphiphilic copolymer (TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6), which could self-assemble into micelles with an average size of 160 nm and zeta potential of +20.1 mV. The in vitro release behavior of TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6 nanocarriers showed a light-activated way and was dependent on the H2O2 concentration. TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6 nanocarriers exhibited high cytotoxicity against C6 cells with illumination. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observation indicated that TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6 nanocarriers were efficiently internalized into the mitochondrion of C6 cells, released Ce6 via light activated. By contrast, in the case of TPP-PEG-NH2 directly bonded Ce6 (TPP-PEG-Ce6) nanocarriers, little Ce6 was found in the mitochondrion. The stronger fluorescence in the mitochondrion of TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6 nanocarriers originated from the mitochondrial-targeting capability of TPP and the cleavage of TK linkages activated by light irradiation, which greatly improved the cellular uptake of TPP-PEG-TK-Ce6 nanocarriers and released more Ce6 in the mitochondrion. This work provided a facile strategy to improve PDT efficacy.",

    "abstract": "In this study, polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber (PAN HF) membranes were designed and fabricated with desired morphology and permeability for low pressure-driven applications via the dry-wet phase-inversion spinning process. The effects of multiple design and fabrication parameters on permeation, morphology, thickness, and pore size of membranes were investigated using various techniques. Moreover, the effects of water as the nonsolvent additive, chemical composition of the bore solution, dope solution flow rate, air gap, coagulation bath temperature, and tensile ratio (take-up speed) were investigated. The addition of 3% wt. water as the nonsolvent additive into the dope solution resulted in a seventeen-times increment in the water flux up to 495 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. It showed a significant improvement in membrane porosity compared with those prepared without water nonsolvent additive. Utilization of 90% wt. of the solvent in water solution as the bore solution instead of pure water showed the most significant effect on the water flux and membrane structure among the fabrication parameters. It resulted in a reduction in threshold permeation pressure by more than ten times. The results revealed that whichever variation, including increased dope solution flow rate or coagulation bath temperature, or reduced air gap or traction, leads to promotion of membrane water flux. Still, different effects on the structure and morphology of the membranes were observed. Based on the outcomes of this study and according to the SEM images, one can conclude that outer surface pore size reduction from about 300 nm resulted in decreased water flux from 448 to 226 L m-2 h-1 bar-1, so that no pores were observed in the outer surface until 50 K magnification of the SEM image. The findings in this study provide instructive guidelines for the design and fabrication of high-performance hydrophilic PAN-based hollow fiber membranes with the desired morphology and water flux. Best ranges of investigated parameters for relatively high permeate water flux and desired membrane morphology were reported.",

Moderate prepolymerization time reduced the fine fraction while increasing polymerization rate and isotacticity. Appropriate prepolymerization technique can increase mass transfer performance and fragmentation, which is a promising way to improve polymerization rate, isotacticity index, and fine fraction. Otherwise, insufficient prepolymerization or excessive prepolymerization causes prepolymer particle fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "The widespread discourse on the circular economy has fueled a growing demand for polymeric materials characterized by mechanical robustness, sustainability, renewability, and the ability to mend defects. Such materials can be crafted using dynamic covalent bonds, albeit rarely or more efficiently through noncovalent interactions. Metal–ligand interactions, commonly employed by living organisms to adapt to environmental changes, play a pivotal role in this endeavor. Metallosupramolecular polymers (MSPs), formed through the incorporation of metal–ligand interactions, present a versatile platform for tailoring physicochemical properties. This review explores recent advancements in MSPs achieved through the assembly of (macro)monomers via reversible metal–ligand interactions. Various strategies and pathways for synthesizing these materials are discussed, along with their resulting properties. The review delves into the stimuli-responsive behavior of coordination metal–ligand polymers, shedding light on the impact of the core employed in MSPs. Additionally, it examines the influence of parameters such as solvent choice and counter-ions on the supramolecular assemblies. The ability of these materials to adapt their properties in response to changing environmental conditions challenges the traditional goal of creating stable materials, marking a paradigm shift in material design.",

Modification of bitumen with a copolymer of ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate leads to an improvement in the properties of road bitumen: the softening point, hardness, deformability at low temperatures, elasticity, and adhesion to metal and mineral filler increase. It was shown that ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate chemically interacts with the functional groups of bitumen asphaltenes through the epoxy group of glycidyl methacrylate. Analysis of the spectra and group composition indicates an increased content of high molecular weight asphaltenes in the modified bitumen with a slight increase in structuring resins. It has been established that bitumen modified with rubber crumbs of 0.6–1.0 mm in size has high elasticity. The most effective composition of a bitumen-regenerated composite material based on tire reclaim has been determined. In terms of the totality of physicochemical and operational characteristics and comparative cost, the most acceptable is the bitumen-regenerated composition (with a regenerate content of 20%) and is superior in the complex of properties to bitumen modified with an optimal content of ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate (1.6%). The technology for modifying bitumen with tire reclaim is less time-consuming, more economically profitable, and environmentally effective, since it utilizes large-tonnage waste of worn-out tires. The resulting bitumen-polymer compositions have a high positive set of properties: softening point, hardness, elasticity, frost resistance, and low-temperature characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In this study, zinc ferrite nanoparticles (ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs) were incorporated into a polycarbonate/polyethylene oxide (PC/PEO) blend using the casting method. The resulting blends were subjected to comprehensive analysis using various techniques. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the presence of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles had a significant impact on the crystal structure of the PC/PEO blend, leading to a reduction in crystallinity. Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) measurements further confirmed the uniform distribution and compatibility of PC and PEO as polymer components, as well as their compatibility with the blend containing ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs. The optical properties of the PC/PEO blend, including band gap and Urbach energy, were quantified using the Kubelka–Munk method. The incorporation of ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs resulted in the formation of sub‐band states between the valence and conduction bands, leading to a decrease in the band gap values. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis revealed a noticeable modification in the surface roughness, with the addition of ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs resulting in a smoother surface texture. The electrical properties of the blends, including dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and AC conductivity, were measured. The addition of ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs increased the dielectric constant ( ε ′) at lower frequencies, while it remained relatively stable at higher frequencies due to the localized charge carriers within the polymer blend. The higher values of ε ’ observed at lower frequencies can be attributed to the movement of ions, which contributes to enhanced ionic conductivity. The magnetic properties of the blends were evaluated, demonstrating an increase in magnetic saturation upon the addition of ZnFe 2 O 4 NPs. These findings provide valuable insights into the structural, optical, electrical, and magnetic characteristics of PC/PEO blends incorporated with ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, thereby highlighting their potential for a wide range of technological applications.",

This research focuses on creating novel hybrid composites using untreated and treated rattan and date palm fibers. Fibers were treated with 3%, 4%, and 5% NaOH solutions. Fiber diameters were measured microscopically. The NaOH treatment enhanced the tensile strength of the fibers. Untreated rattan, midrib, and spadix stem fibers exhibited tensile strengths of 18, 57, and 37 MPa, respectively. Polyester was used as the matrix, combined with fibers in weight fractions of 70 : 30, 75 : 25, and 80 : 20. All composites were made for 1 : 1 rattan–midrib and 1 : 1 rattan–spadix stem fibers. Composites containing 20% treated rattan–midrib fibers displayed the highest tensile and flexural strengths, measuring 13 and 39 MPa, respectively. Meanwhile, rattan–spadix stem composites achieved the highest tensile strength of 14 MPa at 30% treated fiber loading, and the highest flexural strength of 28.91 MPa at 20% fiber wt.%. Additionally, SEM images of the tensile fracture surfaces revealed voids, cracks, and impurities.

    "abstract": "To achieve sustainable and energy‐efficient CO 2 capture processes, it is imperative to develop membranes that possess both high CO 2 permeability and selectivity. One promising approach involves integrating high‐aspect‐ratio nanoscale fillers into polymer matrices. The high‐aspect‐ratio fillers increase surface area and improve interactions between polymer chains and gas molecules passing through the membrane. This study focuses on the integration of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with an impressive aspect ratio of around 12 into rubbery polymers containing polyethylene oxide (PEO), namely PEBAX MH 1657 (poly[ether‐block‐amide] [PEBA]) and polyurethane (PU), to fabricate mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs). By exploiting the interfacial interactions between the polymer matrix and CNC nanofillers, combined with the surface functionalities of CNC nanofillers, the rapid and selective CO 2 transport is facilitated, even at low filler concentrations. This unique feature enables the development of thin‐film composites (TFCs) with a selective layer around 1 μm. Notably, even at a filling ratio as low as 1 weight percent, the resulting membranes exhibit remarkable CO 2 permeability (&gt;90 Barrer) and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (&gt;70). These findings highlight the potential of integrating CNCs into rubbery polymers as a promising strategy for the design and fabrication of highly efficient CO 2 capture membranes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A rheological technique of determining molecular weight distribution (MWD) of ultra high MFR polypropylene (PP) is presented. The development of this new technique was needed for two reasons. First, the advent of high activity catalyst made possible the direct polymerization and thus the commercialization of very high MFR PP. Secondly, the polydispersity index (PI) measurement based on crossover modulus from G′ and G″ curves, which was developed by Zeichner and Patel in 1981, was proven to be inapplicable to resins with MFR higher than about 40, due to instrument limitations. This new technique utilizes G′ and G″ data at low frequencies which are obtained from a dynamic frequency sweep test at 200°C. PI values, a measure of MWD, determined by this method are proven to have an excellent correlation with those obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). This method has been very useful in determining MWD of melt brown fiber resins whose MFR is normally between 30 and 1000. It has also been used as a quality control tool during the resin production in a commercial plant. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of monomeric material transport in reactive extrusion revealed that two different situations can be distinguished in the partially filled zone of a twin-screw extruder. Material is transported from the bottom of the barrel to the top of the screw by drag or material remains on the bottom of the channel because of gravity. Which process takes place can be predicted when the ratio between the Froude number (gravitation forces) and the Reynolds number (viscous forces) is known. From experiments in a perspex model of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, using glycerol and silicone oil as model fluids, it could be observed which situation can be expected at different filling degrees, screw speeds, throughputs, and viscosities. In the case of a constant filling degree, material moves up with the screw flight at a certain value of Fr/Re. At higher Fr/Re ratios, a larger filling degree is needed for the screws to drag material up with the screw flights. When the filling degree reaches one-half, material moves up with both the pushing and the pulling screw flight. On the basis of these observations, a model is proposed to determine the backflow in the partially filled zone of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, dependent on viscosity and screw speed. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The analysis was carried out for a pressure flow situation through a wide rectangular channel. Homogeneous blends were simulated by a model consisting of a large number of alternating layers of A and B components parallel to the flow direction using the adhering layers concept. Heterogeneous blends were simulated by similar alternating layers separated by very thin interlayers. In modeling the negative deviation behavior, associated with the flow characteristics of immiscible blends, the interlayers were assumed to have a viscosity more than one order of magnitude lower than either component. Viscosity values for the interlayers higher than both polymers were used, on the other hand, to represent positive deviation behavior, which is synonymous with the flow behavior of compatibilized blends. To test the accuracy of the model, the computed viscosity results were compared with the values calculated by the more widely quoted equations and also with published experimental data. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "The correlation of insufficient gas penetration and gas permeation to structural performance in gas-assisted injection-molded polystyrene parts, designed with gas channels having five different types of cross sections but with the same section area, was investigated via tensile experiments and bending tests. Test results were also compared with those of standard injection-molded parts. Based on the measured results, it was found that for specimens with insufficient gas penetration, under tensile test and bending test the breaking region occurred in the neighborhood of the gas front tip near the gas entrance. This indicates that the effect of the hollow core developed by the gas, resulting in reduction of the cross-sectional area, is larger than the effect of stress concentration or residual stress at the gas front tip. In tensile tests, it is evident that gas permeation and insufficient gas penetration show significant influence on the tensile properties of parts, lowering the ultimate tensile strength. Moreover, in bending tests, the stress concentration or residual stress occurring at the gas front tip of insufficient gas penetration and the surrounding area of gas permeation shows less significant influence on part bending properties. At the same time, the cross-sectional geometry plays an important role in determining bending properties. The present investigation provides part designers design guidelines for understanding the correlation of insufficient gas penetration and gas permeation to structural performance of gas-assisted injection-molded parts. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, the effect of a liquid stabilizer based on organotins on PVC heat stability is investigated. Control and films with tin soap heat stabilizer Sn500K were prepared by solvent casting and they were heated at 160 and 180°C for different time periods. X‐ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that tin was present in Sn500K and it was lead‐free. DSC analysis showed that glass‐transition temperature of films with Sn500K increased from 67 to 75–85°C by heating for 15 min at 180°C. IR spectroscopy indicated that concentration of carboxylate groups of Sn500K decreased with heating. Films with Sn500K did not degrade for short heating periods; however, degradation occurred in long heating times. Low concentration of Sn500K was recommended, since at high levels incompatibility with PVC and acceleration of degradation was observed. In the high temperature range, control and stabilized samples degraded in the same manner in two steps. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 21: 65–73, 2002; DOI 10.1002/adv.10008",

In the first situation, our interest is focused on the influence of the shear‐thinning nature of the melt onto the 3‐dimensional temperature pattern inside the contraction. In particular, the mechanism of creation of hot spots is shown in the small channel. In the second situation, the influence of the yield stress on the flow pattern is studied.

The same model predicted the glass transition and onset temperature of samples postcured to a glass transition temperature of 287°C. The mathematical model resulted from a kinetic rate law treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel vibration internal mixer was used to prepare polypropylene/ultra high molecular weight polyethylene PP/UHMWPE blends with two additional adjustable processing parameters (vibration frequency and vibration amplitude) as compared with those prepared in the steady mode. Microscopy, mechanical tests, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that vibration influenced the blend morphology and the product properties. The good phase homogeneity of the blends might be due to the variation of shear rate either spatially or temporally in blending. Additionally, the vibration internal mixer could be used to analyze the dependency of viscosity on the shear rate. Vibration enhanced the interpenetration of UHMWPE into PP and vice versa. Subsequently, the formed crystals of two components were connected, and there was epitaxy between PP and UHMWPE crystals. Moreover, the crystalline aggregates, with the amorphous UHMWPE, formed a complex network‐like continuous structure, which improved the elongation ratio at the break and the yield strength. The higher the vibration frequency and/or the larger the vibration amplitude at a fixed average rotation speed of the mixer, the more significant these effects were. The larger amount of the connected crystals, especially of β form of PP in the bulk α form PP as well as with the continuous phase structure, led to a higher tensile properties of PP/UHMWPE vibration blended. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The system follows ideal radical kinetics and the kinetic equation for the system is R p ∝ [ p ‐ABTAY] 0.5 [Sty][VA].

The Extensive Simplex Method is shown to provide reasonable decision support for process optimization based on a linear process model derived from a main effects design of experiments.

In such products, not only very good electrical insulation properties but also high mechanical and thermal performance are required. In order to achieve these, a suitable manufacturing process has to be established. Therefore, the use of optimal process parameters, such as mold temperature, filling time, filling velocity, initial temperature of internal parts, gelation time, as well as appropriate product design is key factors for better quality components derived from minimized shrinkage and crack avoidance. The simulation approach for analyzing the filling and curing stages of reactive molding manufacturing processes has been successfully utilized for some time, providing useful information about thermal conditions during the production.

Then, the reclaimed rubber was subjected to further mechanical shearing using a two-roll mill, rubber extruder, and rubber strainer. The effects of the storage time at room temperature on the properties and structure of reclaimed rubber were examined by sol fraction measurement, Mooney viscosity measurement, crosslink density measurement, tensile property testing, and Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA) measurement. The results under the test conditions indicated that different postprocessing operations were not making much difference to the properties of the reclaimed rubber. But the effect of storage time is more significant; the Mooney viscosity value increased from 65 to 90 when the storage period increases to 60 days, the sol fraction decreased, and the crosslink and density storage modulus also increased with increasing storage time due to the slow recombination and aggregation of the molecular fragments with free radicals happening in the reclaimed rubber during the storage.",

This article focuses on the basic characterizations and properties of acrylonitrile-chloroprene rubber. Qualitative analyses through infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra confirm the presence of both the -Cl and -CN groups in the new rubber. As evidenced through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), the single glass transition temperature of acrylonitrile-chloroprene rubber reflects its monophasic random microstructure. While compared against commercial grades of chloroprene rubber (CR) and nitrile rubber (NBR), the new rubber provides a distinctive combination of properties that are not available with either of the elastomer alone. Acrylonitrile-chloroprene rubber demonstrates slightly lower specific gravity, an improved low-temperature compression set, higher flex-fatigue resistance, and lower volume swelling in IRM 903 and Fuel C to chloroprene rubber. As compared to nitrile rubber, the new copolymer shows appreciably better heat aging and ozone resistance. Good abrasion resistance, low heat buildup, and remarkably high flex-fatigue resistance indicate excellent durability of the acrylonitrile-chloroprene rubber under dynamic loading. Based on the preliminary results, it is apparent that the new copolymer can be a candidate elastomer for various industrial applications which demand good fluid resistance, high heat and low-temperature tolerances, good weatherability, and durability under static and dynamic conditions.",

The concentration of β-CDs with respect to the POM was varied from 0 to 50 wt.%. The effect of β-CDs content on the morphology of POM/β-CD composite microfiber was investigated. The results showed that the introduction of β-CDs reduced the surface roughness and porosity of the microfibers, and the morphology of the fibers was changed.

By comparing the localization of OMMT in a single‐layered nanocomposite with that in the multilayered nanocomposites, as well as by theoretically calculating wetting coefficients of the multilayered nanocomposites, the migration mechanism of OMMT was revealed. As demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ), transmission rate measurement and tensile test, the selective localization of OMMT in the multilayered nanocomposites could increase crystallinity degree of the two‐polymer components, enhancing oxygen barrier property and tensile strength of the nanocomposties.",

The objective of this work is to trace the droplet deformation via conducting fiber spinning process. In this regard, two types of polymer blends Polypropylene ( PP )/Polyamide6 ( PA 6) and Polypropylene/Polytrimethylene terephthalate ( PTT ) with various ratios (99/1, 94/6, 90/10, and 80/20) were melt‐blended on co‐rotating twin screw extruder and thereafter, were spun. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images represent a droplet and fibrillar morphologies for as‐extruded samples and spun blend fibers respectively. Unlike PA 6 as dispersed phase, PTT droplets in PP / PTT blend system shows improved spinnability. Linear melt viscoelastic data were gathered by performing rheological approaches in linear region. Conducting frequency sweep at 240°C is revealed a terminal behavior for Gʹ and a Newtonian plateau for η* at low frequencies. However, at 195°C dynamic rheological data pertinent to fibers represent a non‐terminal trend for Gʹ and viscosity upturn at low frequencies respectively. These distinguishable characteristics can be considered as spinnability of droplets which reflect fibrillation mechanism, and fibrillar growth can be followed by scanning the viscoelastic responses at low frequency region which enhanced upon fibril growth. According to SEM and rheological test results, PTT , as an engineering plastics, manifests higher capability of forming nano fibrils.",

Chopped fibers of length 3–5 mm were used for the extrusion followed by injection molding, whereas long‐length fibers (~100 mm) were used for compression molding process. For compression molding, long‐length fibers were spread in single and double layers. The interfacial shear strength of the composites was evaluated by fiber pull‐out testing. Composites were characterized for fracture behavior and mechanical properties. Additionally, surface morphology was also observed by scanning electron microscopy, whereas crystalline properties were evaluated by X‐ray diffraction analysis. Analyses revealed that compression molding with double layers of long‐length fibers reinforcement showed better properties than other samples. Tensile strengths of extruded and compression processed samples (double‐layered) were 75.5 and 81.1 MPa, which are approximately 33% and 44% higher respectively than neat PLA (56.5 MPa). The crack generation of PLA during applied load was observed and found eliminated for the double‐layered sample processed via compression molding. It was found that compression molding with double layer can be considered as easy and less time‐consuming method for composite preparation, with nearly 8 wt.% of less fiber consumption compared with extrusion/injection molding.",

The microstructure and crystallization behavior of the PVDF / T ‐ Z n O w were analyzed by SEM, FT‐IR and XRD. Thermal stability and electrical properties of the composites, included the dielectric constant, dielectric loss and electrical breakdown strength, were tested. Analysis on microstructures indicated that the T ‐ Z n O w in composites were uniformly dispersed and some of the whisker's tips had penetrated through the surface of the composites because of the special four‐needle structure. Experimental results showed that the addition of T ‐ Z n O w significantly improved the thermal stability of the composites. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy test results showed that the dielectric properties and conductivity of the composites significantly improved with the increase in T‐ZnO w contents. The dielectric constant of the composites was 113 at 100 Hz when the T ‐ Z n O w content was 20% at weight content.",

The strain–stress characteristics were determined in the cyclic tensile tests, at a fixed stress or deformation level. Experiments showed that cyclic loading causes some changes in structure and mechanical properties of polypropylene samples. Smaller total strain of samples and increase in Young's modulus after each consecutive ten cycles of loading were observed as the result of loading at a fixed stress level. In experiments carried out at the fixed strain level, the width of the loop decreases with the increase in number of cycles that indicates the material strengthening. Microscopic examinations showed the change in the structure of injection‐molded parts after cyclic loading. The transient zone, occurring in the area of high shear stress between the core and the skin, became significantly wider for cyclically loaded parts. Phase changes in the part structure were investigated using WAXS method. Samples exhibited the difference in the content of polypropylene polymorphic modifications between the core and skin layers. In the skin, both for nonloaded and loaded parts, the presence of β‐phase was confirmed, whereas this phase did not occur in the core. The investigation by DSC method demonstrated a small change in the degree of crystallinity in the sample core after 4,000 cycles of loading, while in the skin layer, the degree of crystallinity was reduced by about 2% when compared to the value obtained for samples after one loading cycle.",

Morphology was tailored for favorable impact strength through changing viscosity ratio (λ) and interfacial tension (γ 12 ). For uncompatibilized blends, λ decreased and γ 12 increased with increasing Novatein water content, whereas compatibilizers caused a decrease in both λ and γ 12 . PBAT continuity was high when uncompatibilized, but dispersion improved with decreasing λ and increasing γ 12 . The dispersed domain size decreased in all compatibilized blends; PBAT continuity was lowest in samples with the smallest λ. Compatibilized blends had higher impact strength than Novatein and uncompatibilized blends through improved interfacial adhesion, smaller domain size, and increased dispersion. By altering λ and γ 12 , and with appropriate chemical interaction, a morphology can be created for improved impact strength. Increasing PBAT content showed further increases in impact strength; however, a cocontinuous morphology formed, demonstrating that composition can override the effect of λ and γ 12 .",

The inherent viscosity of the polymer is very high ranging between 1.6 and 2.9 dL/g. Differential scanning calorimetry spectrum shows T g for soft and T m for hard segment as expected for crystalline copolymer. The products are semicrystalline materials with a crystallization window of 3–9°C. Depending on the amide concentration in the copolymer, the hard segments melting temperature ranged between 149 and 275°C. Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) results show that the degree of crystallinity of the hard segment in the copolymer is very high, that is up to 97%. Temperature‐dependent FT‐IR shows that crystallinity is highly reversible with respect to temperature. Wide angle X‐ray scattering data also confirm that the materials are semicrystalline in nature. The solvent resistivity of these materials is extremely high even at a low concentration of (3%) amide content. The entire polymer shows low water absorption, depending on the concentration of amide segments.",

A solvent evaporation technique was adopted for microcapsules preparation using Eudragit RS 100 as a retardant polymer. The microcapsules were found free flowing, whitish, and spherical in shape. The entrapment efficacies of microcapsules were 95.73, 85.67, and 84% for F1 (1:1), F2 (1:2), and F3 (1:3), respectively. The particle size was in the range of 12 ± 2.48 to 32 ± 2.20 μm. The X‐ray diffraction and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) studies of prepared microcapsules illustrated that there was no interaction between drug and polymer.

The time for half‐life of capsule filled microcapsules was 15.54, 17.40, and 20.08 h, respectively.

Cured resins showed endothermic transition at about 229–248°C, which supplemented decomposition reactions. Cured resins are thermally stable up to about 200–230°C and followed two‐step decomposition reactions. A 34–56% residue at 600°C supplemented the formation of highly thermally stable cross‐linked products. Glass composites showed 133–153 MPa tensile strength, 223–290 MPa flexural strength, 7520–8015 MPa flexural modulus, 33–38 kg m −2 impact strength, 37–40 Barcol hardness, 8.3–12.3 kV mm −1 electric strength, 8.9 × 10 12 to 4.2 × 10 14 ohm cm volume resistivity, and 13–14% water absorption. Good thermal, mechanical and electrical properties and excellent hydrolytic stability of the glass composites signify their industrial importance for low load bearing housing, electrical, and marine applications.",

The pulping trials were carried out using MEA and MEA‐anthraquinone (MEA‐AQ) methods and the soda‐AQ process as reference. The operating conditions such as the composition of the cooking liquor, the maximum cooking temperature and the cooking time, and a solid/liquor ratio during the pulping process were investigated systematically to establish optimal pulping conditions. The optimum cooking conditions for MEA pulping were 75% MEA concentration, 90‐min cooking time, 160°C cooking temperature, 0.1% AQ, and liquor/kenaf ratio of 4/1. The laboratory‐scale experimental results indicated that this pulping process is particularly well suited for the pulping of kenaf, where the whole stem was delignified to a low kappa number value of 19.8 and the pulp yield of 55.1%. This newly developed pulping process provided a high tensile, tear, and burst indices of 19.8 N·m/g, 5.9 mN·m 2 /g, and 1.43 kPa·m 2 /g, respectively. In addition, MEA‐AQ kenaf whole‐stem pulp showed superior mechanical properties in comparison with MEA and soda‐AQ pulp. MEA‐AQ pulping is a good alternative to soda‐AQ pulping to produce high yield pulp with high strength from kenaf whole stem.",

An optimal design is accomplished for 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 hidden neurons with four different algorithms including gradient descent with momentum (GDM), resilient backpropagation (resilient backpropagation), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), and Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The best result in terms of statistics is presented by the LM algorithm with 16 neurons in the designed artificial neural network (ANN) model. The degree of accuracy of the ANN model is proven acceptable in all statistical analysis and shown in results. However, it was concluded that ANN provides a possible method for the prediction of specific color tristimulus values.",

The X‐ray diffraction signals also indicated that the basal plane spacing was increased to 3.5 nm in the composites irrespective of the filler type and volume fraction. The oxygen permeation in the case of Tixogel VZ decreased to 25% as compared to pure polymer at 6 wt% (2.13 vol%) filler, and an average aspect ratio of 100 was observed by the finite element permeation models. The Tixogel VP filler, on the other hand, had an excess of modification molecules on the surface and combined with the polarity mismatch (Hansen parameters) of the modification with the PU chains led to an increase in the oxygen permeation through the nanocomposite films.",

The results show that the introduced lanthanum nitrate shows a remarkably synergistic effect on MH in flame retardancy of PP. Compared with the unmodified MH‐filled PP FR system, the introduction of only 0.2 wt% La ions can remarkably enhance the limiting oxygen index value from 29.6 to 34.2 and the UL‐94 level from failure to V‐0, respectively. The cone calorimeter (CONE) parameter peak heat release rate is also obviously reduced from 187 to 155 kW m −2 . The reason for the remarkable improvement in the flame retardancy is that the introduced lanthanum nitrate improves the thermal stability, the char yield, and particularly the quality of the condensed charred layers of the FR PP/MH material significantly. The involved synergistically flame‐retarding mechanism of lanthanum nitrate exists in its excellent catalytic carbonization effect on the PP macromolecular chains.",

The effect of various parameters such as polymer concentration, applied voltage, and flow rate on the electrospinning process, morphology, and diameter of the resultant fibers was investigated. The findings indicate that increasing the concentration and flow rate of the solution increases the fiber diameter. It was also demonstrated that increasing the applied voltage decreases the fiber diameter. Mechanical property evaluation of the scaffolds showed that the strength of the scaffold depends on both the diameter and morphology of the fibers.

Nanocomposite fabrics were produced via a simultaneous draw‐texturing process followed by weft knitting. The fabric samples were examined in terms of thermophysiological comfort, tribological performance, and the resistance against structural degradation under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The abrasion resistance was improved by enhancement of rupture work while decreasing the crystallinity. Improvement of more than 200% was recorded in fabric abrasion resistance upon using a sample containing the maximum content of nanoparticles (NPs). A remarkable improvement in resistance was recorded against structural degradation under UV irradiation for the UV‐irradiated polyethylene terephetalate (PET) nanocomposites as compared to UV‐irradiated monocomponent PET. The study of the effect of UV irradiation confirmed our recent finding about a UV‐induced solid‐state interaction mechanism in the case of PET nanocomposites as well as polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. Optimal comfortable characteristic was achieved upon using 5 wt% nanosilver masterbatch. At low environment temperatures, this sample has lower vapor permeability than monocomponent PET fabrics. By raising the temperature, the rate of improving the vapor permeability for the composite fabrics became markedly more than that of monocomponent fabrics. It is of great interest that these desirable changes in permeability can be achieved in the range of common environment temperatures (i.e. 15–35°C), which exactly meet the body requirements. Consequently, nanocomposite fabrics can smartly adapt the permeability requirements for the human body by changing the environment temperatures.",

The fracture morphology of the samples was evaluated by the multifractal, and the effect of GO dispersion on the mechanical properties and the thermal stability were discussed for the P(3HB‐ co ‐4HB) and the composites. It was found that the interlayer spacing of the GO increased due to the intercalation of the polymer into the GO platelets.

The complexation of selected heavy metal ions by the PTAP is strongly dependent on the pH of medium and the adsorption of all selected metal ions was more favorable at the pH 7.

The morphologies of synthesized microspheres were observed by SEM . Finally, the mechanical properties of nanocomposites were investigated in detail. The results suggest that: the nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized by in situ suspension copolymerization; both the dispersion of MWCNT s and interfacial adhesion between MWCNT s and matrix were improved; and the mechanical properties of nanocomposites were dramatically reinforced. The nanocomposites were prepared in one step without additional treatments of MWCNT s or copolymer matrix, which makes the method relatively efficient.",

A modified single fibre spinning device was firstly used to derive a novel generalised model, utilising process parameters (die diameter, throughput, and stretching relevant take-up pressures) and material properties (zero shear viscosity) to predict the diameter of polymeric fibres on the basis of four different polymers. Further evaluation of the resulting power law dependence was conducted on filaments produced via conventional melt spinning and meltblown processes. Fibres produced on the pilot machines showed close agreement with the model equation with only the need to adjust an easily calculable device dependent factor.

    "abstract": "The equibiaxial planar tension test is an important method for determining the mechanical properties of hyperplastic membranes, and it is also critical to designing an effective equibiaxial tension test rig to meet experimental accuracy requirements. However, any analysis addressing the accuracy of this test is not reported in the literature. In this paper, an equibiaxial planar tension apparatus is proposed for conducting single-corner-point tension tests on hyperelastic electroactive polymer (EAP) membranes. The experimental data were compared with those obtained from two-corner-point-fixed tension tests and fitted with nonlinear material models, and the model’s parameters were also evaluated. Finally, the widely-used finite element software ABAQUS was employed to simulate equibiaxial planar tension methods and investigate the impact of clamping mode and point number on test accuracy as well as the uniformity of overall deformation. The test results indicate that the stress-strain curves for the two tensions remain consistent across small stretch ratios. However, as the stretch ratio increases (about <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>λ</mi> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mn>2.25</mn> </math> ) in two-corner-point-fixed tension, stress shielding may lead to a degradation of strain uniformity and result in greater stresses than single-corner-point tension. Additionally, both the three-parameter Yeoh model and the four-parameter Ogden model can provide an accurate description of the EAP membrane material. The simulation results indicate that the axial strain variation amplitudes remain below 5% within a region spanning approximately 80% of the specimen’s overall length from its center to edge and even below 1% within a region spanning 85% in the single-corner-point tension; stress inaccuracies increase with stretch ratio, while the calculated error is about 2.1% when <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>λ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>4</mn> </math> in the single-corner-point tension test, which has the smallest stress error among the tests; when the number of tension points is increased, the overall deformation becomes more sufficient, and the test accuracy improves as well. The conclusions drawn from this paper will be beneficial in designing equibiaxial planar tension test rigs and analyzing their accuracy and uniformity of deformation.",

    "abstract": "Benzoxazine (BZ)-epoxy copolymers exhibit favorable mechanical properties, but their thermal and flame-retardant characteristics are impaired at high epoxy fractions. Here, we report a new type of sulfur-containing epoxy resin (EPS), which we synthesized using 4,4’-thiobisphenol (TBP) instead of bisphenol A (BA) and then blended with three sulfur-containing BZs (TBP-a, TBP-fa, and TBP-tma). The polymerization behavior of the resins was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry for determining the optimal curing procedure. This analysis revealed that the oxazine and epoxy rings undergo ring-opening and cross-linking reactions at the same time and that double-substituted structures originating from the furan and thiophene rings appeared during the curing process. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the addition of EPS increased the initial decomposition temperature by hindering the formation of double-substituted structures. The char yield at 800°C decreased owing to the unstable C–O–C–C–O groups derived from the ring-opening of EPS. To prepare the self-extinguishing copolymers with a char yield of 24%, a smaller quantity of BZ was needed for the EPS-based blends than for the BA-based ones. The heat release capacities—measured using micro-combustion calorimetry—of all copolymers except TBP-a/EPS were less than 300 J/g·K, demonstrating that the presence of thioether bonds and double-substituted structures resulted in excellent flame retardancy. The TBP-fa/EPS copolymer also exhibited excellent flame retardancy in cone calorimeter measurement. Finally, the glass transition temperature of the TBP-fa/EPS copolymer at a ratio of 5 : 5 (w/w) reached as high as 289°C. A TBP-fa/EPS copolymer with an epoxy content of 70% had nearly the same storage modulus (2,206 MPa) at 50°C as poly(BA-a) and thus similar mechanical properties. In summary, BZ-epoxy copolymers prepared from sulfur-containing epoxy combine the advantages of the constituent components and extend their areas of application.",

    "abstract": "Bone defects have recently surfaced as an important topic to discuss in orthopedic clinics, and as a result, they have captured the attention of the biomedical community as well as the general public. Because of their unique characteristics, such as high water content, softness, flexibility, and biocompatibility, hydrogels are gaining more and more traction in the field of tissue regeneration research within the medical industry. Intelligent biomaterials, like hydrogels, are much better than their predecessors because they can respond to new stimuli on multiple levels, such as the physical, chemical, and biological. Because they are sensitive to different outside cues, like shape in three dimensions and conditions between solid and liquid phases, they show certain traits. This indicates that they have the capability of developing into a more efficient material in the future, which would make them better suited to facilitate the localized repair of bone lesions. This article takes a look at hydrogels that alter their shape in response to the environment they are in. Some of the topics covered in this article include the classification of these materials, the concepts that underlie their synthesis, and the current state of research in this potentially fruitful field. This research was conducted with the intention of finding novel ways to treat severe bone defects.",

This study explored blends with a different initial composition of SF, SA, and water at 25°C and neutral pH. The influence of the proportion between mannuronic and guluronic acids on SA composition was investigated. After phase separation, two phases were identified, and the equilibrium data were fitted on three different thermodynamic models: Flory–Huggins, non-random two-liquids, and universal quasichemical. Cohn equation was also used to investigate the potential of SA to precipitate the SF in solution. The results show that the proportion of mannuronic and guluronic acids on the SA can significantly influence on equilibrium data and on the SF/SA interaction parameter, hence, becoming a variability factor if this parameter is not under control in formulations.",

These temperature variations result in nonhomogeneities that affect the quality of the final product. Although there have been numerous efforts aiming at the simulation of the flow in the channel of a single‐screw extruder, and the prediction of important flow quantities, there is hardly any published work in which the temperature distribution in the screw channel was actually measured. Such measurements, if available, would provide data by which computer simulations could be validated. In the present study, a fast‐response, cam‐driven thermocouple system was developed and used to measure the radial temperature distribution in the screw channel. The measurements are carried out on a well‐controlled, custom‐built, single‐screw extruder. Temperature profiles in the centerline of the screw channel were obtained for various operating conditions of the machine. The data obtained revealed interesting features of the flow as well as the dominant heat transfer mechanisms.

The preparation of the compatibilizer and the production of the blends were carried out on a twin‐screw extruder. Both types of compatibilizers acted as effective surfactants for the dispersion of the two polymers, at all weight ratios, and the blends exhibited a substantial increase in melt viscosity as a result of the addition of the compatibilizer. Only the coionomeric compatibilizers, however, produced substantial improvements in both tensile strength and elongation at break, irrespective of the ratio of the two polymers in the blends. This was attributed to the strong nucleating effects on the crystallization of the polymer components and to a strong interfacial adhesion between the two polymer phases. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The changes in the physical properties of three different commercial silicone sealants used in structural glazing applications were monitored as a function of various aging factors. The variables included, simultaneous exposure to ozone and moisture in which the pH of the moisture was maintained at discrete levels of 3 and 11. The extremes of the pH range represent recorded values for acid rain (pH = 3) and basic cleaning solutions (pH = 11), respectively. A second portion of the study involved studying the effect of loading on the sealant performance. The experimental coupons were cut from cast sheets of DC‐790, DC‐995, and DC‐983. An Instron tester was used to measure the changes in the engineering properties such as Young's modulus, relaxation time, and ultimate tensile stress of the test samples as a function of time of exposure to the different variables. Unexposed samples, kept at ambient laboratory conditions, were used as the control. Results of these tests indicate that the Young's modulus of the samples decreases during an initial period as a result of their exposure. After this initial decrease the sample moduli showed a steady increase with time. Surface cracking was observed during the initial period, even though the moduli continued to increase. Moreover, the acid and ozone appear to act synergistically in the deterioration of the sealant. Samples exposed to the higher pH level did not show this kind of behavior. The effect of tensile loading on the sealant was significant only for DC‐983, the high modulus formulation. This was perhaps because of the creation of high stress centers. The medium modulus material exhibited good resistance to the synergistic effects causing deterioration. Ozone resulted in discoloration, softening, and change in structure in the low modulus formulation. Although the ozone did not react aggressively with silicone, its slow attack or degradation should still be of concern. In spite of the use of inhibitors, severe and acute cracks appeared on the surface of the rubber material at angles of ninety degrees across the line of tension. It is hoped that these accelerated test results can lead to more informed decisions concerning silicone sealant life following their exposure to ozone and acid precipitation. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Also the elongation and the stress at break were very sensitive to the content of cross‐linking agent, mainly in the low concentration region (0 to 2%). PE and PS domains of about 1 μm circular cross sections were observed on a smoothed surface of a PE/PS blend. Smaller and uniformly dispersed domains were observed for all the IPN‐like systems. The crystallinity, measured by DSC and WAXS, and the IPN morphological features, appeared to be independent of the styrene cross‐linking content, viz., the content of DVB.

This theory describes the overall morphology of immiscible binary blends in terms of an interfacial area and its anisotropy, which has several advantages such as no limitations of flow type and applicability for any domain shapes and compositions. In this study, the classical algorithm has been adopted to find the pressure profile and the degree of fill along the screw axis for the modular-type twin-screw extruder. It is based on the screw characteristic curves to obtain a pressure gradient at a given flow rate and backward calculation of the pressure profile starting from the die. The partially filled region was also included to describe properly the morphology evolution. Considering the flow characteristics of this region, we assumed that the apparent shear rate was proportional to the degree of fill. The overall model predictions for the various operating conditions are compared with the experimental results. Therefore, it may be said that the new constitutive equation is useful to describe the morphology behavior not only for the twin-screw extruder but also for the other polymer processing equipment. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The first quantitative description of melting in single‐screw extruders was given by Tadmor around 1965. A simple analytical theory was developed for Newtonian fluids assuming the fluid viscosity to be unaffected by changes in temperature. Also, an approximate analytical theory was developed for a power‐law fluid assuming the power‐law constants to be independent of temperature and viscous dissipation to be negligible. Later workers extended the theory; however, most of these extensions did not allow closed‐form analytical solutions, thus requiring numerical techniques to obtain solutions. One of the most crucial assumptions in the analytical melting theory is the assumption that the viscosity of the polymer melt in the melt film is not affected by temperature differences in the melt film. This assumption has been eliminated in the improved melting theory by deriving and exact solution of the temperature and velocity profile in pure drag flow of a temperature‐dependent power‐law fluid between two parallel plates. It will be shown that the inclusion of the temperature dependence of the viscosity dramatically affects the predictions of the melting rate. It will further be shown how the new theory can be used to predict the optimum barrel temperature for melting.",

The density or specific volume of a polymer melt is determined by measuring the mass and volume flow rates of the melt. A positive displacement gear pump mounted on an extruder is used to measure the volume flow rate of the melt. In order to reduce the leakage across the gear pump, the difference between the upstream and downstream pressures is minimized by using a variable resistance die attached to the downstream outlet of the gear pump. The positive displacement volume of a gear pump was determined in calibration experiments with water and oil with the aid of a syringe pump. Two critical sets of experiments were carried out to measure the specific volumes of polystyrene and polypropylene as case examples.

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymerization of an acrylate derivative of bisphenol‐A by ionizing radiation in the presence of an organically modified montmorillonite was carried out in order to produce a flame‐retardant composite. The measurement of the thermal effect during irradiation indicates that radiation curing of pure resin and resin‐clay mixtures occurred in both cases. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed that a curing completion can be obtained by thermal curing after irradiation with a significant increase of the glass transition temperature. The morphology was investigated by X‐ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. These have indicated that gamma irradiation leads to the formation of a microcomposite structure after radiation curing. The flame resistant characteristics were studied by means of thermal gravimetric analysis under nitrogen and air and by cone calorimeter tests. In particular, thermal gravimetric analysis in air showed that the presence of the dispersed clay in the polymer matrix increases the oxidation temperature. This is attributed to the formation of a more stable char, due to a protective skin of clay aggregates that builds up on the surface of the volatilizing polymer matrix during thermal degradation which protects the charred polymer from reactions with oxygen. Finally, the cone calorimeter tests show a reduction of heat release of the clay‐polymer composite with respect to the neat resin. The contribution of the clay in reducing the rate of heat release is attributed to the dispersion of the filler that allows build‐up of an inorganic surface layer at a rate which is sufficient for effectively compete with the feeding of the flame with combustible pyrolysis products. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper reports a comparative study on the nanocomposites of poly(1‐naphthylamine) (PNA), having a fused aromatic ring, and its conductive nanocomposites with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The composites were prepared by two different methods: (a) dispersion of PNA in PVA and (b) in situ polymerization of PNA in PVC. These nanocomposites were characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy, TEM, stress, strain, and conductivity measurements. The variation in the nanostructured morphology of PNA particles in PVA as well as PVC matrix in the two cases resulted from the pronounced interaction of PNA with PVA through hydrogen bond, forming a homogeneous matrix that facilitates the formation of a self‐assembled network of PNA nanoparticles. In case of PNA/PVC composite, a discrete, agglomerate‐free distribution of PNA particles was obtained. The results revealed that an appropriate choice of synthesis conditions offers a possibility to improve not only the processability but also the pattern of distribution as well as the stability of PNA particles. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The UV curing of ultrathin films of acrylates on Al 2 O 3 particles has been studied by using photodifferential scanning calorimetry (photo‐DSC). Effects on curing of the chemical structure of the monomers, thickness of the films, type of initiators, and the presence of oxygen were investigated. Results show that photopolymerization of ultrathin films on the particle surface is much more sensitive to oxygen poisoning than the thick films on flat surfaces, and the conversion of monomers depends on the types of monomers and initiators selected. When alpha hydroxyl ketones (Esacure KIP100F) were used as photoinitiators, the final double‐bond conversions of both difunctional and trifunctional monomers can only reach up to 10% in the presence of air. The curing kinetics of monomers on particles in either air or nitrogen at the early stages of polymerization can be well fitted with calculations based on the quasi‐steady‐state assumption. Esacure 1001M, a sulfur‐containing benzophenone, has been used together with 2‐ethylhexyl‐4‐dimethylamino benzoate (Esacure EHA) as the initiating system to combat the oxygen‐poisoning effect. It was found that this system is much more effective than Esacure KIP100F in achieving high conversions of monomers in the presence of oxygen. This has been further demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Closed‐loop control of key process variables in injection molding has become an essential part of the quality assurance system. Advanced control algorithms such as adaptive control and model predictive control have been adopted to deal with the inherent process nonlinearity and time‐varying characteristics. These control algorithms are all focused on single‐cycle control performance. Recently, a multicycle, two‐dimensional model predictive learning control has been developed for batch process control. This method has been applied to injection molding. In this paper, the basic principles of these control algorithms are introduced, with the control performance demonstrated by injection velocity control. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Blood meal‐based thermoplastic protein (Novatein) was plasticized with up to 40 parts ethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, or tri(ethylene glycol) per hundred parts blood meal. The effect of plasticizers was investigated by relating the effect of equilibrium moisture content, phase separation, and protein secondary structure to the glass transition temperature and the mechanical properties. Plasticizers can diffuse through the polymer network and either be part of a protein‐rich phase where primary plasticization dominates or a plasticizer‐rich phase where secondary plasticization dominates. Equilibrium moisture content and added theoretical hydrogen bonding sites had the strongest correlation with the results. The point at which the equilibrium moisture content reached an equivalent moisture content ( POE ) to that of compositions without a plasticizer was found to be a critical point at which plasticization changes from primary to secondary, with a corresponding change in mechanical properties from brittle to ductile.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanocomposites based on layered silicates offer a remarkable potential in improving mechanical properties with filler loadings lower than 5%. For such polymer nanocomposites, it is important to improve intercalation and exfoliation of the silicate layers by finding the right balance between these effects. Previous works showed that intercalation and exfoliation can be influenced by the use of an additional, extensional flow which can be generated by hyperbolical dies used in the injection molding process. Since such hyperbolical dies account for high shear rates, additional pressure drop, and viscous dissipation, it is of high practical relevance to correctly predict the injection pressure needed. Besides conical geometries, hyperbolical die geometries are of importance due to their uniform elongational rate. Using hyperbolical dies having different diameters, D , and length‐to‐diameter L/D ratios, a full rheological characterization has been carried out for a polypropylene‐filled nanocomposite, and the experimental data have been fitted both with a viscous model (Cross) and a viscoelastic one (the Kaye—Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko or K‐BKZ/PSM model). Four injection molding dies have been also used to reach apparent shear rates up to 500,000 s −1 . Particular emphasis has been given on the pressure dependence of viscosity. It was found that only the viscoelastic simulations were capable of reproducing the experimental data well, while any viscous modeling always underestimates the pressures, especially at the higher apparent shear rates and L/D ratios.",

The sensors connected to an LCR meter were embedded in the compression mold and measured changes in the electrical properties of rubber during vulcanization. Frequencies ranging from 0.75 to 100 kH z were probed for capacitance and conductance, and 5 kH z frequency was found suitable for monitoring natural rubber vulcanization. The results show that capacitance during curing correlated with the time profile of torque from a moving die rheometer ( MDR ). The scorch time and optimum cure time obtained from MDR and RCMS were reported. The degree of cure and the cure rate from two methods were compared. Good correlations between the alternative methods were observed, supporting the potential of in situ RCMS during the vulcanization of natural rubber.",

Water‐soluble poly‐ NIPAM is synthesized as a diol and then copolymerized with PU . Structural investigations confirm that water‐soluble poly‐ NIPAM and hydrophilic PU are combined through PU links. In terms of physical properties, the films are confirmed to be water‐insoluble. Furthermore, based on the relationship between the water‐swelling ratio of the film and the water temperature, the films exhibit temperature‐sensitive hydrophilicity, with the water‐swelling ratio changing across the lower critical solution temperature ( LCST ). Moreover, the drying rate of the water‐absorbing film is different across the LCST . From these results, it is confirmed that a functional film with temperature‐dependent hydrophilicity is achieved. This property enables the poly‐ NIPAM / PU copolymerized films to be used as moisture‐permeable waterproof fabrics for sportswear.",

The flow characteristics of injected fluid are not known well due to the long distance displacement and complex pore structure. In this study, the tight reservoir samples are from typical tight oilfield of China and the oil distribution characteristics are studied based on mineral composition, physical properties and pore size distribution. The long core displacement experiment is conducted based on injection of water, N 2 , and CO 2 , which aims to study the individual flooding feasibility. The results show that the oil mainly distributes in the form of spots and accumulates in the micro/nano-pores. Both oil spots and clay minerals have associated characteristics. The microfractures are not the storage space for oil spots, but can connect the oil spots to improve the mobility of the crude oil. In addition, the oil can achieve long distance migration under the injection of water, N 2 , and CO 2 , which presents different pressure distribution characteristics. The reservoir pressure of water flooding decreases first and increases later with displacement time. The reservoir pressure of N 2 flooding rises gradually over displacement time. The reservoir pressure of CO 2 flooding increases first and decreases over displacement time. In contrast to water flooding, N 2 , and CO 2 can increase the reservoir energy, which contributes to tight oil production. In comparison, CO 2 has better performances than N 2 in terms of oil displacement efficiency. The study contributes to understanding the oil distribution characteristics and provides the guidance for field trials using different flooding techniques.",

By using the two principal component scores as a new index for clustering, it was concluded that long-term fertilization treatments in black soil in Harbin clustered into three groups of manure + NPK and organic manure treatments, NPK treatment, and soil without any fertilization. Manure + NPK fertilization and manure fertilization alone led to a higher degree of humification than NPK only or the control.

To reveal the relation between the mechanical properties of the composite and that of each individual component, finite element analysis (FEA) has usually been adopted.

By varying the substrate properties (i.e., Young’s modulus, viscoelasticity, and Poisson’s ratio), Young’s modulus, energy loss, and the viscoelastic model of the coating system were analysed, and how the mechanical properties of the substrate will affect the indentation response of the coating system was discussed.",

At present, the thermal conductivity of PCMs has two ways to improve: one is to fill the matrix with high thermal conductivity and the other is to fill nanoparticles. After combining the two methods, the choice of filled nano-SiO 2 , carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or graphene (GNPs) has different effects on the performance of carbon-based energy storage composites. Filling paraffin with foamed carbon increased the thermal conductivity of pure paraffin from 0.25 W/(m·K) to 8.3083 W/(m·K), an increase of 33.2 times. When the nanoparticle mass fraction is 5%, the enthalpy of GNP composites is 10 J·g -1 less than that of SiO 2 composites. Under the same mass fraction, compared with the thermal conductivity enhancement effect of SiO 2 composites, the thermal conductivity increase effects of CNTs and GNP composites are 6.7 and 15.8 times the thermal conductivity increase of SiO 2 composites, respectively. The comparison of theoretical and experimental values shows that different nanoparticle forms and dispersion modes have different effects on the performance of carbon-based energy storage composites, among which GNPs have the greatest improvement in the thermal conductivity of carbon-based composites.",

Orthogonal experiments indicated that the optimum synthesis reaction conditions for SGO-PS were as follows: the millimole ratio of chain transfer agent to initiator was 0.15 : 0.3, and the amount of styrene was 8 mL at 80°C for 12 hours. The products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal weightlessness analysis, and the highest grafting rate of SGO-PS was 62.46%. Then, PLA/SGO-PS nanocomposites were prepared using SGO-PS as fillers by melt intercalation method, and its crystallinity, mechanical properties, and thermal stability were significantly improved. Compared with pure PLA, the crystallinity of PLA/SGO-PS (0.3 wt%) nanocomposites was increased by 5 times. Multiple melting behavior tests showed that the introduction of SGO-PS caused the PLA molecular chain to be discharged into the unit cell in time, and the melting temperature shifted to a higher temperature, which ultimately made the grain structure of PLA composites more complete and stable than pure PLA. The rheological performance test showed that the uniform dispersion of SGO-PS in the PLA matrix inhibited the free movement of the PLA molecular chain and caused higher flow resistance, resulting in an increase in the complex viscosity, storage modulus, and loss modulus of PLA/SGO-PS.",

The optimized PPV derivatives are reacted at 80°C for 6 h after mixing of the reactants at 45°C, and then followed by aging at 95°C for 1 h. The optimized molar ratios of dichlorobenzyl chloride/potassium tert‐butoxide for poly(2‐methoxy‐5‐butoxy)‐ p ‐phenylene vinylene and poly(2,5‐dibutyloxy)‐ 1,4‐phenylene vinylene are 1/7 and 1/8, respectively. The yields of the derivatives increased gradually with the chain length of the substituents; however, the yields decreased with a further increase in the chain length to an eight‐carbon substituent, which is resulted from the counteraction of the electronic effect by the steric effect of the substituents. The solubility of the derivatives was greatly enhanced with the incorporation of the alkoxyl substituents, and the highest solubility of 3.08% in chloroform and 1.79% in tetrahydrofuran is demonstrated by poly(2‐methoxy‐5‐octyloxy)‐ p ‐phenylene vinylene (PMOOOPV). All derivatives exhibited higher solubility in chloroform than in tetrahydrofuran. The conductivity of the derivatives increased with increasing of the substituting chain lengths as a result of the enhanced the conjugation degree and lowered energy gap, and the highest conductivity of 2.9 × 10 −4 S/cm was exhibited by PMOOOPV. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Injection molding of liquid silicone rubbers (LSR) is widely utilized in the production and insulation of many medium‐ and high‐voltage electrical components. It is dictated mainly by the excellent properties of LSR, ensuring high quality of the final product. However, this also requires a well‐established and controlled manufacturing process. Typically, experimental methods are used to get a detailed knowledge regarding the process and to gain the necessary experience. Unfortunately, such an approach is expensive and time consuming, and minimal marketing time is one of the most important requirements for being competitive. In this connection, an advanced silicone molding simulation tool was successfully developed and validated experimentally. Furthermore, computer simulations were applied to analyze and optimize the process for a selected product, avoiding trial and error methods with the only cost connected to the computational time. An accurate representation of the process required a mathematical approach, among others, consisting of viscosity, pVT, and curing kinetics models that were built up based on rheological, pressure, and calorimetric measurements conducted for a considered silicone material. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The produced sheets were exposed to gamma rays at dose levels in the range from 25 to 250 kGy. The chemical structure was studied by using FTIR technique, whereas thermal stability was tested using thermogravimetric analysis. Variations in the direct current (DC) conductivity ( σ DC ) with both the clay ratio and irradiation dose were studied. The effect of the clay ratio and gamma irradiation on the dielectric constant ( εε ) and loss ( ε″ ) has also been investigated. The obtained results show that the thermal stability has been improved as a result of clay loading and gamma irradiation of the rubber samples. Moreover, a significant increase in the values of ε′ and ε″ with increasing both the clay ratio and the irradiation dose has been noticed. The values of εε for NBR samples were found to be greater than that for SBR samples.

The structural properties have been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SEM and AFM images represent the dispersion of CdS nanoparticles in a polymer matrix. The permittivity of nanocomposite samples increases with temperature due to formation of new dipoles or accumulation of charge carriers in a nanoparticle‐‐polymer interface. The increase in permittivity with temperature can be attributed to the heat‐assisted dipole moment. Furthermore, it has been observed that permittivity is the function of nanoparticle concentration, temperature, and frequency. The high concentration of nanoparticles lowers permittivity with frequency. The positive and negative tangential loss has been observed in PU‐‐CdS nanocomposite samples. The negative loss phenomenon could be understood in terms of a local space charge separation. The phase transition of PU and PU‐‐CdS nanocomposites has been studied by using a thermally stimulated discharge current technique. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The influence of particle morphology on AmPAM dispersion and other factors and polymerization were investigated. Three crucial factors responsible for particle morphology are the dispersant concentration, sodium chloride concentration, and ionic degree of terpolymer. The ammonium sulfate concentration had relatively less of an effect on particle morphology, but a suitable concentration was necessary to obtain a stable dispersion system. A higher concentration of PDMC could yield more uniform and spherical particles during dispersion polymerization. A small amount of sodium chloride can decrease particle size and dispersion viscosity. These four factors heavily influenced the viscosity of polymer dispersion, and they had a large effect on the intrinsic viscosity of AmPAM except for the AS and NaCl concentration. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present article summarizes the author's recent work on the computer‐based molecular modeling of polysilanes [‐SiR 2 ‐]. First, conformational energies were calculated by molecular mechanics on model compounds for poly(dimethylsilane) (PDMS), poly(diethylsilane) (PDES), and poly(di‐ n ‐hexylsilane) (PDHS). Discrepancies in conformational preferences between calculated and experimental results are attributed to factors not accounted for in these calculations, such as electronic stabilization and packing forces. Second, molecular dynamics simulations carried out on a model compound for PDHS suggest the presence of an abrupt “gas phase” thermochromic transition, analogous to the abrupt thermochromic transitions observed for PDHS both in solution and in the solid state. Third, we develop a methodology for testing Schweizer's theory of polysilane thermochromism based on the existence of a unique polymer‐solvent conformation‐dependent stabilization energy present in conjugated chains. In his treatment of the polysilanes, Schweizer adopted reasonable estimated values for this stabilization energy term V D . Presented here is a derivation of an analytical expression for V D based on a first‐principles approach. © 1993 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

This article analyzes direct induction heating of the compression molding die, instead of heating by conduction via the press platens. Applying heat directly to the die near the polymer, decreases the processing time significantly and, improves process control by reducing thermal mass and response time. Analysis of the electromagnetic field and transient infrared photography resulted in an understanding of the heating pattern of the die. These results were used in a finite element model of the process to predict the temperature history of the die and polymer. The parts made using this process were compared with parts made with conventional processing methods using thin-film tensile testing, density gradient column testing, and microstructural investigation of the degree of consolidation of the powder particles. The methods used to analyze this processing technique and tooling can provide process and mold designers with significant insight. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 17: 251–257, 1998",

    "abstract": "A new gas atomization process (GAP) was explored for mass producing high-quality spherical powders and very high aspect ratio microfibers from molten polymers. The process involves the use of high-pressure (7.6 MPa or 1050 psi) nitrogen gas and a specifically designed nozzle to atomize a molten stream of polymer into fine droplets that cool to form spherical powders. Polyethylene-based powders, ranging in size from 0 to 200 μm, were efficiently produced in short cycle times by changing a few process control variables such as atomization temperature and polymer melt stream size in a contamination-free environment. The crystallinity of the polymer favored formation of spherical powders. Analysis of the experimental data indicated that the maximum weight fraction of the powders at 0–53 μm can be produced by atomizing the more crystalline polymer, using a 3.175-mm melt stream size at 205°C. Using the GAP in an alternative route to mass producing powders from low-molecular-weight, polyethylene-based waxes that cannot be ground eliminates most of the problems of conventional grinding processes. These benefits of the process together with its flexibility, high throughput, and facile nature can be expected to make it worth considering for industrial processes that must be safe, be capable of mass production, and operate in an environmentally benign fashion. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Further, the bands at 2900 cm −1 , 1750 cm −1 , and 3400 cm −1 , observed in FTIR spectrum of terpolymer, evidence the presence of phenyl, methoxy, and alcoholic group respectively.

Unstabilized PP (U‐PP) and stabilized PP (S‐PP) resins, simulating recycled materials prone to degradation, were evaluated for total VOC emissions generated during multiple melt reprocessing by injection molding and extrusion, respectively. Results show that the maximum amount of total VOCs from each cycle (up to six cycles for extrusion and up to ten for injection molding) did not significantly change, while the cumulative VOCs increased with increasing processing cycle for both materials. A good correlation between cumulative VOC increases and melt flow index increase for the U‐PP and weight‐average molecular weight M w decrease for the S‐PP were obtained. Reprocessing in all cases was accompanied by decreases in M w and melt viscosity as a result of thermooxidative degradation. FTIR data considering increases in carbonyl content and degree of unsaturation suggest that at equivalent cycle numbers, degradation appears to be more severe for the extruded material in spite of the longer oxidative induction time of the “as received” pellets used in extrusion. The onset and type of structural changes are shown to depend on cycle number and reprocessing method. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the basic prerequisites for rational and high quality production of plastic parts is a tool layout tailored to the production process. To date, both design and construction have generally been based on values acquired by experience. This first, necessitates highly qualified personnel and second, involves what is frequently time consuming and costly finishing work. Experience acquired so far with computer‐aided layout of injection molds shows that even a designer with little experience reaches the target more quickly and more reliably. At the same time he is able to draw on the results of intricate calculation and simulation methods which he was unable to apply in the past for reasons of time alone. This paper thus sets out the possibilities currently open and the experience available for computer‐aided mold layout. The chief point of focus here is a system for the layout of injection molds. Working on from this system, however, the potentials for computer application are presented for blow mold‐ and foaming mold‐design. After finding the mold principle, mold layout essentially divides up into two major areas, namely dimensioning calculations (CAE) and compilation of production documents (CAD). In dimensioning, the different functional elements of the mold are calculated. The aids that have been developed and the potentials of computer‐aided dimensioning are presented with examples from the fields of rheological, thermal, and mechanical mold layout. Computer‐aided rheological layout divides up into two steps. The first gives information on qualitative filling behavior (filling picture, flow paths) and the second provides quantitative results (pressures, shear stresses, temperatures). Computer‐aided thermal layout similarly divides up into part steps. These are a rough overall energy balance, a rough layout of the tempering system, a segmented layout, and a homogeneity check, which involves simulating the temperature conditions in the mold by means of difference methods. When it comes to mechanical layout of the mold, programs are available for deformation calculations on basic cases and these will frequently be sufficient. For more complex cases of loading and deformation, a finite element program is used. Graphic data processing units can be used to supply extra facilities—first, to provide an aid for the simulation programs in dimensioning and second, to rationalize the compilation of the production documents. An illustration of a CAD workplace is given, incorporating the necessary computer configuration and peripherals. Compiling production documents is essentially a problem of variant design. The variants in this case are the individual components of the mold and a number of standardized accessories that can be called up as “standardized components.” The mold cavity, however, always has to be a free design. All programs are dialogue driven and are in a standardized manner so that even designers with no data processing experience can use the computer as an aid. The CAD/CAE system presented duly fulfils all these requirements. It allows the designer, at a single computer work station, to carry out both simulation and dimensioning calculations, to obtain information on material data, and to compile production documents on the basis of variant and free design. This provides the designer with a readily manageable aid and makes a considerable contribution towards improving the design result. Finally, the capacity of different computer concepts and the CAE/CAD/CAM systems on the market are discussed. For the future it will be possible to establish a computer‐aided link between the different areas of design, from development of the molded part, via mold design and production, through setting the processing parameters of the injection molding machine.",

These mixtures were cast into films by evaporating the solvent and finally drying in an air‐circulating oven at 60°C.

Up to 40 pph Novatein polyethylene ( PE ) was blended with Novatein by extrusion and injection moulding. Using zinc ionomer resulted in optimal properties and was compatible with a finely dispersed morphology at high content; high interfacial tension (σ) and a viscosity ratio (λ) of ~1 was observed. Unmodified blends and those containing epoxy functionalities showed co‐continuity at low PE content. Whilst co‐continuity appeared to increase impact resistance, other mechanical properties decreased due to lack of phase interaction. Maleic anhydride‐grafted‐polyethylene blends showed a finely dispersed PE phase, yet was less compatible.

The mathematical model is established by using simple flow field, plate model, and Newton constitutive relation. It is proved that there is elongational deformation when the fluid bypasses the pin, and the elongational deformation is quantitatively calculated. The finite element method is used to simulate the flow field of the screw mixing section of the pin-barrel cold-feed extruder with different specifications. The velocity vector nephogram in the simulation results is analyzed by numerical analysis of elongational deformation and compared with the theoretical elongational deformation value. The results show that the simulated and theoretical values of elongational deformation are approximately consistent. The numerical analysis of the key factors affecting the elongational deformation shows that the elongational deformation will gradually increase with the increase of screw diameter. For the screw of the same specification, the increasing helical angle will reduce the elongational deformation, and the increasing rotational speed will linearly increase the elongational deformation in unit time. This study can be used to roughly estimate the elongational deformation induced by pins and establish the mixing theoretical model of the pin-barrel cold-feed extruder.",

ELISA kit was performed to examine the levels of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers (ROS, LDH, and MPO). In addition, flow cytometry was employed to determine cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression of cell proliferation-related proteins (PCNA and Ki67), apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3), and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins was evaluated by Western blot. Results. Compared with the control group, the cell viability was decreased significantly in the OGD/R group. CCK-8 results showed that laminarin could attenuate the damage of PC12 cell viability induced by OGD/R in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the highest concentration of 5 μg/ml laminarin could significantly promote the viability of PC12 cells and the expression of PCNA and Ki67 than the OGD/R group. Additionally, ELISA assays showed that laminarin significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the levels of oxidative stress markers (ROS, LDH, and MPO). Flow cytometry results demonstrated that laminarin promoted the cell cycle. And laminin upregulated the expression of apoptotic protein Bcl-2, while downregulated the expression of apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3. Finally, laminarin significantly suppressed the expression of PTEN and facilitated the expression of PI3K and p-AKT compared to the OGD/R group. Conclusion. Laminarin could alleviate the OGD/R-induced PC12 cell neuronal injury via promoting cell activity and cycle and inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The mechanism may be related to the downregulation of PTEN protein and the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

The results show that compared with bisphenol A dicyanate (BADCy), the PCBDCy possesses more excellent comprehensive properties.

The glass transition temperature is reduced by the presence of low molecular weight molecules, e.g., dissolved gases or organic solvents. The quantitative knowledge of reduction of the glass transition temperature caused by the addition of carbon dioxide in a polymer melt is highly relevant for foam extrusion. However, measurement of the reduction of glass transition temperature caused by gas loading has to be performed under elevated pressure which implies high experimental efforts. In this work, we discuss and compare three methods for determination of the influence of carbon dioxide on thermal properties of amorphous polymers, i.e., calorimetric measurements, creep tests, and rheological experiments. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are elucidated. Furthermore, the influence of molecular structure of the styrenic and vinylpyridine polymers on the glass transition temperature is discussed. Polystyrene generally shows the highest reduction of glass transition temperature. Poly(2-vinylpyridine) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) show a slightly less pronounced behaviour in comparison to polystyrene because of the lower polarity of polystyrene. Poly(α-methyl styrene) is associated with a different dependence of glass transition temperature on gas loading in calorimetric and rheological experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The behavior of silicone rubber materials subjected to uniaxial stress fields cannot be predicted by classical mechanical theory which is based on linear stress–strain relationships. Nor do theories based on “ideal elastomer” concepts work well when extensions exceed 30%. For these reasons, there are few design specifications related to the use of silicone rubber sealants for structural applications. This paper presents a theoretical approach used to predict the behavior of silicone rubber under uniaxial stress fields. The model is based on the concept of the classical Maxwell treatment of viscoelasticity and stress relaxation behavior. However, the Hookean spring component of the Maxwell element is replaced with an ideal elastomer component. With this substitution, the new model permits the crosslink density of the silicone elastomer to be estimated from test data and allows a stress level to be predicted as a complex function of extension, crosslink density, absolute temperature, and relaxation time. Simple uniaxial tensile tests were performed on two commercial silicone rubber sealants. Their experimental behavior was compared to the predicted performance based on the new viscoelastic model. Agreement was found to be quite good. It is hoped that the model, therefore, will help in the basic understanding of structural sealant behavior and perhaps lead to better design specifications for structural glazing.",

In principle, the gas-injection process can be treated as a valve-controlled tank charging. One of the critical factors for the successful application of the process is the obtaining and maintaining of a desired gas injection pressure within the polymer melt in the mold cavity. Most of the currently available commercial gas-injection machines operate either in an open-loop manner or with closed-loop control, relying upon manual tuning of the associated controllers. This is not only time consuming but also lacking in measurable performance. To improve the controller tuning problem while retaining the currently used controller structure, this study implements a control method which combines system identification and optimal linear quadratic regulator theory into an analytic approach. To demonstrate and verify the proposed method, several experiments were conducted. The results of these experiments show that the approach has excellent potential for designing a control system for regulating gas pressure variation during the gas-assisted injection molding process. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

For this study, fiber spinning steady states are computed in experimentally based physical regimes.

Real‐time bubble instability was also recorded using a video camera at a speed of 30 frames/s. The pressure signal was analyzed using a fast‐Fourier‐transform (FFT) computer program to determine the frequency of bubble oscillation. Since bubble instability often consists of large‐scale oscillation and bubble flutter, and both motions affect gauge and layflat uniformity, the pressure signal was decomposed to determine the frequency of each oscillation mode. To obtain a stable bubble, the amplitudes of both oscillation modes must be reduced to a minimum. Under a single mode oscillation, the period of bubble‐diameter variation analyzed using videotape matches that of the pressure trace. The initial results indicated that the trace of the pressure can provide a warning to the stability of a blown‐film process.",

The stretched films were then characterized using various techniques. Prediction of container properties using the data generated for films was undertaken and three different approaches were used. The first method involves the use of time–temperature superposition to extrapolate the film data to the extension rate and extension ratio encountered in bottle blowing. In the second method, correlations developed between functional properties and average orientation functions for films were used for prediction of properties of blown containers. The third method was a combination of the first two methods. The birefringence was obtained by superposition and other properties were predicted using the correlation between functional properties and birefringence. With the exception of tensile energy absorption, it has been shown that mechanical properties of blown containers can be predicted from film data using any of the three methods previously described. A quantitative measure of property variation through thickness can also be obtained. Using the methods developed in this work, a map of properties and processing conditions encountered in stretch blow molding can be generated and this information can be used for designing preforms and containers. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Besides the considerations of the dispersion and homogeneity of various ingredients in the compound, thermosetting resins can easily crosslink to some extent during compounding. In this study, a Buss Continuous kneader, Model PR 200 was employed to compound a phenol–formaldehyde molding powder. The operating conditions in the continuous kneader were varied systematically, and samples were collected. The processability behavior of the resin samples were characterized employing the eccentric rotating disc (ERD) flow in conjunction with a Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer, squeezing flow under constant pressure, and torque rheometry, utilizing a Brabender Plasticorder. The extent of curing of resin samples were further determined by acetone extraction. It is shown that the stability of the thermoset compounding rate, temperatures, and power consumption, strongly depends on the operating conditions selected. Furthermore, unstable operation invariably leads to the premature curing of the thermosetting compounds during the compounding operation. The premature curing of the compound adversely affects its flow, curing, and processability behavior.",

These powders were rotationally molded in an axisymmetric cylinder mold using time–temperature molding cycles recommended for these materials. Wall sections were then cut from the molded cylinders and tensile strengths, Young's moduli, elongations at break, and Izod impact strengths were measured. The resins were then injection molded and similar mechanical tests were performed. The rotationally molded samples exhibited porosity, the level of which depended strongly on the residence time in the isothermal oven. The rotationally molded samples showed greater strengths and moduli, but lower elongations at break and impact strengths. The rotationally molded samples also showed higher crystallinity levels and substantially larger spherulite dimensions. These observations support the mechanical property data.",

All the blends obtained were characterized with respect to their melt state and solid state dynamic‐mechanical response and mechanical tensile properties. In particular, the effect on the blend properties of prolonging the irradiation time was investigated. Furthermore, a morphological characterization through atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed in order to determine how the irradiation conditions affect the ABN rubber particle size and distribution.

    "abstract": "Abstract The distribution of state of cure in a molded rubber component is usually nonuniform due to the slow heat transfer processes involved in the molding–cooling cycle. The minimum in the distribution usually occurs in the center of the rubber section. For large components, one method of reducing molding time is to preheat the uncured rubber prior to molding, thus carrying out a portion of the required heat transfer in a more favorable geometry than the molded shape. In this work, computation of the state of cure distribution in preheat–molding–cooling cycles for one‐dimensional rectangular geometry shows that as the preheat temperature is increased, the locus of the minimum state of cure will move outward from the center toward the surface of the component. This has important implications for the range of cure states existing in an article and calls into question the convention of removing samples for state of cure tests from the center of the component. The variables considered in this work are the preheat temperature, the component thickness, and the target state of cure of the rubber compound. A design curve is developed whereby the preheat temperature to optimize the distribution of the cure can be established. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It was found that tensile modulus had increased to 17% at 10% filler loading as compared to unfilled. These results were supported by scanning electron microscopy measurements of the fractured surface of the composites. All the fabricated composites resisted well against the chemicals and it indicates that the composites have excellent chemical resistance.

Copolymers were characterized using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H‐ NMR ), thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. To examine their possible applications in agriculture, germination test and growth analyses of corn plants were carried out. For this purpose, corn ( Zea mays L. cv. “72 May 80”) was allowed to germinate under suitable conditions. Copolymers, 200 mM salt (NaCl) solution, and both copolymers and salt solution were applied to the plants and compared with the control groups. On the 21st day, all the plants were harvested and were stored at −80°C until analysis. Differences in growth parameters, lipid peroxidation degrees, pigment analysis, and total carbohydrate analysis were tested in order to put forward copolymer and NaCl sensitivity of the corn. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 17.0 software program and the results were compared with each other. These results showed that the copolymers both have a positive effect on the carbohydrate and malondialdehyde ( MDA ), a product of lipid peroxidation content as well as the chlorophyll content. Moreover, poly( EPP ‐ co ‐ε‐ CL 0.88) was more efficient than was the other copolymers in the improvement of the detrimental effects of salinity in increasing chlorophyll, carbohydrate, and MDA content, and growth of corn plants. As a result of the study, it was demonstrated that all of the investigated parameters were affected by the applications of salt and copolymers.",

In this study short nylon fibers waste was modified with Glycidyl 3-Pentadecenyl Phenyl Ether (GPPE) in the presence of Triethylamine/Ammonium persulfate by a simple two-step procedure. The reinforcing effects of modified fibers (MNSF-2) on the vulcanization characteristics, mechanical properties, dynamic mechanical properties, and the wear resistant property of Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) tread compounds were investigated. The addition of the MNSF-2 resulted in slightly lower minimum torque (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>) and maximum torque (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>), as well as longer cure time (t 90 ) and scorch time (t 10 ) of tread compounds. The deterioration of tensile strength and elongation at break of the tread compound containing short nylon fibers waste (NSF) was apparent. Conversely, the modified fibers showed reinforcing effect on tread compounds. The tensile strength values of compounds increased with MNSF-2 content, passed through a maximum value, and then reduced slightly. The modulus and the tear strength of compounds increased significantly with fiber loadings. The highest tear strength value was observed in 8phr MNSF-2 reinforced SBR compounds, 31.9% higher than that of the gum compound. Meanwhile elongation at break of MNSF-2 compound maintained a relative high value than that of NSF/SBR compound. The addition of NSF exaggerated wear volume of compounds. However, the wear resistance of MNSF-2 compounds was superior to that of NSF compounds and comparable with that of the gum compound.

Moreover, BET data showed that specific surface area and volume of plasma treated WF and TEOS modified WF (WS) were considerably improved in comparison with original WF. By increasing WF, a remarkable increase in time, temperature, and energy of mixing process led to the enhancement of fusion torque. In the case of composite using WS, the increase of TEOS content resulted in shorter fusion time, whereas the other fusion characteristics of composites increased.

EIS data for mixed acid storage media demonstrated that LAM-V/FR coating has higher strength in mixed acid solution, higher values of impedance and phase shift, higher value of R pore , and low value of C c ; corrosion rate percentage reduction is 96% of LAM-P/FR and 99.96% of LAM-V/FR compared to bare mild steel sample. The outcomes of this study can lead to assist in design guidelines for anticorrosive coating for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of water drainage and gas recovery is the burning issue for Coalbed Methane (CBM) reservoir development. In the process of exploitation, threshold pressure gradients (TPG) is an important factor affecting the control areas, which related to the low-permeability and complex water saturation of CBM reservoirs. In this paper, a new flow model of CBM has been established considering the TPG and gas desorption. Then we carried out a series of experiments and fitted out a new relational expression between TPG and permeability and water saturation, which shows that TPG is negatively correlated with permeability and positively correlated with water saturation. After that, we analyzed the influence of TPG and desorption on the control radius and illustrated a case study. The results show that TPG and desorption effect both can slow down the rate of pressure reduction. The case study indicates that the control radius of target well groups ranges from 55 m to 136.7 m The average control radius and gas TPG are 91.3 m 0.0082 MPa/m respectively. Furthermore, we classify the wells into 5 categories, which are mainly distributed in III (80∼100 m). Finally, we suggest using well pattern infilling in region II and III and hydraulic fracturing method for region IV to increase the utilization area and the sustainability for the target area. This study provides a quick and reasonable prediction of control radius in CBM reservoir with different water saturation for further adjustment suggestion and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "In this work, analytical solution of simply supported sandwich arches considering permeation effect of adhesives is presented. The permeation layer is described by the functionally graded material, exponentially graded in the radial direction. The stresses and deformations of each layer are based on the two-dimensional (2D) elasticity theory in the polar coordinate. The governing equations of the arch are solved by the layer-wise method, which turns the differential equations with variable coefficients into constant coefficients. The solution can be obtained efficiently by means of the recursive matrix method, especially for the arch with many layers. The present solution agrees well with the finite element solution with a fine mesh, while the finite element method is time consuming in mesh division and calculation. The one-dimensional (1D) solution based on the Euler–Bernoulli theory is close to the present one; however, the error increases as the arch becomes thick. The effect of permeation layer thickness on the stresses is studied. It is indicated that the stress distributions tend to be smooth along the radial direction as the permeation layer thickness increases.",

Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films were functionalized with Ar plasma and then immersed in a solution containing gold nanoparticles (AuNps). The results demonstrated the appearance of the hydrophilic groups on the film surface after modification of PET film by plasma Ar treatment and the formation of the polar groups such as C=O, COO-, and OH, which then reacted with AuNps. The changes induced in the treated polymer samples were investigated in terms of AuNp adsorption efficiency on polyester film by contact angle, profilometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The morphological and structural analyses have shown a good adhesion of AuNps at treated film surfaces. The results of biocompatibility antimicrobial and antifungal tests proved the nontoxic behavior of the sample and its good antimicrobial and antifungal activity.",

Two types of PUs differing in the content of flexible chain segments (40% and 50%) were used. Changes in mechanical strength were analyzed to assess the ability to self-healing of PU-based matrix nanocomposites with experimentally introduced damage in the form of an incision. The healing process was activated by heating the damaged samples at 60°C, for 30 minutes. The addition of CNT-OH and CF caused a slight reduction in the self-healing ability of the nanocomposites as compared to the neat PUs. After heating to 60°C, the nanocomposites self-healed up to 72% of the initial strength of the undamaged samples. The introduction of fibrous components to the polymer matrix improved the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites and facilitated heat transfer from the environment to the interior of the samples, necessary to initiate self-healing. Low content of carbon components in the PU matrix, i.e., 3 wt% of CF and 2 wt% of CNF-OH increased the total work up to fracture of samples after healing by about 53%.",

A microcalorimeter provides in this context a fast method for the investigation of oxidation and thermal stability at various conditions opposite to more classical time‐ and labor‐consuming methods. The measurements were performed in both wet and dry environments in sealed stainless steel vials for new and preaged materials. The preaged materials were aged in advance at 110°C and 100% relative humidity to observe the effect of the ageing for the MC measurements. Different material sizes (ground, unground) were also investigated. The results from the MC measurements on preaged material show that stabilized PP produce less heat flow than unstabilized PP in dry atmosphere, and no significant difference between the various levels of stabilized materials are observed as long as the stabilizer is present. This indicates that when stabilizer is present above a certain but so far unknown concentration (50–100 ppm), the oxidation and the following heat flow of the material becomes much weaker compared with the unstabilized materials. Comparison between wet and dry calorimeter measurements in air indicates that the autoxidation of the unstabilized material is more powerful in a wet atmosphere. No significant differences are observed for the stabilized materials. In the material particle size investigation, the heat flow and total energy output seem to be higher for the ground unstabilized materials; no difference is observed for the stabilized material.",

Furthermore, the use of a higher injection molding temperature also reduced modulus and strength. Higher molding temperature also caused an increase in the fraction of creep recovered in 20 min. These results confirmed that increased SS increased chain mobility and that injection molding at 140°C instead of 120°C did not cause excessive thermal cross‐linking.",

The in vitro release profiles were closely correlated with in vivo release profiles calculated using the Wagner–Nelson method ( r = 0.9876). To evaluate the drug release profiles rapidly, an accelerated release method was developed. In the accelerated release method, the acidic and alkaline buffers (the first 6 h, pH 4.0; the last 18 h, pH 9.6) were used as release media, respectively. Results indicated that the accelerated release profiles (24 h) were closely correlated with the in vivo release profiles ( r = 0.9623). Therefore, through optimization of the experiment variables (buffer components and pH), an accelerated release method was developed to evaluate in vivo drug release from microspheres. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

First, silica surface was modified by silylation with 3‐mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane followed by graft polymerization. Modified silica was grafted with polymer containing a functional monomer for metal chelating, poly[1‐( N , N ‐ bis‐ carboxymethyl)amino‐3‐allylglycerol‐ co ‐dimethylacrylamide] (poly(AGE/IDA‐ co‐ DMAA). The resulting sorbent has been characterized by FTIR, elemental analysis, FT‐Raman, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The sorption capacity of the functionalized sorbent was 53.3 mg g −1 . The chelating sorbent can be reused for 15 cycles of sorption–desorption without any significant change in sorption capacity. The profile of neodymium uptake on this sorbent reflects good accessibility of the chelating sites in the poly(AGE/IDA‐ co‐ DMAA)‐grafted silica gel. Scatchard analysis revealed that the homogeneous binding sites were formed in the polymers. The equilibrium adsorption data of Nd(III) on modified sorbent were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Redlich–Peterson models.

The different samples of PP were irradiated with ions to the fluences in the range 10 11 –10 13 ions/cm 2 and exposed to gamma radiation of doses in the range 100–1250 kGy. A comparative study is carried out upon different parameters of irradiated polymer samples such as crystallite size and band gap energy. The structural properties are effectively modified by the ions irradiation, whereas gamma exposure shows insignificant changes in this regard; however, gamma exposure is observed to be effective in gradually decreasing the band gap energy of the PP samples with an increase in the gamma dose. The formation of new chemical bands is observed in the ion‐irradiated and gamma‐exposed PP polymer samples.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT With an objective to investigate the influence of nanoclay (NC) on the mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of polyurethane (PU) in the presence of 5 wt% of ginger spent (GS), PU/GS/NC nanocomposite films were fabricated by a solution intercalation method with varying amounts, namely 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%, of NC. The fabricated PU/GS/NC nanocomposite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, tensile modulus, percentage elongation at break, and surface hardness have been performed for nanocomposites. FT‐IR and XRD analysis show the nature of the NC interaction with the PU matrix, whereas SEM images show agglomeration of NC and entanglement of polymer chains with NC with an increase in the NC content. It was found that the tensile strength of the biocomposites increased from 4.5 to 13.7 MPa, tensile modulus increased from 8.2 to 14.3 MPa, and surface hardness increased from 70 to 77 shore A, whereas the percentage elongation at break decreased from 155.2% to 100.5%. Static water contact angle measurements on the surface of the PU/GS/NC nanocomposites reveal a reduction in surface polarity by way of changes in the contact angle from 76.83° to 55.24°, whereas surface energy increased from 88.36 to 102.11 mJ/m 2 with an increase in the NC content. With an increase in the NC content, the chemical resistance of the green composites in different chemical environments improved. Thermal analysis by a thermogravimetric analyzer indicates improvement in thermal stability with an increase in the NC content. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The difunctional amide segment consists of two terephthalic groups at the outside (T). The length of the soft segment changed from 1000 to 8000 g/mol using difunctionalized polystyrene (PSt) and thereby the concentration of the hard segment is varied from 35 to 4 wt%. The molecular weight of the triblock copolymer is determined by the inherent viscosity measurement method. The FT‐IR results reveal that the degree of crystallinity of the amide segments in the copolymer is high 79%. The differential scanning calorimetry shows the T g for amorphous polystyrene and T m for crystallizable hard segments. Depending on the amide concentration in the copolymer, the diamide and tetraamide melting temperature ranged between 125 to 280°C. All the thermogravimetric data reveal that the polymer shows single‐stage decomposition temperature centered around 410°C. The solvent resistivity of these materials is very high even at a low concentration of (4%) amide content. All the copolymers show low water absorption.",

First, the active amino groups of CS are protected by excess phthalic anhydride. Then, the ring‐opening polymerization of lactide onto phthaloyl‐protected CS could be performed without the addition of a catalyst. Finally, the product is deprotected by hydrazine hydrate to give chitosan‐ g ‐poly ( l ‐lactic acid) (CS‐ g ‐PLLA). The structure of CS‐ g ‐PLLA copolymer is characterized by infrared spectrum and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance. When CS is introduced on PLLA, the solution of the degraded copolymer ceased to be acidic. In addition, CS‐ g ‐PLLA shows excellent solubility in some organic solvent for the easier tissue engineering scaffold preparation.",

Both infrared spectroscopy and SEM images confirmed the formation of PPy layers on uncationized and cationized cotton samples. The agglomeration of PPy particles was also appeared on the uncationized fibers. However, a uniform distribution of PPy films was observed for the cationized cotton fabrics. Furthermore, the conductivity of these samples enhanced up to 49% (with a 0.0212 S/cm electrical conductivity).

GI‐XRD measurements that were carried out at three grazing incidence angles (0.11°, 0.13°, and 0.3°) also substantiate a more prominent upright concentration gradient of the film processed through the modified method. The contact angle measurement reveals accumulation of more P3HT crystallites at the surface of co‐solvent modified films.

Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) here were synthesized by the coprecipitation method and characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscopy techniques. An anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), was loaded onto the NPs and then the release behavior and cytotoxicity effects of nanodrug were determined. The pH‐sensitive behavior of drug release was observed. While the total loaded drug was released at pH 1.2 in 30 min, the amount of drug release was equal to 8% in pH 7 after 8 h. The drug‐loading efficiency was found to be 88%. Also, NPs potentiate the efficacy of the drug by increasing its cytotoxicity, in which IC50 of 57 and 39 μM for the nanodrug and drug was estimated, respectively. In conclusion, the results of the study showed that MNPs are promising vehicle for DOX delivery.",

The miscibility of the functionalized polyethylenes in DGEBA resin was found to be strictly dependent on the number of functional groups contained in the chains. Solubilization in the epoxy resin was achieved by reacting the functionalized polyethylenes with a monofunctional epoxy resin homologue, in order to produce telechelic branches attached to the chains. The addition of such chemically modified polyethylenes to an anhydride hardener/epoxy resin mixture has given rise to the formation of a two-phase microstructure in the cured systems, consisting of small spherical aggregated particles strongly bonded to the surrounding matrix, thereby providing the required mechanism for toughness enhancement.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the following article, we will discuss welding of polyamides inside the injection mold. This process is called injection welding. The process of injection welding makes it possible to bond polyamides with quite different characteristics together without adhesive. In this way, one can achieve economic as well as constructional advantages. We will discuss two different methods in this article. In the first process, two melts are injected onto each other simultaneously; with the second technique, the melt is injected onto a thermoplastic insert. The weld line strengths of injection‐welded parts depend on material and process conditions. With an amorphous polyamide, the weld line strength can be attained up to the full tensile strength of the material, while a glass‐fiber‐reinforced polyamide falls back onto the tensile strength of the basic polymer. Injection welding achieves the greatest weld line strength when two melt streams are colliding together with the highest possible injection pressure. If a melt is injected onto an insert, the temperature of the melt should be as high as possible.",

One was the concurrent blending method in a polymerization reactor (reactor blend), and the other was the conventional melt blending in a twin-screw extruder (extruder blend). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the reactor blend resulted in dispersed PP particles less than 1 μm in diameter, whereas the particles were 3 to 4 μm in diameter for the extruder blend. The rheological properties judged from Rheometrics mechanical spectrometry, capillary rheometry, melt index, complex viscosity, and melt strength also suggested different natures for the two types of blends. The extruder blend showed a sharp change in flow properties as a function of peroxide and coagent concentration, whereas this was only gradual for the reactor blends. For mechanical properties, the reactor blends were superior in elongation at break to the extruder blends. These observations suggest that the level of interfacial tension was lower for the reactor blends than for extruder blends.

These systems were observed fully transparent. Modified matrices were filled with several multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) contents. Morphological analysis indicated a better dispersion of MWCNT with the use of a block copolymer when compared with a neat UP matrix/MWCNT composite, PEO‐PPO‐PEO acting like a surfactant. Furthermore, MWCNT did not affect the achievement of the irregular nanoscale micellar morphology. A reduction of mechanical properties of the composites with the block copolymer content was observed for UP/PEO‐PPO‐PEO composites without MWCNT. With the addition of MWCNT up to 0.5 wt% content, mechanical properties increased, decreasing again for 1 wt% MWCNT content probably due to the formation of agglomerates despite the use of the block copolymer as a surfactant. Flexural properties of composites decreased due to the incorporation of PEO‐PPO‐PEO copolymer, but significant higher levels of ductility were achieved. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, a new process for micropatterning of porous structures with a controllable morphology was developed and investigated. This process combines polymer melt blending, hot embossing, and in‐mold annealing for geometrical pattern transfer and simultaneous morphological control. A special effort was made to generate a microgroove pattern with an open pore structure. Parametric experimental studies were conducted on stamps with different feature sizes under different processing conditions. The results demonstrated the feasibility and the versatility of the proposed technique in fabricating micropatterned porous structures. By varying the geometrical and boundary conditions during in‐mold annealing, micropatterns with graded porous structures were demonstrated. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This includes the contribution made by many authorities, starting from Staudinger, as the founder of polymer science, to the most recent Nobel laureates in the field. The increased awareness for the need to capture CO2 from combustion gases has stimulated interests in the possibility of using polymerization methods as a route to produce useful solid products. The available theoretical arguments and experimental evidence are presented in relation to the feasibility of producing linear polymers, both as homopolymer and copolymers, placing emphasis on stability aspects and possible uses of the products. The various claims on the possibility of opening both double bonds of molecular CO2 to produce stable networks are also analyzed. Arguments in support of the possibilities of producing mixed CO2–SiO2 glasses are provided, and the expected properties of the resulting solids are discussed.

The LGE diols were synthesized through ring‐opening polymerization of LA and GA using PEG as an initiator and stannous octoate [Sn(Oct) 2 ] as a catalyst in advance. A series of novel thermosensitive and biodegradable hydrogels were then prepared from N ‐isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) and LGE dA as a cross‐linker. The effect of different molar ratios of LA/GA in PLGA on the swelling ratio and physical properties of the poly(NIPAAm) hydrogels were investigated. The results showed that the swelling ratios of the poly(NIPAAm) hydrogels in deionized water decreased with increasing cross‐linker content and increased with increasing GA content in the hydrogel. The compressive modulus and cross‐linking density of the hydrogels also increased with an increase in the cross‐linker content and molar ratio of LA/GA in the present hydrogel. The hydrogels can be degraded about 60% for the NL50 series of gels, but for NL78 about 53% can be degradable in 1‐month biodegradable experiment. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The synthesis of a poly(amic acid) (PAA)‐supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst (PAA‐TiCl 4 ) by the reaction of PAA and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 ) is reported. For ethylene polymerization, three catalysts were synthesized by varying the TiCl 4 /PAA weight ratio in a hexane medium. The resulting catalysts were characterized by Fourier‐transformed infrared (FT‐IR), ultraviolet (UV), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x‐ray detector (SEM‐EDX), and x‐ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The acidity of the catalysts in an acetone/water solution was measured by a pH meter. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that catalysts are stable up to 110–125°C. Because of their higher degree of thermal stability, these catalysts may potentially be used as a support in a conventional Ziegler–Natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization. Furthermore, because of the extensive reaction between the functional groups of PAA and TiCl 4 , the chain structure of the PAA was destroyed. The newly synthesized catalysts showed good storability, and the overall catalytic productivity is 4921 g PE/g Ti/h. A catalyst with titanium incorporation corresponding to 2.8 wt% showed the maximum activity. The productivity of the catalysts also depended on the titanium concentration in the polymer matrix. These catalysts are found to retain their catalytic activity for a long time (∼90 days), and a mild reaction condition is required for catalysis. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The formation of these complexes leads to fluctuations in typical parameters such as viscosity and the Huggins and Kraemer constants due to conformational changes experienced by certain macromolecules with donor or acceptor groups in the presence of strongly loaded metallic ions. Crystallization temperatures fell considerably as the metallic complexes were formed; in other words, crystallization and its starting temperature were both reduced, although the complexes exhibited greater thermal stability. This affected the degradation characteristics of PLLA–metal complexes.

    "abstract": "Abstract A common technique for the manufacture of polymer alloys is melt blending of polymers with specific chemical interactions. For instance, an amido ester crosslink forms when oxazoline‐grafted PS is mixed with acid‐grafted PE. The crosslink builds melt viscosity and stabilizes product morphology. Reaction control is critical since overreacted alloys from gels and underreacted alloys have gross composition gradients and/or tend to phase coalesce so that product properties are variable. Polymer reactions in plasticating compounders are particularly difficult control problems since several unit operations involving plastication, heat exchange, mixing, and separating of by‐products must be sequenced properly to control a reaction. Reactive polystyrene (OPS) and reactive polyethylene (APE) with oxazoline and carboxylic acid functionality, respectively, were melt blended in a ZSK compounding extruder under a variety of conditions. The extent of crosslink was monitored by the strong shear viscosity increase of the reacted product, the infrared absorption by the crosslink, and reactant depletion in the melt. The phase morphology was characterized by optical phase contrast microscopy. A response surface of product shear viscosity vs. the primary operational parameters of extrusion rate and extruder RPM is interpreted in terms of characteristic reaction time and development of reactive interfaces during the mixing process. Response surfaces result from storing coordinates and responses while exercising a new feedback loop control system.",

The results indicate that laminar morphology is most likely to develop in the shear zone, as maxima in particle size and aspect ratio are observed in directions parallel and transverse to flow in this region of the sample. The laminar structure is more pronounced at high concentrations of the EVOH minor phase, and at low maleation levels of the matrix resin, as well as for low molding thickness. The influence of processing conditions such as injection speed and mold and melt temperatures appears to be small. Intensive preblending of the components in a twin screw extruder hinders the development of the laminar structure. Toluene permeability measurements show that the presence of laminar phase morphology in injection molded samples produces substantial improvements of the barrier characteristics in the materials. However, impact tests indicate that there is need to optimize the conditions employed in producing the laminar morphology, in order to avoid deterioration of mechanical properties. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Cooling conditions have critical effects on the quality and productivity of such precision parts. This article is devoted to investigate the effects of mold temperature and cooling time on quality. A two-cavity mold for molding convex lenses with square-looped cooling channels was used. Samples molded with different mold temperatures and cooling times were collected, and their contour conformity to those of the cavity was evaluated. Contour errors were defined. The correlation between mold temperature and cooling time and contour errors was analyzed. It has been found that for a given mold temperature, two critical cooling times can be defined at which the thermal and rigidity states pass through a transition.

Small amounts of different organic sodium compounds, exhibiting varying levels of base strength, were also used to catalyze the reaction between the functional groups of the two polymers in the mixture. It was found that whereas EP‐g‐MA reacted with phenoxy to produce both graft copolymers and cross‐linked products in varying amounts, the terpolymers containing carboxylic acid groups in the backbone of the polymer chains would never give rise to the formation of cross‐linked products even when large amount of a strong base, such as sodium ethoxide, was used to catalyze the reactions. The latter mixtures exhibited the characteristics of ionomers, involving also alkoxide anions from the phenoxy component to an extent which depended on the base strength of the sodium compound used. The ionomeric mixtures displayed morphological features varying from finely dispersed particles to cocontinuous phases. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Historically, this switchover was effected either as a function of time or ram position. Unfortunately, neither of those parameters correlated satisfactorily to the processing event that was supposed to be detected, i.e., the “packing” of molten polymer in the mold. There are several IMM Process Controllers that directly sense rate of change of cavity pressure, but these require special transducers to be inserted in the mold. This paper describes a scheme that uses the feedback of injection ram velocity to determine mold packing and the resulting optimum point at which pressure switchover should be initiated.",

For a given rovings content, the ILSS decreased with increasing polycarbonate content. However, the ILSS of the composites with epoxy alone as the matrix is found to be higher than that of the epoxy/polycarbonate blend and this was attributed to better bonding between epoxy and reinforcement than that between epoxy/polycarbonate blend and reinforcement.

    "abstract": "Abstract Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), a natural polymeric material from the palm oil tree, is a potential precursor for making carbon for advanced materials applications because of its continuous generation in large quantities as a low cost by‐product of the palm oil mill; annual production of EFB in Malaysia is approximately 2 million tonnes. Powders of natural pyropolymer having self‐adhesion property, NPP1, NPP2, and NPP3, were prepared by precarbonizing the EFB, EFB treated with acid (1% HCL), and alkaline (1% NaOH) respectively. Green bodies of carbon pellets prepared from the NPP1, NPP2, and NPP3 were carbonized up to 1000°C using a multistep heating profile. Hardness of the carbonized pellets prepared from NPP1, NPP2, and NPP3 were 1/8, 2/5, and 1/2 of that of the reference sample (334 HV) respectively. This implied that, although the treatment improved the sample hardness it did not significantly increase the intermolecular forces or the number of inter‐ribbon cross‐links in the samples during carbonization. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The EMA resin was used in the zinc metal form at a constant ratio of 9 wt% in all preparations. The effect of EMA resin as a crosslinking agent was characterized by percentage gel fraction, tensile mechanical, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In this study, the maximum gel content ( G max ) and gelling dose ( D gel ) parameters were determined by applying the familiar Charlesby–Pinner relationship. The results showed that the gel content for all investigated samples gradually increases with increasing irradiation dose. The modified LDPE batches with EMA show higher gel content than unmodified ones at any irradiation dose. Also, the gel content of all LDPE composites decreases as a result of post‐storage effect. The mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at break) exhibit significant change as a result of irradiation and blending the LDPE batch with EMA. The level of change in mechanical properties seems to be more pronounced for EMA‐modified LDPE batches. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The PIC micelles could be formed via electrostatic interaction between ammonium cations and carboxylate anions under mild alkaline conditions. The formation of the micelles dramatically blocks the nonradiative pathway and enhances the fluorescence of TPE moieties, and the maximum fluorescence intensity was achieved near the isoelectric point due to the restriction of intramolecular motion. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and size of the PIC micelles exhibited a temperature response in the range from 20 to 80°C. Upon adjusting the solution pH to 2, the PIC micelles were reconstructed into hydrogen-bonding complexes while the hydrogen bonding interaction between the protonated carboxyl groups of TPE-(N-COOH)4 and chitosan. Moreover, the size of the micelles underwent a remarkable decrease, whereas the fluorescence emission was further enhanced by ~6.25-fold.

The processing of the PI with hydroxyl‐terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) offers a considerable advantage to develop a material having good mechanical and thermal stability. Taking this into account, the HTPB was blended with polyamic acid, which is precursor to PI to form PI + HTPB films. A number of properties were evaluated for PI + HTPB films with ultra low concentrations of HTPB. The films prepared with ultra low concentration (10 −3 –1 wt%) showed unusual synergism, which is attributed to the presence of in situ generated micro/nanostructures derived from HTPB. The microhardness study was used to elucidate the actual mechanical performance due to structure formation of HTPB in a nanometer regime within PI matrix. Atomic force microscopy analysis confirmed the dispersion of HTPB at nano regime within PI matrix. The enhanced thermal stability as determined by thermogravimetric analyzer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry was attributed to the presence of micro/nanoparticle of HTPB within the PI matrix. The water absorption isotherms were measured and their abnormal behavior was correlated with micro‐/nano‐sized particles in the PI/HTPB film. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present work is the development of a method for structural reinforcement of beams obtained by in‐mold extrusion of plastics from solid urban waste. The beams obtained by in‐mold extrusion are commonly used for outdoor furniture and structures. The material used for such applications is mainly composed of low‐density polyethylene derived from bags and films, with small amounts of high density polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as traces of polyethylene terephthalate. This material is usually referred to as “plastic lumber.” Plastic lumber products have a low stiffness, which results in high deflections under flexural loads, particularly under creep loading. In this study, reinforcing rods of high aspect ratio were incorporated into plastic lumber beams in specific positions with respect to the cross section of the beam. The reinforcement of the plastic lumber beams with fine rods is introduced in the typical intrusion process used for the production of unreinforced beams. Glass fiber reinforced pultruded rods were chosen for this purpose from a preliminary evaluation of different materials. Different diameter glass fiber reinforced pultruded rods, including surface‐abraded systems to increase the roughness, were used for the reinforcement of plastic lumber beams. The reinforced beams were tested in terms of flexural stiffness, creep resistance, and pullout resistance of the embedded rods. The results obtained from the mechanical tests showed a significant enhancement of flexural stiffness and creep resistance behavior. The performance at higher stress levels was shown to be significantly dependent on the interfacial adhesion between rods and polymer matrix. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, the surface of low‐density polyethylene ( LDPE ) was functionalized with maleic anhydride ( MA ) using solution grafting method in the presence of benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ), an initiator. The surface chemistry of the grafted LDPE was characterized using different characterization tools. The effect of MA grafting for analysis of bulk properties such as the change in mechanical strength and thermal properties was studied. Further, the nanoindentation study was performed to analyze the surface mechanical property after MA grafting. Biocompatibility studies were carried out using NIH ‐3T3 cells through MTT assay test. FTIR analysis revealed the presence of carboxylic groups on LDPE surface. The contact angle value was found to be 44 ± 3°, which confirms the development of hydrophilicity in LDPE . Cell viability was found &gt;75% in MTT assay. These results suggested that the prepared hydrophilic LDPE is a potential candidate for biomedical applications and surface coatings with other polar polymer.",

The compression molding parameters such as temperature, pressure, and dwell time were optimized by Taguchi method, and these values are 225°C, 8 MP a, 5 min for tensile strength, 225°C, 5 MP a, 15 min for flexural, and 215°C, 3 MP a, 5 min for impact test. Flame retardancy in SRPC s has also been introduced as a new idea to minimize the flammability nature and is helpful in engineering applications. Flame retardants ( FR s) such as ammonium polyphosphate ( APP ), zinc borate (Zb), and magnesium hydroxide (Mg( OH ) 2 ) were used. The flame retardancy mechanism of optimized SRPC s works effectively which was evident by horizontal burning and LOI test. Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) was also studied to confirm the thermal properties of the composites. Mechanical properties were reasonably affected by the FR s as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope ( FESEM ).",

For polymers that have softening dynamics in glass–rubber transition region, the confinement effect can influence the molecular motions to different degrees.

In the differentia spectra, the confinement effect from additional components on local segment motions ( LSM ), sub‐Rouse modes, and Rouse modes was investigated, indicating that the effect on sub‐Rouse modes is smaller than that on Rouse modes but larger than that on LSM . Moreover, the coupling effects slightly change with introduction of the secondary components, which enables us to assume that the confinement effect has a linear relationship with the content of secondary components. Finally, it has been found that the decrease in tan δ exhibited a linear relationship with the content of secondary components.",

To improve the interfacial strength between SWNT s and CF , a hexahapto‐metal complex, Cr( CO ) 6 , was added to the electrophoretic system to prepare hierarchical fibers ( SWNT s‐Cr( CO ) 6 @ CF ). Results revealed that SWNT s covered CF surface entirely and formed a hierarchical structure. The morphology could be tailored from scattered nanotubes over forest to network by varying the deposition voltage. The hierarchical fibers were highly compatible with epoxy matrix, which could significantly increase the interfacial adhesion through interlocking epoxy matrix. Tensile properties were studied to investigate the effect of interfacial adhesion on mechanical properties of the reinforced composites. The polymeric composite, reinforced by SWNT s‐Cr( CO ) 6 @ CF , exhibited a remarkably high tensile strength of 519 MPa with the content ratio of 1.5:1 (Cr( CO ) 6 : SWNT s). The improvement was up to 193% compared to the desized CF composite and 19% compared to SWNT s@ CF composite.

    "abstract": "Abstract PTFE /ZnO films with varying ZnO thickness were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering under high vacuum (100W RF power). The PTFE /ZnO films show slight enhancement in transmission in the visible range as compared to bare ZnO films. There is a clear UV light cutoff (rapid fall below 380 nm with negligible transmission below ~300 nm) after 10‐min deposition of ZnO, which remains unaffected by further depositing PTFE . Transmission data reveal that absorption edge falls in the range of 300–380 nm, below which, the transmission reduced to only ~0.02% giving an optical density of 4 (for the film deposited for 20 min [total thickness ~415 nm]) in the 200–250 nm range. As the ZnO layer thickness increases, the polycrystallinity increases and simultaneously, roughness increases. It leads to a change in crystallite orientations and also in the distribution of grains on film surface. Corresponding AFM image shows island‐like growth, leading to an intermixed ZnO/ PTFE layer. The roughness of surface in lower as well as higher thickness range is found to be high (~8–9 nm) except the film in which continuous layer seems to be grown. Based on this, a layer model was developed that consists of glass substrate, native oxide SiO 2 layer on this substrate, then a dense ZnO layer followed by mixed PTFE /ZnO layer which is then covered by top PTFE as evident from the ellipsometry fitting. Overall results suggest that by choosing proper thicknesses and number of layers, such thin films might be used in antireflection coatings with UV protection below 400 nm. Based on these experimental results, an optimized simulated layer model consisting of suitable layer thicknesses of ZnO and PTFE has been suggested to achieve high transmission in the visible wavelength region.",

This study focuses on the identification of suitable filler–matrix combinations for the isotropic and anisotropic conductive film layers. Hence, monolayer films with different fillers and filler contents are extruded. Conductivities of 8.31 and 12 S/m were measured in cross and machine direction, respectively, for a polypropylene‐film with 10 wt.‐% of CNT . This is two magnitudes below the required 535 S/m. With 70 mS /m, the conductivity in thickness direction is 115–170 times lower. This is caused by process‐related surface layers with low filler content. For steel fibers, no electrical conductivity can be measured.",

The thermal characteristics were evaluated based on TG and DTA results. Two‐stage thermal decomposition is seen to mainly occur in the range of 700–970 K and the zeolite LTA added has considerably influenced the thermal behavior of PSF . Two isoconversional model‐free Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Coats–Redfern methods are employed to perform kinetic analysis of the mass loss versus temperature data, resulting in activation energy and pre exponential factor values. The activation energies obtained over the whole conversion range for two zeolite composites are considerably lower than those of pure PSF , possibly related to the catalytic effect of zeolite LTA added. The materials conversion functions D 5 and D 3 are found to more appropriately describe thermal degradation of PSF and its zeolite LTA hybrids. Using the kinetic parameters and conversion functions, the temperature‐dependent thermal conversion curves under different heating rates have been successfully recast, leading to excellent calculation results.",

The thickness of the S‐g‐ PEHA / PVA @clay thin films mainly depends on the polymerization of ethylhexylacrylate and concentrations of PVA . The presence of clay nanoparticles in S‐g‐ PEHA / PVA thin films was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analyses. The field emission scanning electron microscopy images showed the presence of exfoliated nanoclay throughout the films. High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy was also performed to determine the degree of distribution and exfoliation of clay platelets. The surface and nano‐tribological characteristics of the thin films were investigated by atomic force microscopy. It was found that the exfoliation and intercalation of clay platelets in thin films depend on the concentration of Cloisite ® 30B loading. The thermal conductivity, tensile strength, thermal properties, and refractive index were studied as a function of clay loading. It was noticed that tensile strength, thermal conductivity, thermal properties, and refractive index of the thin films were enhanced with the increase in Cloisite ® 30B content due to the formation of an exfoliated and partially intercalated structure of the S‐g‐ PEHA / PVA @clay. Chemical resistance and antibacterial and biodegradable properties of the thin films were also studied.

In the autoclave-assisted resin transfer molding (ARTM) process, the mold-filling pressure and the consolidation pressure were controlled by the autoclave in a continuous fashion during the mold filling and consolidation stages. Using a smart spacer inserted between the RTM molds, the part consolidation was effectively achieved after the complete mold filling, which consequently improved processing as well as performance characteristics of advanced composite materials. Visualizing the resin-front advancement, anisotropic permeabilities of several reinforcement fabrics were collectively determined by comparing the experimental results and Darcy's law. A finite element/control volume method was used to predict the resin pressure and flow front advancement during the ARTM process. Finally, the processing variables of resin bleeding, consolidation pressure, and surface formers were investigated to identify the ARTM processing and structural characteristics in high-performance composite utilization. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract The first quantitative description of melting in single screw extruders was given by Z. Tadmor around 1965. A simple analytical theory was developed for Newtonian fluids, assuming the fluid viscosity to be unaffected by changes in temperature. Also, an approximate analytical theory was developed for a power‐law fluid, assuming the power‐law constants to be independent of temperature and viscous dissipation to be negligible. Later workers extended the theory, however, most of these extensions did not allow closed‐form analytical solutions, thus requiring numerical techniques to obtain solutions. One of the most crucial assumptions in the analytical melting theory is the assumption that the viscosity of the polymer melt in the melt film is not affected by temperature differences in the melt film. This assumption has been eliminated in the improved melting theory by deriving an exact solution of the temperature and velocity profile in pure drag flow of a temperature dependent power‐law fluid between two parallel plates. It will be shown that the inclusion of the temperature dependence of the viscosity dramatically affects the predictions of the melting rate. It will further be shown how the new theory can be used to predict the optimum barrel temperature for melting.",

Using this strategy, the hold time is set once in reference to the sensor signal, providing the minimum proper hold time for each part under changing processing conditions. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Semirigid liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) show some advantages with respect to rigid LCPs: in particular lower processing temperatures, and better compatibility with flexible thermoplastics, but also some disadvantages: lower mechanical properties and poor thermomechanical resistance. Both properties can be improved by adding inorganic fillers. In this work, samples of a semirigid liquid crystalline polymer reinforced with carbon and glass fibers has been characterized. Although elastic modulus and tensile strength of the glass fiber filled LCP improve remarkably with increasing the filler content, the same properties for the carbon fiber-filled samples do not increase with increasing the content of the fiber; rather a maximum tensile strength is observed at about 20% of carbon fibers. The thermomechanical and the creep behavior are also drastically improved by adding the fibers. In particular, the creep curve is shifted by several decades toward longer times, and the heat distortion temperature increases about 60°C by adding 20% of carbon fibers. The processability is, on the other hand, significantly worsened. By comparing the results for the carbon fiber-filled samples with those obtained for the same polymer reinforced with glass fibers, it is worth noting that the properties are similar, but lower amounts of carbon fibers are needed to obtain the same mechanical and thermomechanical properties. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Laminar morphology of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/polyamide-6 (PA-6) blends was obtained, for the first time, in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The morphology analysis in the interior of the adapter, which connects the extruder with a slit die, revealed that, under specific processing conditions, it is possible to produce layers of PA-6 in the end of the screw zone of the extruder. The micrographs of the extruded final products showed distributed layers across the sample thickness and along the flow direction. The effect of design and processing variables such as adapter angle, die gap, temperature profile, feed rate, and screw speed on the final product morphology were evaluated. In this research, blends were obtained with toluene permeability reduced by up to 113 times from the permeability of the matrix alone. This value is 2.5 times better than the best value reported for products of single screw extrusion. Mechanical tests showed that the HDPE/PA-6 extrudates maintain stiffness and tensile strength values comparable to those of polyethylene. In order to obtain products with optimum balance between the permeability and the mechanical properties, a statistical analysis was carried out. It produced useful information regarding the important processing and design factors that affect the product properties. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 18: 89–108, 1999",

In the samples, storage and stress relaxation moduli were at least midway between those of pure PS and PVC. On the other hand, the equivalent uncompatibilized blend exhibited storage and stress relaxation moduli that are much lower than those of the soft PVC component. Stress relaxation moduli of pure PS remained fairly constant with time, while a 25% drop was observed for pure PVC after 120 sec. Also after 120 s, stress relaxation moduli for the uncompatibilized blend exhibited a 20% drop, while a less than 10% drop was observed for the compatibilized PS–PVC blends.",

The edge alignment can be achieved by lateral deflection control, provided that the film tension and transport speed are even at desired values. This article aims to correct the lateral deflection of films by designing robust controllers to swivel the guiding rollers and to maintain even tension and speed at target levels. The self‐tuning neuro‐proportional integral derivative controller and adaptive high‐gain output feedback controller are adopted to guide the lateral deflection so that the film aligns at the desired position. A control scheme, neuron controller by associative learning, is used for maintaining tension and speed control. These strategies are applied to a simplified PET film processing system. The experimental results demonstrate that in our setup, the control schemes can effectively alleviate not only the lateral deflection but also the tension and speed fluctuation at target levels. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The elastic constants were obtained, and, for different alignment angles and parameters in the fiber orientation distribution function, their numerical results were compared to those of the Mori–Tanaka model. Good agreement was obtained; thus, the employed FE model is an excellent and simple method to predict the isotropy and anisotropy of a composite with high-aspect-ratio fibers. Therefore, the FE model was employed to predict the orientation distribution of a composite fiber with a nonlinear matrix. The predicted and experimental results agree well.",

    "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM), as a kind of natural polymers, affects the migration and transport of ions and particles in soil system due to its surface characteristics and interaction and then causes significant changes in soil quality such as soil fertility loss and pollutant transfer. It is of great importance to study the temporal and spatial evolution of soil organic matter and its driving mechanism for soil health management. This study aims to fully reveal the evolution characteristics and driving mechanism of soil organic carbon (SOC) in farmland of the Beijing plain based on a six-year site monitoring. According to the research results, there is a significant difference in the overall soil organic content during the 6-year period. The temporal stability of SOC is moderate, and it is inversely proportional to SOC content in terms of spatial distribution. SOC content increases as organic fertilizer input rises, and an extra unit (15 kg· ha −1 ) of organic fertilizer input leads to an increase of 0.057 g·kg −1 in SOC content. The soil with higher clay content exhibits higher SOC content. The organic carbon content in different soil texture types increases with time, and there is a significant difference between the increases in medium loam and light loam. The grain field plantation system exhibited declining SOC content, while the protected vegetable fields, open vegetable fields, and orchards all showed an increase in SOC content. According to our results, the SOC content of farmland in the plain areas of Beijing is largely dependent on the input of organic carbon if other conditions remain unchanged or exhibit insignificant changes.",

    "abstract": "PEGylated or polyethylene glycol-modified proteins have been used as therapeutic agents in different diseases. However, the major drawback in their procurement is the purification process to separate unreacted proteins and the PEGylated species. Several efforts have been done to separate PEGylation reactions by chromatography using different stationary phases and modified supports. In this context, this study presents the use of chromatographic monoliths modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to separate PEGylated Ribonuclease A (RNase A). To do this, Convective Interaction Media (CIM) Ethylenediamine (EDA) monolithic disks were PEGylated using three PEG molecular weights (1, 10, and 20 kDa). The PEGylated monoliths were used to separate PEGylated RNase A modified, as well, with three PEG molecular weights (5, 20, and 40 kDa) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Performance results showed that Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) can bind to PEGylated monoliths and the amount of bound BSA increases when ammonium sulfate concentration and flow rate increase. Furthermore, when PEGylated RNase A was loaded into the PEGylated monoliths, PEG-PEG interactions predominated in the separation of the different PEGylated species (i.e., mono and di-PEGylated). It was also observed that the molecular weight of grafted PEG chains to the monolith impacts strongly in the operation resolution. Interestingly, it was possible to separate, for the first time, isomers of 40 kDa PEGylated RNase A by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This technology, based on PEGylated monoliths, represents a new methodology to efficiently separate proteins and PEGylated proteins. Besides, it could be used to separate other PEGylated molecules of biopharmaceutical or biotechnological interest.",

The results show that the kinetics data fit the pseudo-second-order model well ( R 2 = 0.9991), and the intraparticle diffusion model has 3 diffusion stages, preliminarily indicating that chemisorption plays a major role in the adsorption process, and the sorption mechanism includes intraparticle, external, and boundary diffusion.

    "abstract": "ASP (alkali-surfactant-polymer) is acknowledged as an effective technology to improve the oil recovery. The microscopic displacement efficiency and macroscopic sweep efficiency have been discussed in detail for the past few years. However, development performance, especially pressure characteristics, needs to be further studied. This paper aims to explore the pressure evolution performance during ASP flooding, of which the results will shed light on development characteristics of ASP flooding. The study on ASP flooding pressure field development is conducted by laboratory and numerical methodology. A large sandpack laboratory model with vertical heterogeneous layers is used to monitor pressure performance during the ASP flooding. With the help of interpolation methods, a precise and intuitive pressure field is obtained based on pressure data acquired by limited measurement points. Results show that the average formation pressure and its location are changing all the time in the whole process. In addition, the influence of heterogeneity and viscosity on recovery and pressure is also probed in this paper. We built a numerical simulation model to match the experiment data considering the physical and chemical alternation in ASP flooding. Also, response surface methodology (RSM) is adopted to obtain the formula between pressure functions and influencing factors.",

In this context, PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles were prepared by the thin-film hydration method, and the toxicity of PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles to brain capillary endothelial cell (BCEC) was detected by MTT. The BCEC/TF cell model was obtained by induction of BCEC cells with TNF- α . The BCEC/TF cell model was identified by immunofluorescence; the protein expression was detected by western blotting; the expression level of miR-424 in cells was measured by RT-qPCR; the targeting relationship between miR-424 and PDCD4 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. We found that PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles prepared by the thin-film hydration method had uniform particle size, regular shape, and good stability and were not toxic to cells. The vWF was widely expressed in the cytoplasm in BCECs. The BCEC/TF cell model was obtained after TNF-α treatment, and tissue factor (TF) was widely expressed on the cell membrane of BCEC/TF cells. Furthermore, it was observed that the PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles showed better therapeutic effect on the BCEC/TF cell model than PUE. PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles and PUE inhibited the expression of PDCD4 protein by increasing the expression of miR-424 in BCEC/TF cells. In summary, the therapeutic effect of PEG-PLGA/PUE nanoparticles on the in vitro cell model of cerebral infarction is better than that of PUE. Moreover, PEG-PLGA/PUE inhibits the expression of PDCD4 protein by lowering the expression level of miR-424 in cells, thereby reducing the hazard of cerebral infarction.",

Spearman correlation analysis was used to prove the systematic correlation of the model uncertainty factors. For each model, a regression function f was established to eliminate the systematic nonrandom part of the model uncertainty factor. Then, the model uncertainty factors could be described by random variables obeying logarithmic normal distribution.

Six different types of foams, viz., highly elastic foam K5040, standard PU foam N5063, bonded polyurethane foam R100, viscoelastic foam V5020, self-extinguishing foam KF5560, and foam rubber, were used. The samples were collected at the intervals of 72 hours and 672 hours (28 days) to identify the odors due to chemical reactions in the material or slowly released due to its porous structure. Additionally, repeated-use studies were done to understand the effect of prolonged usage/natural ageing on emitted odors from the foams. The samples were tested as per ČSN EN 13 725 (2005) and ISO 16000-6 (2011) criteria using GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detector) and olfactometry. The most unpleasant substance was found to be nonanal, with an average score of -4 (unpleasant). A total of 23 compounds were identified (5 unidentified) using olfactometry; however, only 11 of them were confirmed by GC-FID-based testing.

Herein, a unique molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) yolk-shell nanostructure (MYNS) was prepared and incorporated into the polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix to fabricate MMMs for model gasoline desulfurization by PV. Moreover, the effects of MYNS content, feed sulfur concentration, and feed temperature on the performance of PEG/MYNS MMMs were evaluated. It was found that there is good interfacial compatibility between the MYNS filler and the PEG matrix, and the resultant MMMs show enhanced swelling resistance against thiophene. The PV results revealed that the as-fabricated MMMs are thiophene-selective, and their desulfurization performance in the pervaporative removal of thiophene from n-octane is remarkably evaluated due to the addition of MYNS. The MMMs display the highest sulfur enrichment factor of 4.02 with an associated permeation flux of 2587 g·m−2·h−1 with the MYNS loading of 3 wt. % when carrying out in an n-octane and thiophene (500 μg·g−1) mixture at 343 K. Furthermore, a consistent increment in the permeation flux accompanied with a continuous reduction in the enrichment factor was observed with increasing the feed sulfur concentration and feed temperature. This work may offer great potential for practical gasoline desulfurization applications.",

Nafion is a very stable copolymer, easily available and relatively inexpensive. This allows us to envision the possibility of having cheap and reliable sensors to detect vapors of these substances based on this copolymer. The main result of the present work is that Nafion can protonate gaseous ions from organic solvents, such as acetone and similar substances, which modify its electrical properties, presenting a differentiated behavior according to the chemical nature of these substances, which could lead to their identification, designing an electrical nose, because each behavior is a fingerprint of the substance to detect. Then, this material can be used in the design of electrical sensors, which can be inexpensive, reliable, and chemically stable, representing an excellent alternative to ceramic sensors.",

Microphotography was performed while tensile tests were conducted on a universal testing machine at tensile rates of 2 mm/min, 10 mm/min, and 500 mm/min. Specimen measurements were obtained by digital image correlation (DIC). The strain fields on the surfaces and around the cracks were studied, and the crack propagation trends for precracked specimens with angles of 0°, 45°, and 75° with respect to the horizontal plane were investigated. Stress–strain curves, tensile microscopic images (50x magnification), and fracture microscopic images (100x magnification) were obtained for different prefabricated crack angles and different stretching rates. It was observed that under low-rate stretching, the propellant crack growth exhibited three stages: a linear stage, a yield stage, and a failure stage. However, the crack propagation in the propellant under high-speed stretching had no yield stage. When there were no prefabricated cracks, a greater tensile rate led to a greater ultimate strain. The maximum strains at the crack tips measured by DIC decreased from group C1 to groups C2, C3, and S. The specimens corresponding to different crack inclination angles are pulled off. It was seen that the closer a crack was to positive breaking, the straighter was the edge notch of the specimen.",

The FT-IR, Raman, XRD, and TGA collectively demonstrated the successful modification of PSQ on the surface of CNTs. The incorporation of PSQ could significantly improve the dispersion of CNTs in the silicon rubbers, and a strong interfacial interaction was formed between CNTs-PSQ and silicon rubber matrix, as observed from TEM images of silicon rubber/CNTs-PSQ nanocomposites.

The hydrophobic interaction, the Van der Waals attractive force, and the steric repulsive force were expressed in terms of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>N</mi> </math> , <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>σ</mi> </math> , and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"> <mi>x</mi> </math> . The osmotic constant (k1) and the entropic constant (k2) were determined from the fit of the steric repulsive force to an experimentally obtained force distance curve. The osmotic constant was 0.105, and the entropic constant was 0.255. Using these constants, the steric repulsive force was plotted as a function of the separation distance(s) between the substrate and the protein. The forces were determined at a separation distance equal to 0.3 nm, where L0 is the equilibrium thickness of the PNIPAM brush. At this separation distance, the value of the steric repulsive force was much higher than the value of the sum of the hydrophobic interaction and the Van der Waals attractive force for large degree of polymerization ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"> <mi>N</mi> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mn>100</mn> </math> ) and density ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M7\"> <mi>σ</mi> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mn>0.2</mn> </math> chains/nm2). However, the repulsive force was comparable to the sum of the hydrophobic interaction and the Van der Waals attractive force for a small degree of polymerization ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M8\"> <mi>N</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>100</mn> </math> ) and density ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M9\"> <mi>σ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.2</mn> </math> ). Furthermore, the steric repulsive force was plotted as a function of pattern size <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M10\"> <mi>x</mi> </math> . The plot indicated that the steric repulsive force becomes nearly zero for all degrees of polymerization and density when the value of the initiator structure size was less than 200 nm. In addition to the steric repulsive force, the lateral extension of the chains in the periodically patterned PNIPAM brush was calculated by scaling low and compared with the experimental data taken from previously published literatures. The polymer brush structure was modelled as if the immediate bare substrate is so wide that even a stretched polymer segment cannot reach to the next polymer brush structure. In such models, the value of the lateral extension was equal to the thickness of the homogenous brush. It was independent of the pattern size. However, when the polymer brush structure was modelled as if there is another polymer brush structure at a distance half of the size of the period, the lateral extension was found to be dependent on the size of the initiator structure size due to chain bridging. This was witnessed by the patterning of polymer brushes using the interferometric patterning of PNIPAM brushes and an atomic force microscopy imaging of the polymer brush structures both in air and in water. The polymer brush structure resolution in water was much lower than the resolution in air, which indicates the lateral extension of the polymer chains in water. For such kind of periodic polymer brush structures, the gap between them was calculated, and it was found dependent on the degree of polymerization, density, and initiator structure size.",

However, the surface of the materials is easily contaminated by microorganisms, resulting in serious problems. To solve this issue, a new type of antibacterial polymer fluorescent coating was successfully synthesized by copolymerization of divinylbenzene with 7-methacryloxy-4-methyl coumarin, dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate, and other monomers. The surface structure and thermal stability of the coating were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Fluorine was polymerized into the polymer, improving the thermal stability compared to polystyrene and polydivinylbenzene. The bactericidal and antibacterial adhesion properties of the coating materials were studied by a contact germicidal test and antibacterial adhesion test. The polymer had a strong inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus. After immersion in room temperature water, the film maintained its strong inhibitory effect on S. aureus fluorescence intensity and had high fluorescence stability.",

    "abstract": "In order to reveal the dielectric properties of the nonaqueous reactive polyurethane grouting material, combined with the electron microscope test analysis, it can be seen that the nonaqueous reactive polyurethane material is a porous two-phase body composed of a polyurethane matrix and closed cells. At the microscopic scale, the porous two-phase physical model is established, and the dielectric model of the material is constructed on this basis. In order to verify the dielectric model, 40 groups of nonaqueous reactive polyurethane specimens with different densities were designed and prepared in this paper. The dielectric permittivity was measured by a vector network analyzer (VNA) with an open coaxial probe within the frequency range of 1050 MHz~5010 MHz for the first time, and the dielectric properties and influencing factors were revealed according to the test data. The result shows that the dielectric permittivity of nonaqueous reactive polyurethane materials increases with the increase of density, and decreases slightly with the increase of frequency. Compared with the three models of the Rule of Mixture, Clausius-Mossotti Model and Lichtenecker Model, the calculation accuracy of the Maxwell-Garnett Model is higher, and the calculation results are more consistent with the experimental results of nonaqueous reactive polyurethane grouting materials. The experimental results can be applied to the nondestructive testing of polyurethane grouting materials and provide reference and basis for the quality evaluation of polymer structures.",

The soft segment length was varied from 2500 to 11,000 g/mol using dimethylterephthalate as a chain extender. The copolymers are characterized by inherent viscosity measurements, Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), water absorption, and solvent resistivity. The inherent viscosity increases with increasing soft segment length. Depending on the amide concentration in the copolymers, the hard segment melting temperature ranged between 248 and 287°C. From the FTIR, DSC, and wide angle X‐ray diffraction results, it is concluded that the hard segments in the copolymer are crystallized completely. All the polymers showed single‐stage decomposition temperature centered around 430°C.

The resulting changes in visibility are analyzed to investigate the effect of the weight ratio of the microballs in the dielectric layer.

The variation in ε′with temperature in different temperature regions has been analyzed in relation to the dipole structure of the molecules. The ε′′– T plots of pristine liquid crystalline polyurethane (LCPU) reveal the presence of multiple relaxation processes associated with the crankshaft motion of but‐2‐ene groups, dipolar nature of carbonyl groups, and glass transition temperature, respectively. An additional dielectric loss peak is observed in irradiated LCPU samples associated with the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) polarization. There is an overall increase in ε′ in irradiated samples due to the dominance of MWS polarization arising from the large number of radiation‐induced defect sites and free radicals. The loss in γ relaxation due to chain scissions of but‐2‐ene groups and the formation of new subpolar groups providing a new dipolar relaxation process is observed in irradiated LCPU samples. The variation in ε′ with fluence shows the occurrence of a secondary radiation induced crystallization in irradiated LCPU samples. The X‐ray diffraction analysis also shows the effect of fluence on the crystalline nature of LCPU samples.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) provides interesting information about the dynamic viscoelastic properties and molecular scale motions. This article presents the results of an investigation into the effects of draw ratio and supercritical CO2 (scCO2) exposure on structural changes and mesomorphic transitions in cold-drawn poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers by focus on DMA. Samples of partially oriented yarn PET fibers were uniaxially drawn below the glass transition temperature (Tg) using various draw ratios to obtain filaments with different structures for subsequent exposure to scCO2 in the presence and absence of tension at a temperature of 80°C and under a pressure of 220 bar. Microstructural investigation of the samples was carried out by combining the results obtained from DMA, differential scanning calorimetry, as well as density and birefringence measurements, all of which exhibited a good correlation. The rigid amorphous region in the PET samples was considered for interpreting structure–property relations. Results showed that increasing draw ratio leads to increased values of rigid amorphous regions and distribution of molecular orientation in the amorphous regions followed by an increase in the relaxation time distribution. Depending on sample conditions, exposure to scCO2 was found to have a strong effect on the transformation of the transient structure into crystalline or amorphous regions. PET fibers exposed to scCO2 under tension yielded higher values of crystallinity and orientation compared to those under no tension. In the case of PET fibers exposed to scCO2 under no tension, CO2 molecules released from the structure possibly caused a metastable structure to form in the amorphous phase. Therefore, rearrangement of molecular chains during the dynamic mechanical test in the temperature sweep mode is expected to increase the storage modulus of the sample before its glass transition temperature is reached. As a result, an increment is observed in the storage modulus of samples exposed to scCO2 without tension that can be related to the release of stress stored during the depressurization process. scCO2 exposure can be, therefore, claimed to be an environmentally friendly method for inducing structural changes and enhancing crystallinity in PET samples.",

It is also a grouting medium in orthopedic joint replacement surgeries as they possess fast primary fixation to the bone. Considering the cement properties and in vitro bioactivity of bone cement is essential for cemented hip and knee joint replacement surgeries. In this study, commercial Simplex P bone cement (SPBC) is modified with carboxyl- (-COOH-) functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to overcome high polymerization temperature, volumetric shrinkage, surface wettability, and in vitro bioactivity. A geometric dilution method is used to incorporate MWCNTs with the PMMA powder, which is in unequal proportions. The PMMA/MWCNT nanocomposite with different concentrations of reinforcements, such as 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 weight percentages, is prepared for the investigation. It was observed that the MWCNTs had a beneficial impact on PMMA bone cement (PMMA-BC) by enhancing its setting time (2.94%↑) and surface wettability (23.58%↑). Also, diminished polymerization temperature (29%↓) and volumetric shrinkage (40.9%↓) are observed for an optimum concentration of 0.7 wt. %. The bioactivity of the cement surface is validated by the in vitro bioactivity observed in simulated body fluid (SBF) through the development of primary and secondary apatite. It is concluded that the synthesized PMMA/MWCNT nanocomposites are found to have enhanced cement properties compared to PMMA-BC.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is one of the most common and significant phenomenon in nature, and epoxy resin is one of the most widely used and researched thermosetting resins, however the influences of chiral carbon in epoxy group on the performances of the cured epoxy resins have ever been hardly studied, therefore it is crucial and meaningful to explore the structure–function relationship of chirality and performance of epoxy resins. Herein, from the analysis of synthesis mechanism, the different chiral configuration with high percent enantiomeric excess (&gt;99%) and racemic bisphenol A epoxy resins were simply prepared by controlling the chirality of epichlorohydrin. The apparent activation energy of the curing process with D230 was calculated by Kissinger method and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method, respectively, and both results indicate that chirality have no effect on the curing reaction. We found that the secondary structure of epoxy monomer is untouched by its chirality, and they are all right helix structure. For this reason, the thermal stability, glass transition temperature, and thermomechanical properties of diverse chiral epoxy resins cured by D230 have no significant difference. Nevertheless, it was found that the optical rotation activity of chiral epoxy resins can be partially maintained after curing reaction, it manifests the cured products of chiral epoxy resins possesses the possibility of application in the field of polarized materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Weld lines are known to present serious problems, especially in injection molding processes. They usually represent the weakest region in a molded part in terms of mechanical properties. They are also known to be even weaker in the case of blends. In this work, the mechanical properties and the morphology of injection molded polycarbonate (PC), high‐density polyethylene (HDPE), and their blends (PC/PE) were investigated. This typically immiscible blend was compatibilized by the addition of small amounts (&lt;5% by weight) of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) containing 60% by weight vinyl acetate. The modified and nonmodified blends were injection molded in the presence of weld lines using a double‐gate dogbone‐shaped tensile bar mold. The weld line strength and its morphology were investigated as a function of injection temperature. In the case of pure polycarbonate, the weld line strength was found to be very sensitive to injection temperature whereas for polyethylene no difference was observed between the strength of the nonwelded and the welded specimens. For the 80/20 PC/PE blend, the weld line strength is lower compared to that of the blend components. The addition of less than 1% of EVA increased the strength of the weld line above that of the neat blend. The morphology of the nonmodified blend was similar to that of a typical immiscible blend (i.e., PE spheres dispersed in a rigid matrix of PC). However, addition of the copolymer to the blend resulted in a better phase dispersion and finer PE particles. In addition, the V‐notch in the middle of the sample was greatly reduced by the addition of the copolymer. This was experimentally investigated by scanning electron microscopy in the region of the weld line. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The roles of mixing and kinetics in the free‐radical reaction are investigated. The modification experiments use a masterbatch feed of HDPE with various concentrations of 2,5‐dimethyl‐2,5‐( t ‐butylperoxy)‐3‐hexyne. The extruder operating parameters studied were barrel temperature, screw speed, and the degree of screw flight stagger. The reaction model is fit using the molecular weight averages and the gel content measured experimentally. The reaction time for HDPE is determined by use of the residence time distribution of the extruder with a segregation (macromixing) assumption. The segregation model is compared against the plug flow assumption, where the mean residence time of the measured distribution is used for the length of reaction of all polymer species within the extruder. The calculated molecular weight distributions are insensitive to the mixing model used. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The first one consists of solving the balance equations (mass, momentum, and energy) that govern the polymer flow and cooling. The shrinkage and warpage of the part are then deduced from this solution. The second approach is empirical and consists of fitting a model to experimental data. In this article, a new empirical method of prediction, based on dual kriging interpolation, is proposed. A theoretical validation is performed on a set of experimental measurements.

The rheological behavior of the polymer is described by the Carreau equation, while elasticity is neglected. The results of the numerical calculations are compared with measurements. The stress field is measured by the birefringence method. The local principal stresses in the fluid are determined from the measured anisotropy of the sheared fluid for the penetrating monochromatic light by means of the stress optical law. The equations of motion and continuity are solved with a Finite Element Method (FEM) based on the Galerkin weighted residual method. The computer code is combined with a Boundary Element Method (BEM) algorithm using the Dual Reciprocity Method (DRM) to solve the coupled equation of energy. Results are shown for a shear‐thinning polyisobutene melt in a calender with totally submerged rolls. The calculated results for the principal stress differences are compared to the measured results and confirm fairly well. The influence of friction is discussed. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The article presented here introduces a technique for the computation of the output performance in grooved‐barrel extruders in the transport stiff as well as in the pressure gradient dependent range. This also allows the computation of optional multisection screws with shear and mixing sections.

    "abstract": "Abstract Plastic bottles for carbonated beverages have many advantages over glass and metal containers. However, plastic bottles are also known to be imperfect barriers for gaseous fluids; i.e., they are semipermeable. This characteristic results in serious carbon dioxide transmission losses, particularly on the ½‐L or smaller single‐service bottles which have high area‐to‐volume ratios. Shelf life of these smaller beverage containers is therefore reduced. This article combines literature data and a simple diffusion model to predict shelf life for PET beverage bottles. As anticipated, the model shows that the smaller bottles have an unacceptable shelf life based on industrial standards. Moreover, while refrigerated temperatures increase shelf life to acceptable levels, temperatures for storage above 100°F can also reduce the 2‐L bottle to less than acceptable levels. The shelf life predictions developed with the model are close to those observed in practice. Further manipulation with the model shows that a hypothetical multilayered barrier wall could be constructed which would give an acceptable shelf life at any reasonable temperature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The morphology and properties of polymer alloys and blends can be controlled via phase separation or phase dissolution during cure. The morphology and properties control by phase separation was achieved by simultaneously manipulating miscibility, kinetics of phase separation, and cure reaction of polymer systems. Using phase diagrams consisting of binodal and spinodal curves, the morphology of epoxy/CTBN (carboxyl‐terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer) systems can be controlled by the mechanism of nucleation and growth or by spinodal decomposition. We have found that the particle size of the rubber reinforcement in epoxies is affected by the mechanisms of phase separation. Phase separation by nucleation and growth gives larger rubber particles than the corresponding phase separation by spinodal decomposition. This contrast in the morphology development is the consequence of controlling phase separation through chemorheological behavior. Modification of the phase separation kinetics in epoxy/CTBN systems was extremely effective at altering both morphology and properties of these alloys. This technique offers a mean to shift the glass transition temperature of the rubber‐rich phase while leaving the glass transition temperature of the epoxy‐rich phase intact. Such control over morphology is the key to ultimately controlling material properties. The morphology and properties can also be controlled by phase dissolution during cure via invoking anion–cation interactions or intrachain repulsion forces. Phase dissolution in elastomer blending is the key for achieving optimal morphology having a synergistic effect in the polymer blends. The morphology and properties of NR (natural rubber)/EPDM blends were controlled through compatibilization and co‐vulcanization to promote phase dissolution during cure. A synergistic result in the blends was achieved by having an interconnected phase morphology. The domain sizes of the blends are 3–5 μm before cure and 1–2 μm after cure. These blends showed superior mechanical properties to those of the individual NR or EPDM, after a long term of high temperature aging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing significance of polypropylene for packing materials is leading to a more widespread use of this semi‐crystalline thermoplastic as film, vacuum‐formed packagings and blow moldings. This paper deals both with the extrusion of semi‐finished ware (film/sheet) and with the biaxial stretching, thermoforming and stretch blow molding of PP. It begins with the influence of cooling on the crystallization and the structure, taking into account various nucleation possibilities. It was found that regranulated scrap as a nucleation additive with PP homopolymer can lead to a fine, spherulitic structure of high crystallinity, which is of particular significance for its use as thermoformed sheet. The relationship between crystallinity or density and mechanical properties was not clear provided there was an influence of defects ( e.g. in the spherulite border in the case of a coarse structure). What proved to be dependent on this was both an increase and a decrease in the modulus of elasticity with rising density. With the biaxial stretching of the sheet of PP homopolymer and copolymer in a stretching frame, there were marked differences in the overall properties of the stretched sheets as far as the mechanical strength data were concerned. Whereas, in the case of the copolymer, the stress at break and modulus of elasticity could only be raised slightly, in the case of the homopolymer, increases in Young's modulus of 100% and more were achieved. With biaxial stretching, only a small influence on the cooling rate was noticeable, and yet the effect of the thermal history from the extrusion was particularly marked during the subsequent thermoforming process. There, a coarse structure led to poorer product properties, it is impossible to compensate this by varying the forming temperature or the mold temperature. The forming temperature nevertheless proved to be the decisive parameter for the quality of the molding; as the forming temperature rises, there is a major increase in the molding accuracy of the radii and in the gloss. The thermal shrinkage drops. We can conclude from this that polypropylene should be formed just below its melt point. With the aid of theoretical observations, the cooling and conditioning phase for a PP stretch‐blowing process are explained “out of first heat”, which was realized and examined in a machine concept—8‐stage machine. With cycle times of approximately 15 s, it was possible to manufacture 1 1 bottles with a crystallinity of 40–45%.",

None of the major plastics involved (nylons and HDPE) was found to be significantly altered after exposure; accelerated thermal stability tests also indicate that these plastics could be reprocessed to acceptable products. Strong evidence suggests, however, that PP found in minor quantities would further degrade during extrusion. The presence of asphaltic and alkyd‐type coatings on the nylon fibers was shown to complicate the characterization and melt flow behavior. Preliminary data on extrusion conditions and the effects of coatings and additives on the mechanical properties of injection molded compounds are presented.

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanics of energy conversion in an extruder is extremely complex. Generally speaking, the extrusion process utilizes two sources of energy: (1) mechanical energy which is imparted to the polymer by the rotational motion of the screw, and (2) thermal energy (heat) which flows between the polymer and surfaces of the barrel by conduction and convection. Modern extrusion processes are relatively wasteful of energy because, operating at high speeds, they often dissipate an excess of mechanical energy as heat that has to be transferred (by barrel cooling) from the polymer and discharged into the surroundings as waste energy. Until recently, little attention was paid to this wasted energy. Energy was relatively cheap and the process economics favored was high speed operation despite its associated energy wastage. With the recent introduction of gear pumps for extruders, low pressure extruder operation becomes a possibility. It appears that this type of operation may result in a significant improvement in energy efficiency. This paper attempts to analyze the energy economy of extrusion processes and to understand where and how energy savings can result from the use of gear pumps. It shows that if substantial energy savings are to result from the use of gear pumps, these savings will come about not because of increased pumping efficiencies, but because low pressure operation has made a fundamental change in the energy conversion processes occurring in the screw.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The design of extrusion lines deals with the extruder and the die as well as with the down stream equipment, especially the cooling section. This paper aids in the design of these three units, regarding different aspects. The scale‐up of extruders by means of the model theory is demonstrated in its practical use with examples. Emphasis is laid on the design of series of single screw extruders with mixing‐pins and of twin‐screw extruders (scale‐up). There the adequate selection of the necessary restrictions for the compilation of model laws is discussed in detail. This is an approach to the safe machine design on the basis of model theory. The present standard of the calculation of threedimensional flow patterns in extrusion dies by means of the finite‐element‐method (FEM) is shown in order to point out how design‐aids for the die‐designer are derived from these calculations. After a discussion of application‐criteria for the FEM, examples will show possible ways of using FEM‐results. For the shaping of Y‐branches in twin‐screw machines the FEM‐results point to possible plate‐out areas and to their avoidance by geometrical modifications. The calculation of a die for a T‐profile helps to design the passages between entry and exit sections. Finally, flow coefficients for the calculation of pressure losses in different cross sections are given. The design and optimization of cooling sections, as it can be done with the aid of the actual cooling models, is shown for some important extrusion processes. Heat transfer coefficients for practical cases (film‐sheet‐, pipe‐ and parison extrusion) are presented. Examples show, how diagrams for the design and optimization of cooling sections (for example the reduction of internal stresses and warping) can be made, using a microcomputer.",

For that purpose, a modified Leonov model is employed and the spectra and model parameters are estimated through nonlinear regression using measured steady shear viscosity data and extensional viscosity data calculated from Cogswell's method. Using the proposed methodology, the spectra of several resins were estimated and they were used in a Maxwell model to predict the linear viscoelastic properties of these resins. The predicted properties (storage and loss moduli and complex viscosity) were found to be in very good agreement with data from oscillatory shear measurements, thus supporting the validity of the estimated relaxation spectra. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents the development of a hybrid process combining the forming of a superplastic zinc–aluminum sheet with injection molding. The product is a plastic part covered with a superplastic zinc–aluminum layer used mainly for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. This hybrid process involves not only molding a plastic plate, but also forming a superplastic zinc–aluminum sheet with features such as ribs. This research observes the process of filling the cavity and forming the superplastic sheet with the aid of short‐shot experiments. By understanding the molding and forming process, guidelines for process control will be derived. This research further investigates the moldability of SIM systems. To make satisfactory parts, sheet thickness, melt temperature, injection parameters, and other process parameters determine the “moldability” of a specific system. The first part of the moldability study is to identify the relative importance of these process parameters. Results show that melt temperature and injection pressure are the two most critical parameters. The second part of this moldability study is to develop the moldability diagrams based on the molding area on the plane of these two key parameters. Moldability diagrams are employed to evaluate the effects of sheet thicknesses and melt inlets. It is found that a thick sheet, high melt temperature, and an inlet providing short flow length improve moldability. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 20: 216–225, 2001",

MFI was the primary factor influencing tensile strength and elongation at break. Volume and surface resistivity of blends were also studied.

Compared to its polymer analogue of PT2‐TPA (with only one thiophene spacer and without the pendant electron‐deficient group), the 2D‐conjugated and side chain isolated PT4‐CTPA with the electron‐withdrawing carbonyl group on the conjugated side chain shows a lower lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level at –5.24 eV and enhanced absorption of the polymer backbone.

Effects of the cross‐linker ratio, acid concentration, and Ce(IV) molar ratios on swelling behavior of the resulting hydrogels have been studied. These experiments show that increasing cross‐linker content has greatly reduced the equilibrium swelling ratios as expected. Interestingly, the increase in the Ce(IV) concentration ( n Ce(IV) = n MPA ) has resulted in a decrease in the swelling ratio. Because the thiol group in 3‐mercaptosuccinic acid acts as a cross‐linking agent, more cross‐linking occurs with an increase in the Ce(IV) concentration and Ce(III) forming in the cross‐linking polymerization reaction of AAm with MBAA may provide the formation of intermolecular complexes between amide groups in polymer chains; the swelling equilibrium ratio and swelling rate decrease with an increase in their concentrations in the cross‐linking polymerization reaction of AAm with MBAA. Kinetics and equilibrium swelling values have been discussed in terms of reaction parameters. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Poly(NIPA‐ co ‐AAc) copolymers were prepared by free radical cross‐linking copolymerization. The fluorescence intensity, I , of pyranine, introduced as a probe, increased as drying time was increased for all samples. The behavior of I was modeled by using the Stern–Volmer equation combined with the moving boundary diffusion model. The desorption coefficient, D , increased as NIPA content was increased at a given temperature. Gravimetric and volumetric experiments also supported the results of the fluorescence technique. The energy, Δ E, values were measured for the drying processes for each molar percentage of NIPA monomer content by using fluorescence, gravimetric, and volumetric methods, respectively. It is understood that Δ E values decrease by increasing NIPA content, until 50% NIPA, and then increase after 50% NIPA, indicating that the phase separation has occurred at 50% NIPA. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The fibrin‐based and cyanoacrylate adhesives are mostly used nowadays, but they still have some problems that are difficult to solve. The urethane‐based adhesive has been considered as the most promising material because they are biocompatible and able to react with the amine groups of proteins on the living tissues. Its curing is, however, not satisfactory due to the aliphatic isocyanates used for its biocompatibility. Therefore, in this work, l ‐3,4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine ( l ‐DOPA) as a third component from mussel's adhesive proteins was introduced to the urethane prepolymer to enhance the adhesive ability through a series of chemical reactions such as esterification, amidation, and handling of protection groups.

Ion‐induced optical, structural, and surface modifications were studied by ultraviolet‐visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X‐ray diffractrometer (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The decrease in the band gap was found to be more in the case of the Ni ion beam as compared to the Li ion beam. The intensity of the infrared bands, characteristics of different chemical functional groups are found to be decreased with swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation.

    "abstract": "Abstract In stretch below molding the stretching temperature has the most significant influence on the article performance besides the stretching ratio. Therefore, a very sophisticated control system was developed for a laboratory stretch below molding plant on which PP bottles are produced. The processing window for the stretching of the used polypropylene homopolymer is within a temperature range of 145–153°C. For that reason a very precisely operating temperature control system had to be developed and integrated into the microprocessor, which runs the complete process beginning with the heating of the preform and ending with demolding the finished bottle. For the heating infrared heaters are used, which are able to heat up the preform (6 mm wall thickness) in times of about 60 s. During the so‐called transient time shortly before the preform is moved into the mold, its surface temperature is read at four different spots simultaneously. That is done by a device developed especially for this task, which consists mainly of four pyrometers. The temperature signals are fed into the microprocessor which then in the case of deviation from the set points adjusts the power of the IR heaters. The closed‐loop temperature control is done by a special algorithm, which takes into account that the controlled system is a coupled multivariable system, which is modeled by a system of linear equations. Tests have proved that the control system is able to react fast and precisely to set point changes and to keep the preform temperature and its distribution constant throughout the production within a range of approximately 2°C.",

The quality of injection-compression–molded parts is evaluated using roundness, straightness, and birefringence.

Most production extruders have excellent process controllers, but they generally lack data acquisition systems. Because of these equipment limitations, all transient, unsteady-state data for a process are unavailable for analysis. Highlighted in this article are four case studies where transient data were collected and used (1) for the diagnosis and elimination of extrusion instabilities; (2) to show differences between competing resin processability; and (3) in extrusion research. In all cases, a portable data acquisition system was temporarily connected to the extruder control panel and was used to collect transient process data. For extruder instability problems, the data collected were used to help diagnose and eliminate the problems quickly, bringing the extrusion lines up to standard production in the shortest possible time, minimizing costly recycle, and maximizing the profits for the processors. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Water‐soluble polyacrylamides bearing meso ‐2,3‐dimercaptosuccinic acid end groups were synthesized using meso ‐2,3‐dimercaptosuccinic acid as a reducing agent. The effects of parameters such as the molar ratio of acrylamide to initiator, temperature, polymerization time, and sulfuric acid concentration on the yields and molecular weights of polymers were investigated. The augmentation in initiator concentration resulted in a decrease in molecular weight but an increase in the yield of polymers. The increase in reaction temperature from 20 to 60°C led to a decrease in the yield from 56.80% to 20.58%. Ce(IV) and Mn(VII) ions are reduced to Ce(III) and Mn(II) ions in the polymerization reaction and the synthesized acrylamide polymers containing meso ‐2,3‐dimercaptosuccinic acid end groups can absorb these ions at the end of the polymerization reaction.

Fiber is drawn on a single pair of shaped rolls through a large number of small draw increments within a compact space. Draw zone length and residence time are increased substantially, allowing time for morphological change. Stress relaxation between draw increments and adjustment of temperature, tension, and rate of deformation (draw) at each draw increment more effectively control stress induced crystal growth and amorphous orientation. Ultra‐orientation, improved tensile modules high tenacity, low break elongation, and low boil‐off shrinkage have been produced. Because rates of plastic deformation during drawing are drastically reduced, high fiber throughput speeds are possible, allowing direct coupling to high speed spinning lines.

    "abstract": "Abstract The synthesis of many thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers can be accomplished by dispersing the monomer (or a blend of monomers) to be polymerized in water with the aid of various surfactants. The monomer is then polymerized by the introduction of a free radical catalyst to produce a latex of the polymer. Coagulation is the first step in isolating the polymer from the latex, and typically, many subsequent process steps are required to “finish” the polymer to the pelletized or expanded crumb from suitable for end users to convert the polymer into useful products. The process described herein combines all the process steps required to coagulate, separate and dewater, wash, devolatilize, homogenize and pump the polymer in a single‐step, short residence time system. The machine employed for this process is a counter‐rotating, tangentially opposed twin‐screw extruder. One important variation of the basic process combines an integral plasticating extrusion step with the latex conversion to make polymer blends and alloys. Critical process parameters are identified and discussed and examples of pilot plant scale experimental data for ABS (acrylonitrile‐butadiene‐styrene terpolymer) systems are reviewed.",

In this study, a simple statistical design of experiments is used to optimize and characterize extrusion behavior of TPEs. Energy input to extrude and viscous dissipation are related to process parameters and polymer rheological characteristics using process physics based on fundamental mechanics of fluid flow of a polymer in a screw–barrel geometry. Metering zone temperature and rpm were observed to be the most significant parameters influencing melt temperature, extruder pressure, torque, and output. Extruder pressure and torque were lower for ultra-low-density polyethylene (ULDPE) than for Santoprene. Screw torque was linearly proportional to rpm for ULDPE, whereas it was nonlinear for Santoprene due to the high shear-thinning nature of Santoprene. Mechanical energy to extrude at the same rpm was higher for Santoprene than for ULDPE. Extruder efficiency, considering output per unit energy expended, was three times higher for ULDPE than for Santoprene. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 17: 115–126, 1998",

    "abstract": "Abstract To optimize the processing, a process model has to be developed. To be able to use a model of this kind, we must also have material data (thermodynamic material data, viscosity, processing time) and must install sensors on the machine and in the mould. The flow properties of thermosets/elastomers under processing conditions is determined not only by pressure, temperature and throughput, but also to a considerable extent by the boundary conditions. At a given throughput, it is possible to calculate the pressure loss for passing through a runner system by dividing up the flow into a plug flow and a boundary shear flow. This takes into account the pronounced temperature profile, which brings about a low‐viscosity outer layer and a high‐viscosity core. With thermosets/elastomers, the compounding process influences the flow properties to a considerable extent. This means that the continuous monitoring of the material state must be included in the process control. This monitoring can be carried out during the mould filling period. Since the mould is filled over a wide area at constant velocity, the gate can be regarded as a “rheometer” and the pressure loss between two pressure sensors installed in the gate used as a measure of the viscosity. Starting from this measurement of the flow properties, moulding properties such as weight and surface texture are influenced in the compression phase. The form of the pressure build‐up in the compression phase affects the flash formation; this pressure buildup should, in fact, be carried out in such a way that the pressure maximum is not reached until the outer layers have passed through their viscosity minimum. After the compression, the moulding is crosslinked in the crosslinking phase far enough for it to be demoulded or for the moulding properties, which are connected with a given crosslinking profile over the cross‐section, are reached.",

PEI1.8k shows significantly lower cytotoxicity than its high molecular weight counterparts. However, it also has the problem of low gene transfection efficiency. To address the dilemma, a highly effective crosslinker (DTME) was synthesized to react with PEI1.8k to obtain CS-PEI1.8k. The reaction showed several advantages, such as a fast process in room temperature within nine hours with the product which can directly complex with DNA after removing the solvent. The ability of CS-PEI1.8k to agglomerate with DNA was proven by particle size, zeta potential, and gel retardation assays. The cytotoxic in vitro transfection ability and cell internalization capacity of CS-PEI1.8k were tested to verify the transfection capacity of CS-PEI1.8k. Moreover, we also studied the mechanism of the relatively high level of gene transfection by this binary complex compared with PEI25k.",

In the present work, an attempt has been made to perform a detailed and rigorous verification to check for these design sensitivities from the CAE analysis. For four design and polymer material combinations, both molding and simulation trials were performed. C-COOL™ v. 3.0 mold cooling simulation software was used for the simulation trials. For each of these trials, measurements were taken for part planar-surface temperature distributions using infrared thermography, and for mold-wall temperatures at specific locations in the cavity using thermocouples. These experimental data have been compared with the predicted values and a favorable agreement has been observed for sensitivities most critical for design purposes. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

PTFE has been used to model the process for the analysis of extrusion forces as it is well characterized with respect to both frictional behavior and yield characteristics. UHMWPE, on the other hand, was used to determine the extent of orientation and mechanical properties in function of the die geometry and extrusion temperature. Dies with low converging angles were found to develop extrusion forces three to four times higher than corresponding dies with larger converging angles and to produce a highly unbalanced orientation with a bias in the transverse direction. A special die design feature producing a crossply orientation pattern was also examined.",

The two monomers for making nylon 66 and their homologues including dibasic and monobasic acids, diamines, and primary amines show very interesting melting point behavior. On the other hand, compounds containing even numbers of carbon atoms show consistently higher melting points than the neighboring odd number compounds of higher molecular weights. However, the boiling points of all four series follow the usual rule: The higher the molecular weight, the higher the boiling point. It has been proven that the quality of nylon 66 has been greatly improved by lowering the residence time during the polymerization. For instance, the spinning rate employed was at a level of 7000 m/min, and the tensile strength of the spun yarn was much improved, which was attributed to the overall quality of the polymer.",

It was possible to obtain composites with very good mechanical properties, approaching those of cortical bone. The best results were achieved for 30% sintered HA composites processed by TSE and Scorim, due to the in situ formation of HA fibers, and the development of molecular orientation and more compact microstructures in the moldings. This was confirmed by SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The biodegradability of the composites was also assessed and was found to be faster than that of the matrix. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 16: 263–277, 1997",

    "abstract": "The effect of processing conditions on the performance of advanced styrenic resins (ASR) is examined. ASR systems offer a combination of high gloss and high impact, which allows them to be considered as alternatives in applications previously dominated by acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene copolymers (ABS). Injection molding conditions were set according to the principles of statistical design of experiments. The information provided by this statistical design of experiments (DOE) method is extensive and highly organized. For the current study, a 25 full factorial model was based on five parameters at two levels of variation. With this model, the effects of injection speed, melt temperature, mold temperature, hold pressure, and cooling time on part properties were investigated. The properties measured were tensile modulus, tensile yield strength, tensile ultimate strength, and Gardner and Izod impact strengths. This study represents an initial variable screening for the establishment of a process window for this particular material. At the same time, significant process knowledge, valuable for further future optimization, was gained and structure-morphology relationships were investigated. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Most production extruders have excellent process controllers, but they generally lack data acquisition systems. Because of these equipment limitations, all transient, unsteady-state data for a process are unavailable for analysis. Highlighted in this article are four case studies where transient data were collected and used (1) for the diagnosis and elimination of extrusion instabilities; (2) to show differences between competing resin processability; and (3) in extrusion research. In all cases, a portable data acquisition system was temporarily connected to the extruder control panel and was used to collect transient process data. For extruder instability problems, the data collected were used to help diagnose and eliminate the problems quickly, bringing the extrusion lines up to standard production in the shortest possible time, minimizing costly recycle, and maximizing the profits for the processors.

This review presents information related to the types of volatiles emanating during the processing of commodity thermoplastics and reinforced thermosets along with analytical methods for their measurement. The identification of volatiles and the development of analytic techniques for measuring their concentration in the workplace are of paramount importance to establish or revise threshold limit values that would minimize exposure to hazardous chemical substances. With respect to material/energy recovery options applicable to fabricated polymer-based parts, this article reviews methodologies based on life-cycle analysis principles to establish an approximate hierarchy of energy recovery potential. It is shown that the overall energy requirements for most secondary (melt reprocessing) or tertiary (chemical) recycling alternatives are well below those of landfilling (highest energy consumption) and for some alternatives closer to those of reuse (lowest energy consumption). © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "It is well known that blade geometry significantly affects the performance and efficiency of partially filled internal mixers. Intermesh type blades with very long tips are regarded as effective alternatives to almond-shaped blades used in more traditional tangential rotor mixers. However, using long tip blades results in the formation of long and very narrow sections between the chamber wall and the blade in these mixers. These narrow sections may act as bottlenecks, disrupting flow and mixing of highly viscous compounds in the mixing of elastomers with fillers. Therefore, to avoid costly and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures, the design of long tip blades requires careful quantitative evaluation of their performance. In this article, a computer model, based on the finite element method for the simulation of mixing in twin-blade intermesh type mixers, is presented. This model represents transient, nonisothermal, non-Newtonian flow and mixing of a polymer–filler compound in a free surface regime consisting of incompressible and compressible parts. Mixing dependent variations of compound viscosity are also taken into account. To incorporate all of the described realistic aspects of the mixing process in the geometrically complex domain of intermesh type mixers, the developed model is based on a novel and robust solution algorithm. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Further increase in the concentration of the added metal ions causes gelation and precipitation of the metal alginate salt. The effect of adding the divalent metal ions on the viscosity of sodium alginate solutions (before gelation or precipitation stages) was investigated via rheological and viscosity measurements. The optimum concentrations of the divalent metal salts were determined. Calculated traces of divalent metal salts were added to pastes of low-viscosity sodium alginate (5%) to increase its viscosity and subsequently decrease the amount of sodium alginate required for use in screen printing of cotton fabrics with reactive dyes (i.e., decreasing cost). For the sake of comparison, a comparativey was conducted by preparing other series of printing pastes thickened with low-viscosity sodium alginate (8%) and high-viscosity sodium alginate (2.5%).

The crystallization and thermal properties of UHMWPE /R‐ PA 6/ HDPE ‐g‐ MAH were discussed from the viewpoint of phase behavior of the blend. Morphology characterization and TMA analysis indicated that UHMWPE and R‐ PA 6 were thermodynamically incompatible phases, and R‐ PA 6 phase was continuous and UHMWPE phase was dispersed phased, respectively. X‐ray diffraction results showed that the interaction between the blending components adversely affected the crystal growth of the components, resulting in reduced crystallization in the blends.

Polymeric microspheres have a potential in various fields of research like diagnostics, separations, thermal insulations, pigments, and additive manufacturing like selective laser sintering (SLS). These microspheres have the potential to be used as building material for SLS provided they have spherical morphology and have a submicrometer particle size. The effects of the different processing parameters on these two response factors have been investigated in SD of PPSU by design of experiment. A plot is predicted in which size and morphology are optimized and combined in order to find the ideal parameter set for production. The effect of polymer concentration, solution feed rate, atomization flow rate, inlet temperature, and polymer grade was optimized using a five‐factor three‐level factorial design. Through the statistical model, particles with a mean particle size of 13.27 μm can be obtained of which 19% are of adequate sphericity and roundness according to Powers’ scale for the low viscous grade (R5600, Radel® R5600 Solvay polymer, low viscous grade (or very high melt flow grade) of PPSU). In the case of the high viscous grade (R5000, Radel ® R5000 Solvay polymer, high viscous grade of PPSU), a best particle size of 12.48 μm with 12.5% spherical particles can be achieved.",

Given the information provided, there will be a growing demand for bitumen, a key raw material used in the manufacturing of asphalt. Bitumen may account for up to 60% of the total usage in asphalt production. This study aims to determine the effect of different content of polylactic acid (PLA) on the change in the chemical and physical properties of biopolymer bitumen during its modification. This study was carried out by using a sample of petroleum road bitumen from CASPI BITUM (Kazakhstan) and a sample of PLA from Zhejiang Hisun (China). As a part of the research, the change of quality indicators of biopolymer bitumen when adding 4%–10% of PLA to it has been established. The results showed that the values of the average molecular weight and average molar mass increased with increasing the content of PLA in biopolymer bitumen. In particular, when the PLA content in biopolymer bitumen increased up to 10%, the average molecular weight of the biopolymer bitumen increased from 1,263 to 2,759 Mw and the average molar mass increased from 1,215 to 1,395 Mn. It was shown that increasing the PLA content in biopolymer bitumen from 0% to 10% leads to an increase in the softening temperature from 47 to 70°C or ∼ 49%. It was found that all examined samples of biopolymer bitumen are characterized by increased plasticity at 25°C (&gt;100 cm). It has been established that the addition of 8% PLA to bitumen allows one to obtain a biopolymer bitumen of optimal quality. The results obtained can be used to produce road biopolymer bitumen.",

Influence of the nano‐Al 2 O 3 and its contents on friction and wear performances of the HNBR materials is investigated. The nano‐Al 2 O 3 particles with different contents are added into the HNBR composites. Then, friction and wear tests are conducted using a pin‐on‐disk tribometer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to observe wear topography of the HNBR composite surfaces. Attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectroscopy is used to investigate mechanism of nano‐Al 2 O 3 reinforcing HNBR. Results show that the filled nano‐Al 2 O 3 and its contents significantly affect friction and wear performances. Presence of the nano‐Al 2 O 3 obviously decreases friction coefficient and volume wear rate. Friction coefficient and volume wear rate of the composites reduce initially with the increase of nano‐Al 2 O 3 content and then increase with further increasing the nano‐Al 2 O 3 content. The HNBR material filled by the nano‐Al 2 O 3 with the content of 15 phr shows better antifriction and wear performances. SEM results indicate that the HNBR material filled by the nano‐Al 2 O 3 of 15 phr presents the best topography of wear surface compared with the HNBR materials filled by other nano‐Al 2 O 3 contents in this study. ATR–FTIR results show that mechanism of the nano‐Al 2 O 3 reinforcing HNBR for wear resistance is due to the graft reaction between the modified nano‐Al 2 O 3 and HNBR to form cross‐linking networks around the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles, and self‐polymerization of unsaturated groups on the surface of the nano‐Al 2 O 3 to form interpenetrating polymer networks with the HNBR molecular main chains.",

This estimate is based on the Arrhenius model, using energy activation data from the literature. Complementary tests were done to analyze the fiber materials, such as XRD (WAX), FTIR, and mechanical tensile tests. For FTIR, no changes are found that indicate modifications in the chemical structure but in the physical properties of the materials. A study based on XRD shows that during the first 72 hr, changes in crystal size were observed, and consequently, there was a loss of transparency. Hence, mechanical tests indicate that the fiber decreases its Young’s modulus with longer aging times, making the material more tenacious to rupture.",

    "abstract": "Deep‐sea equipment is generally made of lightweight and pressure‐resistant materials in order to meet the requirements of the actual work. In order to explore marine resources better, it is necessary to research lightweight buoyancy materials for loading on mining equipment. These buoyancy materials contribute not only to providing adequate buoyancy to the mining equipment but also to reducing economic expenses. In this paper, hollow glass microspheres reinforced epoxy hollow spheres (HGMSs‐EHSs) were prepared by the rolling ball method using expanded polystyrene (EPS), epoxy resin (EP), and HGMS as raw materials. Epoxy syntactic foam (ESF) was manufactured by blending EP, curing agent, HGMS, and HGMS‐EHS with molding method. Basalt fiber (BF) reinforced ESF was fabricated by adding BFs to form a fiber network inside the syntactic foam. The results revealed that the density and compressive strength of ESF increased progressively with the number of HGMS‐EHS layers. The density and compressive strength of ESF decreased prospectively with the increase of the stacking volume fraction of HGMS‐EHS. The density and compressive strength of ESF increased gradually with the enlargement of the length and content of BF. In the range of influencing factors mentioned above, the density of ESF remains around 0.3 g/cm 3 , which has a low density. When the number of layers of HGMS‐EHS was two, the stacking volume fraction was 90%, the length of BF was 12 mm, the content of BF was 4%, the density of BF‐ESF was 0.316 g/cm 3 , and the compressive strength was 6.93 MPa. The compressive strength of prepared buoyancy material can meet the pressure resistance requirements for operations in waters of a certain depth. With a density of only 0.316 g/cm 3 , it provides sufficient buoyancy to balance the gravity of the equipment. Compared with the current study, in this paper, BFs were used as the reinforcing phase to prepare solid buoyancy foam with low density and high compressive strength. The experimental results demonstrate that this economical fiber material can effectively improve the compressive strength of buoyancy materials. This buoyancy material may be suitable for loading on small equipment for extracting marine resources. This work provides a reference for the preparation of low‐density solid buoyancy materials.",

Recently, ESs have been studied as a filler in polymer composite materials, which represents an innovative solution to address ES valorization. In this study, thermal and chemical treatments were investigated for membrane removal since the membrane may alter various properties when the ES fillers are added to the composite material. A nanoindentation method was used to measure changes in the ES mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the ES membrane removal through chemical treatment. The results showed that even at a heating temperature of 100°C, the ES mechanical properties were negatively affected, while a low concentration of bleach solution (25% bleach solution and 10 min of holding time) was able to remove the membrane without reducing the ES mechanical properties. The chemical treatment method offers a means for ES membrane removal while conserving the quality of the mineral fraction (calcite; CaCO 3 ).",

A viable solution involves the application of spray‐coated polyurea elastomer composite materials to insulate exposed conductive points and weakly insulated connection parts of transmission line towers. To improve the comprehensive performance of polyurea elastomers, in this study, a polyurea curing system was modified by incorporating aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ), silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), and (boron nitride) BN nanoparticles. An orthogonal experiment was designed to investigate the influence of different fillers on the comprehensive performance of polyurea elastomers. These nanoparticles partially filled the defects inherent in the polyurea and BN microparticles, improving the alternating current (AC) breakdown strength of these elastomers. Compared with filler‐free polyurea elastomers, optimal performance of the polyurea elastomers was achieved when using 5 wt% Al 2 O 3 , 0.4 wt% SiO 2 , and 5 wt% BN, resulting in a 15.75% increase in the AC breakdown strength and a 10.00% enhancement in the thermal conductivity.",

This criterion is represented by an elliptic paraboloid failure surface (EPFS). The criterion stipulates that in the compression–compression–compression octant these materials may sustain very high loadings. To remedy this ambiguous definition of failure in this zone, an improved version of the EPFS was also introduced as a complement of the EPFS criterion. Based on the same principles as the EPFS, a symmetric ellipsoid failure surface is defined whose symmetry axis is parallel to the hydrostatic axis, which is also passing though the three pairs of failure strengths in tension and compression along each of the principal stress axes. Both criteria are completely defined by stipulating that their symmetry axes are parallel to the hydrostatic axis and that the fourth rank tensors H defining failure should have a zero eigenvalue associated with the spherical tensor 1. Extensive experimental evidence with different orthotropic materials has shown that their failure results corroborate both criteria, depending on the form of their structure.",

All four basic features of the IPM, including modeling, data processing, sensing, and controlling, are considered. In the process modeling, bending and thermal models are developed. With these models, the relationship between the process parameters and quality of the calendered sheets has been established. A material data bank has been established to couple with the process modeling and real‐time sensing data. In sensing, ultrasonic and temperature sensors have been implemented to measure critical quality and process parameters in situ. The sensing data have been used not only to verify the modeling prediction but also to establish information needed to diagnose the causes of the layflat problem. Based on the model prediction as well as sensing information, a better control system to alleviate layflatness problems has been developed. Finally, a control strategy for future improvement of the calendering system is proposed. © 1993 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Because the physical properties of the polymer matrix can be significantly modified by the type of the plasticizer that is used, these high–molecular‐weight esters have been extensively investigated during the last decade. Liquid density, for example, has been found to be a useful bulk property of these liquid plasticizers, since density helps define the internal molecular flexibility. Most of the time, however, experimental difficulties prevent the accurate determination of density. Moreover, the existing empirical models are tedious because of many ill‐defined parameters. In this study a simple artificial neural‐network–based model was utilized for the density of these esters as a function of their chemical structure and temperature. The sum of squared error for densities predicted by this proposed model was within 0.0009. In this study, the density of a series of five different esters was investigated.

    "abstract": "Abstract A new type of vinyloxyaminosilane (VOS) grafted ethylene‐propylene‐diene terpolymer (EPDM‐g‐VOS) has been synthesized in a Haake Rheocord‐90, torque rheometer. Using EPDM‐g‐VOS the blends of linear low density polyethylene (EPDM‐g‐VOS/LLDPE) with varying percentage compositions were prepared in a two‐roll mixing mill. The morphology of the EPDM‐g‐VOS/LLDPE blends was studied using a scanning electron microscope. The morphology of the blends indicated a two‐phase structure in which the minor phase is dispersed as domains in the major continuous phase. However, at 50 wt% both EPDM‐g‐VOS and LLDPE exist as continuous phases and generate co‐continuous morphology. The effect of blend ratio and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) concentration on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elongation at break, Young's modulus, and hardness have been investigated. It was ascertained that the mechanical properties of blends increase with increase of LLDPE content and DCP concentration. An attempt has been made in this investigation to correlate the variation of mechanical properties with morphology of the blend. Data from reprocessability studies of the blends indicate that these blends can be recycled and reprocessed several times without appreciable loss of their mechanical characteristics. Data on mechanical characteristics indicate that these blends can be used for engineering applications with better performance than ungrafted EPDM. The EPDM‐g‐VOS/LLDPE blends developed in the present work may find applications in the field of automobiles and medium high voltage cable insulation. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Both swell and sag determine the parison dimensions in a viscoelastic annular extrusion. So, it is highly desirable to be able to predict the swell of an annular parison under the effect of sag during its extrusion. Numerical simulations on the parison extrusion at the conditions corresponding to industrial blow molding applications were carried out by adopting a finite element method and the Kaye–Bernstein–Kearsley–Zapas (K‐BKZ)‐type constitutive equation in the present work. Five dies were used to study the effect of die geometry (mainly die inclination angle) on the parison swells. The results show that the swellings continue to increase with increasing die inclination angle, which is explained according to stress distributions and exit pressure in the die. Reasons for the difference between the numerically predicted and the experimentally measured swells are analyzed. Then, the sensitivity of the predicted swells to the values of material constants appearing in the K‐BKZ model is examined. It is suggested that the material constants should be chosen in accordance with the die geometry to reflect its contribution to the shear and extensional deformation of the polymer melt inside the die. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The nanoparticle carriers were prepared by using an electrostatic system, and the coverage of ginsenoside Rg3 was determined by HPLC after coating the nanoparticle carriers with the ginsenoside Rg3 monomer. The proliferation of H125 cells was measured using MTT assay, and the Transwell assay was used to detect the invasiveness of H125 cells. Cell scratch test was used to determine the migration ability of H125 cells, and Western blotting was used to measure the expression level of PTEN in H125 cells; the expression level of miR-192 in H125 cells was measured via RT-qPCR, and the apoptosis level of H125 cells was detected by Tunel assay. Results . Firstly, gelatin nanoparticles and hyaluronic acid nanoparticles were uniformly distributed, uniform in size and spherical in shape, and after coating ginsenoside Rg3, the sizes of the nanoparticles were significantly increased. Secondly, the expression level of miR-192 was upregulated in H125 cells, which could be effectively inhibited by the treatment of Rg3 monomer and HA-Rg3 nanoparticles. Thirdly, the knockdown of miR-192 significantly inhibited H125 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and also enhanced H125 cell apoptosis. In addition, PTEN was demonstrated as a target gene of miR-192. Finally, by inhibiting the expression level of miR-192 in H125 cells, the Rg3 monomer and HA-Rg3 nanoparticles upregulated the expression of PTEN and thus exerted its antitumor effect; the effects of HA-Rg3 were comparatively more significant than those of the Rg3 monomer. Conclusions . The Rg3 monomer and HA-Rg3 nanoparticles mitigated the malignant behavior of human non-small-cell lung cancer H125 cells through the miR-192/PTEN molecular axis, and HA-Rg3 nanoparticles showed better antitumor effects.",

The circumferential expansion performance of the system was tested, and the curves of circumferential bearing capacity and radial displacement of the components were obtained. Failure modes of each group of components were compared and analyzed. The results show that most of the components are vertically fractured at the lap transition. The increase of the number of prepreg layers contributed the most to the circumferential bearing capacity of components, with a growth rate of 65.31%~109.01%. The increase of rubber belt layers had the most significant effect on the radial displacement of the components, with a growth rate of 7.06%~23.5%. In the initial stage of the test, the strain of each part of the component was smaller due to the compaction by the loading device, and the strain value of the component was generally linearly increased during the loading process, during which the strain of the overlap was the smallest. The calculated cross-sectional temperature deformation of the main cable is in good agreement with the experimental data. The application of the rubber belt increases the deformation of the main cable; therefore, the protection system for the main cable could have more deformation redundancy and delay the arrival of the ultimate strain of the outer prepreg wrap.",

Conclusion. 125I seeds affect the proliferation and apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. The therapeutic effect of low-activity 125I seeds on cancer cells may be better. 125I seed brachytherapy may promote the apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and regulating the <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mtext>Bcl</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mn>2</mn> <mo>/</mo> <mtext>Bax</mtext> </math> ratio.",

The hot press technique was utilised to generate a variety of composites with four different amounts of fibre loading. In addition, the fibre ratio in composites with a 20-weight-percent fibre loading was changed. The composites were characterised using Fourier transform infrared analysis as well as tensile, flexural, and hardness tests. In the composites that have been created, Fourier transform infrared examination showed that hemicelluloses, lignins, and moisture were present, all of which have the potential to reduce tensile strength. Fibre loading resulted in a decrease in tensile strength but an increase in Young’s modulus. With increasing fibre loading, flexural modulus and hardness rose, whereas flexural strength declined. The best mechanical qualities were found in a composite made primarily of arecanut and glass fibres, with a weight ratio of 1 : 3.",

Based on the viscoelastic constitutive equation (White-Metzner) and the fiber orientation model (iARD-RPR), the effects of fiber mass content, water injection delay time, water injection pressure, and melt temperature, which are on the fiber orientation along the flow direction and shear rate distribution of the melt, were investigated. Studies found that the orientation degree of the fiber along the flow direction was reduced with the increase of the fiber mass content, the extension of the water injection delay time, and the improvement of the melt temperature and that the orientation degree of the fiber along the flow direction was raised with the increase of the water injection pressure flow in the laminar flow state, but it was reduced with the increase in the turbulent state. It can be further learned from the shear rate distribution that decreasing fiber mass content, reducing the water injection delay time, lower melt temperature, and increasing water injection pressure in laminar flow conditions will increase the shear rate in the channel layer and the shear rate gradient along the thickness direction of the melt, while the water injection pressure in the turbulent state is on the contrary.",

    "abstract": "To improve the deteriorated performance caused by CO 2 release during the curing process of traditional moisture‐crosslinked polyurethane or polyurea and poor flame retardancy, this work realized an effective in situ crosslinking technique triggered by moisture for poly(urethane‐urea) with intrinsic flame retardancy, through the incorporation of trimethoxysilane and phosphorus groups via a continuous two‐stage process. Moisture‐triggered crosslinking reaction of trimethoxysilane groups resulted in the establishment of a robust Si─O─Si network, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) test. The structure transformation considerably enhanced the material’s strength, with the stress at break increasing from 1.0 to 3.2 MPa and modulus from 32.9 to 46.9 MPa. The flame retardant properties of PUUS1 (poly(urethane‐urea) sample) were investigated through limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimeter (CCT) analysis, demonstrating satisfactory flame resistance, as evidenced by high LOI value of 29%, high char yield of 46.2%, and controlled smoke production. Combining thermogravimetric analysis‐infrared spectrometry (TG‐IR), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and flame retardant performance, it is speculated that the generation of phosphorus‐free radical scavengers in gas phase from diethyl bis(2‐hydroxyethyl) aminomethyl phosphonate (DBHAP), coupled with the barrier effects of charred layer and distinctive Si─O─Si framework in condensed phase inhibited combustion and toxic gas emission. The results highlight the successful synthesis of a moisture‐crosslinkable poly(urethane‐urea) with intrinsic flame retardancy, promising for applications necessitating moisture‐crosslinkable materials with superior flame resistance.",

    "abstract": "Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) has garnered significant attention in the field of dentistry due to its wide applications. This paper proposes the incorporation of the nystatin coated copper oxide (CuO) particles having desirable conductivity and antifungal properties, as a filler in the PMMA denture to address their low thermal conductivity, low impact strength, low fatigue resistance, and microbial adhesion. The prepared nystatin coated CuO particles were characterized with several analytical techniques. The nystatin coated CuO particles were mixed in different ratios (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) in PMMA corresponding to groups C, E1, E2, and E3, respectively. The prepared samples of composite PMMA with nystatin coated CuO were evaluated to determine their transverse strength, impact strength, Vickers hardness (HV), and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, antifungal properties of CuO particles, nystatin coated CuO particles, and their acrylic composites were evaluated against Candida albicans. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed the particles’ spherical and irregular shapes. The particle sizes range from nano to micron level. Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the coating of nystatin on CuO. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the diffraction patterns and planes of CuO monoclinic shape structure. The composite prepared to have higher values of HV (19.53 ± 0.65, 20.16 ± 0.37, and 21.11 ± 0.75, respectively) as compared to the control. The impact strength values were measured high at 14.12 ± 5.55 kJ/m 2 for 2% containing nystatin coated CuO acrylic resins compared to control and other groups. The conductivity increased linearly with the addition of CuO particles. The addition of CuO particles causes a reduction in flexural strength as compared to the control group. As the concentration of nystatin coated CuO (1%, 2%, and 4%) in acrylic samples increased, the antifungal properties were improved. Thus, the incorporation of optimized concentrations of nystatin coated CuO particles in acrylic resin resulted in the improved mechanical, thermal, and antifungal properties.",

    "abstract": "Polyolefins such as high‐density polyethylene (HDPE), low‐density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP) are among the most widely used packaging materials in the cosmetic industry. Since these materials are in direct contact with cosmetic products, various components of the products are adsorbed to the packaging material’s surface and migrate within the amorphous regions of the polyolefin. This migration process, which occurs in both virgin and post‐consumer recyclate (PCR) materials, can lead to deformation of the packaging. In this study, different types of virgin and PCR pellets were examined to investigate their interaction with cosmetic products and to understand the factors influencing the migration process. The migration of cosmetic oils was observed in all pellet samples, depending on the composition of the product and environmental conditions. The process was characterized by the weight gain of the plastic pellets and further identified through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Additionally, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed to analyze the polymer structure. Components with lower molecular weight (MW), high nonpolarity, and elevated temperatures were found to accelerate the migration process. Moreover, migration occurred more slowly from oil‐in‐water emulsions with larger droplet sizes compared to water‐in‐oil systems with smaller droplets. Among the different polyolefins, PP demonstrated a higher uptake of migrating components but at a slower migration rate compared to HDPE and LDPE. When comparing virgin and recycled polyolefins, it was observed that migration was consistently slower in virgin materials than in recycled ones. The ability of oils to migrate is influenced by the molecular structure of the polymers: high density, crystallinity, and low levels of branching reduce both the migration speed (MS) and the maximum saturation, as seen in virgin HDPE. In contrast, materials like LDPE, with a less dense polymer structure, exhibited higher MSs and saturation limits. As a control, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was used, and it showed no migration due to the polymer’s high density.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the world is undergoing the fourth industrial revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0, which is characterised by a set of new technological advances in the industrial and production sectors. Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered an essential factor in this new era because of its ability to process a wide spectra of materials, produce customised products, promote sustainability and develop intricate components which are unachievable using conventional manufacturing techniques. The field of AM is rapidly evolving and has seen unprecedented uptake in many industries. Different types of AM technologies have been developed over the last three decades to process different materials, such as polymers, composites, metals, ceramics and alloys. Both industry and academia have made a considerable effort to investigate the use of AM technologies to print different types of polymers because of the possibility to reach new markets. This comprehensive review focuses on polymer laser sintering (PLS) and fused deposition modelling (FDM), which are the most commonly employed AM methods for polymers. This review outlines the processes, process parameters, available commercial polymeric materials, benefits, challenges, and applications of the two technologies. PLS and FDM are multifactorial processes that produce final components whose quality is subject to the process parameters. This review, therefore, delves into the different process parameters for the two technologies and their impacts. The article also lists the available commercial polymeric materials, for each of the methods, to assist researchers and industries to select most suitable materials based on their processability and characteristics. A detailed discussion of applications of the two technologies is outlined in this review. The study provides a comprehensive detail of the benefits and challenges of PLS and FDM. Last, the study also outlines the future works for the two techniques.",

The relationship between graft weight and melt processability was determined from melt flow index (MFI) measurements. Films were obtained by both compression molding and extrusion and were characterized in terms of their hydrophilicity. The limiting value for graft level for processability was found to be in the region of 30–35% at the two extremes of the range of MFI values of the base polymer. The preferred polymer has an MFI of 35 dg/min, giving a limiting maximum graft weight for processability of 45%. It was demonstrated that high graft weight EVA copolymer resins are melt processable and that this would be a viable method for the production of hydrophilic membranes for applications such as drug delivery membranes, medical devices, including catheters and stents and, semipermeable battery separator membranes. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Each temperature profile, through the preform thickness, was computed from processing conditions by solving the energy equation with radiation as the heating source. The computed temperature profile was verified by measuring the inside and outside preform surface temperatures using infrared thermocouples. Bottles were then blow molded with various temperature profiles and measurements were carried out on samples cut from the sidewalls. Thickness distributions and axial ratios were determined as were changes in mechanical, optical, and barrier properties. It was found that optical anisotropy through bottle wall thickness was minimal when the inside preform surface was at a higher temperature than the outside surface. Densities of the bottle sidewalls were found to be higher for bottles blow molded at higher average temperatures and there were small increases in density for bottles blown with the preform inside surface at a higher temperature than the outside surface. Haze measurements showed that, to obtain optically clear containers, bottles with an inside hoop ratio of 5.25 should be blown with an inside surface temperature of at least 100°C. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Changes in air quality standards and new polymer manufacturing technologies have renewed interest in polymer melt devolatilizing. Unfortunately, little data is available to aid in the design and scale up of melt devolatilizing single‐screw extruders. As part of the ongoing development activities of Farrel Company, melt devolatilizing in various devices has been under study for a number of years. In order to be able to develop analytical methods of predicting performance and scaling up from small scale test stands, some elementary devolatilizing studies were carried out. Theoretical predictions based on classical diffusion theory were compared with actual results, leading to a revised model of the actual melt devolatilizing process. Based on this revised model, several novel single screw devolatilizing concepts were proposed, built and tested. In this paper, we are presenting some of the theoretical work underlying these studies as well as test results on conventional single‐screw devolatilizing sections. We hope to be in a position to divulge additional information on some of the novel devolatilizing devices at the time of the presentation of the paper.",

A mold heating analysis and optimization scheme has been developed that allows computation of temperature variation on the mold/part surface, and optimizes the location and power of heaters. The heat transfer coefficients for a given mold can also be theoretically calculated. The validation of the analysis was carried out by two sets of experiments: the first one measured the heat loss from the mold under different boundary conditions, and the second one the temperature variation on mold/part boundary for theoretically determined power histories for a specified temperature history. The experimental data compared well with theory and provide a satisfactory validation of the analysis. The present work provides a useful tool to a design engineer and allows the mold heating system design on a scientific basis, thus eliminating the trial and error approach.",

SMC ply preheating has allowed shorter cycle times and improved flow properties. Cycle times of less than 1 min are now possible. Surface quality is improved with accurate press‐velocity control and accurate parallelism control of the movable platen. When mold vacuum is used, the surface quality can approach the auto‐maker's Class A finish standards without the use of time‐consuming in‐mold coating. The parallelism control allows tighter tolerances on the shear edge of the mold. If this is combined with accurately controlled press‐force profile, a substantial reduction in flash can be achieved. The never presses are equipped with microprocessor controls. On‐line quality control is possible, since all relevant parameters can be stored or closed‐loop controlled. Statistical process control (SPC) can therefore be achieved without the need for additional hardware.",

When the properties of these blends were compared, variations in values were obtained for blends of the same composition. Variations in properties were higher in blends containing less than 70% PET content. At 70% PET and above, there were negligible differences between blends of the same composition processed by different methods. Since it has been established that blends with more than 70% PET are miscible, it can be concluded that injection molding can be applied to mix miscible blends into final parts directly without a preliminary extrusion blending process.",

It is observed that die swell increases for increasing entrance angles up to 60° and then decreases for angles up to 120°. Dependence of die swell on aspect ratio and shear rate has also been reported.

    "abstract": "As far as the mixing performance in single-screw extrusion processes is concerned, it is well known that the deformation measure or stretching which materials undergo due to the regular flows inside a conventional screw channel increases linearly with the extruder channel length. In general, the chaotic mixing is far superior to the regular mixing. Therefore, it would be fascinating if one could make the chaotic mixing possible in single-screw extruders with a special, and yet easily manufacturable screw without sacrificing the pumping performance of single-screw extruders. With this purpose in mind, we have developed a new screw (termed “Chaos Screw”) for the single-screw extrusion process to enhance the mixing performance via the chaotic flows. The main idea of the Chaos Screw design lies in the spatially periodic barriers inserted in the channel to break closed streamlines in regular flows, which induces the chaotic mixing. The present article describes the basic mechanism of the chaotic mixing in a single-screw extruder and presents experimental evidence of the chaotic mixing using the Chaos Screw. Experimental mixing patterns due to the chaotic flow clearly indicate that the Chaos Screw drastically enhances the mixing performance in a single-screw extruder. It may be mentioned that the accompanying article, Part II, presents numerical investigation which shows that the chaotic mixing was successfully predicted by numerical simulations. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Pyrene (Py) was used as a fluorescence probe for the in situ polymerization experiments. Swelling of this cylindrical poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) gel in chloroform was monitored using FTRF technique. Fluorescence lifetimes of Py from its decay traces were measured and used to monitor both the gelation and swelling processes. Stern–Volmer kinetics were employed to determine the quenching rate constant before the onset of gelation. MMA consumption rate was measured during gelation process using the Stern–Volmer model. A Li–Tanaka equation was introduced to determine the cooperative diffusion coefficient D c , which was found to be around 10 −5 cm 2 s −1 during the swelling of PMMA gel in chloroform. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract An experimental study was carried out to examine the rheological behavior of polymer melts in laminar flows through channels with small‐angle convergences (2–3°) and spiralling walls (6°/mm along the flow direction), using an extrusion grade of low‐density polyethylene. The results show that convergence is the main factor responsible for the observed deviations from steady state laminar shear flow, particularly with respect to additional pressure requirements to maintain a constant mass output. The swell ratio, calculated from the dimensions of the channel at the exit, was found to be considerably higher for flow‐through converging channels. Only a small increase in swell ratio could be attributed, on the other hand, to the rotational elements of the die configuration. It is inferred that even for small angles of convergence the increased level of swelling is associated with elongational stress components, which were grouped together and denoted as the “additional stress.” This was obtained from the difference between the calculated average shear stress at the wall, using the recorded pressure at the die entry, and the value of the average shear stress at the wall calculated from the shear viscosity data for the melt. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Zeolite Y (Si/Al 5.1, Na + ) or NaY is ion exchanged with transition cations, Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ , and Fe 2+ , at 80% cation exchanged to prepare 80CuNaY, 80NiNaY, and 80FeNaY. In this work, the effects of transition cations, ketone vapor type, and ketone vapor concentration are systematically investigated. The highest electrical conductivity response and sensitivity toward acetone vapor at the vapor concentration of 30,000 ppm is obtained with 80CuNaY, whereas 80FeNaY shows the lowest values due to the electrostatic interaction between the zeolite framework and the cation. dPPV is mixed with 80CuNaY and exposed to the three ketone vapors. The electrical conductivity response and sensitivity of the composites toward acetone exhibits the highest values, whereas with MIBK they show the lowest value. After mixing of 80CuNaY with dPPV, the minimum vapor concentration toward acetone vapor decreases from 9 to 5 ppm. The response of the composite is irreversible as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared and atomic force microscopy techniques.",

The modification of clay using alkyl ammonium salt has been found disadvantageous due to various aspects; hence the approach to dehydroxylation was an innovative step to overcome the difficulties in achieving a thermally stable polymer clay nanocomposite. Therefore, a detailed study of thermal stability of polymer clay nanocomposites has been carried out using isoconversional TGA methods of Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Kissinger. Also, the reaction model involved in the decomposition process of polypropylene (PP) and its nanocomposites have been investigated. From the thermal kinetic analysis, it was clear that the thermal dehydroxylation method can be used as an effective approach for clay modification and the use of organic alkyl ammonium salt can be avoided. Furthermore, to predict the flame‐retardant effectiveness of the thermally dehydroxylated clay, the cone calorimeter analysis was carried out. A comparison of the flame‐retardant effectiveness of the organophillic clay and thermally dehydroxylated clay was presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research in understanding the mechanisms behind driving forces in the fully filled nonintermeshing twin screw extruder concentrated on experimental analysis of the relation between stagger, screw speed, and cross‐channel flow due to measured pressure differential in the nip region. A new measure of the pressure driving force was also sought out, to correlate new data to previous findings from visual studies. The first part of the study was to obtain the values for the dynamic pressure on both sides of the nip region. Further refinements to the equipment used in previous studies allowed closer placement of the transducers in the nip region. After the data were stored, analysis started by determining the δ p values from the trace of the pressure differential. By plotting these values, we obtain a highly repeatable curve confirming that the greatest pressure flow occurs at small staggers. A simple 2‐D model for pressure flow in the nip region was used to estimate the effect of the cross‐channel pressure differential. Values for the cross‐channel pressure flow were calculated and compared with the drag flow and found to be significant. © 1993 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

In spite of obvious similarities in the mathematical expression of numerous failure criteria based on the tensor polynomial theory, their predictions may be substantially different depending on loading conditions and on the choice of stress‐interaction terms. Although these predictions for unidirectional fiber reinforced laminae under biaxial loading do not exhibit remarkable differences, this is not the case for multidirectional laminates. Comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data from in‐plane loaded cross‐ply Graphite/Epoxy laminates proved the reliability of the so‐called generalized elliptic paraboloid failure surface criterion, assuming the existence of a safe triaxial loading path which may depend on the anisotropy of the medium and its suitability for use in structural design applications. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

These synthesized blends were preliminary characterized in terms of functional groups through the FTIR technique. All compositions were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis for studying thermal transition and were founded thermally stable even at 280°C. The zeta potential and average diameter of algal strains of Dictyosphaerium sp. (DHM1), Dictyosphaerium sp. (DHM2), and Pectinodesmus sp. (PHM3) were measured to be -32.7 mV, -33.0 mV, and -25.7 mV and 179.6 nm, 102.6 nm, and 70.4 nm, respectively. Upon incorporation of PEG and SS into PS blends, contact angles were decreased while hydrophilicity and surface energy were increased. However, increase of surface energy did not led to decrease of antialgal activities. This has indicated that biofilm adhesion is not a major antialgal factor in these blended materials. The synergetic effect of PEG and SS in PS blends has exhibited significant antialgal activity via the agar disk diffusion method.

Visual observation by the naked eye through the glass windows revealed that, among the screws studied, pineapple and mixing-pin screws appeared to have the best mixing performance. The presence of mixing elements was found to contribute to the increase in pressure, which was an important processing parameter for enhancing mixing quality. The experimental results also indicated that there might exist an optimum location where a mixing element would best be situated for improving mixing characteristics.

    "abstract": "Microwave curing has been shown to be a viable alternative to conventional thermal curing of polymers on the basis of significant reaction rate enhancements. Proper understanding of the microwave cure reaction kinetics has been hindered by the lack of an adequate basis relating the process to conventional thermal analysis methods. The rate enhancement obtained in microwave curing is shown to have been obtained from the decrease in the lag time prior to initiation of cross-linking, as well as, a decrease in the effective cure time. Phenomenologically, the shortening of the cure time is no different from a shortening achieved by a higher curing temperature, thereby providing a basis for relating the microwave cure process to thermal curing. This article attempts to relate the test results for both thermal and microwave curing by obtaining a temperature equivalent value using a phenomenological logarithmic approach. Results show that the equivalent temperature can be elucidated using a logarithmic plot of the cure times and the glass transition temperature. The values of the equivalent temperature so obtained were also consistently and significantly higher than the actual sample temperature during cure, confirming microwave curing to differ in mechanism from thermal curing. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Reactor produced blends of polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) are obtained by graft copolymerization of styrene onto polypropylene chains. This technique generates simultaneously a graft copolymer (PP-g-PS) and polystyrene homopolymer. The resulting blends, however, have a low impact resistance and have to be modified with the addition of rubbery toughening agents, such as an ethylene propylene copolymer (EPR) or a styrene-b-ethylene-alt-butylene-b-styrene (SEBS) triblock copolymer, in a downstream compounding operation. Part 1 of this work, which has been accepted for publication in the British Journal \"Plastics, Rubber, and Composites\", was concerned with the compatibilization efficiency and the effect of mixing intensity on the morphological and rheological properties. Part 2 of the study deals with interactions of the components of the blends. These interactions were assessed by monitoring the crystallization behavior and mechanical properties. Mixing experiments were conducted on a proprietary twin screw mixing element evaluator (TSMEE) and also on a commercial TSE-30 extruder. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the transition temperatures and the crystallinity of the blends specimens after annealing. The results show that both the free polystyrene and the graft copolymer, PP-g-PS, act as nucleators for the polypropylene phase, thus increasing both the degree of crystallinity and the crystallization temperature of the blends. While a good correlation was found between modulus and crystallinity, the factors affecting fracture behavior were less clearly discernible. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the P2VP/copper iodide binary mixtures as compared with pure polymer increased by 80°C when the amount of Cu(I) in the blend was increased up to 40/60 wt/wt monomer/inorganic salt composition for P2VP. For P4VP, the Tg increased by 40°C in an 80/20 wt/wt decreasing by 10°C at 60/40 wt/wt. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy provided molecular-level data, suggesting that copper coordinates with pyridine rings via nitrogen ion pairs in a metal-ligand bonding. Conductivity measurements were carried out at different temperatures and compositions, and upon increasing the amount of copper iodine in the blends, the conductivity increased drastically. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "The fiber-spinning process is an important industrial operation to manufacture synthetic fibers. The process occurs under free-surface conditions, and the final properties of the fiber are characterized by the extensional properties of the polymer. Specifically, the non-isothermal response of the polymer in uniaxial extension dominates the process. The fiber-spinning process is analyzed by means of a unidirectional approach because the thickness of the fiber is very small with respect to its lateral dimension. The analysis accounts for the prehistory of the material inside the die, based on purely extensional strains. For viscoelastic polymer melts, the constitutive equation must be able to describe adequately the rheological behavior of the polymer in extensional flow. A good candidate for such modeling is the K-BKZ integral constitutive equation, with a spectrum of relaxation times, which captures well the nonlinear viscoelastic response of polymer melts. The non-isothermal response is taken into account with a temperature shift factor utilizing the Morland-Lee hypothesis. The present work includes effects due to gravity, inertia, and air drag, where applicable. Simulation results are compared with experiments on polypropylene (PP), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) melts at low and high speeds. Results are also compared with previous simulations. It is shown that in some cases the extrudate swell at the spinneret exit must be taken into account to accurately predict the drawing forces, which makes a fully two-dimensional analysis a necessity for such operations. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The content of calcium carbonate particulates decreases with increasing concentration of the saturated solvent mixture. The transmittance of the nanocomposites decreases with the increasing content of calcium carbonate particulates and the cutoff wavelength of transmittance is shifted to the short wavelength side. Differential scanning calorimetry displayed the glass transition temperature of nanocomposites is much higher than the virgin PMMA.

A new approach is developed to use the injection‐molding process to produce sterilized products without an additional sterilization procedure. To achieve the aim of an autosterile injection molding, it is necessary to evaluate the sterilization impact of screw plasticization regarding sterile polymer melts before entering the injection mold cavity. Within this study, a screw plasticization unit is fed with defined contaminated polymer granules. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are used as challenge organisms to determine the sterility grade of screw plasticization. The investigation includes method verification and the experimental testing of polyoxymethylene, polyethylene, and cyclo‐olefin copolymer melts at different melt temperatures of 200°C and 280°C. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The process variables influence the condensation and molecular size and reactivity of the resin leading to different resins with variation in reactivity and molecular size. Four oligomers were prepared by refluxing at different temperatures, TPF1 (refluxing at 70–80°C for 15 min), TPF2 (refluxing at 80–100°C for 60 min), TPF3 (refluxing at 120–140°C for 15 min), and TPF4 (refluxing at 120–140°C for 30 min). A process parameter with refluxing at 120–140°C for 30 min resulted in a higher molecular weight fast setting resin, TPF4 ( M n 2700, M w 2920 and polydispersity 1.08). Hydrogel adhesives were prepared using TPF4 resin, poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA, M n 750), and n ‐vinyl pyrrolidone. TPF4 undergoes setting with setting time 8 ± 0.55 min with PEGDMA and n ‐vinyl pyrrolidone. The present hydrogel adhesive has higher shear holding time, 105 ± 3 s and peel strength 13 ± 0.002 kg/m at the speed of 0.022 m/s. The aging of the cured adhesive in the simulated biological fluids reveals gradual degradation due to the cross‐linked nature of the cured adhesive. The cured hydrogel adhesive is cytocompatible with L929 fibroblast cells. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Technol 2013, 32, 20200; View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com .

In this work, a very simple approach for synthesizing CNTs in mild conditions has been developed and investigated. In particular, the nanotubes have been obtained by thermal defluorination of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) by Si, which also acts as an inorganic catalyst for the CNT growth. Fine powders of PTFE and Si were homogeneously mixed together and then compacted by cold pressing. The obtained composite pills were placed into a quartz tube furnace at 650°C, and a vacuum was applied to remove the gaseous by‐product (SiF 4 ). The obtained pyrolysis product consisted of CNTs, wrapping the surface of silicon grains. CNTs have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and large angle x‐ray powder diffraction. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "A novel gas atomization process (GAP) was designed for mass producing high-quality spherical powders from molten polymers. The dependence of the powder characteristics, such as particle size and size distribution on the GAP control variables, and physical properties of the polymers were determined experimentally. Statistical and computational neural network analyses were applied to the data in both the forward and reverse modes, leading to models for predicting the particle size distribution from the process variables and vice versa. The computational neural network (CNN) model predicts an increase in the weight fraction of the smallest particle size range (0–53 μm) by increasing the polymer melt temperature while decreasing the polymer melt stream size for the more crystalline polyethylene-based material studied. Comparisons of the CNN model predictions with experimental data yields good agreement and demonstrates that the CNN can be used to qualitatively design new experiments for the production of spherical powders from molten polymers, thereby reducing the amount of experimental work required to optimize the process. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Rotational molding is one of the most important methods for the manufacture of hollow plastic products. However, there are several unsolved problems that confound the overall success of this technique. Part warpage caused by inappropriate mold design and processing conditions is one of them. An experimental study is reported on the effect of different processing factors on the warpage of rotationally molded parts, including part thickness, oven temperature, cooling condition, mold material, mold release, colorant, fiber reinforcement, foaming and mold pressurization. Experiments were carried out on a lab-scale rotational molding unit. After molding, the part warpage was measured by a profile-meter. It is shown that the mechanisms of warpage formation and removal can be explained and, this being done, steps can be taken to ensure that the warpage is minimized. This provides significant advantages in terms of reduced cycle time and improved product quality. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 18: 201–207, 1999",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the practical application of closed-loop control on the gas pressure during the gas-assisted injection molding process. In principle, the gas-injection process can be treated as a valve-controlled tank charging. One of the critical factors for the successful application of the process is the obtaining and maintaining of a desired gas injection pressure within the polymer melt in the mold cavity. Most of the currently available commercial gas-injection machines operate either in an open-loop manner or with closed-loop control, relying upon manual tuning of the associated controllers. This is not only time consuming but also lacking in measurable performance. To improve the controller tuning problem while retaining the currently used controller structure, this study implements a control method which combines system identification and optimal linear quadratic regulator theory into an analytic approach. To demonstrate and verify the proposed method, several experiments were conducted. The results of these experiments show that the approach has excellent potential for designing a control system for regulating gas pressure variation during the gas-assisted injection molding process. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In accordance with classic solids conveying theory, the granular beds of PP and PS remained as plugs while the drum rotated. In such cases, the dominant modes of heat transfer for these systems are conduction through the contact area of a particle and conduction through the interstitial gas . An exception to this behavior was found with PE, in which the bed temperature increased more rapidly while the drum rotated. Visual observations of the bed showed that the particles circulated in the presence of shear and that this complex flow pattern increased in velocity as the drum temperature approached the onset temperature for melting the PE material. With strong correlation between the rate of circulation and the temperature rise in the bed, the movement of particles was assumed to act in a convective heat transfer mode bringing about more uniform heating of the polymer. The circulation phenomenon was attributed to dominant adhesive forces at the particle–drum interface overcoming the cohesive strength of the bulk. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on a new expansion technology for oriented polyvinyl chloride (PVC‐O) pipes, the stress distribution in pipe wall during expansion and the efficiency of the heating process are analyzed theoretically. According to the results of theoretical calculation, the optimal parameter and strength variation for different expansion ratios are studied experimentally. Theoretical calculation results show that the hoop stress and radial stress in pipe wall are near‐linearly distributed, and they are approximately equal. The heating efficiency is gotten by heat transfer calculations for different oil bath temperatures and heating times. After expansion, the intensity and Young's modulus are increased but elongation at break is reduced. All the variations in properties enlarge along with the raise of expansion ratio. Fine appearance and high‐strength PVC‐O pipe can be achieved by optimizing the expansion parameter. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Researchers analyse and evaluate only the microstructure, porosity, and fresh and hardened concrete properties of UHPFRC but limited their exploration on the reduction of the mechanical properties of UHPFRC due to the presence of metallic particles and micro-fractures that occur during the generation of hydrogen. Hence, the present study aims to eliminate the existing problem by hybridization approach (mixing of bio-nano-silica (nS) and polypropylene) with different percentages to further improve the strength properties of UHPFRC. The result showed that the compressive strength is increased by 15.5% compared to traditional concrete due to the filling ratio of nS in the pores of the concrete; in addition, the fibre’s surface and roughness also contributed to the strength enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Rubber mixing is an important link in the production of rubber products. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is often used to explore the effect of rubber mixing parameters on rubber mixing effect. Previous CFD-based rubber mixing simulation studies did not consider the impact of using 2D or 3D numerical calculation models on the numerical simulation results. In order to investigate the differences between 2D and 3D numerical computational models in rubber compounding CFD simulation problems, in this paper, we compare and analyze the results obtained from 2D and 3D computational models under different rotational speed conditions to investigate the differences between the models in the numerical simulation of rubber compounding. Three different experimental speeds of the rubber mixer—39, 44, and 49 r/min—were set during the study using 2D and 3D asynchronous rotor models with a speed ratio of 1.15, respectively. The rubber was processed using the Bird–Carreau model. The phase interface between rubber and air was calculated using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The numerical simulation results of different models show that the rotational speed set to 49 r/min shows the best dispersion distribution effect; the mixing effect and speed change rule obtained by the 2D model are consistent with the results obtained by the 3D model. The performance of the results of the two models is consistent when exploring the numerical simulation of rubber compounding.",

Combined with studies of temperature correlations, an explicit model for predicting the Payne effect at different prestrains and temperatures is developed. Dynamic mechanical analyses are performed to determine model parameters and validate the proposed model. To further verify the proposed model, the heat buildup of rubber columns under dynamic tensile load is tested and simulated. The comparison between simulated and measured data shows that the simulation considering nonrelaxation is more accurate than without considering. With the increase of prestrain, the accuracy of considering nonrelaxation becomes more obvious.",

These are fiber placement and wall thickness distribution after forming, displacement paths required, interlaminar sliding, minimum blank size required, as well as the heat transfer during forming. Current and future investigations will enhance the program's range of performance. Of particular interest are calculation of three-dimensional anisotropic temperature distribution, of the mechanical characteristic values, as well as of shrinkage and warpage behaviors.

Experiments with PMMA were also performed on an extrusion‐air cooling line to provide a basis for comparison with the extrusion‐roll stack system. The results showed that the size and stability of the bank in the extrusion‐roll stack system affected the thickness variations and the frozen‐in strains. Operating the roll stack system was found to allow for fairly rapid rearrangements from parabolic to plug velocity profiles. Line comparisons between the roll stack and air cooling showed that the roll stack minimized thickness variations, frozen‐in strains, and surface flaws.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The long‐term behavior of a glass mat‐reinforced polypropylene has been characterized by accelerated flexural creep tests on samples of the laminate. Considerable data were collected for stress levels ranging from 200 to 7500 psi at six temperatures from room temperature to 140 °C. The material was found to behave in accordance with the linear theory of viscoelasticity except at the longer times where the creep rate increases dramatically and the specimen ruptures. The stress and temperature dependence of this “terminal creep” zone was treated by means of a slightly modified version of Schapery's thermodynamic theory of nonlinear viscoelasticity, which involves the superposition of double logarithmic plots of creep compliance versus time. The stress and temperature dependence of both the free energy function and the entropy production emerge from this treatment. A comparison of nonisothermal creep data with a prediction from the isothermal master curve is marginally acceptable. A statistical synthesis of the data discloses that the incidence of terminal creep is log‐normally distributed. Moreover, the standard deviation associated with the distribution is independent of temperature. It is therefore possible to assess the probability of failure for any constant stress at any constant temperature.",

    "abstract": "Melting in screw extruders has been studied extensively, starting with the experimental studies of Maddock and Street in the 1950s. These workers observed a melting model with the solid particles all clumped together in a solid bed. A thin melt film separated the solid bed from the extruder barrel; most melting took place between the solid bed and the melt film. This melting model is termed the contiguous solids melting model, CSM; it is the model most often observed in single screw extruders. It was first analyzed theoretically by Tadmor in the early 1960s. Another type of melting that has been observed by several workers has separate, solid particles floating in a melt matrix. This melting model is termed dispersed solids melting, DSM; it has been observed in twin screw extruders, reciprocating single screw compounders, and some regular single screw extruders. It has been observed experimentally that melting through DSM occurs much more efficiently than through CSM. However, there has been little work published on a quantitative description of dispersed solids melting. Here the theory of CSM as well as DSM is developed with closed-form analytical solutions. The melting characteristics of the two models are compared. It is shown that dispersed solids melting can be substantially more efficient than contiguous solids melting. This opens up interesting areas of investigation. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

However, the exact value of the stress for viscoelastic liquids at the synthetic inlet is a priori unknown. In this article, we present the application of the “free boundary condition” to the inlet stress, which avoids the necessity of specifying an a priori unknown value of stress at the synthetic inlet. To apply the free boundary condition, the process must be cast and studied as a two-point boundary value problem by finite elements. To verify the admissibility and accuracy of the free boundary condition, the same process is cast and studied as an initial value problem, directly solvable by a DGEAR subroutine. The initial value problem is cast in a matrix form that allows analytic investigation of admissible solutions: With the upper convected Maxwell model, the fiber can only slim monotonically with the downstream distance, whereas with the Giesekus model there may be cases of initially increasing and subsequently decreasing diameter, i.e., extrudate-swelling. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Film embossing is a mechanical process in which a flat film is transformed into an embossed product. During the process, thermal and stress fields are applied to the polymer, causing changes in the microstructure and physical dimensions of the material. The engineering analysis of the process requires the study of various aspects relating to the characterization of the microstructure before and after embossing. A variety of experimental techniques were employed to characterize the properties and microstructure of embossed films in relation to: crystallinity, orientation, mechanical properties, and dimensions of the embossed films. Mathematical models were also developed to predict the temperature, stress, and deformation in the plastic films during embossing. The thermal treatment of the plastic film was shown to be the most significant factor in the process. The important aspects influencing the thermal treatment include the radiation heater temperature, preheat roll temperature, line velocity, and film thickness. In general, the heat transfer mathematical model predictions were in agreement with the experimental data. The stress and deformation analysis suggested that the embossing pressure and the rubber layer on the backup roll are significant factors in determining the dimensions and stress distribution in the nip region. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The need for composite materials with improved properties tailored to the requirements of specific end uses has led to the development of hybrids reinforcement systems in which two or more reinforcing fibers are combined in a thermosetting matrix. Polyester fibers (PET) are currently being used in combination with other fibers, particularly fiberglass, for impact strength and surface quality improvement. The use of polyester fiber in combination with glass fiber as a reinforcement for composite materials has resulted in the development of novel types of hybrid composites. This study discusses our work to achieve an optimum balance of composite properties through changes in matrix formulation, composite compounding, and processing steps. A number of these parameters are shown to have a significant effect on the performance of the composite. This work includes an analysis of thermoset polyester and epoxy resin formulations, in addition to the effect of other additives for typical BMC, SMC, and injection‐molding operations. The fiber loading, PET–glass fiber ratio, and fiber length are briefly discussed, as these are factors in determining the composite properties. These characteristics are discussed in combination with the compounding techniques. The combination of both factors were observed to have a major effect on the mechanical and surface appearance of the composite. The coherency and dispersibility of the specific PET fiber used had additional effects on resin compounding and final composite characteristics.",

The shaping is performed by injection molding and the compaction into the definitive part by sintering. Shaping starts with the metal powders and binders being mixed, homogenized, and worked up to a granulate. The granulate is now processed to the so‐called green compact on an injection molding machine. Injection mold processing of powder metal is basically comparable to pure thermoplastics. After forming, the green compact must be compacted to the final, purely metallic component. To this end, the binder part must be removed from the body, which is subsequently sintered down to its final density. This article touches upon aspects of the problems and questions arising from powder–metal injection molding. The objective is to provide an insight into a promising production process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plastic components can only be competitive if they make use of the material and thereby emerge technically and economically superior to conventional materials. This places, high requirements on designers and presupposes extensive experience. A situation where the optimal version can only be established in expensive prototype molds is unacceptable. Above all, though, the time that this takes is preventing substitution by plastic parts from gaining an increasing market in the industrial component sector. The tasks which companies have to tackle today include increasing performance and making freely available experience that is currently confined to individuals. The establishment of specified work sequences helps to avoid errors. The chief tasks involved in design are compilation of specifications, material selection, and shaping and dimensioning. The designer's work can be broken down into acquisition of information, calculation, decision making, and drawing. The use of computers can help towards rationalization in the design field as well. This rationalization ought not only to give shorter transit times but improved components as well. The following program packages are available: a data bank program for managing design data, a search program with corresponding data file for material selection, a 3D graphic system for compiling drawings, a FE program for dimensioning, and an expert program to aid the designer in decision making. Apart from the conventional free design it is also possible to define individual functional elements or assemblies, such as snap fastenings or ribs, by way of design macros. These macros are designed and calculated in principle and then simply aligned auttomatically when incorporated in a specific part. Computersided dimensioning makes it possible to establish all the factors influencing quality in a specific application and to recognize weak points in simulated tests right at the design stage. The conventional concept of dimensioning (applying a sum of reducing coefficients to make allowance for loading) has thus been dispensed with, and a route is shown which permits precise allowance to be made for all the influences in a particular loading case. This therefore ensures optimum material utilization.",

The tensile properties and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of composites with various fiber volume fraction were studied using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The fracture surface of composites was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surprising result from the tensile tests is that the percent elongation of AS4/epoxy composites was much higher than that of individual components, i.e., the epoxy and the fiber. The stress–strain curves of AS4 fiber/epoxy composites show yielding. The yielding is interpreted to result from shear stress concentration due to the fiber breakage. Two causes of failure mode were observed in this study: (1) ductile plastic deformation by the PAN‐based AS4/epoxy composites; (ii) brittle catastrophic failure shown by the pitch‐based VSB‐16/epoxy composites. The tensile strengths and moduli of the composites increased as the volume fraction of fibers increased. The principal fracture features of AS4/epoxy composites under tension were fiber pullout (bundles and single fibers) and very rough fracture surface due to the pullout of fiber bundles with epoxy, whereas VSB‐16/epoxy composites under tensile and bending loads showed only tensile (or compressive) failure. The composites of epoxy/PAN (polyacrylonitrile)‐based fibers (AS4) showed greater ILSS than those of the pitch‐based fiber (VSB‐16)/epoxy. The most characteristic features of the interlaminar shear failure surface of AS4/epoxy composites are delamination and formation of hackles.",

Due to the improvements made in the field of both raw materials and production units, the PUR–RRIM process has, in the last few years, become interesting also for high‐volume production. A handicap in this connection is that the development of the RRIM process is, to a large extent, based on the practical experience of a few experts. For its use in high‐volume production it is, however, inevitable to have at hand through scientific data on material, design, process and resulting correlations. It is the objective of the Institute for Polymer Testing and Polymer Science in Stuttgart to help establish these data and, through close contacts to the industry, make them usable in practice.",

The quantitative analysis has been carried out utilizing a computer simulation program covering cavity‐filling behavior to analyze the relationship between the deformation of gold wires that are bonded with mounted IC chips and mold geometries, operational conditions, and physical properties of a thermoplastic encapsulant, i.e., polyphenylene sulfide. As a result, a new technology to encapsulate ICs has been established, preventing no practical gold wire deformation or break‐up damage. © 1993 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

This work uses T-spline surface with extraordinary control points instead of NURBS to represent freeform surfaces in mold models. Compared with NURBS, T-splines’ higher-order continuity facilitates the mold quality control especially at the patch boundary. And, its patch layout information can be utilized for tool path planning. We propose an algorithm to determine the patch processing order and generate nonretraction tool path for T-spline surface models. The tool paths are generated patch by patch using isoparametric strategy. Actual machining and injection molding experiments have been conducted. The result shows the feasibility of the proposed method, and the final product is in good quality.",

The first is to numerically investigate and reveal the effect of polymer viscoelasticity on the retraction of a deformed drop using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method and polymer kinetic theory. More importantly, the second is to propose a novel method to evaluate the interfacial tension between polymer melts based on the numerical study. Compared with the conventional deformed drop retraction method (DDRM), the present method is designed to greatly reduce the impact of polymer viscoelasticity on measuring interfacial tension. To verify, the interfacial tension between molten PP and POE is evaluated using the proposed method and obviously closer result to the true value is shown.",

In this study, first, the principles of Pareto optimal solutions and multiobjective genetic algorithm were presented. Second, to investigate the influence of the mold temperature on the products’ performances, a multicavity experiment injection mold was designed whose temperature could be controlled by the heating rods. To obtain a homogeneous temperature distribution across the multicavity surfaces after the heating stage, multiobjective optimization models for the heating rods layout were established based on the heat transfer process of the mold. Finally, the Pareto-based genetic algorithm and finite element method were combined to solve the optimized models to obtain the optimal solution. After a finite element analysis and experimental injection, it is proved that the optimized distribution of the heating rods in the mold is necessary for the experiment and production.",

An organic solid horizontal array capacitor with a dielectric of prepreg materials of the epoxy type can implement the nine capacitances in a single body via a unique simple lamination and cutting process. We then investigate the basic electrical properties of a horizontal array capacitor. The organic solid array capacitors with five electrodes and four dielectrics are Cu/PPG layer/Cu/PPG layer/Cu/PPG layer/Cu/PPG layer/Cu with a horizontal array structure. The size of a completed array capacitor is 2.85 × 2.85 mm. The height of the fabricated array capacitor in the vertical direction is 0.5 mm, with nine capacitances possessing a series-type structure. The average capacitance value of C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , and C 4 is 1.98 nF, and each tolerance has a value within 1% based on the average value. The temperature change rate in the capacitance maintains a nearly linear characteristic, but the rate of change tends to increase finely from 120°C or more. The capacitance values of C 5 , C 6 , and C 7 with the parallel circuit were measured according to the voltage. Impedance and ESR (equivalent series resistor) of C 1 were measured according to frequency and temperature.",

    "abstract": "The socket plays an important role in prostheses by providing structural integrity and suspension to the distal thigh of an amputee. Heat accumulation and weight of the socket increase the energy consumption in the amputee. To overcome the same, widely used polyester-based sandwich-structured composite was reinforced with 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 wt% multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and analyzed for the thermal and mechanical properties. MWCNT added in a small weight proportion with polyester enhances the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites as they have excellent mechanical and physical properties. The flexural and thermal property was evaluated as per ASTM D790 and ISO 22007-2 standard. It was noticed that the thermal property enhances with increase in wt% of MWCNT and mechanical properties decreased when more than 0.6 wt% MWCNT was reinforced. Hence, the sandwich-structured composite was prepared using polyester resin, 2 to 10 stockinette layers, fiberglass cloth, and 0.6 wt% of MWCNT. The thermal conductivity and flexural strength of 0.6 wt% MWCNT-reinforced sandwich-structured composite were enhanced upto 68.4% and 11.4% for 2-10 stockinette layers, respectively, while comparing to the unreinforced polyester sandwich-structured composite. The 0.6 wt% MWCNT-reinforced sandwich-structured composite may help in reducing the weight and heat build up in the socket. Hence, it is recommended to analyze further on their application in transfemoral socket preparation to bring down an amputee’s metabolic cost.",

    "abstract": "The influence of molecular structure on the rheology and processability of blow-molding grade high-density polyethylene (HDPE) resins is studied using capillary and extensional rheometers, a melt indexer, and a blow-molder unit. Twenty-four commercial HDPE resins were analyzed in terms of their shear and extensional flow properties, extrudate swell characteristics, and melt strength. The resins had varying molecular weight characteristics and were produced using a variety of polymerization technologies (gas, slurry, and solution phase). It was found that shear viscosity is not only influenced by the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PI), but also technology dependent, irrespective of molecular characteristics. Increasing Mw was found to increase both shear and extensional viscosity, while increasing PI by increasing the concentration of smaller molecules increases the tendency of the resin to shear thin. In relating melt strength and temperature sensitivity of shear viscosity to molecular parameters, resins had to be grouped according to ranges of PI < 8, 8. < PI < 10, and PI > 10. Moreover, it was possible to relate melt strength to the Hencky strain obtained from creep experiments and to the melt index of the resins. Finally, it was found that extrudate swell behavior and melt strength are important parameters to be considered during parison formation, as observed during blow-molding experiments. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In addition, the effects of abrasive combing and pretreatment techniques on fiber and composite characteristics were examined in this work. Using PALF vascular bundles separated from different regions of the leaves did not affect the mechanical aspects of pineapple leaf fiber-vinyl ester composites. PALF fibers performed equally in strengthening composite flexural properties under static loading, regardless of diameter or location, with a much lower weight percentage and combined pressure. Tests at higher speeds revealed that the PALF-vinyl ester composite was more robust with more delicate bundles. Reinforcing composites that do not require a high degree of hardness can benefit from the cleaner, more delicate bundles produced by abrasive combing.",

    "abstract": "Structure-property relationships of injection- and compression-molded microfibrillar-reinforced PET/PA-6 blends with different weight ratio of the components have been studied. The blends were prepared by melt mixing using a single-screw extruder. Thermal, X-ray (WAXS), morphological, and static mechanical studies of the bulk samples were carried out in order to determine an optimum processing window. The upper processing temperature was established by the onset of the melting of the fibrillized PET component in the blend. Morphological studies of the injection-molded samples indicate skin-core morphology. The skin layer is composed of fibrils that are well oriented along the flow axis. The core region is composed of a small amount of randomly oriented, fibrillar PET bundles, as well as a large amount of spherical PET domains in the isotropic PA-6 matrix. SEM observations of the fracture surface of compression-molded samples show well-extended PET fibrils embedded in an isotropic PA-6 matrix. The reason for this significant difference in the morphology of the samples is the fact that in the case of compression molding it is possible to keep very accurately the desired processing temperature in a quite narrow interval. On the other hand, an overheating of the system due to non-isothermal shear and a viscosity dissipation are the main reasons for the melting of a part of the PET fibrils and their transformation into spherical domains in the core of the injection-molded samples. The morphology strongly affects the tensile properties of the bulk samples. Compared to the values of injection-molded neat PA-6, the elastic modulus and the strength of injection-molded MFC (Microfibrillar reinforced composites) blends have been increased by a factor of 2.5 and 1.7, respectively. In the case of compression-molded samples, both modulus and strength were about four times higher than those of the neat PA-6. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 19: 249–259, 2000",

The blends are immiscible owing to the differences in the polarities of the component polymers. Thermal studies using a differential scanning calorimeter showed that the blending does not change the crystallinity and non-isothermal crystallization behavior of PBT. The tensile strength and modulus showed gradual decrease with increase in VLDPE content. The impact strength, however, was found to increase marginally with increasing VLDPE content. The examination of fractured surfaces using scanning electron microscopy indicated a two-phase morphology with spherical domains of VLDPE dispersed in PBT matrix. Addition of ethylene-based compatibilizers resulted in significant improvements in the mechanical properties through modification of phase morphology and interfacial adhesion. The effectiveness of the compatibilizers has been explained on the basis of possible interaction between the reactive groups present in the compatibilizer and the polymer. The presence of such bonding reaction leading to better interfacial properties has also been confirmed using lap shear measurements. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Tech 19: 41–53, 2000",

In this study, nanosilica as reinforcing agent and dispersing agent has been introduced during the preparation of PPAs. A series of the polyurethane powder adhesives modified by nanosilica were prepared and the influence of adding order of nanosilica on the heat resistance and adhesive strength properties of PPAs has been investigated. The results showed that the T-peel strength of most samples after second heat (heated at 70°C for 24 hours) decreased about 60-80% comparing with the original T-peel strength. However, PPSY only decreased 17.5%, which indicated the nanosilica added after the chain extension reaction, in the prepolymer synthesis could increase the heat resistance performance of polyurethane powder adhesives. It also means the nanosilica was doped between the PU chains keeping the original form as enhancement reagent adding the nanosilica after the chain extension reaction. The excellent heat resistance performance of PPSY could meet the requirements of the industrial gluing in the fields of footwear.",

    "abstract": "Water flux is one of the most important performance parameters of the reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. The higher water flux means lower energy cost when treating the same volume of feed solution with membrane separation technology. However, the increase of membrane water flux always corresponds to the decrease of solvent rejection, known as the “trade-off” effect. In addition, the surface fouling of membranes is often a serious problem, as frequent cleaning not only increases the operating cost but also shortens the life of the membranes. Recently, various hydrophilic nanomaterials have been used to improve the performance of membranes. To fabricate thin film nanocomposite (TFN) RO membrane with high flux and antifouling performance, maleic anhydride-grafted graphene oxide (MG) was successfully synthesized and incorporated into the polyamide (PA) layer via the interfacial polymerization (IP) method. We performed the IP reaction with m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) as reactive monomers on a polysulfone (PSF) substrate, and acid absorbent (TEA) and surfactant (SDS) were added to improve the separation performance of the membrane. The effects of MG incorporation on the membrane morphology and separation performance were investigated. SEM and AFM results show that the surface of the MG membrane is rougher than that of the membrane without MG. In addition, excessive loading of MG will lead to aggregation of MG nanosheets. FT-IR spectra indicate that the interaction between MG and PA layers results in an increase of hydrophilic groups on the surface of the TFN membrane, which is further confirmed by the results of the contact angle. The optimal MG doping concentration in the aqueous solution is 0.004 wt%, the water flux of the resultant TFN membrane is significantly increased to 51 L·m-2·h-1, 150% higher than the blank control membrane, which also performs a higher NaCI rejection (97.5% vs. 96.6%). Furthermore, the MG-incorporated RO membrane exhibits superior antifouling performance compared with the blank control membrane.",

After mixing with acrylic-based emulsion, dispersion of the VO2 particles in the polymer matrix was significantly improved. The visible light transmittance through the composite films above 75% was maintained if a concentration of the modified VO2 particles loaded into acrylic polymer film was no greater than 1.0 wt%. The NIR transmittance through the acrylic/VO2@PSS : PEDOT also dropped by 9-10%, compared with that of the pure acrylic film (without any particles). Finally, glass substrates coated with the acrylic/VO2@PSS : PEDOT composite films could reduce the temperature inside a model house by 5-6°C, compared with that of the control system (pure acrylic coating film without VO2 particles). Overall, this work demonstrated that it was possible to improve the dispersion of VO2 particles in polymer films without sacrificing its NIR shielding ability by grafting the surface of VO2 particles with PSS : PEDOT chains, while providing the optimum grafting density and particle loading.",

    "abstract": "Salt water exposure conditions relevant to carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) prestressed concrete structures in marine environments are investigated. The diffusion into relatively small diameter CFRP tendons can be a lengthy process so the prediction of the long-term moisture uptake using short-term experiments on thin films of epoxy would be advantageous. However, the fibre inclusions within a composite introduce complexities, and factors are typically required for correlation with pure epoxy specimens. Diffusion parameters based on moisture uptake result from CFRP tendons exposed to salt water solution at 20°C and 60°C are compared with those obtained using equivalent thin film specimens. The higher temperature is selected to accelerate the moisture uptake. It is found that the measured ratios of tendon and epoxy diffusivity were temperature dependent, and the combination of the higher temperature and salt solution leads to an increased propensity for moisture uptake in the tendon. Existing analytical models to predict the CFRP tendon diffusivity from that of a thin film of epoxy did not appear to capture the observed trends. However, predictions using a unit cell with a fibre interface zone suggest that this may be due to an increased diffusivity in the interphase region.",

Bisphenol A-type epoxy-based protective coatings were prepared by impregnating exotic titanium metal microparticles into two different proportions, i.e., 5% and 10% ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mi>w</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>w</mi></math> ). Film hardness measurement by pencil test, adhesion measurement by the crosshatch-tape test, chemical and heat resistance test, gloss measurement, natural exposure, and salt spray testing have demonstrated that Ti-enriched coatings have performed better than the virgin epoxy coating. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy has depicted more surface degradation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has indicated higher mass loss and chain scission in the virgin epoxy coating than the Ti-enriched coatings. In addition, these Ti microparticles have filled up the cavities/imperfections, reduced cracking, promoted crosslinking during the curing, and cordoned-off passage of corrodents and moisture, thus improving epoxy resin coating features. These results have widened the scope of Ti-embedded epoxy coatings against atmospheric corrosion for highly corrosive marine sites.",

Moreover, the vulcanizates with LC-Cys showed excellent mechanical properties and resistance to thermooxidative aging.

In this work, edge-oxidized graphene/polypropylene (EOGr/PP) composites with well-dispersed EOGr in PP matrix, synchronously exhibiting high electrical conductivity and thermal property, were simply fabricated for the first time using a novel strategy by in situ artificial PP latex preparation in the presence of EOGr based on solution-emulsification technique. The good dispersion state of EOGr in the PP matrix was demonstrated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A blue shift in Raman G peak of the EOGr nanosheets was observed in the EOGr/PP composites, indicating the strong interactions between the EOGr nanosheets and the PP matrix. The onset crystallization and crystallization peak temperatures increased as the EOGr loading increases due to its good nucleating ability. An improved thermal stability of EOGr/PP composites was observed as evaluated by TGA. The EOGr/PP composites showed an insulator-to-conductor percolation transition in between that of 1 and 2 wt% EOGr content. Such strategy provides a very effective pathway to fabricate high-performance nonpolar polymer/graphene composites with excellent dispersion state of graphene.",

This article investigates the effects of the ICCM process on moldability and part quality. Effects of compression-related parameters, including delay, speed, pressure, time, and distance, are also investigated. ICCM extends the moldable area with an expanded cavity during short-shot filling. The process improves dimensional accuracy in the lateral direction. However, surface conformity to the cavity is not better than conventional injection molding due to a significant orientation difference in injection- and compression-filled zones. The good part quality can be obtained with short delay, long compression distance, low pressure, and proper compression time. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 17: 353–360, 1998",

Scale-up criteria are delivered in an orthodox way, starting from extruder heat balance and also including a heat-removal parameter and a non-Newtonian index, which specify extruder conditions and polymer characteristics.

One was the concurrent blending method in a polymerization reactor (reactor blend), and the other was the conventional melt blending in a twin-screw extruder (extruder blend). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the reactor blend resulted in dispersed PP particles less than 1 μm in diameter, whereas the particles were 3 to 4 μm in diameter for the extruder blend. The rheological properties judged from Rheometrics mechanical spectrometry, capillary rheometry, melt index, complex viscosity, and melt strength also suggested different natures for the two types of blends. The extruder blend showed a sharp change in flow properties as a function of peroxide and coagent concentration, whereas this was only gradual for the reactor blends. For mechanical properties, the reactor blends were superior in elongation at break to the extruder blends. These observations suggest that the level of interfacial tension was lower for the reactor blends than for extruder blends.

A distinction is made between the effect of pressure and temperature on the bulk density for various materials and this cannot be neglected in polymer processing operations. The rheological property of solid polymer particles must be considered in the design of the plasticating extruder screw, which forms the basis of many polymer processing methods.

    "abstract": "Twin screw extruders are common for mixing and compounding of different polymers and additives in the production of materials with enhanced properties. However, the flow field and resulting mixing that occur inside these extruders are not well understood. For gaining a better understanding of the flow phenomena that take place during these operations, computer simulation can be used; however, due to the complexity of the moving boundaries in the twin screw extruder this is not an easy task. Using the boundary element method (BEM), which is the method of choice for moving boundary problems, the flow field, pressures, stress, and strains can be computed at every time step. With this information, the quality of mixing can be determined quantitatively and allows the engineer to modify the geometry of the screws for optimal mixing conditions. In this article, the boundary element method is used to analyze and compare mixing effectiveness of various geometries of the twin screw extruder. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this report, an L18 experimental matrix design based on the Taguchi method was conducted to optimize the joint strength of ultrasonically welded thermoplastics. For the factors selected in the main experiments, weld time and amplitude of vibration were found to be the principal factors affecting the joint property of ultrasonically welded thermoplastics. A weldability diagram was proposed based on the statistical results to give first guidelines for system optimization. In addition, amorphous polymers required less energy to be successfully welded than semicrystalline polymers.

    "abstract": "The effect of two elastomers and a newly developed plastomer on rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of their blends with a commercially available recycled polyethylene were studied. The results show effective improvements in engineering properties of the recycled polyethylene (PE). Low percentages of these modifiers give rise to higher elastic properties of the blends. Addition of all modifiers resulted in decreases in crystallinity and in melting point of the blends. Depending on modifier type the intensity of the changes was different. It is concluded from infrared spectra of the blends that no chemical interaction occurs during melt mixing of the ingredients. These improvements are attributed to morphological changes and physical interactions between modifiers and PE matrix. In melt state, as the modification percentage increases and depending on the nature of modifier, the resulting blends show different rheological behavior: EPDM447 constantly increases the viscosity and elasticity of the corresponding blends; EPDM541 is almost ineffective; and EXACT™ 4041 decreases and then increases these properties, depending on its concentration in the blend. The results presented in terms of weighed relaxation time spectra show different behaviors depending on the additive. For all modifiers, the 7% modification was always found to have the most pronounced effect on almost all properties of the blends. It was also found that EPDM447 shows the best effects on different properties of the recycled PE. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 17: 127–143, 1998",

    "abstract": "Laminar morphology of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/polyamide-6 (PA-6) blends was obtained, for the first time, in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The morphology analysis in the interior of the adapter, which connects the extruder with a slit die, revealed that, under specific processing conditions, it is possible to produce layers of PA-6 in the end of the screw zone of the extruder. The micrographs of the extruded final products showed distributed layers across the sample thickness and along the flow direction. The effect of design and processing variables such as adapter angle, die gap, temperature profile, feed rate, and screw speed on the final product morphology were evaluated. In this research, blends were obtained with toluene permeability reduced by up to 113 times from the permeability of the matrix alone. This value is 2.5 times better than the best value reported for products of single screw extrusion. Mechanical tests showed that the HDPE/PA-6 extrudates maintain stiffness and tensile strength values comparable to those of polyethylene. In order to obtain products with optimum balance between the permeability and the mechanical properties, a statistical analysis was carried out. It produced useful information regarding the important processing and design factors that affect the product properties. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 18: 89–108, 1999",

    "abstract": "Simulation of monomeric material transport in reactive extrusion revealed that two different situations can be distinguished in the partially filled zone of a twin-screw extruder. Material is transported from the bottom of the barrel to the top of the screw by drag or material remains on the bottom of the channel because of gravity. Which process takes place can be predicted when the ratio between the Froude number (gravitation forces) and the Reynolds number (viscous forces) is known. From experiments in a perspex model of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, using glycerol and silicone oil as model fluids, it could be observed which situation can be expected at different filling degrees, screw speeds, throughputs, and viscosities. In the case of a constant filling degree, material moves up with the screw flight at a certain value of Fr/Re. At higher Fr/Re ratios, a larger filling degree is needed for the screws to drag material up with the screw flights. When the filling degree reaches one-half, material moves up with both the pushing and the pulling screw flight. On the basis of these observations, a model is proposed to determine the backflow in the partially filled zone of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, dependent on viscosity and screw speed. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Suspensions with filler contents of 50% and above by volume showed non-Newtonian behavior, whereas suspensions with smaller contents of filler were Newtonian. In most cases, the non-Newtonian suspensions were pseudoplastic at small shear rates, but dilatant at high shear rates.

The relationship between graft weight and melt processability was determined from melt flow index (MFI) measurements. Films were obtained by both compression molding and extrusion and were characterized in terms of their hydrophilicity. The limiting value for graft level for processability was found to be in the region of 30–35% at the two extremes of the range of MFI values of the base polymer. The preferred polymer has an MFI of 35 dg/min, giving a limiting maximum graft weight for processability of 45%. It was demonstrated that high graft weight EVA copolymer resins are melt processable and that this would be a viable method for the production of hydrophilic membranes for applications such as drug delivery membranes, medical devices, including catheters and stents and, semipermeable battery separator membranes. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "Optimization of the compatibilizer concentration in polymer blends has generally been achieved through an indirect correlation with property improvements. In this article the evolution in particle size with percent interfacial modifier (emulsification curve) is used to quantitatively assess the state of the interface under a wide range of processing conditions in ABS/polyamide-6 (nylon-6) blends. This type of dependence can yield important information concerning the state of the interface of a given blend, including the concentration of compatibilizer necessary for interfacial saturation. To illustrate the applicability of an emulsification curve to polymer processing equipment, a comparison is made between the twin-screw extruder and the single-screw extruder. In order to simulate a wide processing performance range no additional mixing devices were used to enhance mixing on the single-screw extruder. The twin-screw extruder therefore represents the case of good mixing and the single-screw extruder represents that of poor mixing. Finally, for the good mixing case, the impact strength has been analyzed in order to observe its behavior at the critical concentration for interfacial saturation as well as the effect of dispersed phase composition. The size of the dispersed domains reveals important differences between the compounding effects of the single-screw as compared to the twin-screw extruder. A compatibilizing agent renders such a blend more homogeneous by reducing the particle size of the dispersed phase. It was also found for the single-screw extruder that the interface is not saturated and the phase size equilibrium value is not obtained even at high levels of interfacial modifier. The higher efficacy of the twin-screw extruder in migrating the modifier to the interface is clearly demonstrated through the use of the emulsification curve. The impact strength of material prepared by twin-screw/injection molding shows a significant increase at a modifier concentration, which correlates well with the critical concentration for interfacial saturation of interfacial modifier from the emulsification study. The impact strength of an optimally compatibilized system as a function of dispersed phase composition displays a maximum impact strength around 50% ABS in the co-continuous morphology region. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "abstract": "In this work, PET films were stretched on the long extensional tester at various temperatures, stretch speeds, and stretch ratios. The stretched films were then characterized using various techniques. Prediction of container properties using the data generated for films was undertaken and three different approaches were used. The first method involves the use of time–temperature superposition to extrapolate the film data to the extension rate and extension ratio encountered in bottle blowing. In the second method, correlations developed between functional properties and average orientation functions for films were used for prediction of properties of blown containers. The third method was a combination of the first two methods. The birefringence was obtained by superposition and other properties were predicted using the correlation between functional properties and birefringence. With the exception of tensile energy absorption, it has been shown that mechanical properties of blown containers can be predicted from film data using any of the three methods previously described. A quantitative measure of property variation through thickness can also be obtained. Using the methods developed in this work, a map of properties and processing conditions encountered in stretch blow molding can be generated and this information can be used for designing preforms and containers. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Highest velocity gradients were observed below the nip, and the maximum tangential velocity occurred 2 to 3 mm below the nip.

In the present study, we measured the fiber-length distributions and the average fiber lengths under various compounding conditions. It was found that the fiber-length distributions depend upon the shear stress and the total number of rotations and that the fiber-length distributions were identical if the average fiber lengths were the same. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The fact of several reactions and physical processes taking place along side each other in a very short time causes considerable difficulties and leads to high reject rates or high finishing costs in practical operation. These difficulties include obtaining an adequate mixing quality for high‐grade components, transporting the ready‐mixed blend into the mold cavity, and maintaining absolutely constant the optimum process parameters for production. The homogenizing effect of high‐pressure mixing heads was established by using transparent model liquids. The measuring systems we applied was a chemical decolorizing method and the so‐called random sampling method. The findings established with these methods and the model liquids have been summarized in the form of design and setting recommendations for counterflow injection mixers. We also compiled an energy description for the layout and operation of counterflow injection mixers, based on the correlation between energy input and mixing quality. This description is in the form of a dimensioning reference value and allows the user to achieve a rapid layout. We checked the findings obtained on real PUR systems. The dimensioning reference value makes it possible to establish a critical limiting blend. The guarantee of a specific blend quality is an essential, though by no means adequate, criterion for the production of defect‐free moldings. While the ready‐mixed blend is flowing into or inside the mold cavity, incorrect flow guidance can cause bubbles to be enclosed in the blend, or several flow fronts meeting at an unfavorable point can lead to air pockets being trapped. We were able to observe and record the flow processes visually by using transparent molds. The effects of a series of throttle and gate systems on air bubble enclosure can now be assessed on the basis of these records. We also developed an easy‐to‐use method for the mold designer, which allows him to describe the flow processes in the mold. By using this method, the designer can establish a visual picture of the filling process right at the design stage. This makes it possible to eliminate serious errors early on, at little expense, by modification of the construction drawing. In the past, these errors could only be rectified by costly alterations to the finished mold, if at all. One of the characteristics of the PUR manufacturing process is that the chemical reaction and the shaping of the reaction melt take place simultaneously within a very short time and mutually influence one another. The process parameters for a given mold geometry must be selected so as to ensure that both the process sequence for the chemical reaction and the flow and filling process are controlled in such a way as to give a defect‐free part which can be demolded in the shortest possible time. The trial and error method of process optimization applied today is time‐consuming and costly. In addition, it does not permit clear‐cut conclusions to be drawn about the machine setting from the molded part, on account of the complex chemical/thermodynamic interactions involved. Objective criteria for machine setting can be found by measuring the decisive process parameters in the mold itself. Automatic process monitoring is possible, or better, essential, for recognizing errors and deviations right at the manufacturing stage and implementing countermeasures automatically. The control parameter is the reaction temperature in the mold. It is this which determines the reaction speed, the viscosity profile, the crosslinking and curing process and hence the flow in the mold, the foaming and filling process, and the attainable demolding time. The level and time profile of the reaction temperature is controlled via the liberated heat of reaction, the starting temperature of the components, and the mold wall temperature, which, in the case of thin‐walled parts, constitutes the chief influencing variable. The pressure inside the mold is easy to measure and provides a valuable aid in setup and process monitoring. Its profile indicates the flow resistance, the filling and foaming pressure, and the reaction shrinkage. The pressure measurement can thus be used to monitor the viscosity profile of the reaction, and then the metering time, filling capacity, gas charge, and blowing agent aligned to give optimum mold filling without overinjection. A modular unit concept is described for monitoring and controlling the metering unit. Precise operation of this unit marks a prerequisite for a reliable process sequence. This concept incorporates the potential of present‐day microcomputers and personal computers to log and evaluate data. The central feature here is the control of component temperatures and the flow measurement and metering control. It is essential to measure component pressures in the recirculation and mixing phase in order to detect and smooth out pressure differences which could otherwise lead to a change in the blend (dynamic reference value shift). When it comes to the gas charge, the solution of the gas by the conveying pressure is decisive. The dissolution process in the mold is pressure‐ and time‐dependent. It is thus essential to measure the pressure inside the mold in order to check the actual impact of the gas charge for the foaming and holding pressure phase in the mold.",

A significant number of changes have occurred in the rubber industry and, subsequently, in rubber processing equipment. Compound processing machinery reflects the awareness of energy costs and the need for conservation. There is a slow but growing trend toward continuous processing. The elastomers are more readily available in particle form. The machinery reflects a far greater understanding of the nature of the material to be processed, and the need for the processing equipment to be able to operate with this in mind. The processing machinery of the 1980s is not necessarily bigger, but it is better because it is smarter. The old magic and mysterious art of rubber compounding and compound processing is being completely replaced by machinery systems that scientifically process rubber compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On January 18, 1977 the United States Patent Office granted James E. Turner the rights to Patent Number 4,003,408 entitled “Underground Irrigation Porous Pipe.” The porous pipe was claimed to be made entirely from reclaimed rubber and recycled plastic binder. The weight percent of binder materials ranged from 10% to 40%. The wall of the porous pipe was reported to contain labyrinthine apertures of such size and number so as to provide a leak rate of 12 to 20 gallons per hour of water per one hundred feet of length of 1/2 inch pipe when subjected to internal pressures of 5 to 10 psig. The pores were claimed to have been blown into the walls by venting vapors and water associated with the rubber during the extrusion process. This paper reports on an analysis of such a “leaky pipe” as described by Patent Number 4,003,408. The leakage phenomenon is shown to be a natural occurrence which arises from the adhesion of rubber particles with insufficient binder to fill the voids between particles. This observation means that the reclaimed rubber must have a very narrow size range if the leak rate is to be predictable. In addition, the binder material may be restricted to virgin LLDPE feed stock if a reproducible product is to be continuously extruded. Finally, using technology developed for sintered‐porous metal objects, it was demonstrated that the leak rate can be predicted a priori. This evidence suggests that the occurrence of the porosity as claimed in U.S. Patent Number 4,003,408 is not confirmed by practical experience. Moreover, although a leaky pipe can be produced in accordance with the teachings of the patent, the properties and performance of that pipe will probably not meet the specification of potential users.",

It is shown that in co-rotating twin screw extruders there are more design constraints because the flight flank angle has to equal the angle of intermesh. This is not the case for counter-rotating twin screw extruders. The various geometries possible in the two types of extruders are shown. Although the geometries used for co-rotating extruders are well known, the geometries for counter-rotating extruders are not well known. In fact, some of the geometries possible with counter-rotating extruders have not yet been made commercially available. The implications of the geometric analysis on actual extruder performance is discussed in detail. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Co-rotating twin screw extruders are extensively used in polymer compounding. In co-rotating twin screw extruders, the kneading disk region is the most influential for compounding efficiency. However, only a few studies have so far been made for the flow analysis of the kneading disk region. This may be due to the fact that phenomena relating to kneading are overly complicated. In this study, the flow in the kneading disk region was investigated using a closed-type co-rotating twin screw single-staged mixer. We measured torque, pressure, and resin temperature under various compounding conditions of polypropylene. It was found that the flow characteristics obtained were identical with those measured using a capillary rehometer. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "On January 18, 1977 the United States Patent Office granted James E. Turner the rights to Patent Number 4,003,408 entitled \"Underground Irrigation Porous Pipe.\" The porous pipe was claimed to be made entirely from reclaimed rubber and recycled plastic binder. The weight percent of binder materials ranged from 10% to 40%. The wall of the porous pipe was reported to contain labyrinthine apertures of such size and number so as to provide a leak rate of 12 to 20 gallons per hour of water per one hundred feet of length of 1/2 inch pipe when subjected to internal pressures of 5 to 10 psig. The pores were claimed to have been blown into the walls by venting vapors and water associated with the rubber during the extrusion process. This paper reports on an analysis of such a \"leaky pipe\" as described by Patent Number 4,003,408. The leakage phenomenon is shown to be a natural occurrence which arises from the adhesion of rubber particles with insufficient binder to fill the voids between particles. This observation means that the reclaimed rubber must have a very narrow size range if the leak rate is to be predictable. In addition, the binder material may be restricted to virgin LLDPE feed stock if a reproducible product is to be continuously extruded. Finally, using technology developed for sintered-porous metal objects, it was demonstrated that the leak rate can be predicted a priori. This evidence suggests that the occurrence of the porosity as claimed in U.S. Patent Number 4,003,408 is not confirmed by practical experience. Moreover, although a leaky pipe can be produced in accordance with the teachings of the patent, the properties and performance of that pipe will probably not meet the specification of potential users.",

    "abstract": "Melting in screw extruders has been studied extensively, starting with the experimental studies of Maddock and Street in the 1950s. These workers observed a melting model with the solid particles all clumped together in a solid bed. A thin melt film separated the solid bed from the extruder barrel; most melting took place between the solid bed and the melt film. This melting model is termed the contiguous solids melting model, CSM; it is the model most often observed in single screw extruders. It was first analyzed theoretically by Tadmor in the early 1960s. Another type of melting that has been observed by several workers has separate, solid particles floating in a melt matrix. This melting model is termed dispersed solids melting, DSM; it has been observed in twin screw extruders, reciprocating single screw compounders, and some regular single screw extruders. It has been observed experimentally that melting through DSM occurs much more efficiently than through CSM. However, there has been little work published on a quantitative description of dispersed solids melting. Here the theory of CSM as well as DSM is developed with closed-form analytical solutions. The melting characteristics of the two models are compared. It is shown that dispersed solids melting can be substantially more efficient than contiguous solids melting. This opens up interesting areas of investigation. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "To model fiber spinning and film casting, a boundary condition on the stress at a chosen synthetic inlet is necessary. However, the exact value of the stress for viscoelastic liquids at the synthetic inlet is a priori unknown. In this article, we present the application of the \"free boundary condition\" to the inlet stress, which avoids the necessity of specifying an a priori unknown value of stress at the synthetic inlet. To apply the free boundary condition, the process must be cast and studied as a two-point boundary value problem by finite elements. To verify the admissibility and accuracy of the free boundary condition, the same process is cast and studied as an initial value problem, directly solvable by a DGEAR subroutine. The initial value problem is cast in a matrix form that allows analytic investigation of admissible solutions: With the upper convected Maxwell model, the fiber can only slim monotonically with the downstream distance, whereas with the Giesekus model there may be cases of initially increasing and subsequently decreasing diameter, i.e., extrudate-swelling. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In co-rotating twin screw extruders, the kneading disk region is the most influential for compounding efficiency. However, only a few studies have so far been made for the flow analysis of the kneading disk region. This may be due to the fact that phenomena relating to kneading are overly complicated. In this study, the flow in the kneading disk region was investigated using a closed-type co-rotating twin screw single-staged mixer. We measured torque, pressure, and resin temperature under various compounding conditions of polypropylene. It was found that the flow characteristics obtained were identical with those measured using a capillary rehometer. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On January 18, 1977 the United States Patent Office granted James E. Turner the rights to Patent Number 4,003,408 entitled “Underground Irrigation Porous Pipe.” The porous pipe was claimed to be made entirely from reclaimed rubber and recycled plastic binder. The weight percent of binder materials ranged from 10% to 40%. The wall of the porous pipe was reported to contain labyrinthine apertures of such size and number so as to provide a leak rate of 12 to 20 gallons per hour of water per one hundred feet of length of 1/2 inch pipe when subjected to internal pressures of 5 to 10 psig. The pores were claimed to have been blown into the walls by venting vapors and water associated with the rubber during the extrusion process. This paper reports on an analysis of such a “leaky pipe” as described by Patent Number 4,003,408. The leakage phenomenon is shown to be a natural occurrence which arises from the adhesion of rubber particles with insufficient binder to fill the voids between particles. This observation means that the reclaimed rubber must have a very narrow size range if the leak rate is to be predictable. In addition, the binder material may be restricted to virgin LLDPE feed stock if a reproducible product is to be continuously extruded. Finally, using technology developed for sintered‐porous metal objects, it was demonstrated that the leak rate can be predicted a priori. This evidence suggests that the occurrence of the porosity as claimed in U.S. Patent Number 4,003,408 is not confirmed by practical experience. Moreover, although a leaky pipe can be produced in accordance with the teachings of the patent, the properties and performance of that pipe will probably not meet the specification of potential users.",

A similar equation describing the relationship between the wear rate and normal load has also been provided. The coefficient of friction has been analyzed theoretically as a function of normal load and sliding velocity and compared with the experimental results. The coefficient of adhesion has given an expression by employing two approaches: average crack propagation velocity and atomic residence time concepts. Consideration of strength degradation has led to a wear rate equation which does explain the experimental result satisfactorily for polymer composites. Some thoughts has been given to the atomic chain orientation effect on wear and friction, and also the boundary lubrication phenomena have been described briefly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Because the expansion of expandable polystyrene beads (EPS) results in a reduction in bulk density of more than one‐thirtieth, the beads require a pre‐expansion step prior to the final molding operation. Hence, the pre‐expansion process has become an important unit operation for foamed bead molders. This article presents some of the design concepts used for EPS pre‐expansion processing. Included are the characteristics of startup, temperature control and agitation during operation, and shutdown procedures. By following the suggestions outlined, the pre‐expansion process should deliver a uniform product, regardless of the raw bead supplier, and thereby help eliminate waste due to poor foam structure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optimization of resin usage in blow molding necessitates the use of nonround or nonaxisymmetric die tooling. These die geometries are referred to as “ovalized.” The extrusion and inflation of parisons formed from nonaxisymmetric dies are complex because of the radial thickness dependency. Four die geometries are considered in this work; one axisymmetric and three nonaxisymmetric. The three nonaxisymmetric dies have one side set at a constant die gap (1.5 mm) and the side rotated 90° from it, set at progressively increasing die gaps (2.0, 2.5, 3.5 mm). A methodology is presented for the measurement of the radial parison diameter and thickness swell profile for ovalized parisons. The methodology employs a simple mass balance approach between an axisymmetric part and the parison it was blown from. Experimental results are obtained for the radial parison diameter and thickness swell at two radial locations. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

This flexibility offered by the GEL formulation is exploited to exactly determine the shape and location of the free surfaces and moving boundaries in the numerical simulation of various manufacturing processes. The application of the GEL formulation to the solution for the flow field and fiber orientation in the unsteady flows of dilute and semiconcentrated fiber suspensions are presented.

It is shown that the feeding and compaction process is inherently random, leading to random fluctuations in the position along the screw where melting begins. Such fluctuations are not considered serious under most circumstances, however. More severe fluctuations are generated when the taper of the compression zone causes the solid bed to re‐form across the screw channel. This disrupts the melting process, and prevents the extrusion process from proceeding in a steady state manner. Such a phenomena, is by its nature periodic, leading to long‐term fluctuations in the output of the extruder.",

This paper presents the modelling of the flow between the wedge and the roll, up to the level of a parameter study of the dependence of the integral process parameters on geometrical, technological, and rheological factors. The construction of the wedge is explained, and the results obtained in the experimental investigation of the effect of the wedge technology on qualitative and quantitative parameters of the cord are discussed. The utilization of such wedgeshaped components as a continuously operating process viscometer, particularly for rolling and calendering processes, is presented, and further potential applications of the wedge technology in the production of high‐grade finished products are discussed.",
