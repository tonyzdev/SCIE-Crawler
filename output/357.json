    "abstract": "Kosovo is an economy in transition with a high unemployment, a young population and structural problems. Clusters could be considered as an appropriate approach to develop the region. Th is paper deals with the economic pro- spects of the Kosovar wine cluster, its current opportunities and the introduction of new approaches. Th e analysis was based on the Porter's innovation theory and the diamond model. Th e Kosovar wine sector could be a promising example for the future cluster development. Wine has a long history in Kosovo although wine consumption is not widespread. Th is paper presents the main problems and opportunities within this sector, describing its structural changes and current developments. Th e study aims to introduce its readers to the potential that the cluster development can off er as well as to understand the local circumstances. Its main focus is therefore to introduce the advantages and opportunities that clusters could bring to this sector, considering the three pillars of sustainable development, namely economic growth, environmen- tal and social development, and achieving competitiveness.",

    "abstract": "Th is is a study of clusters and their infl uence on companies and the environment in Serbia, with the aim of ana- lysing information regarding companies, clusters and the process of cluster development in Serbia. Some of the most inter- esting features for Serbian companies were drawn out and presented in order to identify and analyse similar processes and externalities in future research about Serbian companies. In order to create a comprehensive study, both quantitative and qualitative research methods have been applied. In total, thirty-nine companies have been surveyed in fi ve Serbian clusters, gaining useful answers regarding companies which joined the clusters and the expectations and aspirations of cooperation within each cluster. Th e research methodology was analysed in-depth and valuable conclusions have been drawn. Often, Serbian companies did not start cooperating through an awareness of the benefi ts that clusters can off er, but rather out of the need to overcome certain common legal and business problems. Th e majority of the companies within the clusters are micro and small companies, without research and development (R&D). Th is study showed that even clusters in Serbia do not have an R&D division, leading us to the conclusion that companies need to improve their internal knowledge manage- ment, support innovations and invest in new material and product development.",
