    "abstract": "It is of great importance to know the rain distribution in the region of Tangará da Serra (latitude 14°37'55\"S, longitude 57°28'05\"W and altitude 488 m), as it is an agricultural region, which makes such information essential for an adequate planning, maximization of agricultural potential and optimization of hydric resources. Thus, this work was aimed at evaluating the annual, monthly and ten-day pluviometric variability, and also quantifying the number of dry and rainy days and different levels of rain probability for the region. Pluviometric data provided by 'Agência Nacional de Águas' (ANA) were used to analyze a period of 38 years (from January 1970 to December 2007). Precipitation behavior in Tangará da Serra has annual and monthly variations, constituting two well defined seasons – a dry one from May to September, and a rainy one from October to April. Annual variability during the analyzed period corresponds to the maximum value of 2,861, minimum of 1,404 and average of 1,830 mm, respectively. The incomplete gamma function adequately expresses precipitation probability in Tangará da Serra. Precipitation averages range from 40 to 50% probability for rainy months and from 30 to 40% for dry ones. According to the results, this type of research might help the elaboration and development of irrigation projects in this region.",

Utilizou-se a expressão de Bouyoucos para a determinação indireta do fator de erodibilidade para os horizontes superficiais e subsuperficiais. A determinação da tolerância de perda de solo foi calculada com base em Smith e Stamey (1964). Os valores extremos do fator erodibilidade do horizonte A foram de 0,4278 e 0,0044 t.ha.h/ha.MJ.mm, respectivamente para um Argissolo e um Gleissolo. Os valores extremos do fator erodibilidade do horizonte B foram de 0,5750 e 0,0038 t.ha.h/ha.MJ.mm, respectivamente para um Espodossolo e um Latossolo. Por outro lado, os valores extremos da tolerância de perda de solo variaram entre 14,70 (Cambissolo/Neossolo) e 3,00 (Argissolo) t/ha.ano. Concluiu-se que, com o aumento da relação textural houve, em geral, diminuição da tolerância e aumento do fator erodibilidade dos solos",

The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design through a factorial combination to analyze four genotypes (BRS 187 8H and ACALA SJ-4 - water deficit tolerant; CNPA 7H and SU-0450/8909 - water deficit sensitive) and two water regimes (watered/always irrigated and stressed/with a water deficit imposed at flowering). Irrigation was suspended for the plants in the water deficit treatment groups when their first flowers appeared. Leaf water potential (ψpd) was monitored until the plants reached -3.0 MPa predawn, at which point leaf samples were collected for analysis. The plants were re-irrigated and monitored for a recovery to 50% of leaf water potential. The maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll content (SPAD index), relative water content (RWC), disruption of the cell membrane via membrane leakage, carbon isotope composition (δ13C), seed cotton yield and fiber quality were evaluated. The trends in membrane leakage and carbon isotope composition were different between the tolerant and sensitive genotypes under a water deficit, which makes these physiological traits suitable for screening for tolerance to water deficits in cotton.",

The data were obtained from 143 scientific papers published from 2005 to 2010. The classification was based on the average (m) and standard deviation (SD) and the CVs were ranked as low, intermediate, high and very high. All of the random variables had the CVs normally distributed. For most of the traits, we observed a large difference between the ranks from Scapim and Pimentel Gomes.

The degree of esterification was determined by the classical titrimetric method and confirmed by the instrumental FTIR method. The samples showed an average DE of 73% and the typical fingerprint in IR spectrogram. The steric exclusion chromatograms obtained with the multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) and refraction index (RI) detectors showed that all samples had a high molar fraction eluted at 36-38 min., another large polysaccharide family had an elution time around 43 min, and some samples showed yet another low molecular oligosaccharide that appeared at 58-60 min. Gas chromatography of alditol acetate allowed estimates of the proportion of the neutral sugar in the samples. The ratio of galacturonic acid and rhamnose may give the average size of the galacturonan fraction. These results showed that yields of pectin extracted by the same acid procedure were slightly different. However, the degree of esterification of pectin was similar, with both factors pointing to the best sources in this group of varieties.",

In addition, the K+/Na+ ratio in stem and root of both varieties was determined. The experiment was conducted in a growth chamber under controlled conditions, under a completely randomized distribution, with a 2 x 2 (Variety x Salinity) factorial arrangement and 12 replications. Plants were grown in a hydroponic solution for 15 days and then some of them were treated with 100 mM NaCl; control plants (without NaCI treatment) were grown in parallel. Salt stress caused 20 and 15% reductions in stem and root length, respectively, in the variety Tres Ríos, while in the variety Cotaxtla no significant differences were observed in these variables compared to the control. Dry matter weight decreased by 24% in the variety Tres Ríos. The quantum yield of PSII decreased by 30% the third day of treatment application, in both varieties. Na+ concentration was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in NaCI-treated plants. In the variety Tres Ríos, the yield of PSII was completely eradicated six days after treatment implementation, while the K+ concentration in stem and older leaves also decreased and the lowest K+/ Na+ ratio in stem was recorded, which could indicate that it is more susceptible to salinity than the variety Cotaxtla.",

Temperate fruits are no longer only produced in regions characterized by a cold winter period. These fruits are also produced in the sub-tropical and tropical regions characterized by mild winter or even the absence of chilling conditions often required by the tree to break dormancy. Currently, temperate fruit production is possible in certain regions of South America, Africa and Asia that are near to the Equator. However, temperate tree fruit production in tropical regions requires modified techniques to overcome dormancy and allow adequate flowering, growth and productivity. The main approaches taken are the development of cultivars with low chilling requirement, chemical induction of budbreak, interruption of irrigation during the winter period, defoliation, orchard densification, and double pruning. Breeding has become a key tool in the advancement of temperate fruit growing in the tropics, especially with the development of low chilling requirement cultivars.",

Either sink or source restriction significantly decreased the amount of current photosynthesis and its contribution to grain yield and Source limitation increased stem and spike reserves contribution to seed filling process. More amount of stem reserve mobilization in source restricted vs. control and sink restricted plants indicates that at rapid grain filling stage (14 days after anthesis to physiological maturity), stem dry matter decrease to provide assimilates for kernel after defoliation. In spike halved plants, drought stress significantly decreased grain yield indicates that when the sink is restricted, postanthesis water deficiency can increase sink limitation through lower grain filling rate and dry matter allocation to grain two weeks after anthesis at beginning of rapid grain filling stage. In other hand, in spike halved plants, more nitrogen supply at anthesis increased grain yield because more dry matter allocation to grain not more current photosynthesis, But When the all leaves removed except flag leaf, more postanthesis nitrogen could not increase dry matter allocation to grain filling process, it show that postanthesis nitrogen supply increase grain yield through decrease in sink limitation than increase in source strength.

PCA results showed that apple pomaces from different cultivars may have different composition profiles and different antioxidant activity. The drying kinetics of apple pomace fitted a third order model. The results also pointed that dehydrated apple pomace could be used as raw material for inverted sugar production, after purification, and as an interesting ingredient for the production of foodstuffs rich in alimentary fibers, TPC, and antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study and model the drying process of corn ears at different air temperatures. Thermodynamic properties associated with the drying process of this product were also determined. Corn ears with initial moisture content of 0.45 dry basis (kgw kgdm-1) were dried until they reached a final moisture content of 0.12 (kgw kgdm-1) at temperatures of 45, 55 and 65°C. Traditional models used to describe the drying process of several agricultural products were employed to fit the observed data of the drying process of corn ears. The effective diffusion coefficient (Def) was determined by means of an analytical solution of Fick’s second law. It was concluded that the Logarithmic model was the one that best fit the observed data representing the drying process. Def values increased with temperature increases, ranging from 5.490 x 10-10 to 1.163 x 10-9 m2 s-1. Based on the dependence of the drying constant of the Logarithmic model with temperature, thermodynamic properties were determined, concluding that the drying kinetics variation is dependent on the energy contributions of the surrounding environment.",

To that end, soil samples were collected in October 2006 and March 2007, at Fazenda Sereno in the city of Jaciara, Mato Grosso State. The samples were removed at 0-10 cm deep with four replications in five areas with different handling systems: agriculture-livestock integration, corn/soy fields, pastures, native vegetation, and native vegetation under recovery. The method of Chloroform Fumigation-Incubation (CFI) was used to evaluate microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial respiration (MR). The qCO2 was obtained through the relationship between MR and MBC. The averages were compared through the Scott-Knott test at 5%. During the analyses, it was observed that the different agricultural practices substantially affect the soil, causing disturbances in the microbial community, which may influence the biogeochemical processes occurring on the soil. The data obtained also makes it possible to conclude that: in the agriculture-livestock integration and pasture systems, the microbial population is influenced by collection times. In this work, in the field-livestock integration system, the microbial activity is constant at the different collection times and management systems influence the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the soil.",

The experiment was conducted in Linhares, ES. It is one of the oldest assays in the country investigating the effects of unburned and burned sugarcane. Installed in a Yellow Latosol with sandy/medium texture, the treatments consisted of plots (conventional and minimum tillage) and subplots (raw and burned sugarcane). Plant growth, contribution of organic matter and quantification of sugarcane yield were evaluated. The diameter was larger for minimum tillage, and tillering was greater for conventional tillage. The height and tillering were superior in the cut without burning. For stems productivity, the treatments did not present significant differences. The leaves were larger in minimum tillage and tips in unburned cane. The minimum tillage propitiates the increase in diameter initially and largest productivity of leaves in the crop. Tillering is favored by conventional tillage. The unburned cane did not present negative influence of straw in the regrowth. After 16 years of sugarcane cultivation with and without straw burning, it resulted in larger productivity of pointers increasing the productivity of the stems in unburned cane.",

Collecting and characterizing germplasm, especially landraces and heirloom varieties, are strategic activities that would create a knowledge base describing the traditional varieties of a given region and reduce the risk of genetic erosion. The objectives of this work were as follows: collect sweet potato roots from rural properties and local markets in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil; characterize the accessions using RAPD and ISSR molecular markers, comparing the efficiency in discrimination of these two types of molecular markers; and estimate the genetic variability of the population. Fifty-nine samples from rural properties and 19 from local markets were studied. A matrix of binary data was developed to analyze the molecular data using the Jaccard index to estimate genetic differences among accessions, and clusters were made using the UPGMA method. The molecular techniques detected genetic variability among the accessions, with cophenetic correlation coefficients (CCC) of 0.80 for RAPDs and 0.89 for ISSRs. The RAPD and ISSR marker results corresponded well, with a correlation of 0.55. All of the accessions were considered distinct, which demonstrates that traditional farmers maintain sweet potato genotypes that have good genetic diversity.",

However, previous studies indicate that this procedure may lead to a false reduction of the significance of a trend. An alternative approach (MK_interact) has been proposed to improve the assessment of the significance of a trend in auto-correlated data. Therefore, the present study compared the performance of the MK_prew and MK_interact for detecting trends in auto-correlated series. Sets of Monte Carlo experiments were carried out to evaluate the occurrence of type I and II errors obtained from both approaches. The analyses were also based on 10-day values of the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-EP) obtained from the location of Campinas, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The results found in this study allow us to conclude that the MK_interac outperformed the MK_prew in correctly identifying the significance of trends and that, concerning agricultural interests, the decreasing trend described by the MK_interac during the beginning of the crop growing seasons may reveal an unfavorable temporal distribution of the P-EP values.",

    "abstract": "Rubber tree plantations may improve the soil's physical and chemical properties, and they may sequester atmospheric carbon in the biomass or the soil. However, the potential role of these plantations in sequestering carbon in the soil and plant biomass has not been fully evaluated. This study evaluated rubber tree plantations at Paranapoema, which is located in the northwestern region of the Paraná state of Brazil, to measure the biomass in plantations of different ages and to determine the organic carbon content and d13C in the soils. Biomass accumulation was evaluated using the destructive method in plantations of different ages. The total carbon stock in the top 60 cm of the soil was 63.4 Mg C ha-1 for the pasture adjacent to the plantations and 66.8 and 79.3 Mg C ha-1 for the 4- and 15-year-old rubber tree plantations, respectively. These values are equivalent to an annual increase in soil carbon stocks of 0.85 and 1.06 Mg ha-1, respectively, and they do not include the accumulation of carbon as tree woody biomass. The soil d13C indicated a relatively fast conversion from the previous C4-C (pasture; Brachiaria-Urochloa brizantha) to C3-C (rubber tree). The results from this study suggest that rubber tree plantations have untapped potential to sequester carbon over a relatively short time period.",

The mineral content and quality of fruits of different blackberry cultivars produced in Lavras, Southern Minas Gerais, in a tropical climate at an elevation (Cwb, according to Köppen) were analyzed. The analyzed minerals were phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). Additionally, chemical characteristics, the total acidity (citric acid), pH, soluble solids (°Brix) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) level, and sensory characteristics, color (L*a*b) and firmness (N) were also evaluated. According to the results, the Choctaw and Xavante blackberry cultivars demonstrated the highest mineral contents, the Caingangue cultivar showed the highest soluble solid content, and the Ebano cultivar exhibited the highest vitamin C concentration and firmer fruits. The chemical variables in the fruits of the different blackberry cultivars presented little significant correlation with the contents of macrominerals present, whereas the opposite was obtained for the micronutrients. However, the chemical characteristics combined with the nutritional characteristics can be proposed as an excellent tool for the selection of cultivars of superior quality and high nutritional value.",

Reports have discussed the role of proline in relation to osmotic adjustment, even though no clear-cut evidence has yet been provided demonstrating this association as a defense mechanism against drought stress in plants. However, it has been indicated that the application of exogenous proline can damage the ultrastructure of chloroplasts and mitochondria. In this study, using transgenic tobacco plants carrying a mutant p5cs gene from Vigna aconitifolia under control of the CaMV 35S promoter, we show that the high levels of endogenous proline accumulated in leaves does not contribute to the osmotic adjustment in plants under water deficit conditions. Additionally, electron microscopic observations of mitochondria and chloroplasts show that the ultrastructure of these organelles was not damaged even in the transgenic plants, with the leaves presenting the highest endogenous proline content in (100 µmol g-1 dry mass). This investigation demonstrates that in tobacco, high levels of endogenous free proline are not associated with osmotic adjustment and that elevated proline content in leaves, even at levels 10 times higher than normal, do not disturb the chloroplast and mitochondria ultrastructure under both irrigated and water deficit conditions.",

The study evaluated four treatments: regular diet (control group) and diets containing 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg g-1 of rutin. The following biological variables parameters of the larvae were evaluated daily: development time (days), larval and pupal weight (g) and viability (%), adult longevity and total life cycle (days). A completely randomized experimental design was used with 25 replication. The rutin flavonoid negatively affected the biology of S. frugiperda by prolonging the larval development time, reducing the weight of larvae and pupae and decreasing the viability of the pupae. The addition of different concentrations of rutin prolonged the S. frugiperda life cycle. The use of plant with insecticidal activity has the potential with strategy in IPM.",

The study was carried out in Rio Largo, Alagoas State, located 127 m above sea level, 9&deg;27’S and 35&deg;27’W. Five clones were evaluated (CL-2, CL-3, CL-4, CL-6 and CL-8) in a randomized complete blocks design with eight replications. The analyzed variables were number of commercial roots (NCR), number of non-commercial roots (NNCR), total number of roots (TNR), aerial part weight (APW), average weight of non-commercial roots (AWNCR), commercial root length (CRL), average weight of commercial roots (AWCR), and diameter of commercial roots (DCR). The analysis of deviance showed that the clones differ statistically for NNCR, TNR, AWNCR, AWCR, CRL and DCR. CL-06 had the best NCRN, NNCR, TNR, AWNCR, AWCR, DCR; CL-03 for APW and CRL, and CL-02 for NCR. By the classification of genotypic averages, the best clone was CL-06.",

The different land uses in the region can effectively change the quantities of soil organic matter and the cycling of nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different land use management systems on the relationship between soil organic carbon and the soil chemical attributes of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) under Cerrado in Rio Verde (Goiás state). The treatments studied were native vegetation (cerradão), low-productivity pasture, conventional tillage with soybean, and no-tillage with soybean and maize. The smallest values for pH, available P, K, Ca and Mg were observed for the Cerradão treatment, even if the relatively high C levels increased the potential soil cation exchange capacity. The pasture, conventional tillage and no-tillage treatments showed higher K, Ca, Mg, available P, and S concentrations in the soil. In the areas where soil tillage did not take place and lime and fertilizers were applied superficially, the stratification of the soil organic carbon provides the retention of the elements near to the surface, with significance correlations with the soil chemicals attributes.",

This study proposes a non-destructive quantification of the photosynthetic pigment concentration in cotton leaves using two portable chlorophyll meters, the SPAD-502 and the CLOROFILOG 1030. After obtaining 200 leaf discs, each with an area of 113 mm2, the greening rate in each disc was determined by the average of five readings from both meters. Immediately after measurement, 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added, and the samples were kept in a water bath at 70ºC for 30 min. After cooling, 3 mL of the liquid extract was used for analyses by spectrophotometry at 470, 646 and 663 nm. Mathematical models were adjusted from analytical results using the reading index obtained from both devices to predict the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids. Based on these results, it was concluded that both portable chlorophyll meters are an effective way to estimate the concentration of photosynthetic pigments in cotton leaves, thus saving time, space and the resources that are often required for these analyses.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a method to rescue adult mate plants through the generation of epicormic sprouts. To accomplish this, tree branches of mate that were at least 19 years of age were collected and packed in trays with sand for sprouting. Different solutions containing a mixture of sucrose and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) were sprayed in branches at 29, 22, 15, 8 and 1 day(s) before collection.

The organic wastes enhanced the soil chemical properties and increased nitrogen concentration in soil. However, the net nitrogen mineralization was affected by C/N ratio of wastes and incubation time. The FBC mixed with the wastes accelerated and enhanced organic matter degradation, resulting in quickly available quantity of net nitrogen. The wastes can be considered potentially useful as organic fertilizer but their usefulness appears to depend on knowing the C/N ratio of each one. The FBC can be used when one wants a more accelerated degradation, resulting in a quicker quantity of available nutrients to the plants.",

We also evaluated the water availability to soybean crop that succeeded these grasses. Our studies were performed in two stages. In the first stage, we divided 32 plots into four randomized blocks in which we cultivated corn combined with following treatments: 1 - Brachiaria brizantha cultivar Marandu; 2 - Xaraes; 3 - Piata; 4 - MG4; 5 - B. decumbens; 6 - B. ruziziensis; 7 - Invasive plants; and 8 - uncovered soil. We evaluated soil, to quantify the biological soil loosening, and also forages. In the second stage, we cultivated soybean and added: 9 - conventional tillage as a control treatment, increasing number of plots to 36. Our results suggest that it is possible to cultivate Brachiaria brizantha or Brachiaria decumbens as management strategy to aid edaphic recovery.

    "abstract": "Soil contamination by metals threatens both the environment and human health and hence requires remedial actions. The conventional approach of removing polluted soils and replacing them with clean soils (excavation) is very costly for low-value sites and not feasible on a large scale. In this scenario, phytoremediation emerged as a promising cost-effective and environmentally-friendly technology to render metals less bioavailable (phytostabilization) or clean up metal-polluted soils (phytoextraction). Phytostabilization has demonstrable successes in mining sites and brownfields. On the other hand, phytoextraction still has few examples of successful applications. Either by using hyperaccumulating plants or high biomass plants induced to accumulate metals through chelator addition to the soil, major phytoextraction bottlenecks remain, mainly the extended time frame to remediation and lack of revenue from the land during the process. Due to these drawbacks, phytomanagement has been proposed to provide economic, environmental, and social benefits until the contaminated site returns to productive usage. Here, we review the evolution, promises, and limitations of these phytotechnologies. Despite the lack of commercial phytoextraction operations, there have been significant advances in understanding phytotechnologies' main constraints. Further investigation on new plant species, especially in the tropics, and soil amendments can potentially provide the basis to transform phytoextraction into an operational metal clean-up technology in the future. However, at the current state of the art, phytotechnology is moving the focus from remediation technologies to pollution attenuation and palliative cares.",

Morphological, productivity, and quality traits were evaluated. Inoculants obtained from agricultural ecosystems of Bom Princípio and Ipê did not influence the horticultural performance of strawberries, while those from Flores da Cunha largely explained total experimental variability, and therefore, should be considered when selecting the location to obtain inoculants for use on strawberry plants. Number of fruits, fruit flavor, chlorophyll a, and total chlorophyll contents, and, most importantly, root variables, should be included for experimental analysis of ‘Albion’ strawberry responses to multi-specific mycorrhizal inoculants from different locations.",

The hidroetanolic extracts provided larger PIM of C. gloeosporioides, while larger PIS was obtained with the aqueous extracts. Non autoclaved extracts was the most efficient in mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, even more than the autoclaved ones. Aqueous and hidroetanolic extracts of Momordica charantia and hidroetanolic extract of Eucalyptus citriodora provided higher PIM. Aqueous extracts of Luffa acutangula, Eucalyptus citriodora, Chenopodium ambrosioides. and Bauhinia, and hidroetanolic extracts of Ruta graveolens, Eucalyptus citriodora, Zingiber officinale and Chenopodium ambrosioides inhibited more than 90% of spores germination",

    "abstract": "Eucalyptus has great importance in the forestry sector and many advances in the area of improvement have been achieved with the advent of biotechnological techniques. However, some promising genotypes still do not have multiplication protocols with cloning techniques, such as minicutting. The study aimed to evaluate IBA concentrations for survival, rooting and vegetative vigor of E. benthamii x E. dunnii minicuttings, and determine the maximum technical efficiency dose. Ministumps H12, H19 and H20 clones were cultivated in a clonal minigarden under a semi-hydroponic system. For rooting, the minicutting basal portion was plunged in hydro-alcoholic solutions, whose concentrations were: 0; 2,000; 4,000; 6,000 and 8,000 mg L-1 of IBA. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with the factors consisting of three clones and five IBA concentrations, with five replications, containing 10 minicuttings per replication. IBA positively influenced the minicutting rooting processes, with differentiated behavior between the clones, with 30.32 to 55.45% rooting variation. The positives increments occurred until the highest IBA concentration for H12 and H19 clones. However, the range between 4,000 and 6,000 mg L-1 of IBA treatments promoted the best rooting results for the H20 clone.",

The work was conducted during the 2004 season in a 6.4 ha field located in central São Paulo state. Two treatments were applied with alternating strips of fixed and variable rates during the whole season: one following the fertilizing procedures recommended locally, and the other based on a grid soil sampling. A prototype pneumatic fertilizer applicator was used, carrying two conveyor belts, one for each row. Harvesting was done with a commercial harvester equipped with a customized volumetric yield monitor, separating the two treatments. Data were analyzed based on geostatistics, correlations and regressions. The procedure showed to be feasible and effective. The area that received fertilizer applications at a variable rate showed a 34% yield increase compared to the area that received a fixed rate. The variable rate fertilizer resulted in a savings of 23% in phosphate fertilizer and a 13% increase in potassium fertilizer, when compared to fixed rate fertilizer. Yield in 2005, the year after the variable rate treatments, still presented residual effect from treatments carried out during the previous cycle.",

Due to the wide use of mathematical methods for representing, analyzing and attaining degree-day estimation as well as the great importance of sugarcane in the Brazilian economy, we carried out an evaluation of the mathematical models and numerical integration methods commonly used for estimating the availability of degrees-day for this crop in the region of Botucatu, in São Paulo State, Brazil. Integration models with discretization every 6 hours have shown satisfactory results in degree-day estimation. Conventional methodologies have shown satisfactory results when the estimation of degrees-day was based on the time-temperature curve for each day and for groups of 3, 7, 15 and 30 days. Through numerical integration method, the region of Botucatu showed a annual thermal availability average from 1,070.6 degrees-day for the sugarcane.",

After 150 days, an anatomical analysis was performed on cross-sections of the plant leaves. A complete randomized design was used. Modifications occurred on the plants of those treatments containing silicon compared to those without silicon, and between environment fo artificial and natural light. Plants showed larger growth at the artificial light treatment with 0.5 and 2.0 mg L-1 of calcium silicate respectively for the native and hybrid plants Treatments without silicate application induced chlorenchyma and epidermis deformation compared to silicon containing treatments, this effect can affect directly or indirectly plant growth at no silicon conditions.",

Minimally processed leaves presented significant browning, indicating increased POD and PPO activities. The PAL activity in minimally processed leaves stored at 5ºC was fourfold higher than that of whole leaves after two days of storage. We showed that minimal processing influenced PAL, POD and PPO activities. The activity of all enzymes studied increased during storage, indicating that changes in phenolic metabolism play an important role in the decline of kale quality. PAL activity increased rapidly at the beginning of storage and exhibited a reduced rate of increase over time, while the PPO and POD activities increased continuously over time. The storage at 5 ° C was a great ally in delaying changes in phenolic metabolism; however, the absolute PAL activity was higher at 5 than at 10ºC.",

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the parameters of adaptability and stability of strawberry cultivars under LT-protected cultivation using the harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetically predicted values. Seven strawberry cultivars were assessed ('Dover', 'Camino Real', 'Ventana', 'Camarosa', 'Seascape', 'Diamante' and 'Aromas') in the agricultural years 2006/7, 2007/8 and 2008/9 in three locations in the mountainous region of Espírito Santo State. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, with 3 replications and 15 plants per plot. The analysis of deviance for the yield (ton. ha-1) demonstrated that only the effects of genotype and the triple interaction genotype x location x year were significant, which indicates the presence of genetic variability among the cultivars and the inconsistency of the position among the genotypes for combinations of year and location. Considering the selection for yield, adaptability and stability, in LT-protected cultivation, cultivars Camarosa and Aromas are highlighted for expressing average values that were 22% higher than the overall mean of the cultivars (24.55 ton. há-1) in the environments assessed.",

    "abstract": "The present research seeks to elucidate the feasibility of chitosan (CHT) in the induction of water deficit tolerance in different maize hybrids, contrasting tolerance to water restriction, tolerance and sensitivity. The maize plants were subjected to water deficit and foliar application of different chitosan doses (60, 100, 140, and 180 mg L-1) at the pre-flowering growth stage and evaluated during the stress period of fifteen days. To understand the induction behaviour of the tolerance to water restriction, biophysical parameters, such as water potential, relative water content and chlorophyll content, gas exchange, and biochemical assays, were quantified based on the activity of SOD, CAT, APX, and PAL antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation activity and hydrogen peroxide content. Among the treatments, maize plants subjected to chitosan foliar application at a dose of 140 mg L-1 presented similar behavioural responses to plants under favourable irrigation conditions. Such positive responses are related to the high degree of activity of antioxidant enzymes, gas exchange and low levels of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide. The results support the potential use of CHT to increase tolerance to water stress.",

    "abstract": "It was studied the genetic variability of 17 lettuce cultivars, types Butter, Crisp and Iceberg, according to agronomic traits and multivariate procedures. It aims to select divergent cultivars with better performance designed to hydroponic system culture. The importance of the traits for divergence was, also, evaluated by the sequential discards of the variables, according its relative contributions. The trial was carry out in greenhouse, Epamig, Viçosa-MG, in summer of 1999, using randomized blocks with three replicates. Six plants were harvested 46 days after the sowing, and evaluated in ten traits related to the yield. The data were analyzed by Tocher, single linkage, and canonical variables grouping methods. The Mimosa, Brisa, Regina, Monalisa and OGR are the most appropriated cultivars to integrate in specific crossings programs for hydroponic culture. They were more genetically divergent and had good agronomic qualities. Some traits did not affect the original grouping, so they could be eliminated in future studies of lettuce genetic divergence",

Treatments were conducted in greenhouse and homeopathic drugs applied weekly (250 mL vase-1) for 98 days. Plant height, root system’s dry mass, shoot’s dry mass and essential oil content were determined. Among the tested homeopathy drugs, Sulphur increased values of fresh and dry biomass more than Arsenicum album. Plant height increased by the two drugs and their respective dinamizations. Whereas Sulphur inhibited dry biomass production, except 6CH dinamization, it increased substantially mint plant’s essential oil content. Arsenicum album presented the same behavior as Sulphur drug, with the difference that it increased the fresh biomass in 24 and 30CH dinamizations. Results suggest that Sulphur and Arsenicum album modify plant metabolism, especially by increasing secondary metabolism as occurs with essential oil contents.",

    "abstract": "Caraway is one of the most important medicinal plant cultivated in Poland. Caraway essential oil performs medium antimicrobial activity, although it inhibits growth of many bacteria and fungi. The aim of the study was to evaluate microbiological activity of caraway oil obtained from fruit originated from different genotypes and investigate the correlation between this activity and essential oil content and its main components content. In the experiments done in 2008 and 2009, essential oil of 20 selected caraway genotypes originated from: European botanical gardens (17), cultivar 'Konczewicki' and our own breeding strains (2) was tested. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of oil, which inhibited standard bacterial strain was investigated. MIC value was recalculated to antibiotic units (AU). The microbiological activity of caraway oil of the tested objects was significantly different. The strongest activity performed oil of population from genotype Cluj (MIC = 0.16 mg mL-1; AU = 8650), while the weakest activity was determined for oil of population from genotype Krakow (MIC = 1.75 mg mL-1; AU = 582). A significant negative correlation was observed between MIC and carvone content, however positive correlation was observed between MIC and limonene content. Caraway essential oil exhibited medium antimicrobial activity and carvone can be recognized as a one of the active component.",

The experimental data were fitted to five mathematical models used to represent volumetric shrinkage in agricultural products. The models were analyzed using the coefficient of determination, chi-square, mean relative error, mean estimated error, and residual distribution. Geometric diameter data were subjected to regression analysis by adopting a 1% level of significance. It was concluded that moisture content and drying temperature influence volumetric shrinkage in Jatropha seeds, a phenomenon satisfactorily described by the Polynomial equation, where the geometric diameter linearly decreased with a reduction of the moisture content, regardless of the drying conditions.",

Morphological and molecular diversity was obtained by dissimilarity matrices based on the coefficient of simple matching and the Jaccard index for morphological and molecular data, respectively. From these matrices, dendrograms were built. There is a large amount of genetic variability among sweet potato genotypes of the germplasm bank at UFVJM based on morphological and molecular characterizations.

The four concentrations of NaCl (mM) were as follows: 0, 20, 40, and 60. Under salinity, the lowest concentration of Na+ ions was observed in the tuberous roots; however, the dry matter of tuberous roots was reduced with an application of just 20 mM NaCl. The harvest index was reduced 50% with the highest salt concentration. Salinity reduced carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration, and the instantaneous water use efficiency. The correlation between gs and A was high and positive, showing that stomatal movement was one of the responsible for the lower A. Under salt stress, there was an increase in intercellular CO2 concentration, indicating the impairment of carbon metabolism. Based on the reduction of dry matter of the tuberous roots (reduction of 81% under 60 mM NaCl), it was concluded that cassava is sensitive to salinity. The growth of shoots and the absorbing roots were minimally affected by salinity, even in the situation where A was reduced; therefore, the sensitivity of cassava was related to the high sensitivity of the tuberous roots to the ionic and/or osmotic effects of salinity. Thus, tuberous roots can be the target organ in studies that aim to improve the tolerance of cassava to salinity.",

Thus, the proposed methods for precision agriculture can be evaluated as an alternative for environment protection and can aid the search for greater productivity at the same time. The main objective of the present work was to compare the precision agriculture (PA) and traditional agriculture (TA) management systems and to highlight their distinctions, such as differences in grid sampling, production variation, plant failure and costs. Two experiments were set up, and the soil fertilizers were applied by corrective application methods to 16-ha lots using the average general fertility rate (GFR). The PA method had the highest productivity volume for conversion of green matter to sugar in the 4.0-ha plots. As the size of the PA plots decreased, the costs of soil analyses increased with potassium and lime analyses being the most expensive. The PA plots had more suitable grid sampling in terms of productivity, and the cost/benefit ratio was 4.0-ha. In general, the final cost was higher in the PA system compared to the TA system. The present results provide information to help select the better system between these techniques to manage tropical soils.",

Considering this, our paper offer a study about the most frequent situations related to data transformation and how this tool can impact ANOVA assumptions and experimental accuracy. Our database was obtained from measurements of seed physiology and seed technology. The coefficient of variation cannot be used as an indicator of data transformation. Data transformation might violate the assumptions of analysis of variance, invalidating the idea that its use will provoke fail the inferences, even if it does not improve the quality of the analysis. The decision about when to use data transformation is dichotomous, but the criteria for this decision are many. The unit (percentage, day or seedlings per day), the experimental design and the possible robustness of F-statistics to 'small deviations' to Normal are among the main indicators for the choice of the type of transformation.",

Samples of five seed lots of the IAC Carioca cultivar were submitted to germination, accelerated aging, seedling emergence in sand and electrical conductivity tests. The parameters measured by the Seed Vigor Imaging System (SVIS®) were mean seedling length, growth (ratio of the actual seedling growth to the maximum possible growth), uniformity of growth and the vigor indexes 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40 and 70:30 (based on different growth/uniformity ratios), and computed from scanned images of three- and four-day-old seedlings. Results of SVIS® analyses were consistent with the physiological potential evaluations provided by the traditional tests of seed vigor. Therefore, the SVIS® is efficient for detecting differences in vigor among seed lots of common bean (IAC Carioca cultivar) using three- or four-day-old seedlings, independently of the growth/uniformity ratios used to calculate the vigor index.",

After a germination test, the seedling length was obtained 5 days after sowing. Multivariate analysis was carried out using principal components analysis. It was concluded that the X-ray test is efficient for evaluating the internal morphology of broccoli seeds and associating it with seedling length, thereby classifying seed lots at different levels of vigor.",

    "abstract": "This study presents self-organizing maps (SOM) as an alternative method to evaluate genetic diversity in plant breeding programs. Twenty-five genotypes were evaluated in two environments for 11 phenotypic traits. The genotypes were clustered according to the SOM technique, with variable topology and numbers of neurons. In addition to the SOM analysis, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean clustering (UPGMA) was performed to observe the behavior of the clustering when submitted to these techniques and to evaluate their complementarities. Genotype ordering according to SOM was consistent with UPGMA results, evidenced by the basic structure of UPGMA groups being preserved in each group of the maps. Regarding genotype arrangement and the group neighbors, maps involving five neurons presented inferior organization efficiency compared to the six-map arrangements in both environments. It was observed that the organization pattern among the rice genotypes evaluated by the maps was complementary to the UPGMA approach, as observed in all scenarios. It can be concluded that self-organizing maps have the potential to be useful for genetic diversity studies in breeding programs.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate temporal changes in the soil chemical attributes after the vegetation has been slashed and burned in an area of native forest in the Western Amazon. For this study, four hectares of forest in Cruzeiro do Sul, State of Acre, Brazil, was slashed and burned. The soil in the study area was classified as Ultisol (Argissolo Amarelo Distrófico típico). Soil samples were collected over the course of one year, the first one being collected 16 hours after the burn and the others at 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 270, and 360 days after the burn. The soil surface layers were more sensitive to fire action. Ashes from vegetation burn increased pH values, basic cations, and C values only in the first months, resulting in higher basal saturation values (V%). The practice of slash-and-burn after 12 months resulted in lower values of pH, Ca, Mg, K, and P and higher values of Al and H, as well as saturation by aluminum in the soil, indicating this practice contributes to the reduction of soil fertility.",

The experiment was performed in Huelva (Spain) and was conducted in a greenhouse on the La Rábida Campus of Huelva University under natural light and temperature from October 2013 to June 2014. Three short-day strawberry cultivars ('Splendor', 'Sabrina' and 'Fortuna') were grown in polyethylene bags filled with coconut fibres. Randomized block design, with 3 repetitions and factorial arrangement (3 cultivars x 3 treatments), was established. Each replicate consisted of one bag with 12 plants supporting structures at 40 cm height. The treatments were: T1 = mycorrhizal inoculation in the transplantation; T2 = mycorrhizal inoculation 30 days after transplantation (DAT); and T0 = control treatment, without inoculation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation significantly affected the contents of anthocyanin and phenolics. When the inoculation is performed in the transplantation, the fruits showed a high content of anthocyanin and total phenolics. The mycorrhizal inoculation influences decreasing the acidity in fruit throughout the growing season and increase firmness only during the early stage of production.",

The classification of 51 isolates resulted in the identification of 10 different physiological races: 4, 38, 55, 65, 73, 81, 83, 85, 321, and 351. Races 65 and 81 predominated, with frequencies of 37.25 and 35.29%, respectively. Regarding the isolates of race 65, wide physiological variability was evident, suggesting that a new differential set should be applied to detect the levels of variation among isolates of a single race of the pathogen.",

In this scenario, our goal was to identify and evaluate the potential of bacteria isolated from maize roots to promote plant growth and be used as inoculants. We evaluated 173 bacterial strains isolated from the maize (Zea mays L.) rhizosphere for the properties of their PGPB in vitro. Twelve strains were positive for siderophores, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and phosphate solubilization. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA identified these strains as belonging to the genera Cellulosimicrobium, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, and Bacillus. The elite strains were evaluated under greenhouse conditions upon the inoculation of two maize hybrids, ATL100 and KWX628. The ability of the isolates to promote plant growth was dependent on the maize genotype; Enterobacter sp. LGMB208 showed the best ability to promote growth of hybrid ATL100, while Enterobacter sp. strains LGMB125, LGMB225, and LGMB274 and Cellulosimicrobium sp. strain LGMB239 showed the best ability to promote growth of hybrid KWX628. The results highlight the potential of bacterial genera little explored as maize PGPB but indicate the need to investigate their interactions with different plant genotypes.",

An important factor related to weeds such as fleabane is the characteristic of herbicide-resistant biotypes developed under selection pressure, with multiple resistance previously detected for Conyza spp. Thus, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the multiple resistance of Conyza sumatrensis to the herbicides paraquat, glyphosate, and chlorimuron. From the F2 seeds of biotypes with suspected resistance to paraquat, glyphosate, and chlorimuron, dose-response greenhouse experiments were conducted for the three herbicides. Herbicides were applied when the plants had 6-8 leaves that were at a height of 8 cm. At the end of the evaluations, 28 days after application, multiple resistance to paraquat, glyphosate, and chlorimuron was observed, with resistance factors (RF50) for the control of 7.43, 3.58, and 14.35 and for the reduction of dry mass of 2.65, 2.79, and 11.31, respectively. All the established criteria for demonstrating new cases of weed resistance were met; thus, the first case worldwide of a Conyza species with resistance to herbicides with three different mechanisms of action was confirmed.",

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the water absorption parameters and storage tolerance of soybean seeds with contrasting seed coat characteristics. For this purpose, seeds of five soybean cultivars with different seed coat colors and lignin contents were used. Before storage, the seed coat lignin content, moisture content, water absorption rate in 11 hydration periods (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 24, 32, and 48 hours), hydration speed index, germination, viability, and seed vigor were determined. After six months of storage in a dry and cold chamber (at 11ºC and 54% relative humidity [RH]) and uncontrolled environment (at 25ºC and 71% RH), the seeds were evaluated for germination, viability, and vigor to quantify changes in their physiological quality during storage and relate them to the seeds water absorption parameters for the different cultivars. The seed coat lignin content is negatively correlated with the seeds water absorption parameters. Soybean cultivars have different storage tolerance levels. Seeds that absorb larger amounts of water have lower tolerance to deterioration related to temperature and relative humidity fluctuations that occur in storage under uncontrolled conditions, negatively affecting the physiological potential of seeds.",

The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four replications, in a split-plot arrangement, with the straws in the plots and evaluation periods in sub-plots (0, 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 e 72 days after seeding). The collected residues were dried to determine the remaining dry matter, then ground and sent to laboratory in order to determinate macronutrient contents. By the contents and remaining dry matter amounts, the remaining nutrient amounts were determined, expressed as percentages of the initial amounts. Non-linear models were fit to the values, choosing the best adjustment. The pearl millet plus Crotalaria juncea intercropping provided the largest biomass production. The straw from intercropping accumulated and released the largest macronutrients quantities, except for sulfur. The single millet presented the fastest nitrogen release speed.",

The selected grids had 128, 64 and 32 units using stratified systematic aligned sampling (SSAS). The thematic maps was generated from each sampling grid and using each of the interpolators. The relative deviation coefficient (CDR) was proposed to express the average difference in module of the values interpolated in each grid in relation to the considered standard SSAS grid with 128 units and kriging interpolator. The CDR proved efficient in the comparison of maps and made it possible to conclude that to effectively use the entire potential of the kriging, it is necessary to have several points, so that a good semivariogram is constructed. Otherwise, any of the other analyzed interpolators can be used. The SSAS 128 inverse distance method was most similar to the reference, SSAS 128 Kriging.",

Therefore, this work was developed with the objective of evaluating the tillering, fresh biomass accumulation and yield of sugarcane ratoon (var. RB855453), as well as the infestation level of M. fimbriolata, when the crop was submitted to three different straw management systems: (i.) straw in total area; (ii.) uncovered rows and (iii.) accumulating the straw of three rows in one interrow. As a result of experimental rigor provided by the Tukey test and the size and representativeness of each plot (2700 m²), it was possible to conclude that keeping sugarcane straw over the soil in total area, after harvest without burning, reduced ratoon development, presenting lower yield and tiller biomass. Straw accumulation of three rows in one interrow did not contribute to the number of tillers; however, it promoted higher biomass of tillers and consequently higher yield, without difference for the management of uncovered rows. Lower infestations of M. fimbriolata were identified in the treatment with uncovered rows; however, the control level was not reached and thus, the entomological damages must not have contributed to the lower crop yield under straw in total area.",

A total of 36 weed species were evaluated for the occurrence of mycorrhizae; of these, 11 were selected to evaluate their potential for total and relative phosphate solubilization. All of the species demonstrated mycorrhizal colonization, including a member of the Brassicaceae family, which is usually assumed to be non-mycorrhizal. In most of the species, morphological types of arbuscular and coiled hyphae were observed, with the coiled hyphae being the most common in the grasses. Dark septate endophytic fungi were observed in most of the plants. The weeds presented different potentials for P solubilization in the rhizosphere; Amaranthus retroflexus, Bidens pilosa and Leonotis nepetaefolia showed high values of relative phosphate solubilization.

Seedlings from stress sensitive seeds germinated under high salinity showed a rapid recover of growth in non stressing conditions. The effect of salt stress on shoot/root ratio was controversial, increased for lab and decreased for greenhouse experiments, probably due to different timing of stress application and additional experimental conditions. Salt stress decreased leaf photosynthesis and increased thermal dissipation in sensitive seedlings (decrease of ΦPSII and qP, increase of NPQ).

The results show that the mean soil moisture content of soil sampled on different dates was correlated with the mean of the ECa. The ideal time for measuring ECa occurred when the mean moisture content of the soil was higher. In this condition, the coefficient of variation for the soil moisture content was lower, there was no correlation between ECa and soil moisture content, and ECa was more correlated with other soil attributes evaluated in this work.",

Coffee drying was conducted in a fixed-layer dryer at two temperatures and two airflows. After drying, an evaluation of the physiological and sensorial quality was conducted. Based on the results obtained, the following conclusions were drawn: coffee that is processed via a dry method is more sensitive to mechanical drying with heated air than coffee processed via a wet method, resulting in poor physiological performance; airflow does not interfere with the physiological quality of pulped and natural coffees; a temperature increase from 40 to 45°C resulted in a decrease in the physiological quality only for pulped coffee; and an increase in the drying rate as a result of an increase in the drying temperature to 40°C had a negative effect on the sensorial quality of pulped coffee.",

Seeds extracted from fruits collected at three stages of maturity were used, i.e., yellow, brownish-yellow, and brown (dry fruits). The seeds were subsequently stored for 18 months in Kraft paper bags in a laboratory environment. Initially as well as every three months, the seeds were evaluated for germination and electrical conductivity, and the seed embryos were evaluated for lipid peroxidation; protein content; and superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase enzyme activity at the same time points. In general, the seeds from the three stages of fruit maturity did not differ regarding germination throughout the entire period of storage, although a reduction in viability was observed after nine months of storage. The electrical conductivity increased during storage and was greater for the seeds obtained from brown fruits. There was a reduction in protein content and in enzyme activities in the seed embryo, except for superoxide dismutase. No relationship was observed between reduction in seed viability and lipid peroxidation. Thus, J. curcas seeds with high initial quality can be stored under environmental conditions for up to 9, 15 and 15 months for brown (dry), yellow and brownish-yellow fruits, respectively, without a significant reduction in germination but with a reduction in seed vigour.",

However, research examining the relationship between depth distribution of Al and soil weathering has received little priority in Brazil, particularly regarding the number of soil profiles investigated. This study analyzed 38 acid soils selected from Soil Surveys in southern Brazil to identify and isolate the effects of organic and mineral components on depth distribution of exchangeable Al extracted with KCl (AlKCl). These soil profiles were divided into the following three groups based on AlKCl depth distribution: Group I – decrease with depth; Group II – little variation with depth; and Group III – increase with depth. High AlKCl found near the surface of well-developed soils (Group I) was influenced by organic matter content, while mineral fraction quality defined the occurrence of high AlKCl in subsurface horizons of Group III. The depth distribution of AlKCl was defined by the degree of weathering in these subtropical soils. Possessing a knowledge of these soil groupings may aid in soil acidity management to optimize crop productivity in southern Brazil.",

The study was conducted in areas around Piracicaba, Brazil. First, we conducted sampling to evaluate the best sampling density to characterize the spatial dependence. The results showed that the procedure in which the evaluators entered every 20 rows of sugarcane and sampled every 20 m was sufficient to characterize the spatial dependence. In separate areas, the sampling was performed similarly to the previous step, and after generating the application maps, insecticide was applied on a site-specific basis. Even using the more strict control level defined by the producer, there was considerable saving for the pesticide used. In the two fields, the percentage of the infestation-free area was 56.1 and 80.7%.",

We studied 30 accessions of the vegetable gene bank of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa. To this end, 17 morphoagronomic descriptors and five combinations of AFLP primers were used. Genetic parameters were estimated for the quantitative traits and the accessions were grouped by Ward’s method, using the Gower’s and Jaccard’s distance measures, respectively, for the morphoagronomic and molecular data. Polymorphisms were observed for all qualitative traits, while the quantitative traits were significant by deviance analysis. The genetic parameters confirmed the existence of variability among accessions, and high accuracy and heritability indices were found for the traits related to fruit and plant height. Ward’s grouping showed no relationship between the clusters formed with the morphoagronomic and molecular data and the geographical origin of the accessions. No association between morphoagronomic descriptors and AFLP markers was observed.

Census data from a semideciduous seasonal forest were used to estimate the aboveground carbon stock. The carbon stocks of soil and fine roots were sampled in 52 plots at depths of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-80 cm, combined with the measured bulk density. The total estimated carbon stock was 267.52 Mg ha-1, of which 35.23% was in aboveground biomass, 63.22% in soil, and 1.54% in roots. In the soil, a spatial pattern of the carbon stock was repeated at all depths analyzed, with a reduction in the amount of carbon as the depth increased. The carbon stock of the trees followed the same spatial pattern as the soil, indicating a relationship between these variables. In the fine roots, the carbon stock decreased with increasing depth, but the spatial gradient did not follow the same pattern as the soil and trees, which indicated that the root carbon stock was most likely influenced by other factors.",

The sampled area has 1.74 ha with 256 plots: 128 with site- specific chemical management and 128 without site-specific chemical management. A plot combine was used for harvest. In the experiment the spatial dependence was verified for both planting systems in each year. The punctual values of soybean yield of each year were standardized using the standard score technique. After that, these values were reclassified in low, medium and high, allowing the comparison of productivities in different years and the generation of a yield average map. Management zones were generated according to the standardized yields and also to the coefficient of variation being classified in low, medium and high. The methodology was efficient to identify homogeneous zones.",

    "abstract": "Currently, Brachiaria brizantha Stapf is the tropical grass with the largest cultivated area in Brazil, being responsible for a major part of the seed market and for the increase in animal production. There are several superior genotypes available in germplasm banks, collected from the African continent and in need of evaluation. The selection of these genotypes must be based on predicted genotype values of the individuals in function of being perennial plants and of unsexed propagation. The standard procedure for the prediction of genetic values is the individual BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Predictor), using estimates of variance components achieved by the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) on an individual model. With the aim of selecting B. brizantha materials superior to the commercial cultivars in relation to the agronomic traits, 218 genotypes were evaluated at four experimental fields belonging to Embrapa Gado de Corte in Campo Grande, MS, Brazil. The fields were evaluated at different times, being that field One was evaluated for three years, and the others for two years. The experimental design used was that of randomized blocks in three replications, with Marandu and Xaraés cultivars as witnesses. Genetic parameters estimated for the characters were: accumulation of dry mass (MST), accumulation of foliar dry matter (MSF), dry green matter (MSV), leaf percentage (F(%)), rebudding (REB) and vigor. It was concluded that two years of measurement are enough for selection, adopting a coefficient of determination of 80%.",

    "abstract": "Harvesting is one of the most important operations in coffee production systems. This operation has a high cost and impact on the final quality of the product. To reduce production costs, producers are looking for ways to mechanize this operation. Harvesting machines generally detach fruits from the coffee plant by vibration and/or impact. The objective of this work was to study the effect of the amplitude and frequency of vibration on the efficiency of coffee fruit harvesting. Vibration tests of coffee branches were performed in a laboratory using an electromagnetic shaker. The tests were performed using amplitudes in the range of 3.75 to 7.50 mm and frequencies from 13.33 to 26.67 Hz. Coffee branches from two different varieties were used for evaluation, Catuaí Vermelho and Mundo Novo. It was verified that harvesting efficiency is directly related to the acceleration reached by the fruits during the harvesting process. The frequencies of 23.33 and 26.67 Hz and amplitudes of 6.25 and 7.50 mm resulted in the highest harvesting efficiency of ripe coffee cherries for both varieties. However, the harvesting efficiency for the Mundo Novo variety was higher than that of the Catuaí Vermelho variety at the studied frequency and amplitude ranges in this work.",

The variables analyzed were: germination percentage, germination speed index (GSI), average germination time (AGT), average germination speed (AGS) and entropy. Evaluations were made 63 days after installation of the test. Absence of light favored germination and GSI. Both AGT and entropy diminished as accelerated aging time increased, but were not influenced by light. Germination and AGT diminished under longer accelerated aging periods in the presence of light.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the root density and root depth of six irrigated grasses under different nitrogen fertilization and management. The experiment was analyzed in a split-split plot design. Two management (grazed and cut) constituted the plots, six grasses (Estrela, Marandu, Mombaça, Pioneiro, Tanzânia and Xaraes) the split-plots, and four nitrogen fertilization (100, 300, 500 and 700 kg ha-1 year-1) the split-split-plots. The root density was obtained by the medium density of all the samples and root depth was based on the first 80% root weight. Effects of the grasses, nitrogen fertilization and management were observed in the appraised characteristics. Marandu, followed by Xaraes, presented larger root density. In general, Marandu and Pioneiro provided larger and smaller root depth, respectively. The cut provided larger root density, even though it did not influence root depth. Nitrogen fertilization depended on the grass and management to have an effect in the parameters.",

These species were evaluated with the purpose of determining the effects of different shade levels on seedling emergence and initial growth. Treatment with 50% shade resulted in the highest percentage of seedling emergence and the highest emergence speed index for all three species. The 50% shade level was the best condition for growth of P. morifolia and P. palmeri var. sublanceolata seedlings because in this condition, they presented higher growth in relation to control and the other treatments. However, P. suberosa litoralis can be considered a sun species because it grew better in full sunlight and 25% shade, but its growth was stunted at 75% shade. Increased leaf area and specific leaf area were due to changes in leaf dimension and shape in response to an increase in shade levels. These observations related to the initial growth reflect the development and adaptation of adult plants to heterogeneous environmentsenvironments. Therefore, P. morifolia and P. palmeri var. sublanceolata seedlings adapted better to moderate shade conditions, and P. suberosa litoralis seedlings should be cultivated in full sunlight.",

This work was conducted at Embrapa Cotton, located in the city of Campina Grande, state of Paraíba, Brazil, in October 2010. For the indirect analysis, portable equipment was used to read leaf discs of different shades of green. The chlorophyll in these discs was then determined using a classical method: 5 mL of DMSO was added, the samples were incubated in a water bath at 70ºC for 30 minutes, and a 3 mL aliquot was removed for spectrophotometric measurements at 470, 646 and 663 nm. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and regression analyses in which the readings obtained using the portable chlorophyll meter were the dependent variable and the photosynthetic pigments that were determined by the classical method were the independent variable. The results indicated that, with the exception of chlorophyll b, the ClorofiLOG® 1030 portable chlorophyll meter estimated the concentration of photosynthetic pigments with high precision, thus saving time and the chemical reagents that are typically used in conventional procedures.",

The nutrient treatments were: T1–farmers' fertilizer use; T2–balanced nutrient management (recommended N, P, Zn. and B from mineral sources); T3–integrated nutrient management, same as T2, except that 75% N was applied from fertilizer and 25% as FYM; and T4 same as T2, except that every alternate year, wheat was substituted by Berseem green manure. All treatments were compared with and without crop residue incorporation. Soil organic matter (SOM) content in both the soils was significantly increased with T2, T3 and T4 as compared with T1, and was increased further where the nutrient-management treatments were applied in combination with crop-residue recycling. Higher increase in SOM content was observed in soil having relatively lower initial SOM (0.61%) than soil having initial 0.80% SOM content. Increased SOM content, in return, decreased soil bulk density, improved macro- and meso-porosity, and enhanced percent recovery of stable aggregates correspondingly. Infiltration rates were 20, 49 and 26% higher with T2, T3 and T4, respectively, over T1 and 64% higher with crop-residue incorporation over crop-residue removal. Positive impacts on soil physical properties were also observed in the sub-soil layers.",

It employed recording rainfall charts from the meteorological station of Urussanga (latitude: 28.31° S, longitude: 49.19° W, altitude: 49 m) from 1980 to 2007. Rain events were classified into four types according to the duration quartile in which the greatest amount of precipitation occurred. It is found that type I rain events are more frequent, followed by type II, and these occur predominantly during the summer, while type III and IV rain events are distributed throughout the year. In the summer, rain events that last for less than 12 hours are more frequent, whereas during the rest of the year, rain events that last for more than 18 hours are most common.",

However, due to genetic breeding, varieties are currently grown in subtropical and tropical regions where there are low occurrences of chill during this phenological stage. This study evaluated the adaptability and stability of the reproductive and vegetative phases of peach tree cultivars in a subtropical climate. An experiment was designed in randomized blocks with split time plots, with 23 peach tree cultivars and four replications, with each replication consisting of one plant and four shoots. The years of evaluated (plots) and the cultivars (subplots) were considered to be treatments. The relative rates of budburst (RRB), flowering (RRF), shoot formation (SF) and fruit set (FS), average time of budburst (ATB) and flowering (ATF), duration of budburst (DB) and flowering (DF) and number of hours with temperatures below 7.20°C were evaluated during the experimental period. The cultivars ‘Bonão’, ‘Ouromel-4’, ‘Libra’ and ‘Maciel’ demonstrated greater adaptability during the vegetative phase, whereas‘Ouromel-4’ and ‘Libra’ demonstrated greater adaptability and stability during the reproductive phase of peach trees in a subtropical climate.",

Currently, lysimeters containing weighing bars with up to 4 load cells are economically feasible. This goal of this study was to present the construction and calibration of four weighing lysimeters built using two rectangular tanks, with a surface area of 1.35 m2 (1 m by 1.35 m) and a depth of 1.5 m, loaded on two weighing bars. Each bar had two high accuracy loading cells connected to a junction box and a datalogger by a coaxial cable. Calibration of each lysimeter was performed after field installation. The results showed a linear response (R2 > 0.9999) of electric signal (mV) to mass increase or decrease (kg) with minimum hysteresis. The mean absolute error of the mass estimate (0.0245 to 0.2844 equivalent-mm) and a Willmott index between the observed and estimated data (d = 1.0000) indicate the high precision of the new equipment. The results allow concluding that the lysimeters in this study are appropriate for estimating evapotranspiration and other components of soil water balance.",

The foliar application of molybdenum did not favor the nodulation, but its effect on yield was dependent on the chemical soil characteristics, providing highest yield in soil at Patos de Minas with pH more acid and with higher phosphorus and organic matter concentrations. Small dose of nitrogen applied at planting did not reduce nodulation of bean inoculated with rhizobia, but it can reduce the seeds emergence, thus negatively affecting yield. The native rhizobia promoted nodulation, the plant growth, shoot N accumulation and yield similar to the treatments that received inoculations of rhizobia strains.",

Twelve primers amplified well-defined DNA segments for all 88 samples of the three Conyza species. The estimated proportion of SSR polymorphic loci, number of alleles, and mean expected heterozygosity were higher in samples of C. bonariensis than in samples of C. sumatrensis or C. canadensis.

Daily data from 2002 to 2016 from 8 Brazilian weather stations were used. ETo was estimated using empirical equations, PM equation with missing data and MARS. Four data availability scenarios were evaluated as follows: temperature only, temperature and solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity, and temperature and wind speed. The MARS models demonstrated superior performance in all scenarios. The models that used solar radiation showed the best performance, followed by those that used relative humidity and, finally, wind speed.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of climate change on irrigation adoption in Brazil. Temperature and precipitation projections for the 2010-2099 periods were employed under a number of different climate scenarios according the 4th Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The results show that irrigation adoption will be affected by climate change. Given current conditions, irrigation has generally been adopted in Brazil to cope with reduced precipitation and temperature variations. The estimated irrigation probabilities in the future scenarios were quite different across Brazilian regions. The main explanation for this pattern is the distinct climatic conditions and production structures. Considering future climate change, over the next 30 years (2010 to 2039), the irrigation probability is expected to increase in all Brazilian regions. However, this trend is reversed in the long run.",

Of the climatic conditions that can impair Trichogramma spp. parasitism capacity, the temperature is critical. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate the parasitism capacity of Trichogramma pretiosum on eggs of T. ni at 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33ºC; 70±10% RH; and 12/12 hours photophase (L/D). Fresh eggs of the host moth were offered to T. pretiosum daily. The parasitism rate varied between 8 and 11.4 eggs/female at the temperatures evaluated for the first 24 hours. The highest number of parasitized eggs per female occurred at 24ºC (53.0 parasitized eggs/female). The period of parasitism and the mean longevity of females were inversely related to the temperature. Temperature heavily influences the parasitism rate of T. pretiosum on eggs of T. ni, and the best overall performance of the parasitoid occurs from 24 to 27ºC.",

The pioneer species presented higher foliar contents of N; the non-pioneer species presented higher contents of K, Ca and S; and the results were inconclusive for P and Mg. The deciduous species presented higher foliar contents of K and of P, whereas the foliar contents of N, Ca, Mg and S were virtually identical between the phenological groups. The internal retranslocation of foliar nutrients in pioneer and non-deciduous species was higher than that of non-pioneer and deciduous species.",

This study was conducted in the Brazilian savanna over 9 years and consisted of the following four treatments with different soil management systems: the NTS and CTS with the succession or rotation of crops (cotton, soybean, maize, and Urochloa ruziziensis). The NTS increased the carbon content by 55% in the top 5 cm after 9 years and increased the carbon stock by approximately 20% at a depth of up to 40 cm. Crop rotation with soybean, maize, and cotton was insufficient to increase the carbon stock in the soil under the CTS. In addition to increasing the fiber yield, the cotton crop in a NTS rotated with soybean + U. ruziziensis and with maize + U. ruziziensis increases the carbon stock and nitrogen content in soil.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen management in crops is a key activity for agricultural production. Methods that can determine the levels of this element in plants in a quick and non-invasive way are extremely important for improving production systems. Within several fronts of study on this subject, proximal and remote sensing methods are promising techniques. In this regard, this research sought to demonstrate the relationships between variations in leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and sugarcane spectral behaviour. The work was carried out in three experimental areas in São Paulo State, Brazil, with different soils, varieties and nitrogen rates during the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. A significant correlation was observed between the LNC and variations in the sugarcane spectra. The green and red-edge spectral bands were the most consistent and stable predictors of LNC among the evaluated harvests. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (MSLR) generated better models for LNC estimation when calibrated with experimental area, independent of the variety. The present research demonstrates that specific wavelengths are associated with the variation in LNC in sugarcane, and these are reported in the green region (near 550 nm) and in the red-edge wavelengths (680 to 720 nm). These results may help in future research on the direct in situ application of nitrogen fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the beverage quality of Coffea canephora genotypes in different environments of the western Amazon to assist plant selection and new cultivar development. To analyze beverage quality, samples of cherry coffee beans were collected separately for each genotype from clonal competition trials installed in the municipalities of Ouro Preto do Oeste, Alta Floresta do Oeste, Porto Velho, and Ariquemes in Rondônia State and Rio Branco in Acre State (Brazil). The beverage quality was assessed using the Robusta Cupping Protocol, which attribute to each genotype a score in a range from 0 to 100, highlighting nuances. Analysis of variance and principal components using reference points were used to quantify genotype x environment interaction (G x E). The analysis of variance indicated that genotypic and G x E interaction effects were significant (p &lt; 0.01). By using a centroid dispersion method, we could identify four clones of low, eight of specific (to favorable or unfavorable environments), and seven of broad adaptability to the environments. The clones BRS 2314, 11, and 17 had average quality scores above 80 in all environments, with potential for specialty coffee production. The clones BRS 1216, BRS 3220, and BRS 3193 presented unstable behavior, with beans of higher quality in some of the evaluated environments. Such inconsistency in clone behavior is caused by unpredictable changes in plant performance in different environments. Our results indicate that both genotypic (clones) and G x E interaction effects are important for the expression of coffee beverage quality. However, the clones BRS 3213, BRS 3210, and BRS 2299 had less prominent nuances, with lower potential for specialty coffee production.",

The antagonistic effects of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. sclerotiorum were assessed in vivo and in vitro using live and autoclaved cultures at concentrations of 0% (control), 20%, 30%, and 40% (v/v). The residual effects of four treatments (20% live culture, 20% autoclaved culture, a Bacillus subtilis-based commercial product, and autoclaved distilled water) on tomato plants inoculated with S. sclerotiorum were determined. The same treatments were also used to assess the myceliogenic germination of sclerotia and induction of plant defense enzymes (peroxidase, catalase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and β-1,3-glucanase) in tomato plants. The live culture had a residual effect for 4 days and inhibited sclerotial germination by approximately 30%. Furthermore, live and autoclaved bacterial growth cultures stimulated enzyme activity. Therefore, B. amyloliquefaciens PKM16 was antagonistic to S. sclerotiorum, effectively inhibiting mycelial growth and activating defense mechanisms in Micro-Tom tomato plants.",

    "abstract": "Antecedent crops, doses and sources of nitrogen on yield compounds of corn. Some plants for mulching have the capacity to increase the availability of nutrients in the soil – nitrogen in particular – for crop succession, thus producing positive effects on the interaction between mineral fertilizer and green manure. As a result, there is a greater possibility to obtain higher incomes than by using each one separately. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of antecedent crops, doses and sources of nitrogen on yield compounds and foliar nitrogen content of corn by means of no-tillage system. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with treatments arranged in sub-subdivided plots. These were constituted by crops preceding corn: black oat, wheat, pasture turnip, hairy vetch and one rest treatment during winter. Subplots were established by four doses of nitrogen (0; 50; 100 and 200 kg ha-1 of N), which were applied as cover. Sub-subplots were represented by two sources of nitrogen (ammonia sulfate and urea). Results showed that antecedent crops had some influence upon yield, mass of 1000 grains and foliar nitrogen content of corn. The highest yield of corn was obtained after the winter rest, the pasture turnip and also in the absence of nitrogen fertilization as cover. The maximum yield of corn was obtained when sowing was done after wheat and black oat, in nitrogen doses of 140 and 137 kg ha-1, respectively. The nitrogen sources utilized had some influence only upon the index of harvest, the number of grains per ear and the foliar nitrogen content.",

Samples were collected containing 15 leaves per plot in five plants in different extracts - one leaf of the lower extract, one of the medium and one of the upper extract - with the objective of evaluating the amount of suspension deposited in function of flow and nozzle type. The treatments were constituted of four spraying nozzles (simple fan, double fan, double fan with air injection and empty cone) and three suspension volumes (100, 200 and 300 L ha-1). The suspension volume that presented the highest depositions in the different extracts of the soybean plants was 300 L ha-1; the spraying nozzle that presented the highest depositions, in the upper plant extract was the double plane jet; for the medium and lower extracts, the jet empty cone nozzle. The depositions in middle and lower thirds of the soybean plants were significantly lower to those obtained in the upper third, regardless of the nozzle and flow used; for higher depositions in the upper third of soybean plants, the best combination is to use double plane jet nozzles, with suspension volumes of 300 L ha-1; for higher depositions in the medium and lower third of soybean plants, the best combination is to use conical jet nozzles, with suspension volumes of 200 or 300 L ha-1",

The following were determined: fresh matter of aerial part; dry weight of aerial part and number of leaves. The applied composts satisfactorily supplied the nitrogen needs of the culture, in the first cycle, making the use of mineral fertilizer unnecessary. The composition of the applied materials significantly influenced the production of lettuce in the first cycle, promoting residual effect in the second cycle, although in lesser ratios.",

The aim of this research was to evaluate response of the common bean to N in no-tillage systems over maize, millet and Brachiaria brizantha crop residues. Three experiments were conducted, one for each gramineous species. The experimental design was a randomized block in a 5x2x2 factorial scheme, with five N doses (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 kg ha-1), in two distinct stadia during the vegetative development (3rd and 6th trifoliate leaf) and two common bean cultivars (IPR Juriti and Pérola), with four replications. The IPR Juriti produced a greater number of pods per plant and showed lower mass per 100 seeds than Pérola. It did not show variation in bean yield when the sidedressing N application was carried out in the 3rd or 6th trifoliate leaf stadia. Based on the obtained results, one concludes that the seed productivity of common beans increases linearly with N doses in a no-tillage system over maize residues.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of new one-way popcorn hybrids developed by the Breeding Program of the State University of Maringá, in northwestern Paraná. The characteristics evaluated were: grain yield, popping expansion, plant height, ear height and the intensity of Southern rust (Puccinia polysora), Northern leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum), and phaeosphaeria leaf spot (Phaeosphaeria maydis/Pantoea ananas). The assay was carried out into randomized block design with three replications in Maringá, state of Paraná, Brazil, during the 2006/2007 cropping season. The treatments were 27 simple popcorn hybrids obtained from S5 endogamic inbreds and commercial cultivars BRS Angela, IAC 112 and Jade. Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were verified among hybrids for all characteristics. The hybrid from C and K inbreds presented better indexes for grain yield and popping expansion; and was susceptible to Southern rust. About diseases, the hybrids from the L, H and K inbreds showed greater resistance levels to Southern rust, and hybrids from G inbred had better Northern leaf blight resistance. Hybrids from L and M inbreds showed better phaeosphaeria leaf spot resistance.",

The joint analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables has been considered a useful tool to estimate the genetic divergence among accessions of a gene bank. The purpose of this research was: (i) to characterize a collection of cherry tomatoes, using quantitative and qualitative descriptors, and (ii) to use Gower's algorithm to quantify genetic divergence among genotypes, employing a joint descriptors analysis. Forty accessions of organically grown cherry tomato were studied in Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Four qualitative fruit descriptors and nine qualitative descriptors were used. Data were analyzed using Gower's algorithm. There was variability for color, shape and number of locules per fruit. The red color was observed in fruits of 25 accessions. Fruit with different colors such as yellow, orange and brown were also observed. Regarding locule number, the presence of fruit with two, three, four and even with seven locules was detected. The UPGMA method resulted in the highest value for cophenetic correlation (0.80) and seven clusters were formed. The formed clusters made it possible to distinguish fruit classified as cherry tomato from other type grouped in different clusters, because the fruits this category were larger than cherry type considering the equatorial diameter of the fruit.",

Also, the semivariograms showed a spatial pattern of data for weeds, even if they were separated according to its leaf morphology. The clustered weed distribution were well designed at the kriged maps and also observed according to distribution index. With the geostatistical approach, it was possible to clear mapping site-specific managing zones with 5 to 10 fold differences in weed count, in order to confirm that this technique can be used as ancillary tool in agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "The study consisted of a comparison of two-peat materials (Brazil and Canada) containing different C-total content. The peats were inoculated with strains of Herbaspirillum seropedicae ZAE 94, Burkholderia sp. M130, and Azospirillum brasilense Sp109, and monitored during a period of six months in relation to variation on humidity and survival of bacteria in the inoculant. The quantification of viable cells in the inoculant was measured by the Most Probable Number (MPN) method. The rice seeds were pelleted with the respective inoculants, grown in pots containing soil and maintained outside a greenhouse. The dry mass accumulation, N percent, N-total and yield were determined during the plant cycle. The humidity content varied with storage period. The survival measurement showed that only Burkholderia sp. M130 maintained the number of viable cells around 108 g-1 of peat, while there was a reduction in population of other strains. An increase of yield and total N of 13 and 19.4%, respectively in comparison to treatment fertilized with 40 kg N ha-1 was observed for variety IAC4440, inoculated with strain ZAE94. There was no difference in yield of the IR42 inoculated with either ZAE94 or M130, as compared to N control treatment. No significant difference in development of both rice varieties was observed for both peat used. The results suggest that peat can be used as a carrier for production of an inoculant based on diazotrophic bacteria, since it allowed maintenance of a bacterial population up to 108 cells g-1 peat during the storage period of up to 100 days. The results obtained encourage the practice of inoculation of non-leguminous plants.",

In this work, different concentrations of activated charcoal or graphite were added to KC medium to darken the culture medium and stimulate the in vitro propagation of Cattleya bicolor and of a double hybrid orchid ('BLC Pastoral Innocence'). The seedlings were inoculated on growth regulator-free KC medium; the effects of activated charcoal (0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 g L-1) and graphite (0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 g L-1) concentrations were tested separately. Each flask contained fifteen seedlings, and the experiments had a randomised, two-way factorial design. The two tested variables were culture medium and illumination levels; eleven culture levels (different concentrations of graphite or activate charcoal) and two illumination levels (14-hr photoperiod or continuous illumination) were evaluated. Three replicates of each combination were utilised. After six months of culture, the average numbers of induced buds and roots per seedling were recorded for each concentration of activated charcoal or graphite. Whereas the largest number of buds in C. bicolor seedlings occurred on media containing 6.0 or 7.5 g L-1 graphite, the largest number of roots occurred on media containing 6.0 g L-1 activated charcoal. In the hybrid 'BLC Pastoral Innocence', the largest number of buds and roots was reported in medium with 4.5 g L-1 activated charcoal. When using graphite in place of activated charcoal, we obtained disparate the results in root formation that suggest that graphite is not a recommended substitute for activated charcoal.",

The physical attributes of soil, such as soil penetration resistance, can be used to monitor and evaluate the soil's quality. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed to solve many problems in agriculture, and the use of this technique can be considered an alternative approach for predicting the penetration resistance produced by the soil's basic properties, such as bulk density and water content. The aim of this work is to perform an analysis of the soil penetration resistance behavior measured from the cone index under different levels of bulk density and water content using statistical analyses, specifically regression analysis and ANN modeling. Both techniques show that soil penetration resistance is associated with soil bulk density and water content. The regression analysis presented a determination coefficient of 0.92 and an RMSE of 0.951, and the ANN modeling presented a determination coefficient of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.084. The results show that the ANN modeling presented better results than the mathematical model obtained from regression analysis.",

Surface liming had little effect on extractable soil micronutrient and nutrient concentrations in soybean leaves. In the area with three years under NT, all liming rates decreased the extractable soil Zn up to a depth of 0.20 m. Lime incorporation decreased the extractable soil Mn in the surface layer. There were no differences in the extractable soil micronutrients and nutrient concentrations in soybean leaves as a function of the number of years under NT. These data suggest that broadcasting lime at current rates on soils under NT does not necessarily lead to micronutrient deficiencies.",

Morphological and chemical characteristics were associated with onion's resistance to T. tabaci. For the cultivar Alfa São Francisco RT, a wider central angle (16.4°), a thinner cuticle, a larger amount of epicuticular waxes, and stomata on the surface of leaves accounted for resistance. For the cultivars BR 29 and Sirius, the resistance was likely due to the presence of resistance-conferring substances or high amounts of some component in the chemical composition of plants.",

The experiment was carried out in a randomized blocks design, with four replications. The treatments were control (limestone, granite and natural phosphate); conventional fertilization; powder basalt (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 ton. ha-1); cattle manure, and doses of powder basalt with cattle manure. In the treatment with conventional fertilizer, the total phosphorus content in grain was higher than the control, but the application of powder of basalt did not show a difference significant. Increase in the doses of basalt powder increased the phosphorus content, but phytate content remained constant. Basalt powder proved to be an alternative to maintain low levels of phosphorus in the form of phytate in the grains.",

Liming induced soil pH, Ca2+, and Mg2+ increases, and the opposite was observed for Al3+ and Al saturation. Fertilisation increased soil exchangeable K+ concentrations and needle and litter K concentrations. The low Ca and Mg concentrations found in the plant needles might be attributable to their low mobility.",

The aim of this study was to assess the phytotoxic action of aqueous leaf extract of Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Myrcia multiflora, Myrcia splendens and Myrcia tomentosa on the germination and development of three weeds. The working hypothesis was that leaf extracts of Myrtaceae may negatively influence the development of weed species. Aqueous leaf extracts at 5 and 10% (g mL-1) were tested on the germination and growth of Euphorbia heterophylla, Echinochloa crus-galli and Ipomoea grandifolia and compared with the herbicide oxyfluorfen and distilled water (control). The most extracts caused pronounced delays in seed germination and inhibited the growth of seedlings of E. heterophylla; I. grandifolia and E. crus-galli, with the last target species had no growth shoot inhibited by the extracts. In this study, the potential and efficiency of the tested aqueous leaf extracts were evident because they were more phytotoxic to the weeds than the herbicide. Thus, the aqueous extracts of leaves from Myrtaceae species show potential for the isolation of active compounds that can be used for the production of natural herbicides in the future.",

Field experiments were performed for four growing seasons in an Oxisol soil in Santo Antônio de Goiás, Brazil, using a randomized block experimental design in a split plot scheme. The plots were planted with common bean SEG, and the subplots were the NF timings, including a treatment without N fertilization. The available soil N with improved fertility and medium to high levels of organic matter were enough to meet the N demands of the common bean crop in order to achieve yields of up to 3,000 kg ha-1. Fertilization with N, regardless of the time of application, provided no increase in the yield components, grain yield and the N, P and K contents in the leaves and grains of the common bean SEG. The genotypes CNFC 15873 and CNFC 15875 had higher grain yields in the rainfed summer, and the genotype CNFC 15874 had higher grain yields in the irrigated winter growing season. It can be inferred that the use of common bean SEG, with life cycles ranging from 65 to 77 days, can be a promising technology, providing grain yields similar to the control (IPR Colibri).",

This study introduces a noninvasive high-resolution imaging procedure for evaluating the mechanical damage to maize seeds and the effects on seed germination. Seeds with different levels of mechanical damage were evaluated using a benchtop micro-computed tomography system (micro-CT) and digital X-ray equipment. The two-dimensional transaxial, coronal and sagittal micro-CT sections were used to inspect the seed anatomy and the mechanical injuries in the internal seed tissue. Germination tests were performed using paper towel rolls (25°C for 7 days) in which the seedling length was evaluated on a daily basis, and the seedling dry biomass was measured at the seventh germination day. The micro-CT cross-sectional images allowed an efficient spatial characterization of the mechanical damage inside the seeds. On average, mechanically damaged seeds produced seedlings with a length 24% shorter and a dry biomass 65% less than that of the undamaged seeds. We concluded that the micro-CT technique provides an efficient means to inspect mechanically damaged maize seeds and allows for a reliable association with germination response.",

The effect of nine AMF isolates was evaluated individually in sugarcane presprouted seedlings (SP81-3250) grown under greenhouse conditions for a 120-day period. The isolates that stimulated plant growth in the soils with low P availability were Acaulospora colombiana (ACOL), Claroideoglomus etunicatum (CETU), Gigaspora margarita (GMAR), Rhizophagus clarus (RCLA) and Scutellospora calospora (SCAL). Compared to the Yellow Argisol, which had the highest P level, the Red-Yellow Argisol, with an intermediate P content, increased plant height. Compared to the other treatments, inoculation with ACOL, RCLA, and SCAL resulted in higher foliar P content in plants grown in soils with high to intermediate P levels. Root colonization by AMF and DSE was verified in the plants, with the coexistence of both fungal groups in the same plant and/or root fragment. However, AMF colonization was low compared to DSE colonization. The cooccurrence of DSE and AMF was higher in the plants inoculated with ACOL, RCLA, SCAL, and Dentiscutata heterogama. ACOL, CETU, GMAR, RCLA, and SCAL are AMF isolates that have the potential to establish a mycorrhizal inoculant for sugarcane that would be effective in several soils.",

The spectra of 901 standard samples obtained from 88 hybrids and 116 lines, which were evaluated in 11 locations, were collected from intact seeds (achenes) and correlated with data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The calibration was determined by linear regression using partial least squares to estimate the parameters. The goodness of fit was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), standard error of calibration (SEC) and the standard error of performance (SEP). The wavelengths ranging from 1319 to 1760 nm were selected for the calibration. The R2 was 0.87, the SEC was 2.39, and the SEP was 1.97. The oil content values obtained for the 19 hybrid seeds analyzed by NIR spectroscopy that were not included in the calibration were similar to the values obtained using the chemical method. The similarities between the values obtained using both methods and the R2, SEC and SEP values indicated that it is possible to establish a calibration equation using NIR spectroscopy to determine the oil contents of sunflower seeds produced under Brazilian field conditions.",

To evaluate the efficiency of EDTA-induced phytoextraction of Ba and Pb using Brachiaria decumbens for the remediation of soil contaminated by oil well drilling and exploration waste, an experiment was conducted by applying a single dose (6 mmol EDTA kg-1 soil) and split doses of EDTA (three applications of 2 mmol EDTA kg-1 soil). The samples were subjected to sequential extractions using the method proposed by Ure et al. (1993) as modified by Rauret et al. (1999).The application of EDTA did not influence the distribution of Ba in various chemical fractions of the soil. The dry matter production did not differ significantly between the treatments and the control, thereby demonstrating the tolerance of plants to the experimental conditions. The absorption of Pb by plants was influenced by the application of EDTA. The application of a single dose of EDTA influenced the absorption of Pb and its translocation to the aerial plant parts. The application of split doses favoured higher accumulation of Pb in roots. Because of its tolerance to heavy metals and EDTA, B. decumbens has the potential to be used in phytostabilisation.",

The experimental design consisted of randomised blocks, with treatments distributed in a factorial arrangement (4 x 2), using four nitrogen doses (0, 100, 175 and 250 g of N plant-1) and two humic substance applications (with and without humic substances), with four replications.

The humic substances and the nitrogen levels significantly affected the soluble solids, titratable acidity and SS/TA ratio, while the pH pulp was only influenced by the humic substances. The humic substances promoted a quantitative increase in the fruit yield of 0.63 ton ha-1. The fruit quality and yield of the custard apple depend on the nitrogen fertiliser and the interaction of the humic substances. Nitrogen fertilising of 100 g per plant, associated with humic substances, could be recommended for use in the production of custard apples.",

The objective of this work was to verify the variation of the LAI and the coffee kPAR subjected to different drip irrigation levels (130, 100, 70, and 40%) and to compare the data obtained from radiation bar linear sensors (SunScan) in the plants that received full irrigation with the values found by other LAI estimation methodologies. The study was conducted in Piracicaba, São Paulo State, Brazil, using the species Coffea arabica cv. Red Catuaí IAC 144; a drip irrigation system was adopted, with the irrigation controlled by tensiometry. The mean LAI values were higher in the L130 (irrigation level of 130%) and L100 (irrigation level of 100%) treatments than those with deficit irrigation depths. The mean kPAR values were lower for the L130 and L100 treatments than the values found in the deficit irrigation depth treatments. When comparing SunScan to other methodologies, the mean error (ME) and absolute mean error (AME) were high.",

    "abstract": "Because of climatic changes, the cultivation of temperate climate plants such as peach in subtropical climates has become a challenge. In these areas, temperatures exceeding 25°C often occur during the pre-flowering and flowering phases. The high temperature causes damages by acting during the early stages of pollen-pistil interaction processes. The objective of this work was to evaluate the stigmatic receptivity of peach flowers at 18°C and 30°C. The pollen adherence was evaluated as well as the germination and presence of pollen tubes in the transmitting tissue of the style. The genotypes responded differently to temperature. ‘Granada,’ ‘Diamante’, and ‘Sensação’ had a stigmatic receptivity that was less affected when flowers were exposed to the higher temperature. Most genotypes showed a reduction in the number of pistils with pollen tubes growing in the style, particularly when pollination was delayed.",

The experimental design was a randomized block design in a 2 x 4 + 2 factorial, which includes two sources of organic matter (sanitized sewage sludge and filter cake) and four levels of nitrogen (50, 75, 100, and 125%) relative to the recommended dose of phosphorus pentoxide compared with the mineral fertilizer. The use of organomineral fertilizer with the formulation of 75% sewage sludge showed greater growth for aerial plant parts. Biofertilizers formulated with sewage sludge and filter cake can replace mineral fertilizer and increase soybean growth. Quantitative changes in peroxidase, catalase and urease activity, as well as lipid peroxidation, were observed following the use of biofertilizers.",

In this context, we aimed to verify the effect of chemical fungicides, biological agents and plant extracts on the control of Lasiodiplodia theobromae in pruning wounds and their physiological effects in cv. Syrah grapevines. Plant extracts (clove, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary and lemongrass), commercial fungicides (difeconazole, tebuconazole, mancozeb, sulfur, pyraclostrobin, fosetyl-Al, and azoxystrobin), chitosan, Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis were used for the in vitro trials. The protection of pruning wounds in the potted vines was studied using fosetyl-Al, tebuconazole, Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis, garlic extract and clove extract. The experiments were carried out through two vegetative cycles: 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. The length of wood discoloration, pathogen re-isolation percentage, fresh mass of the pruning material, peroxidase activity, fluorescence, chlorophyll index, phenological stages, shoot length and leaf area were evaluated. The treatments with clove, garlic extract, tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin, mancozeb, fosetyl-Al and B. subtilis reduced mycelial growth by more than 90%. In the grapevines, the use of T. harzianum decreased the re-isolation of L. theobromae, but no differences were verified for the other plant evaluations. We concluded that the use of T. harzianum would be a potential option for wound protection without altering the physiological aspects of cv. Syrah grapevines.",

    "abstract": "Strawberries are berry-type fruits that are very popular and widely consumed all over the world. The sensorial, physical-chemical and nutritional characteristics of strawberries are parameters of quality that influence the choices of consumers. However, these characteristics may be influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that alter the fruit quality. The concentrations of nutrients and other chemical compounds in strawberries may increase and/or decrease according to the cropping system, maturation stage, climatic conditions, and preservation and storage methods. Factors characteristic of the cultivar, such as the genetic profile, may also influence the composition of strawberries. In this context, the objective of this research was to evaluate the sensorial, physical-chemical and nutritional characteristics of different strawberry cultivars to identify the genotype(s) with the best characteristics for commercialization and human consumption. The day-neutral strawberry cultivar \"Aromas\" and short-day strawberry cultivars \"Camarosa, Camino Real, Dover, Sweet Charlie, and Tudla\" were cultivated in the Olericultura Sector of the State University of the Midwest (UNICENTRO), Paraná State, Brazil. The fruits were characterized in relation to their physical-chemical, nutritional and sensorial aspects. According to the sensorial profiles, the Camarosa, Camino Real, Dover, and Tudla genotypes showed greater acceptability among consumers. Camarosa, Sweet Charlie, and Tudla presented better physical-chemical characteristics for human consumption, while the cultivars Camarosa, Dover, and Tudla had the best nutritional contents. In general, it is concluded that the genotypes Camarosa and Tudla are the most favourable for human consumption, according to their sensorial, physical-chemical and nutritional characteristics.",

In the winter period, black oat and ryegrass straw were managed at different grazing heights by sheep (0.30, 0.20, 0.10 m, conventional grazing, and no grazing) with three doses of nitrogen (0, 50, and 100 kg ha-1, with or without inoculation by A. brasilense). We used the hybrid Pioneer (P1630H®) in 2012 and the hybrid Agroeste (AS 1551®) in 2013. The height of corn plants was greater when they were grown on black oat and ryegrass straw, and the absence of grazing favored productivity. Under drought conditions, the application of nitrogen to the pasture favored corn development, increasing plant height, ear height, and stem diameter.

Herein, the goal of this study was to determine the optimum number of harvests based on yield traits and recommend a superior graft/rootstock combination (GRC) for Citrus latifolia Tanaka. Twenty-four GRCs of 'Tahiti' acid lime were evaluated from July 2017 to August 2018 for fruit yield per plant (FYP), number of fruits per plant (NFP), and longitudinal (LFD) and transversal fruit diameter (TFD). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 4 replications. The experimental unit consisted of three individuals, totalling 244 individuals. The GRCs were composed of (i) two hybrids that were used as rootstock, citrumelo ‘Swingle’ (Citrus paradisi x Poncirus trifoliata) and cintrandarin ‘Riverside’ (Citrus sunki x Poncirus trifoliata); and (ii) 12 different C. latifolia genotypes that were used as grafts: Bello Fruit, Eledio, Iconha, Itarana, Santa Rosa, Bearss lime, CNPMF 01, CNPMF 02, CNPMF 2001, CNPMF 5059, BRS Passos, and Persian 58. Mixed models were employed to estimate the variance components. The optimum number of harvests was determined based on selective efficiency values above 0.9. The estimated repeatability coefficients presented values of 0.14 (LFD), 0.16 (TFD), 0.36 (FYP), and 0.38 (NFD). Based on the results, four harvests were able to choose genotypes based on FYP and NFP, whereas LFD and TFD were considered inefficient traits for recommending superior GRCs.",

    "abstract": "In cotton crops, the cotton seed yield significantly contributes with the success of any cultivar. However, other traits are considered when an ideotype is pointed out in the selection, such as the fiber quality traits. The aim of this study was to applied genotype by yield*trait (GYT) biplot to a multi-environment trial data of cotton genotypes and selected the best genotypes. For this end, thirteen genotypes from nineteen trials were assessed. Seven traits were evaluated [cotton seed yield (SY), fiber percentage (FP), fiber length (FL), fiber uniformity (FU), short fiber index (SFI), fiber strength (FS), and elongation (EL)] and residual error variances structures [identity variance (IDV) and diagonal (Diag)] were tested by bayesian information criterion. After, the REML/BLUP approach was applied to predict the genetic values of each trait and the selective accuracy were measured from the prediction. Then, the GYT-biplot were applied to the data. For SP and SFI traits, the model with Diag residual variance was indicated, whereas for SY FL, FU, FS, and EL traits the model with IDV residual variance demonstrated the best fit to the data. Values of accuracy were higher than 0.9 for all traits analyzed. In the GYT-biplot acute angles were find for all traits relations, which means high correlation between the yield*traits combination. Besides that, the correlation still can be seen in the GYT-biplot, as shown by the magnitudes of the angles between the pairs Yield*FU-Yield*FS and Yield*FS-Yield*EL. Also, the GYT-biplot indicates the genotype G4 with the best performance for Yield*FS, Yield*SFI, Yield*FU, Yield*FL, and Yield*FP combined. The genotypes G4, G1, G13, G8, and G9 represent those genotypes with yield advantage over the other cultivars. Then, the genotype G4 combines all desirable characteristics and demonstrate have large potential in the cotton breeding. The GYT approach were valuable and were highly recommended in cotton breeding programs for selection purpose in a multivariate scenario.",

Computational intelligence and machine learning were notable for their ability to extract nonlinear information from model inputs. Predicting the relative contribution of auxiliary characteristics in rice through computational intelligence and machine learning proved to be efficient in determining the relative importance of variables in flood-irrigated rice. The characteristics indicated to assist in decision making are flowering, number of grains filled by panicles and length of panicles for this study.

The number of pods and seeds per plant, seed production, water use efficiency, shoot dry mass, root dry mass, and physiological parameters were evaluated. Seed production was higher during the mild season than during the hot season and increased linearly with increasing soil water availability. Photosynthetic activity and transpiration were higher during the hot season than during the mild season, with their reduction under a water availability of 25% regardless of the growing season. Total chlorophyll content decreased with excess water. Regardless of water availability, temperature was the most limiting climatic factor for cowpea performance. Cultivars Carijó, Itaim, and Tapahium exhibited a lower reduction in productive potential when grown in the hot season.",

The use of agricultural forecasting techniques is an alternative that has been gaining attention in rural areas. One way to manage and improve agricultural productivity is the use of technologies that allow the monitoring of production. The implementation of computational tools as software to aid processes, such as irrigation management, is gradually taking up space in the agricultural sector. In this light, herein, the present study aimed to develop a model using STELLA 8.0 software to estimate the growth and productivity of irrigated banana (Musa sp.). For this, the physiological processes and water demand were calculated using reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and culture evapotranspiration (ETc) in the first banana cycle for the climatic conditions of the Jaíba Project (Jaíba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil). The data of the climatic conditions were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology. It was verified that the average monthly ET0 was 5.78 mm day-1. In addition, the water requirement of the plant corresponded to a blade equivalent to 65% of ET0. The verified productivity was 8.93 t ha-1, which is considered adequate for the simulated conditions. The model responded efficiently to the proposed application and was characterized as a prognostic tool of reality through simplified representation.",

It aims at evaluating the effect of sidedressing nitrogen application, in common bean Pérola, under no-tillage system. The experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial scheme 6x2 with four dose (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 e 125 kg ha-1) and two sources (nitrate of ammonium and urea) of sidedressing nitrogen, with four replications. The evaluations were: full flowering, dry matter of the plants, nitrogen in shoot, production components, crop cycle and grain productivity. The common bean grain productivity is the same using nitrate of ammonium or urea as sidedressing nitrogen; the common bean grain productivity with irrigation in winter can be increased by sidedressing nitrogen. Therefore, the grain yield was affected by the application of nitrogen over 100 kg ha-1.",

The experiment was conducted in 2004, in Colorado, state of Paraná. Results showed that inoculation was an efficient technique in supplying nitrogen to the culture, when compared with the addition of mineral nitrogen. The “carioca” bean variety showed positive response to the inoculation with good levels of nodulation and yield. The increase of inoculation level did not result in nodulation and productivity gains, though the use of fungicide in the seed affected the productivity.",

Casing C was composed of 25% of vermiculite, 25% of coconut fiber and 50% of coarse sand. Temperature, relative humidity and pluviometric rates were monitored. The physical-chemical properties of the three casing soils were analyzed. The effect of the casing soil on the number and weight of the mushrooms, productivity, yield and biological efficiency of A. blazei were evaluated. The yield, productivity, biological efficiency and number of mushrooms were higher when using soil A. The highest productivity for soil A was attributed mainly to the physical characteristics, which were considered more appropriate for the cultivation, in addition to the high pluviometric rates and relative humidity. The productivity with soil A (9.62%) is comparable with the average productivity obtained in Brazil, meaning that the cultivation of A. blazei in this APA may have good perspectives for cultivation.",

It was possible to group, through RAPD, Brachiaria accesses and cultivars. The genetic variability index between species was considered low, and somewhat low when compared with autogamous species. B. brizantha showed the highest genetic variability and the lowest FST, which means that there is a higher intra specific genetic flux than the others.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to morpho-anatomically characterize nodular embryogenic calluses from zygotic embryos of peach palm during the induction of somatic embryogenesis. Immature zygotic embryos were pre-treated in MS medium added to Picloram and 2,4-D (25 &micro;M) and BAP (0, 5, 10 &micro;M). After three months, primary calluses were transferred to MS induction medium added to Picloram and 2,4-D (450 &micro;M). After six months, the embryogenic calluses were then histologically analyzed and cultivated in the maturation medium. The competent tissues of the zygotic embryos differentiated embryogenic calluses under action of both Picloram and 2,4-D auxins (450 &micro;M), where the presence of multi-granular structures were observed. Histological observations showed that in the nodular embryogenic calluses, the outlying parenchymal cells exhibit cellular characteristics of high mitotic activity. Differentiation of tracheal elements exists in embryogenic calluses connecting the callus to the explant. The evaluated cytokinin/auxin interaction influences the development of embryogenic calluses and globular structures.",

    "abstract": "The producers of green corn aim at the professionalization of their production, providing high-quality products and in sufficient quantity to supply the most demanding markets. To achieve this goal, management techniques must be adopted to provide high yields without negatively affecting commercial traits. Aiming at evaluate the aptitude of cultivars and plant population effect on green corn yield, an assay was carried out in Ponta Grossa, Paraná State. Randomized blocks in a split-plot scheme were adopted as the experimental design. Cultivars (Penta, 30P34, DKB 214 and SWB 551) were primary and plant populations (3.5, 5.0, 6.5, 8.0 and 9,5 plants m-2) were secondary treatments. Ear shape, length of unhusked ear, length of kernel set, diameter of husked ear, fresh weight of husked ear, kernel size, percentage of marketable husked ears, and number of marketable husked ears were characterized. The results demonstrated that 30P34, DKB 214, and SWB 551 are able to yield green ears and their higher yields are expected when grown in plant populations of 38,983, 59,866 and 43,591 plants ha-1, respectively. Increasing plant population negatively influences all evaluated ear traits, except shape. DKB 214 cultivar had higher percentage and number of marketable husked ears.",

The two varieties of yellow passion fruit showed susceptibility to F. solani. Only in the Afruvec variety, the presence of nematode resulted in increase of fusariosis. As for resistance to the phytonematode, the Maguary variety was classified as resistant in the presence or absence of Fusarium. In contrast, for the Afruvec variety, the presence of Fusarium resulted in reduction of resistance to the nematode, going from moderately resistant to susceptible.",

The experiment was conducted in a naturally infested field, by measuring pest infestation on roots, dry weight of plants (leaves + roots) and mortality during three years. V. rotundifolia cultivars showed a reduced infestation by the pest, a higher vigor and lower mortality when compared to 101-14 rootstock. All 101-14 plants were killed by the pest after the second year in the field. The cultivars Bountiful, Chief, Magoon, Magnolia and Regale had low pest infestation, showing antixenosis or antibiosis resistance. The Dixie cultivar showed a higher pest infestation; however, this was associated with high plant vigor, suggesting the existence of tolerance. The results show that V. rotundifolia cultivars Bountiful, Chief, Magoon, Magnolia and Regale showed a low infestation by E. brasiliensis and can be alternatives for direct fruit production or pest resistance source in plant breeding programs",

The objective of this work was to assess the potential antagonistic effect of yeast in dual-culture with filamentous fungi. Isolates of Debaryomyces hansenii (UFLACF 889 and UFLACF 847) and Pichia anomala (UFLACF 710 and UFLACF 951) species were inoculated (103 to 106 células mL-1) with three species of filamentous fungi, Aspergillus ochraceus, A. parasiticus and Penicillium roqueforti (103 to 106 spores mL-1). The assessment of mycelial growth and counting of spores was done for 21 days. It was observed that the isolated UFLA CF 889 attained, on average, the greatest inhibitory effect on the spore production of A. ochraceus (inhibition of 82%) and P. roqueforti (74%). The isolated UFLA CF 710 inhibited the spore production, on average, 60 and 75.6% of A. ochraceus and P. roqueforti, respectively. The fungus A. parasiticus was the most resistant to inhibition by yeasts. The mycelial growth was not inhibited by the presence of yeast in dual-culture. It could be concluded that yeast in dual-cultiure with filamentous fungi were able to inhibit the production of spores and potentially reduce the spread of this fungus during coffee processing.",

Installed in a Yellow Latosol with sandy/medium texture, the treatments consisted of plots (conventional and minimum tillage) and subplots (raw and burned sugarcane). Plant growth, contribution of organic matter and quantification of sugarcane yield were evaluated. The diameter was larger for minimum tillage, and tillering was greater for conventional tillage. The height and tillering were superior in the cut without burning. For stems productivity, the treatments did not present significant differences. The leaves were larger in minimum tillage and tips in unburned cane. The minimum tillage propitiates the increase in diameter initially and largest productivity of leaves in the crop. Tillering is favored by conventional tillage. The unburned cane did not present negative influence of straw in the regrowth. After 16 years of sugarcane cultivation with and without straw burning, it resulted in larger productivity of pointers increasing the productivity of the stems in unburned cane.",

(Caryocaraceae) and the effects of tree size, chemical and physical soil attributes, and floristic diversity in its attack. The wood-boring caterpillar of the trunck of C. brasiliense belongs to the family Cossidae (Lepidoptera). The number of pupae and the amount of sawdust produced by the wood-borer per tree was higher in the pasture 1 of Montes Claros and pasture in Ibiracatu than in the other four areas (pastures and savanna in Montes Claros and savanna in Ibiracatu). The number of pupae and the amount of sawdust was highest in the trunks of trees with diameters having a breast height (DBH) more than 30 cm. This may explain the severity of attack in the areas mentioned above, which contain a higher percentage of plants with DBH> 30 cm. The soil properties also positively associate with higher attack of the wood-borer on trees when the soil is rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, sum of bases, capacity of cationic exchange, and organic matter, while there was a negative correlation between attack and fine sand content. Systems with less floristic diversity, particularly trees of other species, may concentrate the attack of the wood-borer in the trunks of C. Brasiliense trees.",

At the end of 9 days of water deficit there were significant decreases in all the characteristics evaluated, independent of ABA application. This suggests that the main effect of ABA was to cause a reduction on gs which was accompanied of a reduction in A, only when the plants were submitted to the water deficit. There was no significant difference among the levels of water deficit tested in relation to the total flavonoid content in inflorescences. However, ABA restricted the flavonoids biosynthesis both in control plant and stressed plants.",

    "abstract": "Crambe is a promising crop for biodiesel production, mainly due to the high oil content of its seeds. However, there have been no effective methodologies for evaluating the physiological quality of crambe seeds. Seed lots have not been compared, especially by vigor tests, such as the accelerated aging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of high temperature and exposure periods on the physiological quality and enzymatic activity of crambe seeds during the accelerated aging test. Two lots of crambe seeds of the Brilhante cultivar were analyzed by tests of moisture content, weight of 1,000 seeds, germination, first count, electrical conductivity, enzymatic activity (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and seedling length. All tests were carried out before and after the accelerated aging, which evaluated different temperatures (38, 40 and 42ºC) and exposure periods (24, 48 and 72 hours). The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. Variance analysis and mean comparison through the Tukey and Dunnet tests (p ≤ 0.05) were applied for statistical analysis and means were also submitted to the linear correlation test. It was concluded that the interaction between temperature and exposure period affects the physiological quality and enzymatic activity of crambe seeds. We also conclude that the best conditions of temperature and exposure period for evaluating the physiological quality of crambe seeds through the accelerated aging test depend on genotype.",

A randomized block design with two replicates was used. The lateral and axial root lengths were measured using WinRhizo software. The analysis of deviance was calculated using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood/Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (REML/BLUP) method. Eighty microsatellite markers were used to genotype the estimation population. The Random Regression method was used to analyze the GWS (RR-BLUP/GWS) data. The gains per unit time of the GWS and the phenotypic selection method were compared, as the standard phenotypic selection methods were considered to be the Recurrent Selection. The GWS accuracy was higher than the phenotypic selection accuracy for all of the traits evaluated. Thus, the GWS method may significantly increase the genetic gains for root traits that are obtained in tropical maize breeding programs for nutritional stress conditions.",

Green manures were sown at two different times including the following: 60 days before transplanting of lettuce seedlings and simultaneous to transplanting of lettuce seedlings. N transfer was estimated using the natural 15N abundance method. It was observed that lettuce intercropped with green manures reached the same fresh mass of monocropped lettuce when the green manures were sown at the same time as the vegetables were planted. However, when the green manures were sown previously, the fresh mass of the monocropped lettuce was higher, and independent of the sowing time of green manures, the monocropped lettuce reached a higher dry mass. White lupin and cowpea transferred higher amounts of N regardless of sowing time, and the C:N ratio of white lupin to cowpea was lower compared to black oats. Intercropping with white lupin, cowpea and black oat transferred 18, 17 and 7% of N, respectively, to lettuce.",

Surprisingly, there are scarce research data available regarding the influence of Si on rice diseases in tropical lowland regions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of three silicon sources on rice yield and disease management. Three experiments were carried out from December 2005 to April 2006 at an experimental field area located in Formoso do Araguaia, Tocantins state, Brazil. Each experiment consisted of one silicon source (powder, granular or liquid) and the treatments consisted of six Si doses. All the treatments were performed in a completely randomized block design. The data presented in this study provide evidence that Si applications in Si-deficient soils of lowland regions, depending on the application source, dose and disease intensity, can decrease the severity of brown spot and the incidence of panicle blast. Calcium silicate effectively reduced the brown spot and the panicle blast, which resulted in an increased rice yield. In contrast, Ca and Mg silicate and potassium silicate did not show an efficient control of rice diseases nor an increase in productivity.",

This study investigated the effects of wounding, humidity, temperature, and inoculum concentration on the severity of corky dry rot under controlled conditions. Cantaloupe and honeydew melon types were inoculated by spraying conidial suspensions of three F. semitectum isolates. In all experiments, the tested F. semitectum isolates did not differ in relation to disease severity, but, the cantaloupe melon showed higher levels of severity. No lesions appeared on fruits that lacked wounds, and increasing wound age reduced lesion severity. Melons that were inoculated with F. semitectum developed symptoms regardless of the presence or absence of a moist chamber at the post-inoculation stage, but the lesions were larger under moist chamber conditions. There were no symptoms at 10°C, but a temperature increase from 15 to 25°C resulted in a disease severity increase. The largest lesions were observed when both melon types were inoculated with a concentration of 106 conidia mL-1, but even the lowest concentration (101 conidia mL-1) was sufficient for causing lesions. Injury reduction and/or the acceleration of melon healing, as well as environmental variable control and a reduction of inoculum sources, are essential to reducing corky dry rot severity.",

Analyses of adaptability and stability were carried out by the method of Eberhart and Russell. The parameters obtained for each genotype were submitted to the respective controllers. There were significant genotypes x environments interaction, which justified the necessity of performing an adaptability and stability analysis. For both controllers (Mamdani and Sugeno), seven lines presented general adaptability, while only one presented adaptability to unfavorable environments.

Therefore, the present study was designed to survey insecticide resistance and the associated likelihood of control failure among boll weevil populations in the region. Ten insect populations were sampled during the 2016/2017 season and subjected to time-mortality (contact) bioassays in glass vials impregnated with dried insecticide residues at their respective label rates. The three insecticides most frequently used in the region were surveyed: the organophosphate malathion and the pyrethroids beta-cyfluthrin and zeta-cypermethrin. The survival curves showed estimates of the respective median survival time (LT50) for each combination of insecticide and insect copulation. However, there were no significant differences in susceptibility among populations. The estimates of control failure likelihood for each compound at their respective label rates also indicated negligible risk of control failure with their use. These findings are consistent with time-mortality results indicating the lack of insecticide resistant populations at the surveyed sampling sites, suggesting that the reported field control failures result from other causes such as problems with insecticide application.",

The hybrids were produced from crosses involving the following progenitors: 'Toyonoka' x 'Sweet Charlie', 'Camino Real' x 'Sweet Charlie', 'Oso Grande' x 'Sweet Charlie', 'Oso Grande' x 'Toyonoka', 'Dover' x 'Oso Grande', and 'Camino Real' x 'Toyonoka'. Fourteen genotypes were randomly sampled for each hybrid combination and evaluated. The results showed that the genetic profiles of the hybrids from each test cross were very diverse, most likely due to the high heterozygosity of the genome of each progenitor involved, which might indicate the presence of adequate genetic diversity among the hybrids to allow for the selection of new cultivars with agronomic traits that are more suitable to environmental conditions in Brazil.",

The loss of DT was characterized in germinated seeds with increasing radicle lengths (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm) when subjected to dehydration in silica gel, followed by rehydration. To re-establish DT, the germinated seeds were incubated for 72h in polyethylene glycol (PEG, -2.04 MPa) with or without ABA (100 μM) before dehydration in silica gel. Cell viability was assessed by seedling survival, and DNA integrity was evaluated by gel electrophoresis. Seeds with 1 mm radicle length survived dehydration to the original moisture content (MC) of the dry seed (approximately 10%). PEG treatment was able to re-establish DT, at least partially, with 2, 3 and 4 mm but not in 5 mm radicle lengths. Germinated seeds treated with PEG+ABA performed better than those treated only with PEG, and DT was re-established even in germinated seeds with a 5 mm radicle length. Among the PEG-treated germinated seeds dehydrated to 10% MC, DNA integrity was maintained only in those with a 1 mm radicle length.",

Increasing barium doses and two redox potential conditions were evaluated. The geochemical fractionation data demonstrated that reducing conditions led to an increase in the levels of more labile forms of barium and a reduction in more stable forms. Furthermore, higher doses of barium were found to have a negative impact on grain production. The highest levels of barium accumulation in the leaves, roots, and grains were observed with the highest barium dose under reducing conditions. These results demonstrate that reducing conditions increased barium bioavailability and absorption by rice plants.",

    "abstract": "Castor bean crops are agriculturally relevant due to the quality and versatility of their oil, both for the chemical industry and for biodiesel production. Proper weed management is important for both the cultivation and the yield of castor bean crops; therefore, the intention of the present work is to review pertinent information regarding weed management, including the studies regarding weed interference periods, chemical controls for use in different crop production systems and herbicide selectivity, for castor bean crops. Weed science research for castor bean crops is scarce. One of the main weed management challenges for castor bean crops is the absence of herbicides registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MALFS). Research for viable herbicides for weed control in castor bean crops should be directed by research and/or rural extension institutions, associations and farmers cooperatives, as well as by manufactures, for the registration of these selective herbicides, which would be primarily used to control eudicotyledons in castor bean crops. New studies involving the integration of weed control methods in castor bean also may increase the efficiency of weed management, for both small farmers using traditional crop methods in the Brazilian Northeast region, as well as for areas with the potential for large scale production, using conservation tillage systems, such as the no-tillage crop production system.",

The study was conducted in four commercial fields in the North of Paraná State, Brazil, during the wheat crop season of 2009. Two transects were surveyed parallel to the edge of the forest at two distances: 25 (\"near\") and 525 meters (\"far\") from the edge. The abundance of hoverflies was compared using a χ2 test (p ≤ 0.05). In total, 1,845 hoverflies adults were collected, which represented 15 species and three genera. The most abundant species was Allograpta exotica (60.43%), followed by Toxomerus dispar (17.78%) and Toxomerus watsoni (7.26%) (Diptera: Syrphidae). An important inference was that all fields showed a higher abundance of aphidophagous hoverflies closer to the edge of the forest (25 m) during the wheat tillering stage. The initial abundance of aphidophagous hoverflies in wheat fields is likely greater near the edge because of the availability of resources in the surrounding forest that enhance hoverfly survival during periods of low aphid infestation.",

Treatments consisted of four concentrations (0, 0.28, 0.55, and 0.83 g pot-1) of silicon applied as a silicic acid solution 1%. This solution was applied around the stem of the plants (drenched), with the first application being administered 15 days after transplanting. In total, three applications were made at intervals of 15 days. After the last application, the plants were subjected to chemical analysis to determine the silicon concentration and to X-ray microanalysis and flow cytometry. Phytotechnical analyses were performed during the applications. The use of silicon in concentrations of 0.28 and 0.55 g pot-1 provides better growth of the passion fruit, and the absorption and deposition of the silicon in the passion fruit leaves are proportional to the availability of this element in the plant. The roots of the passion fruit plant are silicon accumulators, and the DNA stability and amount are preserved in the silicon-treated passion fruit plants.",

To this end, an F1 population derived from the hybridization of divergent parents with 500 individuals genotyped with 1000 SNP-type markers was simulated. Phenotypic traits were determined by adopting three different gene action models – additive, additive-dominant, and epistatic, representing two dominance situations: partial and complete with quantitative traits having a heritability (h2) of 30 and 60%; traits were controlled by 50 loci, considering two alleles per locus. Twelve different scenarios were represented in the simulation. The stepwise regression was used before the prediction methods. The reliability and the root mean square error were used for estimation using a fivefold cross-validation scheme. Overall, dimensionality reduction improved the reliability values for all scenarios, specifically with h2 =30 the reliability value from 0.03 to 0.59 using RBFNN and from 0.10 to 0.57 with RR-BLUP in the scenario with additive effects. In the additive dominant scenario, the reliability values changed from 0.12 to 0.59 using RBFNN and from 0.12 to 0.58 with RR-BLUP, and in the epistasis scenarios, the reliability values changed from 0.07 to 0.50 using RBFNN and from 0.06 to 0.47 with RR-BLUP. The results showed that the use of stepwise regression before the use of these techniques led to an improvement in the accuracy of prediction of the genetic value and, mainly, to a large reduction of the root mean square error in addition to facilitating processing and analysis time due to a reduction in dimensionality.",

Thus, studies that provide information on topics in strawberry growth are important and must be constantly updated. The aims of this study were to fit a logistic growth model to describe strawberry fruit production and to estimate the partial derivatives of the fitted model in order to estimate and interpret the critical points, in addition to using multivariate analyses. To do this, data on 16 treatments [combinations of two cultivars (Albion and Camarosa), two origins (national and imported), and four mixed organic substrates (70% crushed sugar cane residue + 30% organic compost, 70% crushed sugar cane residue + 30% commercial substrate, 70% burnt rice husk + 30% organic compost, and 70% burnt rice husk + 30% commercial substrate)] conducted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates were used. A logistic model was fitted to the accumulated fruit production stratified by treatment and replication. Partial derivatives related to the accumulated thermal sum were estimated in order to quantify the critical points of the model. Subsequently, a principal component analysis was performed. The results show that the use of growth models substantially increases the inferences that can be made about crop growth, and the multivariate analysis summarizes this information, simplifying its interpretation. Approaches such as those carried out in this study are still rarely used, but, compared to simpler models, they increase the amount of inferences that can be made and provide greater elucidation of the results.",

Considering parameters higher alcohols and aldehydes, cachaça produced by pure culture of S. cerevisiae was similar to cachaça produced by mixed culture. Cachaça produced by mixed culture showed high values of volatile acidity (letter 'b'-Tukey test) being characterized by this parameters in the principal component analysis. High percentage of acceptance (81.10%) for the attribute aroma was observed in samples from cachaça produced by mixed culture.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the thermodynamic properties of the process of water sorption in forage turnip seeds. The equilibrium moisture content of forage turnip seeds was determined by the gravimetric-dynamic method for different values of temperature and water activity. According to the results, increasing the moisture content increases the energy required for the evaporation of water in forage turnip seeds, and the values of integral isosteric heat of desorption, within the moisture content range of 3.33 to 11.30 (% d.b.), varies from 4,222.70 to 2,870.34 kJ kg-1. With the elevation in the equilibrium moisture content, there is an increase in differential entropy and Gibbs free energy, which has positive values, demonstrating non-spontaneity in the process of desorption in the seeds. The theory of enthalpy-entropy compensation can be satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon, and the process of water desorption of forage turnip seeds is controlled by enthalpy.",

The initial tillering, leaf area index, stalk and sugar yield in the cane ratoon benefit from the application of filter cakes and soluble phosphate in the planting furrow. The best combination is filter cakes at a dose between 1.0 and 2.0 mg ha-1 with 100 to 200 kg ha-1 soluble phosphate applied at planting.

The period of flowering and harvesting of the yellow pitaya was determined according to the phenological stage records. Flowering began in the spring, with successive flowering events until the autumn. The time between floral button formation until anthesis ranged from 46 to 55 days. The time from flower fertilisation until fruit ripening ranged from 96 to 110 days. Fruit harvest began in the summer and ended in winter. The reproductive cycle of S. megalanthus is longer than H. undatus and H. polyrhizus, which are also cultivated in Brazil, ranging from 147 to 166 days from floral button formation to fruit harvest.",

The fruits were harvested in the municipality of Cantá, Roraima State, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three replications, in a factorial arrangement consisting of three different maturation stages (immature, semi-mature and mature) and eight days of storage (3 x 8). The fruits were analysed every day regarding total vitamin C, carotenoids, anthocyanins, flavonoids, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH). According to the results obtained, the interaction of maturation stages x eight days of storage had a significant effect according to the F test at 5% probability. The highest antioxidant activity (FRAP) was observed in the fruits harvested in the semi-mature stage, providing a longer shelf life. The carotenoid pigment, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and vitamin C contents were higher in the fruits harvested in the mature stage, and this stage was the most suitable for obtaining these functional biocompounds. Additionally, in mature fruits, the highest mean content of total phenolics and antioxidant activity (DPPH) were observed during storage. It was concluded that the mature stage is the most recommended for the extraction of pigments and antioxidant biocompounds from camu-camu fruits.",

The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions with 4 treatments: field capacity (FC), water deficit (WD), field capacity + KNO3 (FC + KNO3), and water deficit + KNO3 (WD + KNO3). Two foliar applications of 3% (m/v) KNO3 were made, the first on day zero of stress and the second on the fifth day. All analyses were performed after 12 days of stress (end of stress). Foliar application of KNO3 to irrigated plants led to increases in relative chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and carboxylation efficiency. It also induced increases in leaf concentrations of P, Mg, S, Cu, and Fe, in addition to height growth. Under water deficit conditions, plants treated with KNO3 presented higher relative chlorophyll content, leaf area, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, carboxylation efficiency, and higher levels of P, K, Mg, S, Cu, and Fe than those not treated with KNO3. The morphometry of the root system was not altered by the treatments. In addition, plants treated with KNO3 under water deficit conditions showed higher growth and a grain yield 32.2% higher than those that did not receive KNO3. These results demonstrated that KNO3 applied to the leaves induced water deficit tolerance in sorghum plants subjected to severe water stress at pre-flowering.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the different patterns of nutrient absorption and allocation related to the rootstock in ‘BRS Rubimel’ peach plants by analyzing growth variables during the post-graft period. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks in a 3 × 3 factorial scheme, with three peach rootstock varieties (i.e., ‘Flordaguard’, ‘Capdeboscq’, and ‘Okinawa Roxo’) and three post-graft evaluation periods (i.e., 30, 60, and 90 days after the start of budding), corresponding to a total of nine treatments, with three replications, each including five plants. During the three evaluation periods, morphological growth characteristics were measured, and the macronutrient content was determined in the different plant organs (i.e., leaf, stem, and roots). The nutrient content in plants of the ‘BRS Rubimel’ peach plants was influenced by the rootstock. Despite showing greater N use efficiency, ‘Capdeboscq’ accumulated a large part of this nutrient in the roots, using it for root growth, which resulted in a smaller scion diameter compared to that of ‘Flordaguard’. Comparing the three rootstocks and the evaluated variables, it seems that ‘Flordaguard’ can be used as a rootstock for the ‘BRS Rubimel’ peach plants, as it induces a greater scion diameter as well as the uniform allocation of dry matter between organs during the post-graft period, hence ensuring greater initial plant vigor.",

Additionally, the enzymatic activity of the substrate enriched with AMF and biochar was analyzed. The experiment consisted of the control (absence of the mycorrhizal community) and four biochar proportions (0, 3, 6, and 9% of the volume of the container) coinoculated with AMF. Plantlets produced on substrates enriched with AMF showed higher levels of polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins in the tissues analyzed than control plantlets. The combination of AMF and 9% biochar increased the content of total flavonoids in the leaves of strawberry plantlets and increased the activity of phosphatase. The substrate with up to 6% biochar and mycorrhizae showed increased β-glucosidase activity. In conclusion, mycorrhizae are excellent tools to improve the phytochemical quality of strawberry plantlets acclimatized ex vitro. The association between host plants, mycorrhizal symbionts, and bioactivators of these fungi potentiates properties beneficial to health, which can be exploited efficiently in sustainable agriculture.",

Then, the seeds were harvested and evaluated for physiological potential, antioxidative enzymes, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, proteins, and protease activity. The simulated rainfall allowed the variation in seed moisture, promoting a significant reduction in germination and seed vigor, especially at 120 and 180 mm levels. There were also reductions in antioxidative enzyme activity with weathering deterioration (mainly for catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and peroxidase), accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde, and reductions in protein content and protease activity. The proposed rainfall system is efficient in inducing weathering deterioration during the pre-harvest phase and its deleterious effects.

    "abstract": "Purslanes are frequently used in Brazil as potted plants and for landscaping because of their beautiful colored flowers. Despite their commercial importance, the genetic diversity within ornamental purslane remains largely unknown. Thus, a complete characterization of ornamental purslane resources is essential for its utilization since genetic variability is indispensable for the efficient development of new cultivars. This study aimed to evaluate genetic variability and recommend accessions to start a genetic breeding program for purslane (Portulaca umbraticola). Twenty purslane accessions were collected in public places in Areia City and Santa Rita City, Paraiba State, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. An entirely randomized experimental design with 20 accessions and 5 replicates was utilized. Plants were evaluated for quantitative and qualitative traits. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and grouped by Scott–Knott’s criteria (p ≤ 0.05). The accessions were grouped using Tocher’s method based on the generalized Mahalanobis distance. Principal component analysis was also used to analyze the genetic divergence. There were significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) for all evaluated traits except for internode distance, plant height, and leaf length. The Scott–Knott criteria clustered the accessions into two groups for all traits except days to flowering (five groups). Tocher’s grouping based on Mahalanobis distance allowed the accessions to be separated into eight clusters. The genetic diversity observed in this study was supported by the consonance between the Tocher cluster method and the PC analyses. The traits that most contributed to genetic divergence among accessions were days to flowering (70.37%), flower length (6.10%), leaf width (3.89%), branch number (3.57%), and stem length (3.36%). Considering the criteria for use in outdoor spaces, wider plants with several large colored flowers, thicker stems, greener leaves, and earliness were interesting. Accessions 5, 7, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 20 should be selected as parents for further breeding programs. However, if the objective is to produce potted plants, dwarf plants with bigger leaves are desired, and accession 1 should be selected. This will create greater variability in segregating populations, which will increase the overall quality of ornamental use of this species. For those accessions with no reproductive verticils but with other excellent attributes, for example, high chlorophyll content breeding strategies, such as induced mutations or protoplast fusion, can be used.",

Cowpea was cultivated after desiccation of the cover crops. Most of the straw favored soil particle aggregation, except for C. juncea and SV, which negatively influenced this variable. Basal soil respiration, organic carbon content, potassium, base saturation, geometric mean diameter, macroaggregates, and macroporosity at layer of 0-0.10 m were the most sensitive indicators for improving soil quality in a savanna environment. UBS, UBCJI, and UBCEI were superior to the other treatments in improving soil quality. Almost all treatments increased cowpea yield by up to 29%, except for CJS and SV.",

Selection indexes are considered the best option to perform genotype selection when many different traits are being considered to select genotypes as close to the desired ideotype as possible. Therefore, this study aimed at selecting late blight-resistant tomato families based on their fruit quality attributes using factor analysis and ideotype-design / best linear unbiased predictor (FAI-BLUP) index. For this purpose, we assessed the fruit quality parameters of 81 F3:5 tomato families previously selected as late blight resistant. The tomato cultivars Thaise, Argos, and Liberty were included in the trial as checks. The experimental arrangement consisted of complete randomized blocks with three replicates. Each plot was formed by five plants, three of which were used in the fruit quality assessment. The quality parameters assessed were fruit diameter, fruit length, fruit color (L, a*, C, and H), fruit firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solids content, hydrogen potential, and SS:TA ratio. Fruit quality data were analyzed using the mixed model methodology via REML/BLUP (restricted residual maximum likelihood / best linear unbiased prediction) to obtain BLUPs that were further subjected to the FAI-BLUP selection index. The FAI-BLUP was efficient in selecting late blight-resistant tomato genotypes based on their fruit quality attributes. Fourteen tomato families were classified as closest to the desirable ideotype for fruit quality. These genotypes should move on to the following stages of the tomato breeding program.",

    "abstract": "The intensive cropping and soil tillage in unsuitable conditions can change its physical characteristics and organic matter content in variable degrees according to its nature. Depending on the intensity of these alterations, they can lead to limit conditions to plant growth and yield. In addition, huge amount of soil is lost by runoff. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical alterations of a red latosol under savanna vegetation submitted to different use and management. A completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 10 replicates was used. The treatments, use and managements were: no-tillage, conventional system, minimum tillage, native vegetation (savanna), pasture, and rubber-tree crop. The following physical attributes were evaluated: bulk density, soil porosity and soil penetration resistance at 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m depth and organic matter. All soil use and management caused degradation of soil physical properties as compared to the native vegetation system. The management and use applied were attested through the increase of bulk density, soil penetration resistance, microporosity and reduction of the macroporosity, total porosity and organic matter. The minimum tillage was the best management system when compared to the native vegetation system. The former showed lower soil penetration resistance and bulk density values as well as higher porosity and organic matter content. Pasture and rubber-tree crop system were the least efficient in maintaining the soil quality.",

    "abstract": "The soil nitrogen (N) losses in gaseous form depend on their intrinsic characteristics and also on the environmental conditions. In soils with the same texture class, the mineralogy of the clay size fraction and the amount of organic matter are the main factors that may affect the N dynamics. In the State of Paraná northerner region, variations in these characteristics are found in the toposequence of soils derived from basalts where, in the landscape upper part, highly weathered soils, such as the Latosols, are found and, in the other sections, younger soils, such as Neosols and eventually Vertisols, are found. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the N volatilization losses from ammonia, using three clayey soils (Red Dystroferric Latosol-LVdf, Litholic Neosol-RL and Ortic Hydromorphic Vertisol-VGo) submitted to two soil moisture contents (S8 and SS) and treated with urea. The ammonia volatilization of the applied urea was evaluated in 2000cm3 plastic recipients that received 500g of soil and 200mg of urea, for an accumulative period of 10 days. Paper filter collectors, previously humidified with H2SO4 measured the N-NH3 losses, which were placed 5cm above the soil surface. The results showed that the soils presented differences in the ammonia losses, related to the initial soil moisture contents and the mineralogy of the clay size fraction. In the lower moisture treatment (S8) the least weathered soils (RL and VGo) showed the lowest ammonia losses, due to the higher percentages of 2:1 clay type minerals. In the soil-saturated treatment the N-NH3 losses were not statistically significant among the soils",

Thus, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of organic and mineral fertilization on corn yield and on physical and chemical characteristics of a red-yellow argisoil. The treatments were constituted of four doses (0, 10, 20 and 40 m3 ha-1) of organic matter, two ways of organic matter distribution (by throwing and in the groove) and three doses of NPK fertilization (0, 250 and 500 kg ha-1) with the 04-14-08 formulation, combined in the factorial scheme of the treatments (4x2x3) with four replications using the randomized blocks design. The organic fertilization promoted an increasing of the corn yield compounds. The organic matter with the dose of 40 m3 ha-1 presented similar production with the dose of 500 kg ha-1 of the NPK fertilizer. The association of organic matter and mineral fertilization, as well as the way of distribution, had no effect on the crop yield. The mineral fertilizer reduced the size of soil aggregates and the levels of calcium, magnesium and potash, and increased the phosphorous level in the soil. The organic fertilizer increased the levels of organic carbon, calcium, magnesium, potash and phosphorous in the soil. The mineral and organic fertilization did not interfered on the real density, apparent density and on the total porosity of the soil.",

Twenty days after corn emergence (DAE), the herbicides (nicosulfuron and atrazine) were applied in order to minimize the competition between the intercropped species, and fertilization as topdressing occurred at 25 DAE. Corn nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chlorophyll contents were assessed, as well as one thousand kernels' yield and weight. B. brizantha biomass and mineral composition were measured at the corn harvest 50 days after harvest (DAC), and 40 days after B. brizantha graze period (DAP). An increase in chlorophyll and organic N contents, yield and weight of the thousand-corn-kernels sample was verified, proportional to the N doses increase. When the 120 kg ha-1 N proportion was applied in the sole crop and intercrop, no difference was observed among the characteristics. N doses increase engendered a larger forage production and organic N content in the B. brizantha shoots.",

The energetic efficiency was obtained performing the ratio between the total amounts of energy outputs and inputs during the productive process. Results indicated that the expenses with harvest and transport and the intensive use of nitrogen in the corn, in the two years of production, contributed for the increase of energy consumption, and a decrease of the energetic efficiency.",

The assays were conducted at the Cazarotto Farm, located in the Iguatemi District, municipal district of Maringá, Paraná State, in a HAPLOTOX Soil. Two experiments were set up: the first using a seeder with a horizontal plate distribution mechanism, and the second using a seeder with pneumatic-type mechanism. A split-plot design was used, with four replications. The main treatments were: soil covering conditions (spontaneous vegetation, desiccated black oat, and desiccated + rolled black oat); and the secondary treatments were the forward speeds (horizontal plate: 4.74, 5.41, 6.47 and 7.24 km h-1; and pneumatic: 5.56, 8.04 and 10.21 km h-1). With the increase in speed, the plant population and the percentage of acceptable spacings were reduced, and the recommended plant population was not reached by either seeder. The pneumatic mechanism obtained better results than the horizontal plate. The yield was larger where smaller populations were obtained, influenced by the water deficit.",

Sweet potato was grown at Marechal Cândido Rondon, Paraná State (24º33’40”S and 54º04’12”W), at a mean annual temperature between 14 and 28ºC. The experiment was designed in complete randomized blocks, in a factorial scheme of 4 cultivars (CNPH 003, CNPH 004, Brazlândia Roxa, and Brazlândia Rosada) and 2 cultivation periods (115 and 183 days), with four repetitions. The evaluated parameters were the root productivities (t ha-1) and the physical and chemical root composition (humidity, pH, acidity, starch, total soluble sugars and fibers). Data was submitted to an analysis of variance (Anova) and the means were compared by the Tukey test at 5% of probability. Results indicated that sweet potato yield at the cultivars was higher during the 183 day cultivation period (average of 9.14 t ha-1) than during the 115 day cultivation period (average of 4.25 t ha-1). Thus the CNPH 003 cultivar seems to be a better indication for starch extraction, due to the lowest fiber content in the root, the driest mass content and the largest yield of starch per area",

Treatments were established in two management systems (conventional and no-tillage), two doses of gypsum (zero and 2 t ha-1) and the use of two summer crops (soybean and corn). Aggregates were collected, in depths of 0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm, using, in experimental proceedings, those held in diameter intervals of 9.52 and 4.76 mm, after sieving in a standard sieve set. For collecting aggregates, 40 x 40 cm trenches were opened and sieving was done in the field. Aggregate analyses were done by digital images obtained by scanner (300 dpi) of 60 aggregates arranged in a tray with untidy holes in order to preserve the principle of randomization. Images were later analyzed using the QUANTPORO program, and the analyzed characteristics of the aggregates were the area and its inter-relation with chemical attributes of the soil. The results demonstrated that no-tillage promoted the formation of larger aggregates; soybean as summer culture contributed to that structural effect in the soil; and the application of gypsum increased the aggregation in larger depths.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish super-traits for simultaneous selection of variables related to fruit yield and quality in full-sibs and/or half-sib families of yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa). The Design I of Comstock and Robinson was used, in random blocks with three replications, to evaluate 113 families and 11 variables. Three super-traits were determined by factor analysis: fruit size (TF), productivity (PROD) and industry yield (RI). Signals of factorial charge reflected the true sense of selection in passion fruit breeding programs for most original variables. Genetic variability was detected at the hierarchical levels of male parent and female parent within the male parent for the super-traits TF, PROD and for the respective original variables that represented it. There was no variability in super-trait RI since it was absent in the variables that represented it. Genetic gains were obtained in the desired sense in the determinant variables of the super-traits fruit size and productivity. Consequently, these can be employed in the simultaneous selection of traits related to fruit size and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Farmers use non-selective herbicides, such as glyphosate, in directed applications to control weeds in coffee crops. Despite the precautions used during the application of herbicides, there are usually reports of poisoning in plantation areas. Moreover, it is fundamental to understand the effects of glyphosate on photosynthetic processes. The present study aimed to evaluate the characteristics associated with the photosynthetic activity in coffee cultivars subjected to doses of glyphosate. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using three varieties of coffee (Coffea arabica), including Acaiá (MG-6851), Catucaí Amarelo (2 SL) and Topázio (MG-1190), and three subdoses of glyphosate (0.0, 115.2 and 460.8 g ha-1) in a 3 x 3 factorial scheme. Herbicide application led to reduced internal carbon, ratio between internal and environmental carbon, carbon consumption and photosynthetic rate at 15 days after application (DAA) in the fourth leaf. In the same leaf at 45 DAA, the carbon consumption of the cultivars was even less. Despite low carbon concentrations, no difference in consumption and photosynthetic rate was observed in the last leaf. Glyphosate caused metabolic damage with transitory effects on the photosynthetic rate; the Acaiá cultivar was the most tolerant. These transitory effects may result in irreversible and prolonged damage to crop growth.",

We evaluated the number of days from emergence to flowering, number of days from flowering to physiological maturity and number of days from emergence to physiological maturity in relation to the genotypes' cycle. The aerial plant architecture characteristics evaluated were the growth habit, plant habit, plant height, stem diameter, height of the first pod insertion and number of nodes on the main stem. Trail analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the emergence-to-flowering period and yield and that the emergence-physiological maturity; flowering-physiological maturity showed a negative correlation to the yield in both locations. Therefore, short-cycle genotypes, especially those with a reduced post-flowering period, produced increased yields. The aerial plant architecture characteristics showed phenotypic and genotypic positive correlations with the yield in both environments. To increase yield, the reproductive period needs to coincide with periods of the greatest photosynthetically active radiation.",

The morphological traits of the conidial stages, such as the presence of fibrosin bodies and a germinative tube, were used to identify the species. Leaves exhibiting high severity of powdery mildew were collected from plants of 13 plastic greenhouses during different seasons in 2003/2004 and in different regions of Paraná State. In all environments, a significant prevalence of P. xanthii (80-100%) was observed affecting parthenocarpic or ordinary cucumber and melon.

Furthermore, mineral nutrition plays an important role in the induction of organogenic responses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of boron and calcium in the organogenesis of nodal segments from seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis growing under in vitro conditions. The concentration of boron and calcium in MS medium was modified to induce organogenic responses in 45-day-old nodal segments used as explants. After 60 days, the fresh weight, dry weight, ratio of fresh and dry weight, relative water content and relative matter content accumulated by the explants were evaluated. The concentrations of boron and calcium in the culture medium influenced the in vitro organogenic control of Eucalyptus grandis. Reduced combinations of boron and calcium induced callus formation and dry matter accumulation in the explants. A boron concentration of 100% (1.10 mg L-1) combined with 100% (119.950 mg L-1) and 200% (239.900 mg L-1) of calcium, and 200% (2.20 mg L-1) of boron combined with 100% (119.950 mg L-1) of calcium allowed the induction of well-developed buds, which can be used for the regeneration of micro-plants.",

Moreover, the areas whose soils contained higher levels of aluminum and clay had a higher percentage of healthy C. brasiliense trees and branches. Smaller percentages of live and healthy trees and healthy branches were noted in areas with higher floristic diversity. Overall, the higher mortality of C. brasiliense trees may be associated with a higher pH and a lower content of aluminum, silt and clay, with competition with other tree species for nutrients, water and light, with the attack of Cossidae and particularly with the attack of fungi, Phomopsis sp.",

The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized 5 x 5 x 5 factorial design using five explant types (whole leaves, half leaves; petiole; nodal segments and root segments) from in vitro plantlets; five auxins: indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (Picloram); at five concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 µM), with five replications using five Petri dishes. The cultures were maintained in a growth room at 25 ± 2ºC in the dark. The explant type was investigated for the induction of somatic embryogenesis in anthurium cv. Eidibel, and nodal segments were shown to be the most suitable explant for this process. After 60 days in culture, the highest number of embryogenic calli was recorded for the nodal segments cultured in NAA (5, 7.5 and 10 µM), 2,4-D (10 µM) and Picloram (7.5 and 10 µM). The histological analysis confirmed the presence of embryos with established polarization, procambium, ground meristem and protoderm in the nodal segments cultured in Pierik medium containing 10 µM NAA. After the conversion of the somatic embryos into plantlets, these plantlets were acclimatized transferred to in vivo conditions and grown into normal plants.",

For each of the 80 experimental plots, the optimum plot size (Xo) was estimated by the method of maximum curvature of the coefficient of variation model. The number of replicates for each genotype and the means were estimated through the use of 10 plants per plot, combined with Xo plants per plot. The optimum plot size for the assessment of properties in yellow passion fruits independent of genotype is less than five plants, as the number of replicates is a function of the desired magnitude of accuracy. The number of plants per experiment is lower when using Xo plants per plot.",

Arundina graminifolia is a terrestrial orchid that produces attractive flowers, and, although the species could be a potential candidate for the floriculture market, its considerable height makes it difficult to transport and commercialize. A number of plant growth regulators have been utilized to control plant height in ornamentals and other species. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of growth regulators, paclobutrazol and chlormequat chloride on the vegetative development of containerized A. graminifolia orchid aiming at height control. Paclobutrazol (Cultar) was applied at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1, and CCC (Cycocel) was applied at 0, 2000, 4000, and 6000 mg L-1. The plants were assessed monthly for the plant height and number of shoots per container. CCC had no effect on the final height of plants at the concentrations applied. In contrast, paclobutrazol was effective in controlling plant height at a concentration of 5 mg L-1, but higher concentrations (10 and 20 mg L-1) proved to be toxic to the plants, causing death to the new shoots. Paclobutrazol at lower concentrations offers a viable means for height control in A. graminifolia.",

This work evaluated aphid control and the ability of products to prevent aphid infestation using natural insecticides compared to a standard synthetic insecticide. The control trial was conducted with four products [Beauveria bassiana (Boveril&amp;reg;), neem oil (Neemseto®), and cotton seed oil compared to thiamethoxam (Actara®)], and untreated plants served as the control group. The trial testing the efficacy of these products in preventing aphid infestation was conducted using the same products, excluding Boveril®. The evaluations were conducted 72 and 120h post-treatment for the efficacy and the protection against colonization trials, respectively. The aphid control by cotton seed oil, Neemseto®, and thiamethoxam was similar, with 100% control being achieved on the thiamethoxam-treated plants. Regarding the plant protection against aphid colonization, the insecticide thiamethoxam exhibited a better performance compared to the other tested products with steady results over the evaluation period. The natural products exhibited variable results with low protection against plant colonization throughout the evaluation period.",

From these data, we estimated the mean and variance of the genetic components by employing the weighted least squares method. The estimated number of genes and broad- and narrow-sense heritabilities were also obtained. It was concluded that rust resistance is a characteristic controlled by 2 to 23 genes that are predominantly dominant. The estimate of narrow-sense heritability was greater than 70% for the Caiapônia x IAC-100 cross, and the wide-sense heritability was greater than 60% for the Luziânia x Potenza cross; thus, it is possible to successfully select resistant individuals in early generations.",

In this study, we investigated the variation in P uptake by different cotton cultivars grown in savannah soil. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using a fully factorial 2 x 17 randomized design with two P treatments (low P = 20 mg kg-1 and high P = 120 mg kg-1) and 17 cotton cultivars. The plants were potted in Acrisol soil labeled with radioisotope 32P. There was genetic variation in the P use efficiency among the cotton cultivars. The P treatments significantly influenced the dry weight of shoots (DWS), P accumulation, the specific activity of 32P, and the L-value (both the standardized and L-values discounted the P present in the cottonseed). Hierarchical clustering analysis classified the cotton cultivars into distinct, internally homogeneous clusters. Our results suggest that cotton cultivars could be selected to maximize P absorption efficiency in conditions of low plant-available P. The cultivars FMT 523, FM 910 and CNPA GO 2043 were the most responsive to P fertilization, while Barbadense 01, FM 966LL, IPR Jataí, BRS Aroeira and BRS Buriti were most efficient at absorbing plant-available P.",

Analyses of the following traits were performed: fruit yield, mean fruit weight, pulp thickness, pulp firmness and soluble solids content. A complex portion of the GxE interaction was predominantly detected for all traits. The recommendation in this case is to promote selection in each environment. Alternatively, selection based on the average behavior of the inbred lines is the strategy that generates the greatest gains, approaching those obtained through direct selection in each specific environment. The selection indexes aimed at reducing the expression of all traits proved to be best for both locations. The index constructed for Baraúna allowed the selection of a greater number of inbred lines with a higher yield potential and better quality fruit and, thus, greater efficiency.",

The values of the physical properties throughout the sub-basin were predicted and mapped. Thematic maps were generated and showed a relation to each other: the clay was related to a higher hydraulic conductivity, higher porosity and lower soil density. In the steeper areas, the greater silt contents were mapped in the deeper layers and indicated the thin thickness of horizon B in these areas. A close relation of the curvature with the soil thickness was detected and was greater in the flat areas with less slope.

An experiment was conducted in Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil, with six precrops treatments: fallow, ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis), showy rattlebox (Crotalaria spectabilis), corn (Zea mays) without or with 80 kg ha−1 of N at topdressing as urea, and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Subplots consisted of two levels of N fertilization at soybean sowing: 0 and 30 kg ha−1 of N as ammonium nitrate at sowing. Urochloa ruziziensis as precrops increased the soybean yield (5,171 kg ha-1) when compared with corn (4,346 kg ha-1) and fallow (4,467 kg ha-1). In 2016/17, N fertilization of soybean with 30 kg ha−1 of N at sowing, although increasing the initial plant growth (745 kg ha-1 with vs. 662 kg ha-1 without), impairs nodulation (100 mg pl-1 with vs. 130 g pl-1 without) and does not increase grain yield.

The first factor consisted of equitable amounts of biomass mixtures of hairy woodrose and roostertree at doses of 20, 35, 50, and 65 t ha−1 on a dry basis, and the second factor of coriander population densities of 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 thousand plants ha−1, intercropped with 500 thousand plants ha−1 of radish. The characteristics evaluated in both crops were pH, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), SS/TA ratio, total soluble sugars (TSS) and vitamin C content (vitamin C), and the chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents were also evaluated in coriander.

    "abstract": "Breeding wheat for production in the Brazilian Cerrado region should aim at developing productive genotypes adapted to heat and drought conditions; therefore, this study evaluated the tolerance of wheat cultivars to heat/thermal and drought stress. To meet this objective, 30 wheat cultivars were cultivated in 3 greenhouse environments, namely control, drought, and heat, applying stress from the booting stage to the end of anthesis. The following parameters were evaluated: cycle, plant height, spike number per plant, spike length, spike weight, spikelet number per spike, percentage of fertile spikelets, number of grains per spike, and grain weight per spike. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were performed by the Ward and “K-means” methods. Principal component analysis showed that the correlations between the productivity traits and the principal components were more affected by drought than by the control and heat environments. The cluster analyses formed five clusters for the control and heat environments and seven clusters for the drought environment. Grain productivity was highlighted in the heat environment for ‘BRS 210’, ‘BR18 Terena’, ‘IPR Catuara TM’, ‘CD 154’, ‘BR 220’, ‘MGS Aliança’, ‘IAC 350’, ‘IAC Tucunaré’, ‘BR 24’, ‘IAC 5 Maringá’, ‘UFVT1 Pioneiro’, and ‘CD 151 4’ with a positive relationship in principal component analysis.

This study aimed to investigate hedge and central pruning and tree thinning as alternative solutions to increase the vegetative growth and production of pecan trees in high-density orchards. The experiment was conducted in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, using a randomized block design with three replicates, each consisting of five trees. Treatments included: i) control (no treatment), ii) hedge pruning, iii) central pruning, and iv) tree thinning (tree removal). We evaluated vegetative growth, the number of dry branches, and aspects related to production and production efficiency. Tree thinning resulted in increased transverse width, canopy volume, and the number of basal branches, along with a decrease in dry branches per tree. Production was higher in trees subjected to thinning (42.89%), followed by central pruning (39.80%) and hedge pruning (37.03%), compared to the control. The average yield was higher than the control after both pruning methods; hedge and central pruning increased yield by 37.20 and 39.85%, respectively. However, tree thinning decreased yield by 10.80%. Trees subjected to hedge pruning achieved higher production efficiency relative to canopy volume than the control, while, concerning trunk cross-sectional area, tree thinning was more efficient than the control. Tree thinning increases vegetative growth, production, and production efficiency, while hedge pruning and central pruning lead to higher yields.",

Limited information is available on the optimal harvest time for atemoya grown in semi-arid conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of atemoya fruits at various maturity stages under semi-arid conditions. Fruit was harvested from a commercial orchard and the experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design (CRD) with a 3x5 factorial scheme. This included three maturation stages (100, 105, and 110 days after pollination - DAP) and five refrigerated storage periods (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days), with four repetitions. The fruits were stored at 15 ± 2°C and 74 ± 2% RH and subjected to physical, chemical, and biochemical evaluations. Throughout storage, there was a significant fresh mass loss of 13.83, 11.99, and 11.92% for fruits harvested at 100, 105, and 110 DAP, respectively. Firmness and starch content also decreased as starch was converted into sugars. Across all maturation stages, the shelf life was limited to nine days due to compromised appearance, primarily cracks and peel darkening. Fruits harvested at 105 and 110 DAP exhibited better quality at the end of storage, including improved appearance, greater mass, lower weight loss, and higher soluble solids and vitamin C content. The results suggest that atemoya fruits can be harvested between 105 and 110 DAP under semi-arid conditions. Thus, atemoya shows commercial potential for production in the semi-arid region.",

The knowledge of the nutritional behavior of coffee crops, as well as the pattern of nutrient release and loss, contribute to the appropriate crop management, influencing quality, productivity and minimizing economic losses. Therefore, the objective of this article is to select the non-linear model that best describes nitrogen losses due to ammonia (NH3) volatilization, in seven conventional and increased efficiency fertilizers, applied in three installments to coffee plants and indicate the fertilizers that presented the highest and lowest nitrogen losses due to NH3 volatilization. The data come from an experiment carried out during the 2015/2016 harvest at the Coffee Innovation Agency (INOVACAFÉ) of the Federal University of Lavras, in a randomized block design with 3 replications of 7 treatments (nitrogen fertilizers). The estimation method used was the least squares method (MMQ), with the Gauss-Newton convergence algorithm as the iterative method. As diagnostic measures to determine the best model, the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2aj), residual standard deviation (RSD), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and mean absolute deviation (MAD) were used. It was verified that all models exhibited good adjustments, however, the Brody and Logistic models stood out in describing the accumulated nitrogen losses, due to ammonia volatilization, in relation to the seven treatments applied and evaluated. It was found that ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate fertilizers presented the lowest N losses, while Prilled Urea and Urea + anionic polymer contribute the greatest losses due to the volatilization of NH3, in the three fertilizations on coffee plants.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of management systems that utilize both organic and mineral fertilization on soil chemical attributes and organic matter fractions in the Xanthic Ferralsol. This study was conducted in the experimental areas of Embrapa Mandioca and Fruticultura, Cruz das Almas, Bahia State, Brazil. Three cassava and banana production systems, a conventional cassava cultivation system (CAS-CT), an organic banana system (BAN-ORG), and a conventional banana system (BAN-CT), were investigated using the native forest (NF) area as a reference. Soil sampling was conducted within the planting rows at depths of 0.0 - 0.10 and 0.10 - 0.20 m. Macronutrients, soil pH, soil total organic C, particulate organic C, light organic matter, labile-C, mineralizable C, and microbial biomass-C were assessed. BAN-ORG led to an increase in soil pH at both depths. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that organic cultivation was distinguished from the others owing to its strong correlation with soil bases (Ca and Mg), particulate organic C, and labile-C. In the NF and BAN-ORG soils, microbial-C levels in the 0.0 - 0.10 and 0.10 - 0.20 m layers remained consistent, whereas there was a reduction of 30 and 70% for CAS-CT and BAN-CT, respectively, with increasing depth. Mineralizable C (release of CO2-C) was higher in the NF and BAN-ORG systems than in the conventional system for both evaluated layers. BAN-CT and CAS-CT were strongly correlated with available potassium in PC-2, separating them from BAN-ORG and NF. Management practices implemented in the organic system resulted in an increase in macronutrient levels and a reduction in soil acidity. The elevation of labile-C and particulate organic C in the organic system increased the microbial activity in the soil, particularly in the subsurface layers. Organic management has emerged as a viable approach for enhancing organic C sequestration in the soil and creating favorable conditions for increasing microbial activity in banana cultivation.",

For the process to be efficient, experiments must be as precise as possible. Factors that affect accuracy include plant survival (PS) and assessment age. The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are differences in progeny PS among evaluation sites and ages, whether dominated plants affect precision estimates, and how potential damage caused by differences in PS can be mitigated. Data from the evaluation of half-sib progenies of C. maculata at three sites and C. torelliana at four sites were used. The experiments were implemented in an alpha-lattice design with 40 repetitions and a single-tree plot (STP). Diameter at breast height (DBH) and PS data were obtained at three and six years of age. All plants that presented DBH with a deviation below the mean (dominated plants) were not considered in the survival estimates. Although there was a difference in plant survival between progenies and experiments, none of the strategies used to mitigate damage due to differences in PS significantly changed the classification of progenies or the magnitude of the accuracy. There was a high association between the estimates obtained at three and six years of age, indicating that for species of the genus Corymbia, early selection is viable.",

Grains with initial moisture contents of 21.95% (w.b.) and 3.50% (w.b.) were used for desorption and adsorption analyses, respectively. The static-gravimetric method determined equilibrium moisture content at various temperatures (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50°C) and relative humidity (between 0.11 and 0.92 ± 2%). The Modified Halsey model quantified the hygroscopicity of soybean. Key findings include: (a) desorption equilibrium moisture content exceeded adsorption values, demonstrating hysteresis; (b) decreasing equilibrium moisture content increased the energy required for water removal and its release during adsorption; (c) differential entropy of desorption and adsorption increased with decreasing equilibrium moisture content; (d) Gibbs free energy decreased with increasing temperature for both desorption and adsorption. The enthalpy-entropy compensation theory effectively described the observed phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to select Coffea canephora genotypes from the seminal propagation variety ‘ES8152’ with different harvest times. The experiment was conducted using a Federer augmented block design with three repetitions, evaluating 175 genotypes and four clonal witnesses in two harvests (2022 and 2023), and 20 morphoagronomic characteristics were evaluated. The data were analyzed using the REML/BLUP methodology with the Selegen software, where the variance components and genetic values were estimated. The selection was performed using the Mulamba-Rank index. The bottom sieve (BS) and top sieve (TS) characteristics had high heritability (0.5779 and 0.6694, respectively) and accuracy (0.7602 and 0.8182, respectively). TS also showed high repeatability (0.6827). The genotypic effects were significant at 1% level for days for fruit ripening, fruit size, vegetative vigor, yield per plant, TS, and BS; at 5% level for general scale; and at 10% level for incidence of rust, degree of inclination, and percentage of fruit float. It was possible to distinguish 20 superior genotypes in terms of maturation, among which the selection gains for the genotypic clusters were 46.14, 45.92 and 41.56% for indefinite, early, and late maturation, respectively, by applying a selection intensity of 11.43%. Genotypes 25, 26, 73, 93, and 100 could be used for early maturing varieties, whereas genotypes 155 and 189 could be used for late-maturing varieties. The most promising genotypes for composing a variety, regardless of the maturation period, were 20, 39, 90, 112, and 190, as these were among the five best genotypes ranked in the three selection processes, demonstrating that they added superior desired morphoagronomic characteristics. It is concluded that there is genetic variability among the 175 genotypes evaluated, as well as significant genetic effects to be explored in the pool gene of individuals originating from the 'ES8152' variety.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on incorporating dimensionality reduction based on marker significance to better harness the potential of machine learning for genomic prediction in different trait-genomic structures. The aim was to show that outcomes achieved with reduced data would improve predictive accuracy ( ) and precision (root-mean-square error: RMSE) while reducing computational time. Distinct subsets of markers, in simulated data, were chosen by prioritizing importance via the Bagging technique. Predictive modelling was subsequently conducted using both Bagging and the diverse architectures of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This study was carried out with six traits of an F2 simulated population (derived from contrasting homozygotes) with 1,000 individuals. Three traits had three different heritabilities (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) and were controlled by a set of 40 quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Additionally, four QTLs with more pronounced heritability effects (set at unity) were introduced in three other traits while preserving the same genetic control structure as the earlier traits. In our investigation, as the number of markers increased, both techniques gradually increased training time; however, the time needed for computation notably extended beyond the threshold of 100 markers for Bagging. In comparison to the MLP model, the Bagging model generally obtained better accuracy (higher ) and precision (lower RMSE) values regardless of heritability and added QTLs. Most importantly, results highlight that for traits subject to robust genetic control of additional QTLs, MLP networks experienced a decline in prediction performance from a few markers (~10). In contrast, Bagging kept constant or subtly improved predication performance. Finally, the dimensionality reduction procedure effectively improves genomic prediction, and Bagging captures complex genetic control structures for prediction better than MLP networks.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is an oilseed of great relevance to Brazil because it is one of the main crops produced in the country. The success of this crop depends on several factors, the main one being seed quality. The tetrazolium test has been used for quality control because in addition to evaluating the viability of germination and the vigor of the seed lots, it facilitates classification of the types of damage. Thus, the use of sequential sampling, which takes into account the immediate evaluation of each seed, may facilitate an earlier decision on viability and vigor without the need to evaluate all seeds as in the classic test as a formality of the method. In addition, the estimates obtained through Bayesian techniques can be improved by including prior information. The objective of this study was to study the application of Bayesian sequential tests to estimate the proportion of vigor in lots (binomial modeling) and the proportion of damage per category in soybean seeds (multinomial modeling) through the tetrazolium test. In each case, conjugate priors were used, and the parameters were elicited. It can be concluded that the four approaches, frequentist, Bayesian, sequential, and Bayesian sequential, were efficient for estimation of and decision-making about the parameters, with a reduction in the sample size. Moisture damage was present in 20.17% of the soybean seeds evaluated, damage by stink bugs in 3.50%, and mechanical damage, in the case of manual harvesting, in only 1.92%. In addition, 1.00% of seeds presented more than two types of damage.",

The VG method successfully described the changes in the structure of the soil samples by comparing the CT images and may be used to quantify soil degradation. The topological indices clustering coefficient, average shortest path, and average degree of the VG network described the communication between soil structural units, pore continuity, and the distribution of paths between pores. We found strong correlations between the phenomenological aspects and the topological descriptors of the generated network, especially for the average degree. This index best highlighted the difference between the samples, revealing greater heterogeneity in the Atlantic Forest sample compared to the sugarcane sample. These correlations indicate that the complexity of the networks of 3D soil images is related to physical properties, enabling quantification of the degradation of soil morphological properties.",

    "abstract": "Ruzigass (Urochloa ruziziensis) is a forage crop with high agronomic and nutritional value. Plant breeders often assess ruzigrass phenotypic traits via vigor ratings. The analyses of these categorical data often fail to meet the usual statistical assumptions. In this study, we compared four fittings of linear models for vigor rating analyses: i) a linear mixed model for the original scale (LMM), ii) a linear mixed model for a Box–Cox transformed scale (BCLMM), iii) a multinomial generalized mixed model using a probit link function, also known as threshold model (GLMM), and iv) a hierarchical Bayesian model, also referred to as a Bayesian threshold model (HBM). Additionally, biomass yield was assessed, and the indirect selection of high-performing genotypes was evaluated. The experimental design included 2,204 ruzigrass genotypes randomized into augmented blocks. Six graders visually assessed each plot using a rating scale. Fitting methods were sampled from three scenarios, employing one, three, or six graders. A nonnull genetic variance component was detected for vigor and biomass yield traits. Except for BCLMM, the methods for analyzing vigor ratings were correlated. The correlations and coincidence indices for selecting genotypes increased with the number of graders. The analysis of vigor ratings under Gaussian approximations is riskier when a single grader is used to evaluate genotypes. The GLMM and HBM perform similarly and are more recommended and suitable analyses of vigor ratings when selecting high-performing ruzigrass genotypes.",

The experiments utilized a randomized block design with four replications and treatments arranged in a 2 x 5 factorial design, assessing coinoculation (with and without) and five planting speeds. Results indicated that increasing planting speed reduced soil moisture and increased soil temperature, adversely affecting soybean nodulation and yield due to uneven plant distribution in the planting furrow. Planting speeds close to 4 km h-1 achieved the best uniformity in plant distribution, nodulation, and soybean yield.

The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of the Wehrmann Agricultural Group and was replicated three times on April 4th (Experiment I), April 18th (Experiment II), and May 16th, 2019 (Experiment III). The experimental design consisted of a randomized complete block design in a 3 × 3 factorial scheme, with nine treatments and four replicates.

After harvesting, the bulbs were counted, weighed, and classified based on sieves ranging from 2 to 8, according to the transverse bulb diameter. Following this classification, the commercial, total, and industrial bulb yields were estimated. Negative vernalization temperatures resulted in slower bulb development in all experiments; however, this was associated with a higher potential for bulb growth. Notably, the Chonan cultivar outperformed the other cultivars. Negative vernalization temperature increased the yield of bulbs in the 5–7 and 8 classes (higher commercial value classes), reduced the bulb yields in the 2–4 and industrial classes (lower commercial value classes), and enhanced the total yield.",

We assessed the host status based on the nematode reproduction factor (RF) and the number of nematodes per gram of root. For both nematodes, all the rice cultivars we studied were classified as susceptible, with RF means ranging from 21.80 to 108.92 for M. ottersoni and 2.12 to 177.16 for M. graminicola. Conversely, the Oryza accessions displayed varied phenotypes. For example, O. grandiglumis, O. glaberrima, and O. glumaepatula exhibited moderate to high resistance to M. ottersoni, with RFs ranging from 0.53 to 4.50, while O. latifolia was susceptible. Additionally, O. glumaepatula showed moderate to high resistance levels to M. graminicola (RF = 0.23 – 8.88), whereas O. alta was susceptible, and O. grandiglumis, O. glaberrima, and O. latifolia demonstrated varying levels of resistance.

Brazil accounts for approximately 90% of global passion fruit production, while Europe is an emerging market.

Despite its native origin, there is limited research on the impact of cultivation systems on fruit quality. This study compares trellis systems with two wires to the espalier system across two growing seasons under annual cultivation. Fruits were harvested when at least two-thirds of the skin turned yellow. Rainfall accumulation and light availability within each system were measured. Various fruit characteristics-including skin color, skin thickness, fruit mass, longitudinal and transverse diameters, pulp mass, pulp yield with seeds, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and ascorbic acid content—were evaluated in both systems across both seasons. Results indicate that the trellis system consistently produced higher pulp mass and larger fruit diameter across seasons. No significant differences were found in postharvest quality between the systems. Based on these findings, the trellis system is recommended for annual yellow passion fruit cultivation.",

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the linear relationships among morphological traits of sunflower in a low-altitude subtropical environment and identify traits that can assist in the indirect selection of cultivars, hybrids, and genotypes in field trials of the national sunflower genotype evaluation network. Data from five experimental years conducted annually between 2017/2018 and 2022/2023 were used. The experiments were conducted at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM). The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with four replications, considering 34 treatments (genotypes) evaluated over five experimental years, totaling 1,754 plants evaluated during the period. The evaluated traits were plant height (cm), capitulum diameter (cm), thousand-achene mass (g), number of achenes per capitulum, and individual achene yield per plant (g). Subsequently, the relationship among traits was investigated using Pearson correlation (r) and path (cause and effect) analyses. The traits number of achenes per capitulum, thousand-achene mass, and capitulum diameter are positively related. The magnitude of Pearson correlations among evaluated traits changes in an environment with prolonged water deficit conditions. The number of achenes per capitulum and thousand-achene mass have a linear relationship and a direct effect on individual achene yield. Capitulum diameter has a direct effect on the number of achenes per capitulum and can be used to assist in the indirect selection of sunflower genotypes, hybrids, and cultivars.",

Crossbreeding and backcrossing were performed using UFU-57 as the recurrent parent and UFU MC TOM1 as the donor parent, and dwarf plants were selected in the BC1F2 and BC2F2 generations. This research focused on improving key fruit quality attributes, including size, acidity, and phytonutrient levels, such as β-carotene and lycopene. Notable improvements were observed, particularly in the second backcrossing generation, which produced salad-type fruit with enhanced traits. Promising populations, including UFU × DTOM 8#2-3, UFU × DTOM 22#1-17, and UFU × DTOM 4#4-14, demonstrated significant potential for further lineage development and hybrid breeding programs. Metabolomic analysis identified increased levels of glycine, myo-inositol, acetamide, and dodecanoic acid in the dwarf salad-type tomato line, which were likely associated with improved stress resilience, enhancing its potential for breeding robust cultivars. These results provide a crucial understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying fruit quality improvement and stress resistance in dwarf tomato.

Cell analyses were performed by using scanning electron and light microscopy (with reactions for starch and lipids). In addition, the sugars and lipid contents were determined. The results indicated that C. aschersoniana seeds are sensitive to desiccation and that under the conditions tested, the critical water content is approximately 30%, and the lethal water content is less than 18%. The seeds are dispersed while dormant, and this dormancy is partially overcome by partial drying. These seeds have some protection systems against desiccation, such as increased sucrose concentrations, during artificial drying; however, these systems are not efficient at protecting the seeds from damage caused by more intense desiccation. The images obtained allowed the verification of changes only at the point where the seeds were already completely unviable.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the effects of phosphorus on sesame development and yield in semi-arid environments is crucial for refining agronomic practices and enhancing crop productivity. This research evaluated the response of sesame cultivars to varying phosphorus levels under irrigation in a semi-arid setting. Conducted at the Experimental Farm of the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid, two experiments ran from August to November in 2021 and 2022. A randomized block design with subdivided plots and four replicates was employed. Treatments consisted of five phosphorus doses (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg ha-1 of P2O5) applied to main plots, while four sesame cultivars (CNPA G2, CNPA G3, CNPA G4, and BRS Seda) were assigned to subplots. Variables such as plant height, stem diameter, leaf count, capsule count, above-ground dry matter, thousand-seed weight, and seed yield were assessed. Phosphorus application significantly enhanced plant growth, which correlated positively with seed yield. Optimal phosphorus doses for peak seed yield in the first harvest were 170, 184, 167, and 152 kg ha-1 of P2O5 for cultivars CNPA G2, CNPA G3, CNPA G4, and BRS Seda, respectively. The second harvest showed maximum yields at doses of 149, 137, 125, and 164 kg ha-1 of P2O5. Notably, the second harvest yielded better plant development. Response to phosphorus varied among cultivars, with CNPA G3 and CNPA G4 showing the highest growth and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Brazilian Savannah (Cerrado) soils have insufficient nutrient concentrations for attaining high crop yields. Properly applied poultry litter (PL) may improve soil fertility and forage productivity. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the vertical distribution of acidity and nutrient availability in an Oxisol (Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico) subjected to increasing PL doses over 7 years. We determined the vertical distribution and levels of total organic C, total N, Ca, Mg, K, P, and pH in seven soil layers (0–0.05, 0.05–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30, 0.30–0.50, 0.50–0.75, and 0.75–1.00 m) where four different PL treatments were applied (cumulative levels: 0, 26.32, 43.15, and 57.6 Mg ha−1) over seven years. Potential acidity and low total organic C content indicated the chemical limitations of natural soil. The application of PL reduced soil acidity and increased K, Ca, and Mg levels and base saturation to 1.00-m depth. The highest PL dose (57.6 Mg ha−1) increased the vertical mobility of Ca, K, and Mg while increasing their stocks by 157, 140, and 135%, respectively, in the deeper soil layers. However, even in the long term, the tested PL doses did not increase total organic C, total N, or P levels in the subsurface soil layers. The dual effects of soil acidity correction and improved nutrient content attest to PL application as an effective strategy for improving soil fertility and ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the Brazilian Cerrado.",

AE in autoclaved or non-autoclaved concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% was prepared with or without antioxidant (Na2SO3 – 0.25%).

Non-autoclaved AE inhibited only 20% of conidia germination but the autoclaved AE did not cause inhibition showing the presence of thermo-sensible compounds. The incorporation of antioxidant Na2SO3 in AE increased the inhibition of conidia germination. The camphor AE also induced systemic resistance in wheat plants, reducing the size (up to 29%) and number of spots (up to 60%). The induction was higher in plants treated with camphor 72 hours before the inoculation with pathogen. These results confirm the potential of camphor AE in alternative control of black point wheat.",

The evaluated linear, exponential and geometric models can be used in the billygoat weed leaf area estimation. In the practical sense, the simple linear regression model is suggested using the C*L multiplication product and taking the linear coefficient equal to zero, because it showed weak alteration on sum of squares error and satisfactory residual analysis. Thus, an estimate of A. conyzoides leaf area can be obtained using the equation Sf = 0.6789*(C*L), with a determination coefficient of 0.8630.",

The treatments were composed by the combination of seed treatments (0 and 500 mL 100 kg-1 of seeds) with three doses of plant growth regulator (250, 375 and 500 mL ha-1) applied to the leaves in two stages of the culture’s development (V5 and R3), plus the control without application. The features evaluated were: plant height, number of seedpods per plant, yield and mass of one thousand seeds. The features of plant height and number of seedpods per plant were not influenced by the application of the plant growth regulator in the two agricultural years. In the agricultural years of 2005/06, the greater seed yield (2.927 kg ha-1) was reached with the application of 211 mL ha-1 of plant growth regulator to the leaves at the R3 stage, together with seed treatment. In the second agricultural year there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the treatments in seed yield, although the results were superior to those obtained in the first year. One of the basic principles to improve the efficacy of the plant growth regulator in soybean crops is an adverse climatic condition.",

The study used seeds stored for one year in laboratory uncontrolled conditions, of the following cultivars: CD 201, CD 202, CD 204, CD 205, CD 206, CD 208, CD 215, CD 216, Embrapa 48, BRS 132, BRS 184 and BRS 212. The soybean seeds were evaluated through germination tests, seedling vigor classification tests, seedling length and dry biomass, under water stress conditions using two levels of osmotic potential (0.0 and -0.1 MPa). Cultivars were them grouped in different levels of drought tolerance, by the percentage reduction in the appraised characteristics {% Reduction = [1-(Germination or Vigor in PEG 6000 / Germination or Vigor in water)] x 100}, for the technique of grouping analysis, according to the nearest neighbor hierarchical method. The soybean genotypes presented differentiated behavior regarding drought tolerance. The Embrapa 48 cultivar presented the greatest tolerance to water stress. Comparing the results obtained by multivariate analysis and by the Scott-Knott grouping method, good concordance was observed between the two methods in the constitution of the groups. The method used and the statistical procedure adopted allowed to differentiate the soybean cultivars in a short period of time",

    "abstract": "In order to be efficient, the crop rotation system requires, among other factors, an adequate choice of species to be installed. Vegetal cultures can feature allelochemical compounds, released by root hairs, roots, stems and leaves in variable amounts, which are able to interfere on subsequent cultures, as well as cause a delay in their production. Thus, this study analyzed the allelopathic potential of black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) (BO), forage turnip (Raphanus sativus L.) (FT), vetch (Vicia sativa L.) (V), ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) (RG) and consortium (CO - BO+V+FT) on soybean seed germination and plantlet growth. This trial was carried out in a laboratory, with sand substrate, where coverage plants were grown, during 30 days. The remaining root portions of plants were kept with and without the remaining aerial part portions. A reduction was observed on the emergence of soybean plantlets under CO, RG and BO. The emergence speed index (ESI), emergence percentage on sand (ES) and the green mass of hypocotyls (GMH) were negatively affected by coverage plants, and due to this, another study is essential to verify whether there is an indication of the allelopathic effect.",

The study was conducted at C-Valley Agroindustrial Cooperative, in Palotina (Paraná State). Two treatments of soil were evaluated: no-tillage without additional compaction (PD-C0) and no-tillage with additional compaction (PD-C1), and five varieties of soybeans: (1) Coodetec 204, (2) Coodetec 215, (3) Monsoy 5942, (4) Embrapa 48 and (5) Spring. A completely randomized experimental design in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme was adopted. The attributes of soil evaluated were: bulk density, total porosity, macro- and microporosity. In the plants, the following parameters were assessed: harvesting dates, plant height, height of insertion of the first pod, mass of one thousand grains and productivity. The results showed that the parameters for the production of soybean cultivars were not influenced by the different levels of soil compaction, and the differences observed were due to the characteristics of the cultivars themselves.",

Effects of the grasses, nitrogen and seasons of the year were observed on the two evaluated characteristics. The Estrela and Tanzania grasses provided the largest and smallest soil cover, respectively. Pioneiro and Marandu presented the highest and lowest height, respectively. The highest temperatures in the spring/summer season caused higher plant height, but they did not affect soil cover. The increase in nitrogen dosages had little influence on the appraised characteristics in the autumn/winter season: there was a reduction in soil cover and increase in the height of Xaraes. In the spring/summer season, there were reductions in soil cover for Pioneiro and in the height of Pioneiro and Estrela.",

The herbicide Glyphosate was applied on three plots of each treatment of transgenic soy, 30 days after emergence. Grain production, number of pods/plant, weight per 100 seeds, and seed germination percentage were evaluated. There was no difference among cultivars; however, the production in the covered area with honeybees (2757.4 kg ha-1) and in the uncovered area (2828.47 kg ha-1) were higher than in the covered area without honeybees (2000.53 kg ha-1). The number of pods/plant was greater than in the covered area with honeybees (38.28) and in the uncovered area (32.65) as compared to the covered area without honeybees (21.19). The weight per 100 seeds seed germination did not differ among cultivars or treatments. It can be concluded that, for these cultivars, there was a rise in grain production of 37.84% when honeybee visits were allowed",

Adult plants are different from other genus members in this ecosystem due to their size, and efforts to locate the plants may lead to their extraction from the savannah and, frequently, plant death. Micropropagation has played a significant role in the propagation and preservation of specimens of several plant species; therefore, this study evaluated the effect of various salt concentrations and culture medium volumes on the in vitro cultivation of A. othonianum Rizz. Trial (I) evaluated two culture media (MS and WPM) and three salt concentrations (100, 50 and 25%) in a completely randomized design. Trial (II) evaluated two culture media and salt concentrations, MS (50%) and WPM (100%), and five medium volumes (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mL per test tube) as a 2 x 5 factorial in a completely randomized design. After 30 and 60 days of growth, the percentage of plantlet survival, average plantlet and leaf lengths and the average number of leaves and buds per explant were evaluated. The MS (50 and 25%) media and WPM (100 and 50%) media were the most effective for plantlet regeneration. The best responses were observed in 15- and 25-mL volumes of the MS (50%) medium. Therefore, the use of a 15-mL volume is suggested for greater medium economy.",

    "abstract": "The effect of homeopathic preparations on the activities of the leaf-cutting ants Acromyrmex spp. was studied. A field experiment involving ant nests in six experimental areas was performed using a randomised complete block design. Within each block, every ant nest was considered to represent one repetition. The treatments consisted of the following: Belladonna homeopathic preparations of macerated or triturated Acromyrmex spp. adults, homeopathic preparations of macerated or triturated ant nest fungus (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus) collected from Acromyrmex laticeps and Acromyrmex heyeri nests, a homeopathy Belladonna, and dynamised water. All of the homeopathic treatments were tested at the 30 CH (thirtieth centesimal Hahnemannian) dynamisation. An untreated nest served as the control. The total number of ants from each trail was counted, including both those carrying or not-carrying green plant fragments, immediately before the daily homeopathic applications. All of the tested homeopathic preparations, except for the water, significantly reduced the activity level of Acromyrmex spp. The homeopathic preparations of Belladonna and the macerated nosodes of Acromyrmex spp. reduced the activity level of the ants beginning with the sixth day after the first treatment application; the activity level reduction effect lasted more than 20 days after the last application.",

    "abstract": "We examined the heterotic parameterizations of diallel crosses among 10 popcorn inbred lines in two different environments (municipalities of Campos dos Goytacazes and Itaocara, Rio de Janeiro State) and originating from tropical, temperate and subtropical germoplasm. Traits, including grain yield (GY), plant height (PH), ear height (EH), days to silking (FL) and popping expansion (PE), were measured. The inbred lines and the hybrids were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The sources of genotypic variation, inbred lines and heterosis had significant effects on all traits. When the sources of heterotic variation were compared separately, estimated mean heterosis was found to be significant for all traits. When inbred lines and specific heterosis was investigated, only popping expansion was not significantly different, demonstrating that heterotic effects are favorable for developing superior hybrids. A direct relation between ĝi and was made clear, especially for traits that were slightly influenced by the effects of dominance. Additivity was determined to have the best effect for improving popping expansion. The hybrid combinations had positive estimates of heterosis for the GY but not for PE. The hybrids P1 x P3 and P2 x P4 had the best responses for the GY and PE. The superiority of the combination P1 x P3 shows that the addition of genomes with different edaphoclimatic adaptations is an important factor in obtaining superior hybrids.",

The objective of this research was to determine a mathematical equation for M. cissoides leaf area estimation based on the relationship between the leaf blade linear measures. Leaves of the species were collected from a variety of agroecosystems at São Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, São Paulo State, Brazil, measuring the length (L), maximum width (W) and real leaf blade area of the three kinds of leaflets. Linear equations Y = a x (X) were estimated for each kind of leaflet. The confidence intervals of the primary leaflet equation overlapped those ones from the secondary leaflet equation, and then only one equation was considered for these leaflets. So, an equation of principal leaflet plus that one of primary + secondary leaflets were used to determine the M. cissoides leaf area. Thus, the leaf area of the species might be determined by the sum of the leaf areas of the principal leaflet with the primary + secondary leaflets, according to the equation LAest = 0.501 x (X) + 2.181 x (Z), where X indicates L x W of the principal leaflet and Z indicates medium L x W of the primary + secondary leaflets, respectively.",

Two field experiments were performed with applications of tembotrione and atrazine, alone or in combination.

In the Serra do Salitre (Minas Gerais State) area, in the medium texture soil, the herbicides were applied and incorporated into the soil, and the potatoes were planted the day after. No injuries were found in the shoots. Decline in the potato yield was found only in the medium texture soil (Serra do Salitre). Atrazine did not affect the quality of potato tubers. In the two areas, tembotrione promoted cracks in \"Atlantic\" potato tubers.",

A positive effect of soil fumigation was observed on the growth, leaf number, leaf area, plant height and accumulation of nutrients in monocot weeds in relation to dicots. Conyza bonariensis was the most affected by soil fumigation, with levels of dry matter, leaf number, leaf area, height and accumulation of nutrients approximately 50% lower than plants grown in normal soil. Fumigation also influenced the growth cycle of the plants, which was lower for B. pilosa, E. indica and C. echinatus. We also observed a 20 and 30% lower phosphorus accumulation in Bidens pilosa and Conyza bonariensis, respectively, when grown in the sterilized soil.

The ‘FHIA 17’ and ‘Nanicão IAC 2001’ cultivars have the potential to replace susceptible cultivars, but there is little information about their nitrogen and potassium nutritional requirements. This study aimed to identify the best fertilizer recommendation with N and K for banana cultivars ‘FHIA 17’, ‘Nanicão IAC 2001’, and ‘Grand Naine’. The applied fertilizer levels with N and K2O in two production cycles were as follows: NK0, without fertilization; NK1, 175 N and 285 kg K2O ha-1 year-1; NK2, 350 N and 570 kg K2O ha-1 year-1; and NK 3, 525 N and 855 kg K2O ha-1 year-1. It was concluded that the N and K fertilization levels influenced most of the phenological and production parameters of ‘Grand Naine’ and ‘Nanicão IAC 2001’. ‘Nanicão IAC 2001’ and ‘Grand Naine’ achieved maximum yield with an application of 525 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 855 kg K2O ha-1 year-1. The ‘FHIA 17’ cultivar showed a low response to nitrogen and potassium fertilization. Regardless of cultivars, to achieve maximum productivity (44.2 and 43.3 ton ha-1 year-1), an application at 150% and 124% of the fertilizer recommendation is required in the 1st and 2nd production cycles, respectively.",

The aim of this study was to describe the seed germination patterns of 45 juçara accessions by using a nonlinear model to examine the behavior of these patterns and select superior genotypes. After clustering 45 juçara accessions into four groups, four nonlinear models, namely, the logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy and Weibull models, were tested based on their fit for each group of accessions. The Gompertz model presented the best fit to describe the germination growth curve of E. edulis seeds. Groups 3 and 4 presented the highest daily germination rates and were considered the most vigorous. Analysis of deviance was performed, revealing genetic variability among the genotypes in terms of seed germination and vigor. It was possible to find a nonlinear model that best explained our data, and this model may also be a promising model for other palm tree species. It is possible to select genotypes based on the characters we analyzed, due to the elevated genetic variability.",

The results showed that, regardless of the use of urease inhibitors, an irrigation depth of 10 mm is suitable for incorporating urea into the soil and stabilizing N losses from NH3 volatilization. NBPT is the most efficient inhibitor under nonirrigated conditions. All N sources promote increases in the concentrations of nitric and ammonia nitrogen in the soil. In the first 15 days after fertilizer application, the highest concentrations of ammonium were in the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm soil layers, and NBPT showed the highest ammonium content compared to that of the other sources in the 0 - 10 cm layer. The nitric nitrogen content in the soil was slightly influenced by the irrigation depth in the first 15 days after fertilizer application. However, the ammonia nitrogen content decreased exponentially with the increase in irrigation depth due to the movement of ammonia in the soil.",

Many types of compost have been tested in sodic soils reclamation; however, these materials often do not provide satisfactory pH reduction. A recent study reported effective effects applying mixture of gypsum and sulfur inoculated with Acidithiobacillus in sodic soils with high pH and exchangeable sodium, though the effects on plant parameters were not evaluated. The present study was conducted to verify the effects of BPK rock biofertilizers on nodulation, biomass yield and nutrient uptake in cowpea compared with mineral fertilizer after sodic soil amendment. The BPK biofertilizers and PK mineral fertilizer were applied at different rates, and plants were inoculated with effective rhizobia strains. A control that did not receive PK fertilization was included. The results indicated that gypsum and sulfur with Acidithiobacillus reduced the soil’s pH and the amount of soil exchangeable sodium. BPK rock biofertilizer increased cowpea nodulation, biomass yield and nutrient uptake. The native rhizobia in the soil exhibited effectiveness in cowpea growth; displaying similar results compared with the rhizobia inoculated plants. BPK biofertilizers may be used as alternative to mineral PK fertilizers in sodic soils after the application of gypsum and sulfur inoculated with Acidithiobacillus.",

The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with ten treatments and four replicates, including a commercial substrate. Linear regression analysis showed a strong positive relationship between manure treatments and number of leaves, fresh and dry biomass, diameter, height and Dickson Quality Index at 30 and 40 days after sowing (DAS), with the exception of height at 30 DAS. There was no significant relationship for biochar dosage in any assessment for these parameters. The use of substrates with different dosages of cattle manure resulted in an increase of seedling quality compared to biochar and commercial substrates. The hypothesis that biochar can be substituted for fresh organic matter and is more stable in the substrate was not supported.",

Muell is a tree endemic to southern Australia and is distributed across four isolated regions: Kangaroo Island, southern Flinders Ranges, and two geographical zones in Eyre Peninsula. E. cladocalyx is capable of growing under extreme environmental conditions, including dry and saline soils. The objective of this study was to analyze genetic diversity in 45 half-sib families planted in northern Chile that are distributed across five different zones (provenances). Genetic variability was assessed using ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat) molecular markers. The results showed low levels of genetic diversity within populations (He = 0.113 to 0.268) in contrast with other Eucalyptus species. In addition, there was a significant genetic differentiation among provenances (Φst = 0.14); populations from the Kangaroo Island provenance showed more differentiation than any other population. These results are in agreement with previous studies of the species. Our study revealed that Chilean resources are a representative sample of Australian populations; therefore, the germplasm planted in northern Chile would be sufficient for the development of improvement programs. ISSR-Marker technology could be an alternative to identify genotypes of interest in material selection.",

The variables MR, qCO2 and enzymatic activity varied as a function of the management systems. The IPF and CEE systems caused improvements in the soil attributes, with increases in organic carbon and microbial biomass. The IPF integrated production system promoted improvements in the microbiological indicators of soil quality and was considered an environmentally sustainable agricultural production system. The transition from CN to agricultural areas caused changes in the soil microbiological indicators, which were perceived several years after anthropogenic intervention, indicating that even with the adoption of conservation systems, it was not possible to reestablish the soil microbial biomass.",

    "abstract": "Intensive weed management is one of the most common practices in coffee cultivation areas. Consequently, some problems, such as soil degradation and the selection of herbicide resistant weed, have increased over time, but, if properly managed, weeds at coffee planting inter-rows can offer benefits of erosion control, nutrient recycling and crop sustainability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different weed management strategies on the productivity and coffee grain size, i.e., quality. The experiment is installed onto a resprouting Coffea arabica L. site, four years after it was established. Treatments are implanted at planting inter-row Urochloa ruziziensis, Pueraria phaseoloides, and spontaneous vegetation maintained by mowing, herbicides, and weeding. To measure dry matter accumulation, samples are taken with a 0.25 m2 square template at plots maintained by mowing and herbicide application. To evaluate the yield and granulometry, coffee fruits are harvested, processed and classified in a set of 14 sieves (grouped in flat or “moca” shapes). The methods of controlling herbicide and weeding show significance in relation to grain production, with the production of grains having a higher market value standing out, when compared with the other treatments. The accumulation of dry matter above soil, in treatments with herbicides and spontaneous vegetation positively influenced the early coffee productivity (2018), and with U. ruziziensis and spontaneous vegetation, positively influenced the productivity of late harvest (2019). The accumulation of dry matter on the soil tends to be positively linked to coffee productivity, especially in periods when there is a shortage of rain in the region under study; however, it cannot be stated that this influence relationship (causality) has a direct positive effect between dry matter mass production and productivity of future coffee plantations.",

    "abstract": "French lavender (Lavandula dentata L.) is of great ornamental, medicinal, and aromatic interest. It is generally propagated vegetatively using stem cuttings. When using artificial lighting, a specific light composition can modify the entire plant phenology and is a factor that can be managed in controlled conditions. This study evaluated the rooting of stem cuttings and growth of lavender under four spectral LED lights. The LED lights used were: T0 (white LED, Roblan®), T1 (AP67 Milky, Valoya®), T2 (NS1, Valoya®), and T3 (AP673L Milky, Valoya®). The first phase evaluated the rooting of stem cuttings and initial development. The plants were then transferred to plastic pots to evaluate plant growth. In both rooting and growing phases, the plant morphological characteristics and water and light efficiencies were evaluated. Nutrient-uptake efficiencies were also evaluated after the growing phase. It was observed that cuttings rooted under the influence of T1 showed greater height. After the growing phase, plants under T3 showed better results in electricity use efficiency, water use efficiency, and nutrient-uptake efficiency and less nitrate leaching. They also presented more uniform growth with a compact canopy. Thus, T1 was better for the stem cuttings rooting phase, while T3 was better for growth and energy efficiency.",

The present study aimed to evaluate soil carbon stocks, accumulation rates (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and the quality of soil organic matter (SOM) after the transition of a low-productivity pasture into agrosilvopastoral systems in the Cerrado biome. We evaluated an 11-year-old experiment, and the treatments studied were: Eucalyptus + buffel grass; Eucalyptus + cowpea; Eucalyptus + pigeon pea; eucalyptus + buffel grass + cowpea; Eucalyptus + buffel grass + pigeon pea; Eucalyptus in monoculture (with a 20 × 3 m tree arrangement and no cultivation between rows but with a history of forage and grain crop production); and a low-productivity pasture as additional treatment and reference to the soil condition previously the land-use change. In this study, TOC and TN stocks and accumulation, labile (LC) and non-labile carbon (NLC), and SOM humic fractions were evaluated at 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 0-40 cm depth layers. Integrated farming systems have increased TOC and TN, NLC, carbon contents and stocks in SOM chemical fractions in all depths and TOC and TN accumulation of 5.22 Mg ha-1 year-1 and 0.23 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively, at the 0-40 cm depth layer. The integration of Eucalyptus with legumes or buffel grass increased the LC content in the surface layer of the soil. The transition from low-productivity pasture into integrated farming systems can promote the recovery of SOM and soil quality. Hence, our results suggest that agrosilvopastoral systems can be used as sustainable farming systems in the Cerrado biome.",

Thirteen yellow melon hybrids were evaluated in randomized blocks with three replications across four municipalities in Rio Grande do Norte State during two distinct seasons. Traits investigated included the number of fruits per plant and soluble solids. Factor regression and principal component analysis were employed to quantify the influence of maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, and radiation on the G × E interactions. The Harmonic Mean of Relative Performance of the Genotypic Values method identified adapted and stable genotypes. The covariate-biplot model established relationships between crucial environmental covariables and their impact on the number of fruits per plant and soluble solids. Minimum temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation significantly contributed to the G × E interactions in melon. Hybrids exhibited distinct sensitivities to environmental covariates, with HA-08 emerging as the most stable and adapted hybrid for both the number of fruits per plant and soluble solids.",

Therefore, in order to quantify the genotype interaction in environments and also to study the grain yield stability, methods such as the bi-segmented linear regression (Cruz et al., 1989), Lin e Binns (1988) and the traditional method were used. The experiments were carried out in ten locations in Santa Catarina in the 2000/01 and 2001/02 growing seasons. Each assay was composed of 13 black bean genotypes, which were assessed in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Data showed that BRS Campeiro, AN 9021332, IPR Uirapuru and LP 98-5 genotypes had the best general adaptation. Genotypes with specific adaptation were also identified, although the only concordance among the methodologies was the indication of the IPR Uirapuru cultivar for favorable environments.",

Neste trabalho, foram realizadas análises dos riscos de geadas em todo o ciclo da cultura, com atenção especial ao período compreendido entre o florescimento e a maturação, bem como os de deficiência hídrica no estabelecimento e no florescimento, para identificar zonas homogêneas climaticamente e indicar as melhores épocas de semeadura para o estado. O risco de geada, nos trinta dias que antecedem a maturação, foi considerado o de maior restrição ao cultivo da “safrinha” de milho. Este fator, associado à combinação de menor risco de deficiência hídrica, permitiu a identificação de oito regiões distintas, com períodos de semeadura variando de janeiro a março",

According to the analysis results and experimental conditions, the friction factor (f) of the Darcy-Weisbach equation can be estimated with c = 0.300 and m = 0.25. The Blasius equation (c = 0.316 and m = 0.25) gives an overestimate of friction loss, although this fact is non-restrictive for micro-irrigation system designs.

At every seven days, the roots were removed from the cold storage and visually analyzed for the presence of chilling symptoms. Afterwards, the roots were grinded for polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase activities and soluble phenolic compounds. Both temperature of 5 and 10ºC induced external and internal darkening of the roots, with higher intensity at 5ºC. Activities of polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase and content of phenolic compounds were enhanced at cold storage. Activity of polyphenoloxidase and content of phenolic substances increased up to the 14th day of storage in both temperatures. The activity of peroxidase was elevated up to the seventh day of storage in both temperatures, which was kept constant at 5 and at 10ºC. The highest activity was detected at the 14th day of storage. These results show that peroxidase is involved in the initial stress response to the harvest and chilling, followed by the involvement of polyphenoloxidase in the enzymatic darkening and accumulation of phenolic compounds in the tissues",

The experiment was arranged in a subdivided parcel scheme, with types of soil tillage as the primary soil treatments and the number of tractor passes as secondary treatments. In addition to a control treatment without soil tillage, the treatments were: tilling to a depth of 18 cm, a tilling to a depth of 18 cm followed by harrow use at a depth of 10 cm, and a 40-cm deep subsoil tilling. After preparing the parcels, soil penetration resistance was measured with an electronic penetrometer, before tractor passes and after 1, 3, 5 and 7 tractor passes on the same track. Soil density was also evaluated. It was concluded that the greater the pulverization during soil tillage, the greater the potential for compaction. Recently tilled soils (plough + harrow) were more susceptible to compaction than soils that were just tilled or deeply tilled. The effect of tractor traffic was chiefly concentrated on a superficial layer. The first tractor pass caused the greatest soil compaction, while the effect of subsequent passes was smaller.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to quantify the response of sugarcane to the replacement of phosphorus, applied as mineral fertilizer, by sewage sludge (SS). Sewage sludge was applied alone and in conjunction with mineral P fertilizer on a sugarcane crop in an Ultisol, SP83-2847 variety, distributed over seven treatments: 1 - control, without fertilization; 2 - mineral fertilization, based on the official recommendation; 3 - SS+0P; 4 - SS+45P; 5 - SS+90P; 6 - SS+135P; and 7 - SS+180P. Treatments 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 received 8.2 t ha-1 of SS (dry weight), enough to supply 60 kg ha-1 N, and the P fertilizer rates were equal to 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha-1 P2O5. Sewage sludge and SS+P did not increase pH, soil organic matter, available P and soil electrical conductivity. An increasing value of available soil Cu, Fe and Zn and foliar Mn and Zn content was observed with sewage application. The SS+0P treatment resulted in a stalk yield corresponding to 71% of that obtained with mineral fertilization, and there were no observed alterations in recoverable total sugar (RTS) amounts.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate resistance is conferred to soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) by incorporating a gene encoding a glyphosate-insensitive enzyme (CP4-EPSP synthase) that acts in the shikimate/chorismate pathway, an important metabolic route in the lignification process. The aim of this work was to investigate the root growth and lignin contents of susceptible (CD 201 and OC 14) and glyphosate-resistant (CD 214RR and CD 213RR) soybean cultivars. To this end, three-day-old seedlings were cultivated in half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (pH 6.0) in a growth chamber (25°C, 12-h photoperiod, irradiance of 280 &micro;mol m-2 s-1) for 24 to 96 hours. The results revealed that glyphosate-resistant (CD 213RR and CD 214RR) cultivars showed high root growth when compared to the conventional (OC-14 and CD 201) cultivars. CD 213RR showed high root lignin content and reduced root weight compared to the conventional (OC 14) cultivar, although CD 214RR and CD 201 did not follow the same trend. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that (1) the different form of EPSP synthase encoded in RR soybean may interfere in phenylpropanoid pathway and further in lignin biosynthesis, and (2) other genetic characteristics inherent to each cultivar may affect roots lignin content in soybean seedlings since lignification in CD 214 RR was not affected of similar manner than cultivar CD 213 RR.",

The objective of this study was to verify the effect of sources and levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization, under microbial activity (carbon of microbial biomass and carbon released as CO2) and fertility of soil cropped with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés. The experimental design was randomized, organized under a 3 x 4 factorial scheme, with three nitrogen sources (urea, ammonium sulfate and Ajifer-L40) and four nitrogen levels (0, 100, 200 and 400 kg ha-1), analyzed on two depths (0 - 0,10 e 0,10-0,20 m), with 3 replications. The higher levels of N doses, the 0 - 0.10 m depths, reduced the values of pH, MO, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SB and V%. Ajifer and urea resulted in higher values of Ca2+, in the depths of 0.10 – 0.20 m, and the values of Mg2+ and SB exhibited high values with the doses of 100 and 200 kg ha-1 levels of N. The higher levels of ammonium sulfate resulted in soil acidification. Soil carbon loss, due to the high microbial activity, could be the result of metabolic stress caused by soil acidification. The application of 100 kg ha-1 of nitrogen was the best fertilizing level, considering the smaller loss of soil carbon by microbial activity.",

The fruits were placed in a convection oven at 37±2°C for 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 days. After these periods, the moisture contents of the fruits and seeds were determined. A reduction in the water content occurred more rapidly in the fruits than in the seeds. The decrease in seed moisture content from 12.59% (on the basis of fresh weight) to 4.56% did not affect the percentage of germinated zygotic embryos; however, we did observe a decline in the vigor as the seed moisture content decreased. Embryos with a 4.56% moisture content developed into seedlings of shorter lengths after 30, 60, and 90 days of in vitro growth. The longest seedlings originated from embryos with a 10.42% moisture content after 90 days. Thus, it was evident that the babassu embryos were tolerant to desiccation, whereas the seedling length was negatively affected by a reduction in the seed moisture content. Therefore, babassu fruits may be dehydrated and stored without losing their viability, which thereby guarantees the conservation of their germplasm.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is essential for plant growth and development and directly influences both grain production and oil content. Boron has been studied in sunflower cultivation due to high demand of this culture for this nutrient. This study aimed to evaluate the N and B differential supply effect on the grain and oil production of sunflower plants. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and used two sunflower hybrids: BRS 321 and Neon. N and B were applied via nutritive solution according to the following treatments: B + 50 N (2.49 kg ha-1 B and 10 kg ha-1 N at planting and 40 kg ha-1 B as additional fertilization); B + 10 N (2.49 kg ha-1 B and 10 kg ha-1 N at planting); 50 N (0 B and 10 kg ha-1 N at planting and 40 kg ha-1 N as additional fertilization) and 10 N (0 B and 10 kg ha-1 N at planting). Analyses of total N and B in all collected plant parts were performed, as well as measurements of grain production for each chapter and oil extraction at the end of the cycle. The association between B fertilization and a greater amount of N fertilization was essential to BRS 321 oil production. Regarding grain production at lower levels of N fertilization, Neon presented the best response to B application.",

Leaves and roots were evaluated at the beginning of treatment and after 7, 14, and 21 days for chlorophyll content, biomass production and antioxidant metabolism. Mn was strongly translocated from the roots to the leaves, triggering a decrease in chlorophyll content. Excess Mn promoted an increase in reactive oxygen species that was accompanied by higher levels of antioxidative enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation. Zea mays L. cv. Saracura efficiently sequestered relatively large amounts of Mn in the leaves, with a significant impact on metabolism; however, we did not observe visual symptoms or a large decrease in biomass production.",

The effects of monospecific plantations of Acacia mangium, Dipteryx odorata, Jacaranda copaia, Parkia decussata,and Swietenia macrophylla, and areas of pasture and native forest on the chemical soil attributes of the Brazilian Amazon were evaluated. One bulked soil sample was collected per plot (0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.30 m; three plots of 128 m2) in each area. No significant differences in most of the soil attributes were observed among the forest plantations. However, soil K+ and P were higher in the Swietenia macrophylla plantations, while higher values of Ca2+, sum of bases, and pH occurred in Jacaranda copaia plantations. In the native forest, the pH, and P content were lower, whereas the soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), N content, H+Al content, and Al3+ content were higher than in the plantations. The lowest values of SOM, SOC, CEC, K+, Mg2+, N, H+Al, and Al3+ occurred in the pasture. None of the forest species led to the return of the original soil chemical attributes of the native forest.

Four storage periods were used, freshly collected seeds (0), stored for 6, 12 and 18 months, and four methods were applied, mechanical scarification and immersion in water (EI), mechanical scarification (ES), immersion in water (IM) and control (TE). We obtained the percentage values of seedling emergence (EP) and the mean emergence time (TME). Conductivity and moisture were obtained as indicators of the physical and physiological quality of seeds, respectively. Variations in moisture content and electrical conductivity during storage did not have effect on the percentage of germination. EI treatment was more efficient for overcoming dormancy than the ES was, regardless of storage time. IM and TE treatments did not lead to germination. EI was the most efficient treatment for decreasing the TME. The results indicate that alternative and low-cost methods are efficient at overcoming exogenous dormancy and thus can be used to optimize the process of seedling production.",

The health assessment was conducted by the method of incubation on paper filter (Blotter Test) and physiological quality seeds was determined by germination tests and electrical conductivity. The thermal treatment was used by immersion in water heated to 60 degrees for 5, 10 and 20 minutes. The chemical treatment was done with Captan fungicide. The study used 100 seeds per treatment (10 seeds per petri dish), which were incubated for seven days, at a temperature of 22 ± 2°C and 12-hour photoperiod. The qualitative and quantitative assessment (expressed in percentage) of the fungi associated with the seeds was done with the help of a stereoscope. In the examined samples, only the Aspergillus niger fungus was found. There was a higher incidence of A. niger in the lot from the town of Catolé Rocha, Paraíba State, with very low incidence of the fungus in the town Petrolina, Pernambuco State. The treatments with the best results were fungicide and thermotherapy for 20 minutes.",

Seeds of carnauba (Copernicia hospita Martius) obtained from mature fruit, were pre-germinated and sown in plastic 20 x 30, 28 x 40 and 40 x 60 cm bags, within a substrate of sandy loam + red sand + cured cow manure (2:1:1). After sowing, the bags were kept for 3, 6 or 9 months at a place with direct sunlight. The variables of growth of the plants were not influenced either by the size of the recipients or by the periods of exposure. Although the size of the bags did not influence the development of the plants, the 20 x 30 cm size should be more practical and economical to be used. The 9 months growth period gave more vigorous plants.",

We confirmed that glucosinolates content depends on plant species, plant organs and the time of sampling. In the samples aliphatic glucosinolates (glucoiberin, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, epiprogoitrin, sinigrin, gluconapin, glucoraphenin, sinalbin) prevailed. Glucobrassicin, an important indolic glucosinolate compound, was detected in all tested Brassicas. Its concentration in the oil radish samples was highest during the first assessment (30 DAS), 8.84 ± 0.65 µmol g-1 ds, while the oilseed rape samples displayed lowest concentration during the last assessment (134 DAS), 4.30 ± 0.80 µmol g-1 ds. The stimulative activity of individual glucosinolates or their negative influence on feeding of cabbage stink bugs in the Brassicas used in our experiment was not uniformly manifested. Based on a two-year field experiment we concluded that oil rape was the most adequate trap crop used to allure cabbage stink bugs. In future, glucosinolates should be employed to a greater extent in environmentally acceptable ways of food production, one of which is also the use of trap crops in order to reduce harmful effects of cabbage stink bugs.",

Oxygen deprivation promotes the induction of the expression of genes related to glycolysis and fermentation pathways to maintain energy metabolism and, in addition to reducing-power consuming processes, act in the formation of adaptive structures and the maintenance of the redox status of the plant. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relative expression of genes related to soil flooding response in two contrasting soybean cultivars. Soybean plants of the sensitive (BRS 154) and tolerant (I27) cultivars at the V1 development stage were submitted to the flooding and control conditions (without flooding) for 0, 24, 48, and 96 hours. The relative expression of genes associated with flooding, including enolase (ENO), alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1), alanine aminotransferase 2 (ALAT2), hemoglobin 1 (GLB1), LOB41 domain-containing protein (LBD41), xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XETP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX2), was evaluated by means of RT-qPCR. The relative expression, in general, increased with flooding, especially in the root tissue. Cultivar I27 responded positively as observed by the expression of the maintenance genes of energy metabolism, structural changes and detoxification, suggesting the presence of three tolerance mechanisms in the flooding response.",

For this purpose, 2,309 regular genotypes were evaluated in an augmented block design in two cuts. The evaluators gave grades for plant vigor, and later, the plots were measured for green biomass yield. The coincidences of the selected genotypes were estimated by different selection strategies. Then, 254 clones of the genotypes selected in different strategies were evaluated in a clonal test in a triple lattice design in four cuts. The statistical analyses were performed in SAS using the Mixed procedure. The regular genotype level and clone-mean basis heritabilities were 31.16 and 62.91%, respectively, for green mass yield. The expected selection gains were 21.09% (visual), 25.43% (phenotypic mean), and 27.5% (BLUP). Moreover, the realized heritabilities for these strategies were 15.58, 11.87, and 15.86%, respectively, which might be associated with genotype by environment interaction. Therefore, the visual selection could be a useful strategy in initial phases of a U. ruziziensis breeding program because the efficiency was moderate to high in relation to phenotypic mean and BLUP.",

However, the shelf life of sugar apples is one of the most concerning problems owing to their perishability. This work aimed to determine the ideal harvest time for sugar apple fruits in relation to different classes of carpel interspaces. Therefore, fruits were classified into three stages according to the carpel interspace: stage 1 (0.0 - 2.0 mm); stage 2 (2.1 - 3.0 mm); and stage 3 (3.0 - 4.0 mm). After harvesting, the fruits were evaluated daily in the laboratory regarding their physical and physicochemical aspects until they reached the point of consumption (horticultural maturation). The following variables were evaluated: fruit diameter and length (mm); fruit, peel, pulp, and seed masses (g); color index, including the chromatic attributes L* (luminosity), C* (chroma), and h* (hue angle); bark firmness (N); soluble solids (°Brix); titratable acidity (g citric acid 100 g-1 of pulp-1); pulp yield; and ratio SS/TA. Fruits at stage 3 showed larger diameters, less firmness, and better chromaticity means. Fruits at stages 2 and 3 had eight days of postharvest life. However, fruits at stage 2 took longer for 50% of the fruits to be ready for consumption. The results demonstrate that stages 2 and 3 can be determinants for the harvest time of sugar apples.",

The F3:4 and F4:5 progenies that originated from the two crosses were evaluated in the 2015/16 and 2016/17 agricultural years, respectively, using the pedigree method. The experimental design utilized augmented blocks, while statistical analyses were performed by using the REML/BLUP methodology. The evaluated traits were plant height at maturity (APM), insertion height of first pod (AIV), lodging (AC), agronomic value (VA), number of pods per plant (NV), number of days to maturity (NDM), number of branches (NR), number of nodes (NN), 100-seed weight (PCS), and grain yield per plant (PG). The best progenies were selected, and the following genetic parameters were estimated: genetic variance, phenotypic variance, heritability, and selective accuracy. The estimates of the genetic parameters indicate the presence of high genetic variance in these populations. Heritability was high for most of the traits, indicating good potential for the selection of superior genotypes.",

We aimed to explore valuable diversity for the drought tolerance, existed in the core collection of Iranian spring bread wheat landraces. A number of 206 spring bread wheat accessions along with the check cultivar were assessed for grain yield, drought-adaptive traits, and estimated drought tolerance criteria during 2016-17 and 2017-18 growing seasons. Analysis of data using the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) approach revealed that the genotype x environment (GE) interactions accounted for the highest variation in grain yield (36.23%) followed by 1000-kernel weight (35.39%), heading date (21.4%), days to maturity (16.38%), and plant height (5.83%). Using the hierarchical cluster analysis and developed pattern heat map based on the values for the agronomic traits and drought resistance indices, the accessions clustered into nine groups of different sets of agronomic and drought tolerance characteristics. Several accessions with high yield potential, early heading, optimal plant stature and high drought tolerance groups were identified. Three drought selection criteria of stress tolerance index (STI), geometric mean productivity (GMP) and mean productivity (MP) were more effective in identifying accessions producing higher yield under both drought and irrigated conditions. The superior accessions identified in this study may be explored further for breeding new wheat cultivars with enhanced level of drought tolerance.",

For this, an experiment was carried out with pots in a greenhouse using a Cambisol and Nitisol to cultivate the soybean from January to May 2019 until seed production. The seeds were harvested, ground, and sieved through a 1 mm mesh sieve to determine the nutrient, phytate, and crude protein contents. The effects of the rock dusts on the chemical composition of seeds were directly related to the chemical characteristics of the evaluated soils. The tested rock dusts had a more pronounced response in the Cambisol (poorer soil) than in the Nitisol (more fertile). The contents and accumulation of nutrients in the seeds, as well as the total dry matter production in both soils subjected to the treatments with the rock dusts olivine melilitite and siltstone + olivine melilitite, pure and combined with manure, were similar and, in some cases, higher than the treatments subjected to conventional fertilization. The combination of manure and rock dusts provided an increase in the concentration of nutrients in both soils, resulting in their higher availability for plants and directly reflecting on the chemical composition of seeds.",

This study describes physiological and cytological profiles of J. curcas seeds imbibed in water restriction conditions by means of osmotic stress or osmoconditioning. Seeds were characterized by size, weight, moisture content and dry mass, germinability, and cell cycle activation by means of tubulin and microtubule cytoskeleton accumulation. Osmoconditioning at -0.8 MPa did not induce priming effects as it did not improve the physiological quality of the seed lots. Western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis revealed an increasing accumulation of tubulin and microtubule cytoskeleton in seeds imbibed in water for 48h onwards, culminating in the onset of mitotic configurations after germination. Only cortical microtubules were observed during seed osmoconditioning, whereas mitotic microtubules only occurred after re-imbibition of osmoconditioned seeds in water and subsequent germination.",

Alcohol-insoluble solids and pectin were very similar, with the highest levels detected at the green and turning stages, and the lowest levels occurring at the fully ripe stage. The amount of total fiber was consistent at the green, turning, and ripe stages, but declined at the fully ripe stage. These changes correlated with the pectinase activities, the profiles of which resembled those of other species of the Solanaceae family during fruit ripening. However, cubiu fruits were significant sources of dietary fiber at all stages. The reducing sugar content reached the highest level at the turning stage, with glucose as the major sugar. The content of nonreducing sugars, such as sucrose, remained low at all stages. The other physicochemical indices displayed increases during ripening, characterizing cubiu as a very acidic fruit with a small degree of sweetness.",

Trials were conducted for two growing seasons under field conditions in a 3 x 4 factorial, randomized, complete block design, with four replications. For each material, treatments consisted of the combination of row spacing (0.225, 0.35, and 0.45 m) with nitrogen (N) applied as topdressing (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1). The lowest row spacing (0.225 m) for genotypes 07SEQCL441 CL and BRS Esmeralda provided a higher number of tillers, number of panicles m-2, and grain yield of rice. Increasing rates of N in the topdressing improved the rice grain yield for both cultivars, but for 07SEQCL441 CL, the grain yield was positively affected only to applications up to 50 kg N ha-1. Row spacing and N rates did not affect the rice grain quality. Therefore, these results indicate that the narrowest row spacing used (0.225 m) with N fertilization as topdressing increased the rice grain yield most in the no-tillage system.",

Therefore, it is important to use methods that diagnose the nutritional status of plants through chemical leaf analysis, considering the relationships between nutrients and taking advantage of productivity and nutritional monitoring data from orchards. This study aimed to establish norms and ranges of nutrient sufficiency for ‘Nanica’ banana trees in Vale do Ribeira, São Paulo state, using the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) method. Productivity data and chemical analysis of the leaf tissue of 291 commercial plots of Nanica banana trees, collected between 2015 and 2020 in Vale do Ribeira, were used. The DRIS method was used to establish norms and sufficiency ranges for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn. Fruit yield did not correlate with the average nutritional balance index (NBIa), indicating that its variation was affected by non-nutritional factors. The contents of K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn showed high correlations with their respective nutritional indices. The sufficiency ranges and adequate nutrient contents differed from the values established for bananas in the literature.",

In this study, photosynthetical rates of ten different leaves of a coffee plant were obtained during a day. The daily variation in photosynthetic rates showed a peak between 7:00 h and 9:00 h with higher values measured for the leaves positioned at the sunrise direction and northern orientation. Lower values were consistently observed for leaves at inner position of the plant. After 9:00 h, despite the increase in photosynthetically active radiation, photosynthetic rates decreased steadily to reach negligible values at sunset. The reductions on photosynthesis rates can also be attributed to increasing stomatal resistance. Since number of leaves is highly variable in coffee plants, those results make evident how difficult is to integrate and estimate whole plant photosynthesis by taking the average of 10 leaves.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of canonical correlations measures the existence and the intensity of the association between two groups of variables or characters of importance. This study aimed to estimate the intensity in the association between the agronomic and industrial characters in sugarcane. The analysis of canonic correlations allowed to conclude that clones with bigger number of stalks per parcel, greater number of stalks per stool tend to provide an increase in the TCH production. Another conclusion was that shorter clones with larger diameter, greater number of stalks per stool and plants, are determinant in increasing TCH, brix and pol% characteristics.",

This study was carried out to verify the effect of environmental conditions and crop cultivation on chemical composition and their consequences in cup quality of coffees from region of Jesuítas, Paraná State. During the same crop season this study was accomplished (2002-2003), cup quality was evaluated among the producers in several coffee-growing municipalities in Paraná State. It was observed that 86% of samples were classified simply as “soft” (smooth flavor) or “hard” (bolder flavor), and 14% were classified as rioysh/rio (strong unpleasant taste). The results concluded that the practices adopted by producers, who have collaborated with the study, reflected positively on the final cup quality, when compared to the overall quality results in the State. The climatic conditions and practices of crop management and harvest in the Jesuitas region made for bolder coffee with low acidity, comparable to high quality coffees produced in Brazil and abroad.",

    "abstract": "The fungus Sclerotium rolfsii causes major economic losses in agriculture. Due to the resistance structures (sclerotia) production in soil, this pathogen is difficult to be controlled in field. Furthermore, new reports of active ingredients to control of this pathogen are scarces in literature. The objective of the present work was to verify the existence of fungitoxic activity in Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) with future potential of study to control S. rolfsii. Assays were carried out in vitro (laboratory) and in vivo (growth chamber). In vitro, sclerotia of the pathogen were placed in contact with hydroethanolic and aqueous extracts of leaves and stem of M. charantia for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. To the control, sclerotia were placed in flasks without extract. After each time, the survival of sclerotia was evaluated in specific culture medium. In vivo, the activity of the extracts was investigated preventively and curatively (application at 6 and 3 days before the planting; at the day of planting, and at 3 and 6 days after the planting), and the extracts also were applied in seed treatment to the pathosystem common bean cv. Carioquinha versus S. rolfsii. The efficacy of the extracts was evaluated by disease severity. The hydroethanolic and aqueous extracts inhibited 100% of germination of sclerotia in vitro in a period from 0-7 days. When applied at 6 and 3 days before planting, the hydroethanolic extract reduced 74% of disease severity. These results showed fungitoxic activity in bitter gourd aerial part that could be potentially studied to control of S. rolfsii, preferably applied preventively.",

The statistical diagnostic of the OLS (Ordinary Least Square regression model) was employed to determine the most suitable regression model to predict corn yield. The SAR (Spatial Lag Model) was recommended for all crop years; however, the Spatial Error Model (CAR) was recommended only for the 2013/2014 crop year. The SAR and CAR spatial regressions chosen to predict corn yield in the various years had better results when compared to a regression model that does not incorporate data spatial autocorrelation (OLS).

Nodules were field collected from 20 plants of each species. The isolated strains were characterized morphologically, their 16S rRNA gene was partially sequenced, and their symbiotic ability was authenticated in siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum). Despite being in the same climate and soil conditions, gliricidia and sombreiro are nodulated by different rhizobia genera, with Rhizobium predominant in gliricidia and Bradyrhizobium in sombreiro. Endophytic strains also colonized nodules in the field. Approximately 60% of Rhizobium strains did not nodulate siratro, whereas all Bradyrhizobium strains did. Native strains isolated from gliricidia nodules had low efficiency, and only four strains isolated from sombreiro nodules were efficient in siratro. These results highlight the importance of symbiotic relationships in the regulation of biological nitrogen fixation.",

Sodium hypochlorite (2.5%) with or without 70% alcohol was used to avoid contamination because it was not toxic to murici embryos. Water-agar was the most appropriate culture medium for bud germination, and 50% WPM was appropriate for seedling growth.",

The model simulates growth, development and yield components of beans as a function of daily climatologic elements for each soil’s specific conditions. It is possible to affirm that water deficit during flowering caused the model to penalize yield severely. It showed discrepant values in leaf area index simulation, and also accentuated discrepancies between measured and simulated values of soil moisture on the day following rainfall. Correlations between measured and simulated values of soil moisture exceeded 70% in both experiments. Yield was underestimated by the model in both experiments.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is a self-sufficient specie in nitrogen acquisition due to their efficient association with diazotrophs. Unlike bean, which requires nitrogen supplementation, soybean is not dependent on nitrogen fertilization. This interspecies difference may be related to the allocation pattern of photosynthates during their growth cycles. Distinct from soybean, common bean cannot maintain their active nodules until the end of their growth cycle due to the unavailability of photosynthates in their roots after flowering. To compare the partitioning of the phytomass in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) species during their ontogenetic cycles, a growth analysis experiment were conducted with Favorita BRS and BRS Pontal varieties, respectively. The results revealed that soybeans keep producing leaves, branches and roots even after flowering, indicating no limitation in the supply of photosynthates to its organs, especially to the roots, where a predominant allocation of photosynthates can favor nodule activity. After flowering in bean plants, allocation preferentially occurs to the pods at the expense of the other organs including the roots, which potentially affects their nodule activity.",

The experimental design for Study 1 was fully randomized in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement (phenological stage x age of the 4th, 5th and 6th trifoliate at the time of inoculation), and in Study 2, the experimental design was fully randomized with five treatments (T) and four replicates. The variables assessed were disease severity, number of lesions, uredinia per lesion, and viable spores. In Study 1, it was observed that disease severity was lower when the plant was in the growth stage V6 (11.4%), compared to the reproductive stage R4 (16.9%). The regression for disease severity and leaf age at the time of inoculation showed that older trifoliates on the plants in the reproductive stage exhibited higher severity. However, in Study 2, for trifoliates of the same age on plants of different ages, the trifoliates of younger plants were more susceptible to the disease. It was concluded that soybean plant susceptibility to soybean rust was directly proportional to the age of the trifoliate on a given plant and the phenological stage of the plant at the time of inoculation.",

A homogeneous water depth was applied using a triple-line sprinkling irrigation system under a gradual TSW application, using the following TSW and water ratios: E5 = 1.0; E4 = 0.87; E3 = 0.6; E2 = 0.31, E1 = 0.11, and E0 = 0.0.

Forage yield had marked seasonality, with the highest values in summer (35.9 to 44.7%) and spring (35.7 to 38.4%) and the lowest ones during the fall-winter seasons (19.6 to 25.7%). Despite the high nitrogen rates (1,132 kg ha-1), maximum forage yield was not achieved, hence further nitrogen increments would still enhance yield.

Fifty EST-SSR markers were used for the analysis of genetic diversity across the recurrent selection cycles, 16 of which were polymorphic. Thirty-four alleles were detected, with an average of 2.13 alleles per locus. Throughout all the recurrent selection cycles, there was a reduction in heterozygosity and an increase in inbreeding.

The increase in N provided greater DM and crude protein content and reduced the fiber content in neutral detergent. The source of N did not affect the chemical composition, and therefore, it is recommended to use urea due to the ease of acquisition and higher economic return. The production of Mombasa silage can be economically viable due to high DM and crude protein content combined with low production costs.

In each location, yacon was planted in four different seasons, fall (April), winter (July), spring (September) and summer (December). We collected primary dry matter accumulation data for different parts of the plant and the leaf area at 30 day intervals. We used these values to calculate the following morphophysiological indexes: specific leaf area, leaf area index, tillage growth rate and net assimilation rate. We concluded that planting in the fall in mountainous or lowland sites favoured the growth and development of yacon. Cultivation in mountainous regions, regardless of the planting season, promoted a greater mass accumulation of tuberous roots, which may be reflected in higher productivity. Both fall and winter planting in the mountainous region allows root harvesting at the same time.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian popcorn has low genetic variability and the successful development of advanced lines, new popcorn cultivars with high grain yield (GY) and expansion volume (PE) is dependent on parental selection and precise determination of heterotic groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variability and identify heterotic groups in synthetic populations of popcorn, using diallel crosses. Thus, nine synthetic populations were crossed using complete diallel scheme. The GY and PE traits of 36 hybrids and reciprocals were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with 72 treatments and two replicates in two years. The effects of non-additive genes were the most important in the genetic control of these traits, indicating a favorable situation to produce hybrids. The reciprocal effect is mainly due to non-maternal effects for GY and PE. The highest GY values were obtained for the 02 x 08, 04 x 09, 05 x 09, and 01 x 09 crosses and the highest PE were obtained for the 07 x 01 and 03 x 04 crosses. The exploitation of synthetic populations from S3 lines can be an alternative to increase the genetic variability for grain yield and popping expansion in popcorn breeding programs.",

This study estimated the magnitude of association and interdependence between two trait groups of clones of two varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes. The study was based on the mean data of eight characteristics from two experiments to test the performance of these clones: the first experiment provided data from seven clones of Cabernet Sauvignon, which evaluated in the northern San Joaquin Valley, California, United States, and the second data set was from six clones of the Chardonnay variety, which were evaluated in the Napa Valley, California, United States. The canonical correlations among the two varieties were significant, indicating that the two groups of characteristics were related or not independent. The quality and quantity of the raw material required for fine-wine production were inversely proportional and specific to each variety. For Cabernet Sauvignon, the high number of berries per bunch and high number of bunches per plant resulted in fruits with a high °Brix level and increased pH. For Chardonnay, the increase in the bunch weight and number of berries decreased the fruit pH.",

Therefore, it is necessary to adopt postharvest strategies to ensure oil quality. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of drying macauba fruit on the quality of the pulp oil. Husked and dehusked fruits were dried at 60°C and then stored. At 0, 15, 45, 100, and 180 days after storage, fruit samples were retrieved, and the oil from the pulp was evaluated for physicochemical parameters. The removal of the husk from the fruits considerably reduced the drying time compared to that of the husked fruits. Drying prevented deterioration of the fruit even after 180 days of storage, regardless of the presence of the husk. The drying process allowed for efficient storage of the macauba fruit while maintaining low levels of oil acidity. Furthermore, the oxidative stability of the pulp oil from the dehusked dried fruits lasted longer than that from the husked dried fruits. Therefore, drying is a viable alternative for the postharvest of macauba fruits to maintain the quality of the oil for biodiesel production.",

NP is defined by summing throughfall and stemflow, which have been collected after each rain event and accumulated monthly. Soil moisture measurements were carried out monthly up to a depth of 1.00 m and then integrated to obtain the SWC. The exponential semivariogram model was fitted for both hydrological variables, and the goodness-of-fit was assessed by a cross-validation procedure, spatial dependence degree (SDD) and spatial dependence index (SDI). This model provided adequate performance for SWC and NP mapping according to the cross-validation statistics. Based on the SDD, both variables have been classified as a ‘strong spatial dependence structure’. Nevertheless, when the SDI was assessed, NP showed less spatial dependence, while the SWC maintained almost the same performance. Kriging maps pictured the regional climate seasonality due to higher values of both variables in spring and summer than in autumn and winter seasons. However, correlations between NP and SWC are not expressive in the studied period.",

The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of pre-harvest application of calcium chloride on the fruits of ‘Tupy’ blackberry (Rubus spp.). A randomized block design for a factorial scheme was used, i.e. calcium chloride concentrations (0, 1.5, 3, and 4.5%) and number of applications (1, 2, and 3). Multiple applications occurred between 5-day intervals. The results showed that the calcium content in the fruits increased with a single application of 2.2%, but a decrease in mass loss was observed with a 4.5% application. The results also indicated great firmness and ascorbic acid content of fruits of ‘Tupy’ blackberry, in addition to the significant increase in fruit size and mass. However, in general, the content of soluble solids, sugars, antioxidant activity and total polyphenols decreased.",

An experiment was conducted with two strawberry cultivars from two origins grown in four substrate mixtures, totaling 16 treatments, evaluated in a randomized block design with four replications. Mass (MF) and number (NF) of fruits per plant were evaluated as measures of production, and total soluble solids (SST), titratable acidity (AT) and firmness (FIR) of fruits during the crop cycle were evaluated as measures of quality. Subsequently, the repeatability coefficient was estimated by the following methods: analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis using a correlation matrix (PCcor), principal component analysis using a variance-covariance matrix (PCcov) and structural analysis (SA). The number of measurements was adjusted for each studied variable based on determination coefficients of 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95. The repeatability coefficients ranged from low to medium.

To attain these objectives, 204 soybean progenies originating from three populations were examined for various traits of agronomic interest. The inclusion of the population effect in the statistical model was relevant in the genetic evaluation of soybean progenies. To quantify the effectiveness of the FAI-BLUP index, genetic gains were predicted and compared with those obtained by the Smith-Hazel and Additive Genetic indices. The FAI-BLUP index was effective in the selection of progenies with balanced, desirable genetic gains for all traits simultaneously. Therefore, the FAI-BLUP index is an adequate tool for the simultaneous selection of important traits in soybean breeding.",

An experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with a 5 x 12 x 2 factorial scheme corresponding to five levels of water salinity (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 dS m-1) applied in 12 citrus rootstocks grafted with two scion varieties: ‘Tahiti’ acid lime and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit.

Five experiments were carried out in hydroponics to identify the initiation of nodulation and nitrogenase activity in common bean cultivars, and the effects of additions of mineral N on plant nodulation and growth. Three experiments evaluated the initial growth of five inoculated bean cultivars in the absence or presence of mineral N, and two experiments evaluated the effect of the moment of mineral N addition until the beginning of reproductive stage. The first root nodules appeared 10 days after plant transplant (DAT) and nitrogenase activity initiated 11 DAT. Cultivars of large seeds had lower initial nodulation and nitrogenase activity than those of small seeds. Inoculated plants showed limited shoot growth that lasted until 21-25 DAT as compared to inoculated plants receiving mineral N. Addition of mineral N reduced nodule mass more intensively than nodule number and more strongly nitrogenase activity. Nitrogen applied until 15 DAT enhanced nodulation and nitrogenase activity without limiting shoot growth, as compared to plants receiving N throughout their growth. Otherwise, plants that received N after 15 DAT had lower nodule mass and nitrogenase activity than plants only inoculated. The results indicate that symbiotic N did not suffice to an adequate growth of common beans and some supplemental N is necessary. This N should be added in the beginning of growth cycle to stimulate plant growth without inhibiting further nodulation and N fixation.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic stress interferes with plant-microbial interactions, but some microorganisms may buffer this interference. We investigated the interaction between temperature and bacterial wilt (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens - Cff) biocontrol and the ability of Bacillus subtilis strain ALB629 to colonize bean seedlings, to inhibit pathogen growth and to use different C and N sources. B. subtilis ALB629rif, a mutant selected from the wild population of ALB629, was used to monitor plant colonization at 20°C and 30°C. ALB629rif was detected only in the plant roots (103.22 CFU g-1) at the lower temperature but colonized the roots, stems, and leaves (105.85, 104.48, and 104.01 CFU g-1), respectively, at 30ºC. The area under the disease progress curve was also different at the two tested temperatures (p &lt; 0.01). Nevertheless, the disease reduction using ALB629rif - treated seeds was similar: 71% and 75%, respectively, at 20 and 30ºC (p &lt; 0.01). A higher efficiency of C and N source utilization was observed at the higher temperature, but the antagonist inhibited Cff growth equally at either temperature in vitro. Based on our results, temperature interferes with pathogen and antagonist plant colonization, but the overall suppression of bacterial wilt appears to be stabilized by ALB629.",

Six parents (two genotypes of CBB-resistant dry bean and four susceptible snap bean accessions) were crossed in a complete diallel scheme without reciprocals to estimate the general and specific ability to Xap resistance. CBB resistance was evaluated by the inoculation with two Xap isolates, and its severity was evaluated based on the four following resistance components: area under the disease progress curve; scores in the leaves; latent period and diameter of pod lesion. Differences between the two isolates were observed considering all the disease components. Besides pathogen variability, significant GCA and SCA indicate that additive and non-additive effects are involved in Xap-resistance control for the evaluated genotypes, implying that CBC resistance is a trait with complex inheritance. For breeding purposes, the result demonstrates the need to apply breeding methods that are focused on advanced generations selection.",

The seeds from stage 5 showed a higher rate of germination 30 days after sowing than did the seeds from stage 3. Treatment with CEPA decreased seed germination, apparently due to decreased starch mobilization; the opposite response was observed following KNO3 treatment. GA3, alone or in combination with KNO3, stimulated an increase in lipid mobilization. In general, with the exception of CEPA, all growth regulators tested were effective in overcoming seed dormancy, and KNO3 was the most effective.

The dendrometric variables analyzed presented normal distribution throughout the entire production cycle according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The spherical model adequately represented the spatial distribution of dendrometric characteristics for the planted forest.

Seeds were collected from the cities of Painel and Urubici in Santa Catarina State and tested for moisture content, 1000-seed weight, emergence, emergence speed index (ESI), root and shoot length, electrical conductivity, tetrazolium, soluble carbohydrates, and starch content. Among the varieties cited above, the angustifolia variety from Painel displayed a greater 1000-seed weight, ESI, electrical conductivity and shoot length.

In conclusion, there is great diversity in A. angustifolia seeds. The angustifolia and caiova varieties displayed similar diversity, and their physiological quality was better than that of other varieties.

Therefore, it is essential to accurately assess the ploidy of all breeding materials. Increased DNA content is known to have various effects on external and internal morphology, an effect known as the “nucleotypic effect”. Thus, anatomical assessment can be used as a tool for determining ploidy in plants, making the chromosome counting technique or flow cytometry unnecessary. This study aimed to evaluate the leaf anatomical characteristics of banana cultivars and understand the relationship between these features and ploidy levels. Thirteen accessions were evaluated, including diploid, triploid, and tetraploid genotypes, and cultivars, resulting from in vitro propagation after 90 days of acclimatization. Five fully expanded young leaves were collected from each cultivar, fixed in FAA70 (formaldehyde–acetic acid–ethanol) and preserved in 70% alcohol. Transverse and paradermal sections of the abaxial and adaxial regions were taken, and variables such as size and stomatal density, leaf thickness in the midrib and fourth vascular bundle region, and thickness of the epidermis, hypodermis, and parenchyma were measured. Results for leaf thickness, stomatal size, and density proved to be appropriate parameters for characterizing banana ploidy levels.",

In this study, the objective was to select the most promising genotypes for their future use in AFS based on the additive index, a pioneering method for this crop. The trial was carried out for 12 years in an agroforestry system in the municipality of Tomé-Açu, Pará State, Brazil. The 16 evaluated clones were completely randomised with a variable number of repetitions. The average number of fruits produced as well as the morpho-agronomic characteristics of the fruits were analysed. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the components of variance and predict the genotypic values. The genetic correlation between the variables was estimated, and the selection of genotypes was based on the additive index, with a positive orientation of all variables except the thickness of the fruit shells and the weight of the fruits. Clones 42, 44, 46, 47, 57, 61, and 64 performed well for all the analysed variables, resulting in a selection gain of 7.3% and low incidence rates of witches’ broom disease.

Thus, this study aimed to obtain desorption and adsorption isotherms of soybean grains to determine the mathematical model that best fits the experimental data and analyze the hysteresis phenomenon. Soybean grains with a moisture content of 21.95% (db) were used to verify the desorption process. The grains were dried until 3.50% (db) for the adsorption process. The static-gravimetric method was employed to determine the equilibrium moisture content of the grain at different temperatures (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50°C) and relative humidity levels (0.10 to 0.92%). Eight mathematical models were fitted to the experimental data. The modified Halsey model satisfactorily represented the desorption and adsorption phenomena of soybean grains. The equilibrium moisture content of soybean grains increased along with an increment in water activity. The increase in temperature led to a reduction in the equilibrium moisture content of soybean grains at a constant water activity. The equilibrium moisture content values obtained by desorption are higher than those obtained by adsorption, indicating the hysteresis phenomenon at the studied temperature range. The isotherms obtained for the desorption and adsorption process were classified as type III because of the high oil content in soybean grains.",

During the study period, second-season corn was cultivated for two years and fertilized with urea, for which the N losses through ammonia volatilization, soil pH, leaf N content, and N uptake values were quantified. The losses through ammonia volatilization were subjected to nonlinear regression using a logistic model, and the other variables were subjected to linear regressions. The lime applied by broadcasting on the soil surface in the NT increased the pH of the topsoil and increased N losses via NH3-N volatilization in the second-season corn. Further, the N losses in the NT treated with lime accounted for 58% of the applied N, which increased by 2.3 to 2.5% for each Mg ha-1 of lime applied.

A randomized complete block design was used, with three replications, in a split-plot experiment. The plots received four rates of N applied as top dressing: 30, 60, 90 and 120kg ha-1. The subplots were constituted by four application forms: surface-applied urea, incorporated urea, surface-applied ammonium sulfate and surface-applied urea + ammonium sulfate. The N rates led to a linear increase in corn yield, number of grains per ear, ear weight per plant, grain weight per ear, and weight of 1000 grains. Urea, surface-applied or incorporated, and surface-applied ammonium sulfate performed similarly in nutrition and corn grain yield.",

Despite the importance of this crop to Brazilian agriculture very little is known about the factors involved in the production of commercial roots. The objective of this work was to identify which variables are related to the yield of commercial roots, using path analysis. The following variables were evaluated: yield of commercial roots (YCR), length of the root (LR), diameter of the root (DR), number of commercial roots (NRC), weight of the aerial part (WAP), yield of non commercial roots (YNCR), resistance to the root borer (RRB), and resistance to the white rust (RWR). The results showed that DR is main variable responsible for the YCR variation. The variables LR, NRC, WAP, YNCR, RRB, and RWR did not present significant effects on the YCR.",

To study the losses it was used the crop life table. The average yield was high (3386.59kg/ha). The most productive cultivars were CO 34, Mitla 9742, XB 7012, HTEP 22, P 30F80, Hata 2025, and XB 7070. The total cumulative loss was 33.92%. The production component in which happened larger loss was the grain, followed by the ovules, plants, and ears. The critical component of losses was the grain. The key-factor of losses in the grains was the attack of Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) followed by the attack of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Agromen 3150, CO 32, HTEP 22, Dina 1000, C 855, P 3027 and CO 9560 were the cultivars less attacked by S. zeamais, while AG 9010, XL 357, HTP 02, Agromen 3100, CO 9560 and P 30F80 were less damaged by H. zea. The cultivars HTEP 22 and P30F80 were the most productive among the cultivars and less damaged by S. zeamais and H. zea, respectively. The insect-pests with highest densities on the canopies on the plant were Dalbulus maidis (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), Diabrotica speciosa adults (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and Spodoptera frugiperda larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The most abundant natural enemy was the predator Doru luteipes (Dermaptera: Forficulidae). The densities of these insects were similar among the cultivars",

    "abstract": "The equidistant space arrangement of plants in a productive system is fundamental once it is one of the essential factors for the plant to explore the available resources and display all its production potential. The space arrangement of the plants in the area is achieved by means of interaction of the spacing among lines and plants on the line, resulting in the ideal population per area unit for each cultivar and / or hybrid. However in most work performed it is noticed a variation in the spacing among lines only keeping fixed the sparing among plants in the line or vice-versa. The present study aims to define population arrangements for corn cultivation in Mato Grosso do Sul State. The experiment was conducted in the agricultural year 2001/2002, at Idaterra experimental land located in Campo Grande - MS. The soil was latossolo dark red. The treatments were all obtained by the interaction of 40cm, 50cm, 60cm, 70cm and 80cm spacing among lines with the following population densities: 50.000, 62.500, 75.000 and 87.500 corn plants per hectare. The experimental delineation used was casual blocks, divided parts and the sub-parts by population densities. The corn culture used was AG 9010, super precocious cycle, simple hybrid, short size and semi-erect leaves. There was no significant interaction between spacing and population density. In relation to the characteristics forming the return components of grains in corn cultivation, it did not have significant effect for the espaçamento between lines. However, in the variation of the population density, it occurred. The was a significant rise in the number of NE/ha as the population of plants/ha rose. The opposite happened for NFE, NGF and RGE, where the bigger the population densities, the smaller the profit components. The results for grain return indicated that bigger and heavier corncobs are not directly related to higher production",

The physiological quality of corn seeds was evaluated by using the germination test (first counting and final counting), accelerated aging, modified cold test and electrical conductivity. The results obtained in this study has revealed that there was no significant effect on the treatment using micronutrients concerning the productivity and weight of 1000 seeds of all the hybrids tested. However, there was an increase on the germination and vigor of the seeds produced in the sublots which received the micronutrient-seed treatment, whose results can vary according to the evaluated corn hybrid and seed germination and vigor tests.",

The experiment was installed in Cascavel, State of Paraná, in the agricultural year of 2004/05. It was studied three row spacings (0.45; 0.67 and 0.90m), with a population of 55000 plants ha-1. The experiment design used was that of randomized blocks with four repetitions, in a split plot scheme. It was used 13 combinations of seven nitrogen doses (8; 20; 40; 80; 120; 140 e 152 kg ha-1 of N) with seven potassium doses (3; 7.5; 15; 30; 45; 52.5 e 57 kg ha-1 of K2O), adding 39 treatments. The reduction of interlineations spacing of 0.90 m to 0.45 m maintaining the same population in each area caused the increase of whole dry biomass production, more efficiency in the nitrogen and potassium absorption and also more efficiency in using N and K in the grain. The grain productivity was statistically the same in the three spacings studied. It was verified a linear increase in the productivity and of the dry biomass production in the aerial part until the doses of 152 kg ha-1 of N in covering. The fertilization with potassium proportioned an increase of dry biomass production in the aerial part, but does not influenced in the productivity. Over 80 kg ha-1 doses of N and 30 kg ha-1 of K2O resulted in a smaller efficiency in using nitrogen and potassium fertilization.",

The fruits were stored for 30, 60 and 90 days under a temperature of 3ºC and 90-95% relative humidity (RH). After the cold storage the fruits were submitted under the temperature of 8±0.5ºC and RH between 75-80%, during four days to simulate the commercialization. The evaluated variables were: weight loss; color; pH; soluble solids (SS); titratable acidity (TA); SS/TA ratio; rottenness; physiological disorders; juice of revenue and sensorial characteristics. The oranges treated with wax without dilution showed higher indication of acquisition. The general quality after 90 days of cold storage was higher in oranges treated with wax. The use of carnauba wax without dilution in oranges Navelina intensifies the brilliancy of the flavedo, reduces the weight loss and the percentage of rottenness and permits the storage for 90 days without compromising the sensorial quality of the fruits.",

This operation is the main source of error in determining drying rates, due to the interruption of the drying process or the sample losses during the weighing stage. In this work, the automation of thin-layer grain drying control is proposed through the use of a system based on a load cell and on addressable electronic devices. The results are recorded in a file and compared with the final pre-defined values for the drying process. The process is terminated when there is no significant difference between the measured values and the pre-defined ones.

Thus, relief information such as slope and water-saturated areas, land use in two scenarios, in 1986 and 2005, and their respective procedures, were crossed. The results indicated that in 1986 and 2005, land use was represented by native forest, pasture and forestry, with a transition: pasture and native forest are being replaced by forestry. In the studied area, medium wavy relief is predominant, i. e., 20 to 32.5% slope, and water-saturated areas represent 25% of total area. The highly erosion-susceptible areas evolved during the 19-year interval, and the Atibainha watershed presented the highest indices. The identification of erosion-susceptible areas using historical series provides data useful in assisting the recognition of the region’s reality, pointing ways for agriculture-environment planning.",

    "abstract": "Thanatephorus target spot is one of the most important diseases of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) in the Amazon region of Brazil. In addition to rubber tree, the fungus Thanatephorus cucumeris (anamorphase = Rhizoctonia solani) causes several foliar diseases on other agricultural crops or native species in the region. Based on the lack of information on which anastomosis groups (AG) of R. solani are associated with rubber tree and other hosts in the Amazon, we tested the hypothesis that these isolates belong to distinct AGs. There is no information about the cross pathogenicity (to rubber tree) of isolates from other hosts. The AG was determined based on phylogenetic analyses of the ITS region of the rDNA. We concluded that a new subgroup of R. solani (the AG-2-2 Hb) is the main pathogen causing the rubber tree leaf spot. However, isolates from other AGs (AG-1 IB and ID, AG-4 HGI) and from Ceratobasidium sp. (binucleate Rhizoctonia sp. AG-R) from distinct hosts can also infect the rubber tree. This implicates in diversity of inoculum sources for the survival and spread of the leaf spot pathogens. For the very first time, we report the occurrence of a new AG of R. solani infecting citrus in Acre, Brazil, which is distinct from all the others already described worldwide (probably AG-14).",

On average, three shoots emerged per stem between December and February, while other four shoots appeared in two periods between July and September: two shoots between July and August, and two other shoots between August and September. This pattern of vegetative flush occurred during an atypical year, with high water deficit (between April and November) and increase in air temperature starting in May. The number of leaves per stem increased following the same seasonal pattern of shoot emergence. The amount of purely vegetative shoots (given by the ratio between number of leaves and number of shoots) was 2.5 times higher on the first flush in relation to the others. The main vegetative flush responsible for stem growth and increase of leaf area occurred during the summer. Stem growth was interrupted by endogenous aspects (summer) and by unfavorable environmental conditions (winter). There were no differences between the evaluated variables when comparing canopy positions.",

The C. rotundus extracts were prepared using leaves and roots by alcoholic extraction, aqueous (hot water) extraction and aqueous (cold water) extraction and diluted to four different concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15% of the volume of each extract). These dilutions were then tested and compared with a control. The higher mortality of D. speciosa adults as well as a smaller leaf consumption area were observed after treatments with increasing dosages of different C. rotundus extracts generated by alcoholic extraction (55% of mortality and 28% leaf consumption). Therefore, the alcoholic extract of the C. rotundus foliage is an option for the control of D. speciosa in agroecologic systems.",

    "abstract": "The terracing of agricultural land is the most widespread mechanical practice used among farmers in the control of water erosion. The objective of this paper was to carry out a comparative analysis between mixed terraces and level and graded terraces. The dimensioning of level terraces was carried out based on the surface runoff volume, while the graded terrace dimensions were based on the maximum runoff flow rate. For the mixed terraces, the dimensioning was carried by considering two surface runoff hydrographs, one for the determination of the terrace channel capacity and another to estimate the flow rate at the extremity of the terrace channel. Therefore, in order to contain and transport the excess volume, an additional value was calculated and added to the depth of the channel. A case study was performed for the Uberaba, Minas Gerais State (Brazil) rainfall conditions, considering events with return periods of 10, 30, and 50 years. The obtained results provided quantitative evidence that mixed terraces have a lower height than level terraces and a higher level than the graded terraces, resulting in direct consequences for the soil movement for the terrace construction.",

Seeds were inoculated in MS medium with different concentrations of sucrose (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 g L-1). The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial experiment 4 x 5, with five replicates for treatments. Contamination, germination and seedling growth were evaluated. The results of the analysis of variance indicate that there were no significant interactions among factors. There was no significance for sucrose concentrations on contamination but these treatments showed significant differences for seed germination and seedling growth (p &le; 0.01). At higher sucrose concentrations there was lower germination and smaller seedlings. There were significant differences between the treatments with sodium hypochlorite for all traits analysed (p &le; 0.01). There was low contamination with the increase in sodium hypochlorite concentrations with higher germination percentage and taller seedlings.",

The peach palm has high tillering and no post-harvest oxidation. An experiment in a randomized block design with 72 progenies of peach palm, 36 replications and a single tree plot was performed for five years at the experimental field of Embrapa in the Western Amazon. Genetic parameters were estimated using two mixed models, one based on progeny means and the second on joint information from crops. A repeatability analysis, genotype selection, and progeny selection were performed; the Mulamba and Mock selection index was determined; and Tocher's clustering method was applied. The repeatability analysis revealed the existence of genetic variability, low repeatability, which ranged from 0.3307 to 0.6698 for five years. The analysis performed through the progeny means showed a heritability that varied from 51% to 23% for in all variables; the clustering revealed two groups. The progeny selection should be the main selection strategy, and crosses of superior progenies of different groups should be emphasized.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of osmotic-priming on the uniformity of seed germination. First, we evaluated the percentage of normal seedlings from two seed samples harvested in 2011 and 2012. The seeds harvested in 2012 produced 71.4% normal seedlings and thus they were used in the next experiments. The seeds were subjected to osmotic stress using five concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) at -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, and -1.0 MPa in contrast with distilled water. Based on these first results, only -0.8 and -1.0 MPa were evaluated in the third experiment. The seeds were immersed in both concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) for imbibing at 20ºC for four, five, six, and seven days. Thereafter, we evaluated the time to the first normal seedling (Ti), time to the last normal seedling (Tf), percentage normal seedlings at the initial time (Pi) and percentage of normal seedlings at the end of every treatment (Pf). Osmotic priming increased the percentage of normal seedlings of the Stevia rebaudiana and reduced the time to the first and last germination events.",

A study was performed over two crop years to estimate the critical period of weed interference (CPWI) during chickpea production under three doses of nitrogen (N) fertilizer topdressing (0, 50, and 75 kg N ha-1). The experiments were conducted at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 63, and 140 days after emergence (DAE) of chickpea/weed coexistence under two conditions: initially weed-free and initially weed-infested. The presence of weeds negatively affected chickpea production and reduced yields by 70% on average regardless of N rate, rendering the crop economically unfeasible. The CPWI ranged from 5 to 76 DAE and was not affected by N topdressing up to 75 kg N ha-1 in both crop years, assuming an acceptable production loss of 5%. Although the CPWI without fertilization (0 kg N ha-1) was similar to that when fertilized with 50 and 75 kg N ha-1, the two topdressing doses increased chickpea productivity by 37% and 51%, on average, respectively.",

Agronomic and technological traits were evaluated in 36 elite lines of cotton that were cultivated in three environments. Canonical correlations were estimated between two groups of traits: agronomic and technological. Path analysis was performed that considered fiber length as the primary dependent variable. The genotypes presented variability in all the evaluated traits, and no significant genotype vs. environmental interaction was observed for any of them. The main technological traits of cotton crops can be improved by an indirect selection of agronomic traits. The selection of cotton genotypes with a smaller size and a higher mean boll weight can be used to increase fiber length and improve other technological traits. Selection indices containing plant height, mean boll weight, fiber strength, and fiber uniformity can be one of the main strategies for the selection of cotton genotypes with a high yield of cotton bolls and long fibers.",

Thus, Pb phytostabilization is considered to be an attractive remediation technique. Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is an oilseed crop known for its tolerance to heavy metals, and our aim was to assess the early detection of Pb toxicity and the effects of Pb on the biomass, photosynthetic pigments, antioxidative enzyme activities, and total soluble proteins of this plant. Specimens were grown in a nutrient solution spiked with Pb concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 µmol L-1. A control without Pb was also grown. The results show that X-ray chlorophyll fluorescence is an efficient technique for the early detection of photosystem II alterations driven by Pb toxicity. Castor bean was tolerant to the Pb doses tested; plants presented no changes in photosynthetic pigments, defense enzyme activities, or total soluble proteins in leaves. Given its ability to tolerate and accumulate Pb in its roots, castor bean is a viable alternative for phytostabilization and phytoattenuation of lead-contaminated areas. It is also economically attractive for industrial and biofuel oil production while being used for remediation.",

A moderate degree of clonality indicated that the asexual sclerotia represent important source of inoculum. Population subdivision varied within and among countries, fitting the isolation by distance model. While no subdivision was found among populations within Japan or within the Philippines, subdivision was detected among populations within China.

Genetic progress estimation allows evaluation of the effectiveness of genetic improvement of crops and helps in the planning of breeding programs. This paper aims to estimate the genetic yield progress made by the program in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which is run by the Epamig/UFV/Embrapa consortium. A total of 210 lines were evaluated by value for cultivation and use testing that was conducted in the municipalities of Janaúba, Leopoldina, and Lambari, from 1993 to 2016. Based on Vencovsky’s (1986) method, the genetic gains in Lambari, Janaúba, and Leopoldina were 1.46, 0.14, and 0.11%, respectively. The gain in Leopoldina was considered very low during the evaluated period. According to Breseghello’s (1998) method, the annual average genetic gain was 0.23 and 0.04% in Lambari and Janaúba, respectively. In Leopoldina, a yield gain of - 2.37% per year was observed for the evaluation period from 1994 to 1999, and a yield gain of 0.1% per year was observed from 2000 to 2016. These results can be explained by the focus on quality as a strategy for the breeding program in Minas Gerais State in the 1990s.

In this study, mathematical models were used to fit the experimental data of the Muntingia calabura peel drying kinetics, and the effective diffusion coefficient, activation energy and thermodynamic properties of the process were determined. Then, the effect of the drying temperature on the antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of fruit peels was examined using conventional extraction and ultrasonication. Among the analyzed models, the logarithmic model was selected to represent the drying phenomenon of the calabura peel kinetics. The effective diffusion coefficient decreased by 74% as the temperature increased from 40 to 60°C, and the activation energy for liquid diffusion during drying was 23.96 kJ mol-1. The enthalpy and entropy decreased with increasing temperature, while the Gibbs free energy increased by 5% for each 10°C increase in temperature. Regarding the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of the calabura peel, it was observed that an increase in the drying temperature had a positive effect on the conservation of the bioactive compounds, making it possible to conclude that drying at 60°C and ultrasound extraction are the most suitable approach to conduct the process.",

    "abstract": "The potential yield of wheat is mainly determined by temperature, solar radiation and the photothermal quotient. The objective of this study was to determine the temporal and spatial variability of the photothermal quotient and the frost risk to identify suitable sowing dates for wheat in Parana State, Brazil. The results showed that the photothermal quotient has greater spatial variability than temporal variability. The sowing date affects crop conditions that can in turn affect yield. However, the photothermal quotient and frost risk fluctuate differently in different Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU) regions. The regions VCU 1 and VCU 2 showed greater temporal variability of the photothermal quotient. The photothermal quotient ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 MJ m-2 day ºC in VCU 1, from 1.1 to 1.5 MJ m-2 day ºC in VCU 2 and from 1.0 to 1.2 MJ m-2 day ºC in VCU 3. Sowing performed in June provided the greatest photothermal quotient in all VCU regions. However, June sowing increased the frost risk in VCU 1. Thus, the sowing date can be used as a management tool for the attainment of higher yield in wheat.",

Experiments were conducted between April and August in 2007 and 2008. Branches were collected every two weeks from an orchard at Porto Amazonas (Paraná State, Brazil). On the last sampling day, an additional set of branches was collected and refrigerated between 4°C and 7°C for 1,440 hours. Dormancy was evaluated using a biological test of single node cuttings isolated in growth chambers (GC) at 25°C with 16 hours of light exposure. The number of chill hours (CH) and chill units (CU) for the region were recorded. The two species were evaluated in separate experiments. We used 11 completely randomized treatments with four replicas for each species. The peak of endodormancy for the Imperial Gala apple tree buds occurred in early June 2007 and from middle June to early July in 2008. The endodormancy of the Hosui pear tree buds oscillated between April and August in 2007 and peaked between June and early July in 2008.",

A randomized experimental design was conducted in a greenhouse, with five treatments to each tree species (different weed densities per pot per tree species) and four replicates per treatment. After the weeds flowered, the height and stem diameter of seedlings were quantified, including the aboveground dry biomass and the percentages of macro and micronutrients contents in the leaves. The growth of the tree seedlings was affected by the lowest weed density (two weeds per pot) when interacting with U. decumbens or I. grandifolia. In general, significant decreases in the percentage of macro and micronutrients in the leaves were observed, especially at eight weeds/pot. Such results could warrant experimental practices in chemical control in conjunction with alternative methods to control of these two weeds in restored areas.",

    "abstract": "Coffee outturn can be defined as the ratio between the harvested coffee and its respective processed grains. This character is greatly influenced by genotypic and environmental effects, and in breeding programs your analysis is costly and time-consuming. In this sense, the use of an outturn index to estimate coffee yield on experimental plots is a desirable measure aiming at reducing resources and time in postharvest evaluations. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the use of an outturn index equal to 4.0, in the estimation of Conilon coffee grains production. This index indicates that four kilograms of harvested fruit would be needed to obtain one kilogram of processed grains. Based on the average of 157 genotypes conducted in three trials and four harvests, we evaluated the relationship between harvested fruits and processed grains (FcBe), the observed (OGY), and the estimated grain yield per plant (EGY) based on FcBe equal to 4.0 (an outturn index). Descriptive statistics, adequation test for EGY, and the coincidence of occurrence of genotypes observations relating to the top 20% of all observations of OGY and EGY. In the estimation of grain yield in Conilon, the use of FcBe equal to 4.0 showed high precision in the average of the analyzed trials. However, further studies should be conducted to elucidate the effects of climate variables on the yield of Conilon coffee, especially in atypical crop years. Thus, the use of an outturn index becomes interesting in cases where the number of genotypes to be evaluated is very large and a screening of the promising ones is desirable.",

    "abstract": "Chemical control is essential for efficient pest management in coffee crops. Application technologies should safely deliver insecticides to the target whilst protecting the environment, insecticide applicators, and consumers. To achieve these goals, application volumes, hydraulic nozzles, and application techniques should be evaluated. This study assessed the biological efficiency of different spray volumes and spray nozzles used to apply insecticides to control coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) populations. We applied insecticides using a hydropneumatic sprayer with and without an electrostatic spraying system. The experiment followed a randomized block factorial design (2 × 2 + 1) and included two types of spray nozzles [a hollow cone spray nozzle (JA1) and a hollow cone spray nozzle with air induction (TVI)], two spray volumes (200 and 400 L ha-1), one additional treatment (SPE2 nozzle with a 200 system 200 L ha-1), and six replicates. We assessed the control efficiency of the different application methods by evaluating the percentage of fruits damaged 20 and 40 days after the date of application. The spray volume did not affect the biological efficiency of pest control, and the lower spray volume (200 L ha-1) was effective in the control of coffee berry borers. Application of insecticides using coarse droplets was more efficient than the application using very fine and fine droplets. The TVI hydraulic spray nozzle effectively controlled coffee berry borers at 200 and 400 L ha-1. The electrostatic application system performed similarly to the conventional system in terms of the control of the coffee berry borers, and was less efficient than the conventional system under some operational conditions.",

Brassinosteroids, such as epibrassinolide (EBL), have multiple actions in essential processes in plants. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the contributions of EBL to the growth, physiology, and production of tomato plants under salinity. The experiment was conducted in a factorial scheme, with five levels of water salinity (0.5 [the control], 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 dS m-1) and two concentrations of EBL (0 and 10-6 M). Salt stress reduced tomato growth, relative water content, membrane integrity, gas exchange, and fruit production. However, the exogenous application of EBL attenuated the adverse effects, partially improving these characteristics at all salinity levels. EBL reduced electrolyte leakage and increased membrane integrity and relative water content in control and stressed plants. Additionally, it increased the content of photosynthetic pigments, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and photosynthesis, which led to higher leaf dry mass production, fruit transverse diameter, and production per plant. Therefore, our results confirmed that foliar application of EBL improved the characteristics of stressed and non-stressed tomato plants.",

In the case of means tests, it is important to present a type I error that is equal to the nominal pre-fixed level, such that this error remains unchanged across various scenarios, including the number of treatments, number of repetitions, and coefficient of variation. The purpose of this study is to analyse and compare the following multiple comparison tests for the control of both conditional and unconditional type I error rates, depending on a significant F-test in the analysis of variance: Tukey, Duncan, Fisher’s least significant difference, Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK), and Scheffé. As an application, we present a motivation study and develop a simulation study using the Monte Carlo method for a total of 64 scenarios. In each simulated scenario, we estimate the comparison-wise and experiment-wise error rates, conditional and unconditional on a significant result of the overall F-test of analysis of variance for each of the five multiple comparison tests evaluated. The results indicate that the application of the means tests based only on the significance of the F-test should be considered when determining the error rates, as this can change them. In addition, we find that Fisher’s test controls for the comparison-wise error rate, the Tukey and SNK tests control for the experiment-wise error rate, and the Duncan and Fisher tests control for the conditional experiment-wise error rate. Scheffé’s test does not control for any of the error rates considered.",

In the laboratory, seeds harvested at different times were evaluated by mean of standard germination test (first and final count), accelerated aging test, modified cold test, tetrazolium test (1-5 e 1-3), at emergence in sand seedbed and health test (blotter test). There was difference of delayed harvest tolerance behavior among soybean cultivars. Significant reduction (p < 0.05) was observed in seed germination percentage of the fifteen cultivars evaluated for delayed harvest. The best seed quality cultivars harvested at R8 stage of development did not often show higher tolerance to seed deterioration in the field with delayed harvest time. The reduction in seed germination and vigor with delayed harvest was associated to the increase of seed borne fungi infection percentage.",

    "abstract": "The molybdenum and cobalt are essential to nitrogen simbiotic fixation in leguminous and to other physiologic processes in superior plants. Micronutrients application to solve nutritional deficiency can be done through foliar fertilization, seed treatment or directly in the soil, together with conventional fertilization. In this context, an experiment was carried out to evaluate grain yield, protein content of seeds and agronomic traits of soybean plants after foliar fertilization and seed treatment with molybdenum (Mo) and cobalt (Co). For this, a BRS 133 cultivar was submitted to different treatments, consisting in a combination of seed treatment with and without Mo and Co (Comol) and foliar fertilization in different stages of developtment with the following commercial products: Comol (V4), Bas-Citrus (V4), Bas-Citrus + Fetrilon (V4), Bas-Citrus + Fetrilon (R4). There was also a control without fertilization. The characteristics evaluated were: grain yield, protein content of seeds, number of days for maturation, plant density, plant height, degree of the plants layering and height of the first pods insertion. The molybdenum and cobalt seed treatment and the foliar fertilization with Comol (Co + Mo) in V4 stage of development promoted significant increases in grain yield. The seed treatment with Mo and Co increased the protein content of soybean seeds. The foliar fertilization with Bas-Citrus + Fetrilon in V4 stage of development increased the plants height and the degree of plants layering. The molybdenum and cobalt seed treatment and foliar fertilization of soybean had no effects on the rest of plant agronomic traits evaluated.",

The species used in the surrounding strips were Crotalaria juncea, pigeon pea, corn, and sorghum. Leafminers attack was similar in the two cultivation seasons. The attacks of borer insects in the stem apexes and fruits were larger 443 and 45% in the spring-summer cultivation than in the winter-spring cultivation, respectively. The action levels used decreased 25 to 87% of the insecticide applications and it decreased the production cost in 20%. The use of action level + surrounding strips reduced the production cost in 37% and increased Hymenoptera predator populations, mainly in the winter-spring cultivation. Sorghum surrounding strip + action levels was the best treatment because it showed the largest productivity and economic profitability, besides leading to the greatest reduction in insecticide applications",

The present experiment was conducted at University Centre Moura Lacerda, Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, and had the aim of studying the insects frequency and behaviour on cotton flowers (Gossypium hirsutum L.) as well as the collection type (nectar and/or pollen) of these insects and the effectiveness of their visits on cotton production. To do so, the culture remained under observation on March, 2002, during the first five minutes in each time, from 8:00 to 17:00, with three repetitions. We also marked 50 flowers buds: 25 covered with paper bags and 25 uncovered, in order to evaluate the insects influence on fructification. The cotton flowers opened between 8:00 and 9:00 and closed between 17:00 and 18:00. The insects which were observed in the flowers were the africanized honey bee Apis mellifera scuellata (50.3%), followed by the cleoptero (brasileirinho) Diabrotica speciosa (40.8%), other hymenoptera (5.0%), other coleoptera (1.7%), lepidoptera (1.1%), and the bee Trigona spp. (irapuá) (1.1%). Apart form the africanized honey bee and the irapuá, all the insects collected exclusively nectar from the flowers. The africanized honey bees preferred to collect nectar (95.6%) and visited the flowers from 9:00 to 16:00, with frequency peak at 13:00. Brasileirinho visited the flowers from 8:00 to 17:00, with frequency peak at 15:00. The number of apples was not different in the treatments (covered and uncovered), however, the number of seeds was higher in the uncovered treatment (29.45 seeds/apple, on average) than in the covered one (20.65 seeds/apple, on average). The africanized honey bee was considered as an effective pollinator of this culture",

The first experiment consisted of nodal segments of plants with ±2 cm of length obtained from in vitro culture cv. Ebano, excised and inoculated in MS culture medium, supplemented with five activated charcoal concentrations and five BAP concentrations. Both experiments were entirely performed in a design randomized complete block, using in vitro 3 explants by repetition and 4 replications for treatment and in greenhouse, a factorial 4x4. The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 5.8 before the addition of 6 g L-1 of agar and the sterilization to 121ºC and 1 atm for 20 minutes. After 70 days, several parameters in the explants were evaluated. A greater number of leaves and roots were obtained with 0.5 mg L-1 of BAP. The number of roots and their length were larger in the presence of 3 g L-1 of activated charcoal. A larger weight of the fresh matter was obtained in the absence of activated charcoal. The second experiment consisted of plants cv. Cherokee maintained in in vitro conditions and transplanted to plastic trays, containing the substrates and kept in greenhouse. Four types of substrates were tested. After 100 days of acclimatization, the leaf number, root length and aerial part, cool and dry root weight and cool and dry aerial part weight had been evaluated. It was concluded that the acclimatization can be successfully performed using Plantmax&reg; followed by the Plantmax&reg; + vermiculita + rind rice carbonized mixture. There was a 92% rate of the plants' survival in all substrates.",

This research was carried out in five geographic regions of Matinhas, where 20 fruits on plant and 20 fruits in soil were collected, with the aim of searching for the frugivorous flies and their levels of infestation in tangerine. The results showed that tangerine is infested by frugivorous flies Ceratitis capitata (Wiedmann, 1824), Neosilba zadolicha (McAlpine e Steyskal) and Neosilba glaberrima (Wiedmann, 1830). The mean infestation index of C. capitata in five regions did not exceed 0.5 pupae fruit-1. The emergence percentage (EP) of C. capitata adults in fruits collected on plant and in soil varied between 14.0% and 54.0% of adults fruit-1. The infestation index for N. zadolicha had variations between 0.4 and 4.3 pupae fruit-1. The data on the emergence percentage (EP) of N. zadolicha varied between 49.9% and 65.9% of adults fruit-1, which made it the most abundant and dominant species, with a high survival rate. N. zadolicha was considered the pest with the highest economic impact to tangerines in Matinhas. The present work is also the first report of the N. zadolicha and N. glaberiima species causing infestation in tangerine fruits in the state of Paraíba.",

The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design, with four replications and 50 seeds per experimental unit, at room temperature in a rustic nursery covered with 70% shade cloth. Weekly readings were performed during 70 days. The best alternative as a substitute to xaxim was forest litter, due to its germinability of 79.5% and survival rates of 97%, significantly similar to xaxim (78%; 94.75%; Tukey p < 0,05). Additionally, this product features positive characteristics such as high availability, low cost, and easy recycling",

After calibration, the simulation of soybean yield was carried out for five different sowing dates and in 25 harvest periods, from 1974 to 1999. From the analysis carried out in the simulations, varying probability levels were determined for the actual occurrence of these productivities, for each of the simulated sowing times. From the five simulated sowing dates, October 1st presented the highest yields, but also the lowest. October 15th and November 1st were considered the best dates for soybean sowing, presenting an average for the four cultivars in the 25 simulations of 2,450 kg ha-1 and 2,303 kg ha-1, respectively. The yield probability analysis proved to be a great tool in decision-making as for the time of sowing of soybean. Well into the 50% level of yield probability is a good number for the farmer, in assisting in the decision of when to sow soybean in the region. Only the sowing time of December 1st presented productivity inferior to 2,000 kg ha-1 with probability levels of 50%",

The experimental was conducted using a randomized block design, with seven treatments for species nutrient levels under different conditions (sole crops or intercropping) and five treatments for phytomass production and micronutrient accumulation, with four replications. For phytomass production, only the pigeon pea sole crop displayed lower yield of fresh and dry phytomass, while the others produced on average 12.361 and 2.854 t ha-1 of fresh and dry phytomass yield, respectively. There were significant differences in B, Cu and Zn levels, and in accumulation of all evaluated micronutrients. The leguminous species presented the greatest B levels, with the greatest Cu and Zn levels found in millet. In general, millet plus jack bean intercropping presented the greatest micronutrient accumulation.",

In this study, PA levels were determined in the germ and endosperm of eleven corn hybrids cultivated in Paraná State (Brazil), and also in several industrialized corn products. Corn hybrid germs were characterized as corn components with high PA levels, whereas endosperms featured low levels of PA. Corn-based industrialized products, derived mostly from corn endosperm (such as canjica, creamed corn, corn flour and cornmeal) featured the lowest PA values. Conversely, defatted corn germs and corn cuticle showed the highest PA levels",

The experiment was performed at the campus of Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia – UESB, in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia State, Brazil, from November 2005 to May 2007, aiming to evaluate irrigation management, harvest time and the mepiquat chloride effect on cassava agronomical characteristics. The study used randomized blocks delineation with three replications and sixteen treatments in subdivided lots, using the following combinations: irrigation management (lack and with irrigation during the whole cycle, irrigation from November to April, performed again from November to April of the following year), harvest time (nine, eighteen months) mepiquat chloride (with and without application). The harvest at 18 provided an increase on aerial part weight and on root productivity, showed an increase from 16.89 to 36.73 t ha-1, as well as a high harvest index. Irrigated plants during the whole cycle presented higher tuberous root productivity than the ones kept without irrigation. When irrigated, the plants produced tuberous roots with a higher percentage of dry matter and starch. The use of mepiquat chloride increased both the starch and the flour production of the irrigated plants during the whole cycle.",

The experiment was accomplished in Campo Mourão, Paraná state, over two agricultural years and this study had as its objective to evaluate the response of oats to nitrogen fertilization, as well as the yield of corn cultivated in succession. The treatments consisted of nitrogen application (120 kg ha-1) on the oats, through ammonium sulfate, as follows: 24-90-30; 0-90-30; 144-0-0; 0-0-0; these sequences of numbers correspond to N applied in the sowing of black oats (SA), N in pre-sowing of corn (PS), and N in the sowing of corn (SM). In the treatment one, the oat received only the nitrogen fertilizer in sowing of 24 kg ha-1 and in the treatment two, the oat was not fertilized, but the corn received it. In the treatment three, the oat received a nitrogen fertilizer basic in sowing of 24 kg ha-1, as well it received 120 kg N of corn, that made of 144 kg N ha-1. The results led to the conclusion that the oats fertilized with 144 kg ha-1 of N during sowing obtained a larger production of dry mass, as well it increased the N content and corn yield; the corn has not difference of yield when submitted to the nitrogen fertilizer in the beginning of the cultivation (120 kg ha-1) or when the fertilizer was applied all in the oats sowing (144 kg ha-1).",

Abnormalities recorded were irregular chromosome segregation, chromosome stickiness, and absence of the first cytokinesis, but the latter did not compromise pollen viability. Multivalent chromosome configurations at diakinesis, ranging from one to three quadrivalents, suggest that genetic recombination and introgression of some genes can be expected in the hybrids. Based on meiotic stability, the hybrids should be selected for high seed production, and the genitors could remain in the program participating in other intraspecific crosses.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of total and dissolved organic matter produced from two swine wastewater treatment systems, a biodigester and a manure lagoon, on the adsorption, desorption, and leaching of alachlor (2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide) in soil. It was used the batch equilibrium method to test adsorption and desorption, and the results are presented in Freundlich isotherms. It also used disturbed soil columns to evaluate the miscible displacement of alachlor in soil treated with total and dissolved organic matter. This assay was used to monitor the concentration of alachlor in the leached material, the amount of total organic carbon, and the pH. The addition of swine wastewater promoted greater adsorption and desorption of alachlor compared with the control. The dissolved organic matter promoted less soil adsorption of alachlor compared with the total organic matter and also interacted with the alachlor and/or competed with the exchangeable cation sites in the soil, resulting in greater leaching. The total organic matter contributed to the emergence of new sorption sites in the soil column, and the solids present in the composition may have blocked pesticide passage, resulting in lower loss of alachlor due to leaching.",

    "abstract": "The low height of pod insertion in beans is due to the low height of its basal internodes that lead to problems in plant management, low grain quality and inefficient commercial harvest. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA3) to increase basal internodes of bean seedlings. The experiment was conducted in greenhouse and field growth conditions, using two common bean genotypes. In both, the seeds were treated with 10 µM GA3; spraying on seedling shoot (hook, primary leaves, first and second trifoliate leaf) with 10 µM GA3, and control using distilled water. The plants were harvested at V4 stage. GA3 promoted significant increase of the hypocotyl and epicotyl (first internodes 9 cm) length, and decrease of their respective diameters, particularly with GA3 seed treatment. The genotype BAF#55 was more responsive to GA3 treatments than Carioca Iapar#81. Moreover, a reduction in leaf area was observed in all dimensions (length-to-width ratio). In the seed treatment, the emergence was 34% for IAPAR#81 against 71% for BAF#55, and around 90% for controls. It indicates that GA3 modifies plant architecture, whose response depends on genotype, the environment and the physiological development stage of the plant.",

The models were adjusted to doses of 0, 30, 60, 110 and 270 kg of N ha-1, doses were divided in applications after each evaluation, with a rest cycle of 35 days. The adjusted model presented good performance in predicting dry matter production of Thanzania grass, with r2 = 0.9999. The results made it possible to verify that the proposed model can be used to predict forage production in different regions of Brazil. It can be estimated, with good precision.

Both fruits do have processing compatibilities, and it is permissible to add pear juice to apple juice at levels defined by law. Quality indicators, such as pH, total acidity, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were used. The simple sugar analysis clearly defines fructose as the main component in pear juice, and lower figures were found when enzymatic processing was used. Color intensity measured instrumentally was much greater in pear juice with all processing methods and in apple juice when an enzymatic method was used. The results clearly indicate proper ways of processing pear and apple, aiming to have better products, as the grinding and extraction processing steps surely affect the fruit juice quality.",

    "abstract": "Competition experiments were installed at the COODETEC unit in Palotina, Paraná State, with the objective of evaluating the influence of the cultivation of soybean in succession to a second crop season on different sowing dates on the agronomic traits and seed yield in both cultures. The experiment consisted of four field replicates, arranged in a completely randomized block design and carried out in two agricultural years (2003/2004 and 2004/2005). The individual blocks were comprised of three early-maturing soybean cultivars (CD 202, CD 215 and CD 216) sowed on five different dates (9/15, 9/30, 10/15, 10/30 and 11/15) and also three corn hybrids (CD 305, CD 306 and CD 308) that were sowed on different dates (1/30, 2/15, 3/1, 3/15 and 3/30). Data were submitted to a joint analysis, and the interaction decompositions were made when verified significance. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that early season second crop growing is a valid strategy for obtaining a good agronomical performance and better productivity in off-season corn sowing. The succession of early soybean/early corn in the off-season is a potentially viable alternative for the west region of Paraná State, as long as the soybean sowing is done by the first half of October and the second crop season corn is sown in the first half of February.",

The data were analyzed through multivariate statistics. The archaeological dark earth areas have different behaviours between pastures and forests: chemical attributes have greater interaction in archaeological dark earth due to the high fertility of the anthropic horizons. The attributes that may indicate environmental changes are calcium, potential acidity and clay for archaeological dark earth, forest and pasture areas, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are sustainable options for agricultural diversification, but there have been few studies on the influence of ICLS on soil microorganisms. This work investigated the influence of agropastoral (AP) and agrosilvopastoral (ASP) systems, compared with a non-integrated crop (CO) on the suppression of Rhizoctonia solani and on the density of Fusarium and Trichoderma propagules. In the first assay, soil samples were inoculated with R. solani and evaluated for soybean damping-off. After this, the soil was sterilized and re-inoculated with the pathogen for a new evaluation. Finally, 10% of the soil in the pots were substituted by newly soil samples collected from the same plots in the field to evaluate de suppressiveness transference by soil samples. In the second assay, native Fusarium and Trichoderma propagules were quantified in semi-selective media. Damping-off incidence in ASP was 70% compared to AP and CO. Evaluations with sterilized and transferred soil samples attributed this suppression to biotic factors. Fusarium propagules were retrieved in the ASP soil at 70% and 60% the amounts in AP and CO soils, respectively. Trichoderma propagules were retrieved in the ASP soil at 150% compared to AP, but similar to CO. The agrosilvopastoral system in the Brazilian subtropics has the potential to reduce pathogens and enhance beneficial microorganisms in the soil.",

Embryo germination was influenced primarily by the stage of development of the embryo and the composition of the culture medium. Regardless of the species, the most suitable culture medium for the germination of globular and cordiform embryos was ½ MS with 0.05 mg L-1 of GA3 and IAA and 40 g L-1 of sucrose. For torpedo and cotyledonary embryos, ½ MS culture medium with 20 g L-1 of sucrose without phytoregulators is recommended for germination. These results were better than those described in the literature for all development stages in the two species. The results in the present study will be useful for geneticists and genetic enhancers interested in applying germination techniques conducted in vitro for immature Capsicum embryos.",

Twenty segregating populations were selected by two methods. The 60 best families of each method were selected according to their average agronomic performance. An augmented block design was used. The following agronomic traits were evaluated: insertion height of first pod, plant height at maturity, number of branches and of pods per plant, 100-seed weight, and grain yield. For comparison of the methods, genetic component estimates, genetic gain and predicted breeding values were calculated using mixed models (REML and BLUP).

In this way, physiological mechanisms to exclude, detoxify or compartmentalize trace elements that are in excess are crucial for plant survival when exposed to high concentrations of these elements. In this way, the aim of this study was to understand the physiological responses of Phaseolus vulgaris plants subjected to increasing doses of Cd and Zn for 21 days in different soil, Cambisol and Latosol. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and APX; hydrogen peroxide content; lipid peroxidation; chlorophyll index; photosynthetic rate; stomatal conductance; and transpiration were analysed.

This study aimed to verify the occurrence of heterosis for the root distribution trait in hybrid F1 populations of common bean derived from crosses within and between gene groups. Thirty-six populations (six parents and 30 hybrids) were evaluated under field conditions in the agricultural years 2016/17 and 2017/18. The root distribution was assessed with the adapted Bohm method. The genotypes responded similarly to environmental changes (absence of an interaction). However, the root distribution differed significantly between the agricultural years. Comparisons between the mean of hybrids from crosses within each gene pool and the mean of parents did not reveal heterosis. The comparisons between gene groups showed significant differences only between BRS Embaixador x IPR Uirapuru, CBS 14 x IPR Uirapuru, and BAF 53 x IPR Uirapuru and the mean of parents. The absence of heterosis in the root trait can be explained by the degree of kinship between the gene groups, as well as some epistatic interactions.",

The experiments included two single hybrids, two double hybrids, and two triple hybrids inoculated with A. brasilense via seed treatment; foliar application during phenological stages V2, V2 + V4, and V4; and a control treatment without bacteria. The response varied with the hybrid and the year. In the 2013/14 crop, a significant difference was observed in the grain yield for the single hybrid AG9045 inoculated with A. brasilense via seed and foliar application in V2. In the 2014/15 crop, inoculation with A. brasilense via seed application resulted in significant increases in the grain yield for the triple hybrid BG7051. Foliar application of A. brasilense is an efficient alternative for the improvement of plant morphological traits, and inoculation via seed and with foliar application in V2 increases the relative contribution of N.",

It evaluated the productivity of corn cultivars of the national experiment of Embrapa, center, regarding the crops 2004/2005, 2005/2006 and 2006/2007, in order to determine the adaptability and stability, by the methods of Lin and Binns with decomposition (CRUZ; CARNEIRO, 2006), Annicchiarico with decomposition (SCHMILDT; CRUZ, 2005) and by another method proposed based on the Annicchiarico method with decomposition. The use of the average standard error instead of the standard deviation in the calculation of the variability of environments for each cultivar, as well as for the increasing of the confidence level of 75 to 95% was proposed. It was noticed that the results of indication of cultivars by the three methods showed Spearman's high correlation (p < 0.01). The new method presents advantages: it values the deviations between the environments by taking into account the number of environments and presenting the lowest level of significance (allowing lowest type I error). The proposed methodology presents the numerical results of the confidence index equal to the results of the Annicchiarico method with decomposition when the compared number of environments is equal to six.",

    "abstract": "In this work, lacunarity analysis is performed on soil pores segmented by the pure voxel extraction method from soil tomography images. The conversion of forest to sugarcane plantation was found to result in higher sugarcane soil pore lacunarity than that of native forest soil, while the porosity was found to be lower. More precisely, this study shows that native forest has more porous soil with a more uniform spatial distribution of pores, while sugarcane soil has lower porosity and a more heterogeneous pore distribution. Moreover, validation through multivariate statistics demonstrates that lacunarity can be considered a relevant index of clustering and can explain the variability among soils under different land use systems. While porosity by itself represents a fundamental concept for quantification of the impact of land use change, the current findings demonstrate that the spatial distribution of pores also plays an important role and that pore lacunarity can be adopted as a complementary tool in studies directed at quantifying the effect of human intervention on soils.",

The leaf chlorophyll content, mass loss (ML), relative water content (RWC), soluble sugars levels, reducings (RED), non-reducings and starch were determined. In leaves stored at 25ºC, the ML was higher when leaves were hydrocooled. The highest RWC resulted from the use of plastic bag, which prevented the leaves from wilting for a longer period of time. The soluble sugars levels varied according to the increase or decrease in RWC. The contents of RED decreased with the time of storage at 25°C. The cold storage increased the shelf life of ora-pro-nobis by 168 hours. The hydrocooling increased the RWC of leaves, although it did not influence the shelf life. The perforated plastic bag was effective in increasing the shelf life, and when associated with hydrocooling, the plastic bags provide a lower rate of loss of fresh mass.",

The aim of this work was to cryopreserve B. intermedia zygotic embryos and subsequently thaw them at room temperature in a solution rich in sucrose. The embryos were decontaminated and desiccated in a laminar airflow hood for 0-4 hours prior to plunging into liquid nitrogen. The embryo moisture content (% MC) during dehydration was assessed. Cryopreserved embryos were thawed in a solution rich in sucrose at room temperature, inoculated in a germination medium and maintained in a growth chamber. After 30 days, the embryo germination was evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the different embryo dehydration times, where they were dehydrated for at least one hour. Embryos with a MC between 34.3 and 20.3% were germinated after cryopreservation. In the absence of dehydration, all embryos died following cryopreservation. We conclude that B. intermedia zygotic embryos can be successfully cryopreserved and thawed at room temperature after at least one hour of dehydration in a laminar airflow bench.",

Seven combinations of primers corresponding to EcoR1 and Mse1 were tested for the AFLP analysis, and the combinations E-AAG/M-CTC, E-ACT/M-CTT and E-ACC/M-CTT were selected. The resulting products were denatured and subjected to capillary electrophoresis. The Jaccard distance was used to estimate the genetic distances between accessions, and the Unweighted Pair Cluster Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and Bayesian statistics were used for the clustering analysis. The three combinations of primer/enzyme revealed 485 informative loci in total, and the combination E-ACC/M-CTT detected the greatest number of informative loci (49%). The analysis of dissimilarity frequency distribution showed that the distribution was uniform, ranging from 0.1285 to 0.7310 with a mean of 0.4801, and the accessions with indeterminate growth habits exhibited greater variability than the accessions with determinate growth habits. The clustering UPGMA, PCoA and Bayesian analyses showed the formation of two large clusters, wherein there is a possible association between snap bean growth habit and gene pool. The determinate accessions may be more closely associated with the Andean gene pool, while the indeterminate ones may be associated with the Mesoamerican gene pool. The Bayesian analysis showed accessions intermediate to both groups, suggesting introgression between the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools.",

The following characteristics were evaluated: grain yield, grain yield in silage maturity, vitreousness, ruminal digestibility of grain, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude protein. The grains in the group of dent hybrids exhibited better degradability associated with lower vitreousness than the group of flint hybrids. The group of dent hybrids exhibited better ruminal digestibility of the grains associated with lower vitreousness versus the group of flint hybrids. There is a negative correlation between vitreousness and the digestibility of the grain; thus, vitreousness can be a criterion for selecting genotypes for forage production.",

The capacity of multiplication of bacteria in YMA liquid mean with two concentrations of benomyl, carbendazim, carboxin+thiram, difenoconazole, thiabendazole+thiram, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim+thiram fungicides was compared in vitro. Survival of bacteria was measured by transferring of serial dilution in YMA mean. In greenhouse, seeds (cv. “Embrapa 48’) were treated with thiabendazole+thiram, metalaxyl, thiram, difenoconazole+thiram, carbendazim+thiram, fludioxonil+metalaxyl-m, thiophanate-methyl+tolyfluanid, thiabendazole and captan fungicides. Inoculant containing both bacteria strains was inoculated in a proportion of 10 g/Kg of seeds. Nodulation in soybean plants was measured counting the total number of nodules and those on the main root. Reduction over 10% was observed in relation to control in multiplication of B. japonicum in means containing thiram, carbendazim, carboxin+thiram and carbendazim+thiram. Tested fungicides did not affect nodulation. Only captan fungicide reduced the number of nodules in the main root when compared to control (not inoculated).",

Thus, the purpose of this work was, by means of citric extracts, (Ecolife40 commercial product), to assess the antifungal activity, as well as the induction of phytoalexins in soybean and sorghum, in order to develop an alternative method of phytopathogens control. The effect of concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 5000 ppm of citric extract was carried out on Colletotrichum lagenarium and Fusarium semitectum. Besides, the mycelial growth and sporulation, spores germination and dry weight were evaluated. The induction of gliceollins phytoalexins in soybean cotyledons and deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum mesocotyls was also verified. Through the results obtained, it was verified that citric extract showed antifungal and phytoalexins-inducing activities in all the essays performed. The antimicrobial activity was dosis-dependent, the most efficient being the 5000 ppm of citric extract. The gliceollin accumulation in soybean was greater for the concentration of 5000 ppm of citric extract, while for sorghum, there was a production peak in 100 ppm.",

Crop coefficient values for different stages are also presented as a result, in order to provide the basis for crop water budget and management throughout the cycle. A field experiment was carried out during the main season, in which biomass, soil moisture, leaf area, climate data and light transmittance were evaluated. These have allowed deriving water balance, use and efficiency. The mentioned genotype requires around 600 mm for high yield targets, being less efficient when led under below-optimal nitrogen fertilization.",

The present research was conducted with the objective of evaluating the influence of the substrate volume in the development of seedlings of red pitaya, by using polystyrene trays expanded with different volumes of cells: 10, 15, 30 and 65 mL. The evaluations, conducted during 90 days, evaluated: survival percentage; number and height of stems (cm); largest root length (cm); fresh and dry masses of the stems and roots (g). The delineation was entirely randomized. The values of survival percentage were transformed in arc sin and the averages were compared by the Tukey test at 5%. The survival and vegetative development for seedlings of red pitaya were directly proportional to the volume of the substrate used. In order to form seedlings of red pitaya from seeds, the use of containers with 65 mL of capacity is recommended.",

In addition to being a crop that meets the characteristics of family agriculture, it is also cultivated in extensive areas using high technology. Research related to the behavior and development of the bean crop in relation to regional soil and climatic variants have assumed a prominent role, especially because it is a plant that is sensitive both to the lack and excess of water in the soil. The objective of this research was to compare two methods of management of center pivot irrigation: a) soil sensor (tensiometry) and b) simplified climatological water balance – Class A pan; in conventional and no-tillage systems of soil cultivate (first year), on the irrigated dry bean winter crop growing under center pivot in succession to the corn crop in a Oxisol soil. The leaf area index (IAF), dry matter plant production and variation of the soil matrix potential were evaluated. It was concluded that both irrigation managements and tillage systems did not result in differences in IAF, nor in dry matter accumulation along the crop cycle; the tensiometry method brought on a larger variation in the soil matrix potential than the Class ‘A’ simplified climatological method.",

This study was conducted in order to adjust the variation curves for static air pressure, when forced into piles of organic material at different biochemical degradation stages. To that end, a composting pile with both sugarcane bagasse (BC) and poultry litter (CF) was stacked, by preparing the mixture in such a way as to obtain an initial C/N ratio of 30/1. The material was revolved every three days during the first month, followed by revolutions at regular 5-day intervals for two more months. Load loss was measured at 1m column height for the BC under the same conditions used in the mixture, as well as in the BC + CF mixture under the conditions at 30, 60 and 90 days of composting. The higher the specific air flow and the biochemical degradation time of the material under composting, the higher the decrease in the static pressure of the air insufflated in it. The Shedd model was well adjusted to the experimental data in the air specific flow range under investigation, and can be used to predict the static pressure gradients in organic compost",

The plants were inoculated with the pathogen at the following stages: V7, V9, R1, R2, R4, and R6. The experiments were conducted in pots, in a completely randomized design, with six replications. The fungus infection rate in the seeds was verified through the health test (Blotter Test). The significance of the contrast between the phenological stages and in the two experiments (rainy season and dry season), and productivity showed plant-seed transmission of F. verticillioides in all phenological stages. The PCR technique was able to reveal up to the lowest level, 1% incidence of F. verticillioides in corn seeds. There was a significant difference between the times of plant inoculation and the incidence of the fungus in the seeds. Plants inoculated in the reproductive phase transmitted F. verticillioides for seeds with the highest rate of infection, in the two experiments, in the rainy season (V7 - 48; V9 - 46; R1 - 77.33; R2 - 84; R4 - 96; R6 - 96.67; and Test - 14.67%), and dry season (V7 - 46.67; V9 - 66; R1 - 75.33; R2 - 95.33; R4 - 98; and R6 - 97.33%). In this way, the present work demonstrated that in the reproductive phenological stages R2, R4, and R6, the corn plant was more susceptible to infection with F. verticillioides, and that it also resulted in a decrease in grain productivity.",

The collection was composed of commercial accessions, materials collected in South Brazil, and of foreign origin. Twenty quantitative, five multicategorical and two binary traits were evaluated. Quantitative data were submitted to a multivariate analysis. Genetic variability was observed for almost all characteristics. The traits with the greatest relative contribution to genetic divergence, which accounted for 79.54% of the variability, were as follows: the thickness and diameter bottom, bottom fresh mass/head fresh mass ratio, external bract length, bracts base, leaves and primary head height and plant diameter, primary head diameter and bracts base thickness. A cluster analysis revealed four groups. Group I aggregated the accessions with characteristics for fresh consumption. The best accessions were Romanesco 1, Green Globe, and Improved Green Globe, all of which exhibited plants with a greater fresh mass, larger primary head diameter, greater fresh mass and bottom diameter, circular head shape, no thorns, round head tip and desired color, that are important traits for selection of superior genotypes for in natura consumption.",

The present study assessed the traits related to productivity, in rice genotypes under conditions of irrigation and water stress, in Gurupi municipality, Southern region from Tocantins state. We evaluated agronomic attributes (number of tillers and panicles, number of grains per panicle and productivity), besides the index of drought sensitivity. The selection of superior genotypes and traits that may serve for the differentiation among the genotypes in this stress condition is essential to create more tolerant materials. Among the most productive genotypes, we highlight the ‘Quebra Cacho’ that besides presenting relatively high productivities for both culture conditions, also presented a low index of drought sensitivity, ratifying itself as one of the most productive ones and adapted to this culture condition. The number of tillers by square meter did not present differences among the genotypes in both environmental conditions, but in some cases, there was a decrease under the condition of water stress. The number of grains per panicle evidenced great variation between the environments, with a decrease under the stress condition.",

A field trial was conducted at São Paulo State University, Brazil, in a randomized complete block design using a 2 x 13 factorial scheme. Direct seeding and seedling transplanting methods were evaluated within thirteen increasing weekly weedy periods. Weed relative importance was calculated and weed density and weed dry matter accumulation data were analyzed by nonlinear regression as well as beet yield and stand, which were submitted to analysis of variance. Amaranthus viridis, Coronopus didymus, Cyperus rotundus, Digitaria nuda, Galinsoga parviflora and Nicandra physaloides were the most important weeds found, with special reference to C. didymus. Weed dry matter accumulation was greater in the direct seeded crop, although weed density was higher in the transplanted crop. Transplanted beet yield was greater than of direct seeded beet in the weed-free treatment during the whole crop cycle. Crop-weed coexistence could remain for four and seven weeks after seeding/transplanting in direct seeded and in transplanted beet, respectively, before reducing yield economically. Thus, direct seeded crop was more susceptible to weed interference than the transplanted one.",

Selective bioassays were done to evaluate the toxicity of 47 isolates against first instar larvae of E. lignosellus. For the most toxic bacterial strains, the lethal concentration (LC50) was estimated and morphological, biochemical and molecular methods were used to characterize the isolates.

Isolates BR83, BR145, BR09, BR78, S1534, and S1302 had the lowest LC50 values and did not differ from the standard HD-1 strain; the exception was BR83.The protein profiles produced bands with molecular masses of 60-130 kDa. The genes cry1, cry2, cry3, and cry11 were identified in the molecular characterization. The morphological analysis identified three different crystal inclusions: bipyramidal, spherical and cuboidal.

A decrease in the instantaneous population growth rate of A. gossypii with increasing concentrations of neem was observed, and the aphids did not reproduce on the leaf discs treated with malathion during the first 24 hours of exposure due to its rapid lethal effect on adult insects. The larvae of the predator C. sanguinea exposed to malathion survived only for 24 hours. The survival of the predator exposed to different concentrations of neem was also significantly reduced compared to the predators exposed only to water.

The genes Dt1 and Dt2 affect the termination of the stem, and the types of growth are classified as determinate, semi-determinate and indeterminate. Phenotypic characterization of the type of growth is complex and is occasionally erroneously described. The objective of this study was to map and validate molecular markers to classify the type of soybean growth to facilitate the description of cultivars and genotypic selection. Two populations were used for mapping and validation of molecular markers F2:3: T 117 (semi-determinate growth type) x Igra RA 518 RR (indeterminate growth type) and CD 235RR (determinate growth type) x Igra RA 518 RR. The study demonstrates that the association of the molecular marker with the gene GmTFL1b was efficient in the classification of soybean growth types. The marker sat_064 is connected to the Dt2 gene, which is located in the Liaison Group G of the consensus map of soybeans with a recombination frequency of 19.4%. Molecular markers for Dt1 and Dt2 genes efficiently described the genotypes of soybean stem growth and selection.",

For each treatment, two chambers were used, each containing 15 7 L pots. Each pot received five seeds at the beginning of the experiment and thinning to one plant per pot at 15 days after sowing. Ten plants were harvested from each chamber 65 days after sowing and the plant height, the number of leaves and the longest root length as well as shoot and root biomass were measured. The remaining plants were harvested 130 days after sowing to evaluate grain production. The results indicate that high CO2 levels did not affect plant growth and biomass. On the other hand, plants subjected to high temperature grew 7% taller than those grown under ambient temperature. Contrastingly, plants submitted to both elevated CO2 and temperature were 19% taller and had 22% more shoot biomass than plants under ambient CO2 and temperature. However, grain production did not change in any of the environmental conditions. We provide evidence that millets are tolerant of the predicted climate changes and that grain production potential may not be affected.",

    "abstract": "The succession of soybean/maize has been largely adopted. Storm damage and crop problems can lead to grain loss, generating maize ear fragments or even whole ears that remain in the soil and still display germination viability, resulting in the occurrence of volunteer plants. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the interference of voluntary maize plants on soybean and investigate the susceptibility of maize hybrids to pre-emergence herbicides. In the first step, an experiment was performed evaluating the influence of voluntary maize plant density and spatial distribution on soybean. The experiment was performed in a randomized completely block design (RCBD) with four replications, with treatments disposed in factorial arrangement (2 x 4) + 1. The first factor corresponded to the spatial distribution of maize plants: row or in between soybean rows; while the second factor adopted four infestation densities of maize plants m-2: 4, 8, 12, and 16. The additional treatment consisted of a control without maize plants. For the second step, an experiment was conducted in two locations aiming to determine the efficacy of pre-emergence herbicides in the control of voluntary maize. Both experiments were installed in RCBD in a split-plot scheme with four replications. Fomesafen, lactofen, sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl, diclosulam, flumetsulam, imazethapyr, clomazone, metribuzin, [sulfentrazone + diuron], [imazethapyr + flumioxazin], and a control without herbicide application were evaluated in the main plot. In each subplot, the maize hybrids DKB310 PRO3™ and DKB390 PRO3™ were evaluated. No influence on the position of voluntary maize on the soybean yield was observed. The presence of the maize population led to a progressive decrease in soybean yield, ranging up to 86%, at 16 plants m-2. DKB390 displayed a stand reduction of 82.88% after the use of diclosulam. Diclosulam led to better results regarding maize plant decreases for both hybrids.",

This work aimed to fractionate inorganic P (Pi) in tropical soils of different mineralogical compositions and to relate these fractions with their respective phosphate buffer capacity (PBC) indicators. The soils were characterized physically, chemically and mineralogically. Additionally, we evaluated the P concentration that remained in solution of soil after equilibrium was met; this was termed P remaining (P-rem). In general, the Pi fractions of soils did not correlate with the PBC indicators. The P-H2O fraction showed a negative correlation with the P-Al fraction. Ferric minerals did not influence P fixation. P-rem showed a strong correlation with the maximum P adsorption capacity, adsorption energy, and the amorphous and crystalline forms of Fe. The minerals of aluminum contributed the most to P fixation. P-rem was the best estimator of PBC. The soils with high, moderate and low rates of P fixation showed high amounts of the fractions P-Al, P-Ca, and P-Fe, respectively. The results showed that P fixation was influenced by the fractions of P in the soil, suggesting that the efficiency of phosphate fertilizers in tropical soils depends on the mineralogy of the clay fraction within those soils.",

However, plant breeders are finding it difficult to combine these two traits in the same cultivar. The aim of this study was to compare success in the selection of new common bean lines that combine the two traits in segregating populations with 25%, 50%, or 75% of the alleles from the parents contrasting in upright plant architecture or in bean grains with persistent light color. A biparental cross was performed between a parent with light-colored beans (P1) and another with upright plants (P2). Three populations were obtained from the F1 seeds, with allelic frequencies of 75%, 50%, and 25% of P1. Subsequently, progenies were evaluated in a similar number in each population in the F2:3, F2:4, F2:5, and F2:6 generations. The plant architecture (PA) and grain darkening (GD) traits were visually evaluated using a scoring scale. Genetic and phenotypic parameters were estimated for all generations. There was no expressive advantage in using populations with a greater allele proportion of the parent favorable to upright plant architecture or slow grain darkening either in releasing of variability or in the occurrence of progenies with favorable phenotypes for the two traits.",

This study was carried out aiming to evaluate the susceptibility of 16 peach and 4 nectarine genotypes to brown rot, as well as to evaluate how well the sporulation area and diameter correlate with number of spores in the lesions. Both wounded and non-wounded fruits were inoculated with 10 μL of M. fructicola suspension. Wounded fruits from all genotypes (nectarines and peaches) showed susceptibility to M. fructicola, from 92 to 100% of incidence. The disease incidence was between 18 and 100% when non-wounded fruits were inoculated. High variability was detected for the fungus sporulation, in both wounded and non-wounded fruits, with ranges between 16 to 96% and 0 to 94%, respectively. The fungus sporulation was variable among the genotypes (between 0.1 to 96.0 conidia per mm2) and it is positively correlated with the diameter and area of sporulation. The genotypes Conserva 947, Conserva 1662, Conserva 672, Conserva 1600, and 'Bolinha', are the ones with less susceptible to brown rot.",

Producing high-quality seeds has been a constant challenge due to their uneven maturation. The development and application of precise and non-destructive methods for identifying internal damages to seeds, such as the X-ray test, which quickly indicates the quality of the lots, is of fundamental importance for the seed industry. In this work, the quality of Brachiaria brizantha seeds was analyzed based on the morphological characteristics observed in X-ray images that were related to viability using a mixture model under a Bayesian approach, with the following objectives: i) verify the adequacy of the Bayesian modeling used in the data analysis; ii) associate the efficiency of using radiographs as a way to assess the viability of the seeds; and iii) relate the classifications carried out by evaluators with the probability of originating normal or abnormal seedlings. The methodology applied for the analysis proved to be adequate. Further, the Bayesian estimates for parameters related to internal morphology were established with associated levels of uncertainty, which represents an advantage over usual frequentist methods. Based on the model's estimates, seeds evaluated as potentially unviable by three evaluators had practically no probability of germination and did not germinate in the test applied later. Seeds classified as potentially viable had a high probability of developing into normal seedlings, while 73.27% showed this property in the germination test.",

Metabolic quotient (qCO2) values were lowest in summer and autumn, with an average of 2.31-2.49 µg C-CO2 h-1 g-1 soil, under organic management, indicating greater microbial growing efficacy. Regardless of season and sampling position, organic soil had a higher C microbial biomass than conventional vineyards, with values ranging from 179.79 to 284.71 µg g-1 soil, which were similar to those of the adjacent forest soil. Overall, there were increases in both the microbial and the chemical attributes of soil under organic vineyards compared relative to conventional management, which might have been due to the continuous input of organic matter, crop rotation, and alternative plant protection and fertilizer compounds used in organic farming.",

The objective was to evaluate the effects of the management of phosphate fertilization, place and time, on the soil and leaf P content, and crop yield in grain production systems. An experiment was conducted at the farm level in the municipality of Nazareno, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, for four years on soil with adequate level of fertility. The treatments consisted of the management of phosphate fertilization by broadcast or furrow and dose for each crop or for the production system (spring/summer and autumn/winter crops), being: Control = without phosphate fertilization; Conventional = phosphate fertilization in the furrow in each crop; BTP = phosphate fertilization of the grain production system to broadcast; TPS = phosphate fertilization of the grain production system in the furrow of the spring/summer crop; TPW = phosphate fertilization of the grain production system in the furrow of the autumn/winter crop. Soil P content was evaluated in the third year of implantation, and the crops yield every season crop (maize, soybean, common bean and wheat). The P content in the leaves of maize and soybeans were evaluated in the spring/summer crops. The application of the total dose of phosphate fertilization for both crops in the sowing furrow of the spring/summer or autumn/winter crops (TPS and TPW) promoted operational advantages and increased soil P content in the 0-0.20 m layer, without reducing the yield of the spring/summer crops. Leaf P content was not affected. The Conventional management (phosphate fertilization in the furrow in each crop) provide greater yield of common beans and wheat during autumn/winter crops, which are more subject to water restriction due to less rainfall, even without increasing the soil P content.",

    "abstract": "The genotype by environment interaction is the main factor that influences the response of evaluated genotypes in trials of value for cultivation and use. Adaptability and stability analyses are fundamental to understanding the performance of genotypes in a growing region. Some of these methodologies incorporate previous information for recommending an extra group of genotypes denominated as specific ideotypes under certain cultivation conditions. Based on this strategy, the centroid method and its modifications have been widely used due to the simplicity of classification of the evaluated genotypes. However, these methodologies present problems in identifying adaptability patterns of some genotypes. Artificial intelligence techniques, such as fuzzy C-means, can be an alternative to reduce these difficulties, since they use, in addition to distance information between genotypes, memberships (measures quantifying how much an observation belongs to a particular class) to increase discriminatory power. Therefore, our aim was to propose and evaluate the phenotypic adaptability method by fuzzy clustering to assist cultivar recommendations. The adaptation of the fuzzy C-Means method to classify the genotypes was implemented in BioFuzzy software. The grain yield data of black common bean genotypes were used to evaluate the potential of the method. The results obtained by this method were compared with those obtained by the centroid method. The phenotypic adaptability method by fuzzy clustering was effective in identifying the adaptability patterns of common bean genotypes. Moreover, the discriminatory power was higher than that observed with the centroid method.",

The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 3 × 3 factorial arrangement consisting of two temperatures (20 ± 2°C and 27 ± 2°C), three concentrations of MSM mineral salts (100% MSM, 50% MSM, and 25% MSM), and three sucrose concentrations (10, 20, and 30 g L-1). Evaluations were performed at 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days for survival, number of leaves, and plant color (using a color scale where 1 = dark green, 2 = light green, and 3 = yellow). After 180 days of culture, mineral salt, sucrose concentration, and incubation temperature affected plant survival, regeneration, and acclimatization. During the 180 days, it was possible to slow the growth of nodal segments of passion fruit ‘UENF Rio Dourado’ in culture medium with 25% MSM mineral salts plus 10 g L-1 sucrose, at an average temperature of 20°C without compromising plant survival, regeneration, and acclimatization.",

    "abstract": "The center of origin and domestication of Piper nigrum L. are in high rainfall regions. But when grown in regions with irregular or insufficient rainfall, irrigation becomes essential. This study evaluated the impact of irrigation levels on the physiological and growth characteristics of black pepper plants, cv. Bragantina. It was carried out from April 2019 to May 2020, using automatic activation irrigation. We used emitters with different flow rates to apply water depths corresponding to 100, 81, 62, and 42% of the crop water requirement. The parameters evaluated comprised main stem length (MSL), stem diameter (SD), number of leaves (NL), leaf area (LA), chlorophyll contents, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, and some photosynthetic parameters. The treatments significantly influenced (p &lt; 0.05, F-test) MSL and NL. Plants submitted to the control treatment showed MSL (65.8%) and NL (123%) greater than those irrigated with the smallest volume (p &lt; 0.05, F-test). However, the treatments had no significant effect on SD. Moreover, chlorophyll b levels decreased by 26% and chlorophyll a/b ratio increased by 22% at 120 and 180 DAT, respectively. Some photosynthetic parameters such as FV/FM, ABS/RC, and DI0/RC were affected by water deficit at 120 DAT. Our results suggest the sensitivity of black peppers to water deficit and contribute to the proper management of this crop.",

    "abstract": "Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is the most consumed leafy vegetable in Brazil. It is cultivated using at least four distinct systems, the most common of which are conventional and hydroponic systems. These systems provide different cultivation conditions for plants, causing physiological changes that are important for commercial production, such as nutrient uptake and biomass accumulation. However, only a few studies have compared the physiological aspects of these two cultivation systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological behavior of ‘Rubinela’ lettuce plants grown in hydroponic and conventional pot systems, by comparing dry mass (DM) and fresh mass (FM) production, number of leaves (NF), stomatal density, and contents of chlorophyll, carotenoids, anthocyanin, sugars, and starch. Plants cultivated in hydroponic systems presented significant differences in chlorophyll content, producing more biomass than plants cultivated in conventional pot systems, probably because of better nutritional conditions, primarily with respect to macronutrients, provided by the nutrient solution of the hydroponic system. The lower water availability encountered by plants cultivated in conventional pot systems influenced the increased sugar and starch concentrations, as well as the anthocyanin content, which may be a strategy to mitigate the possible damage caused by hydric stress conditions.",

Leaf, fruit peel and seed samples were collected in an experimental site of Coffea Arabica cultivars Mundo Novo, Catuaí, Icatu, Sarchimor and Laurina and of Coffea canephora, cultivar robusta. The objective was to save time in the plant selection with different caffeine content with previous determination of the alkaloid in the leaf. Samples composed by the first, third, and sixth pair of leaves counted from the lateral branch in the following coffee fruit stages: initial growth, fruit filling, green formed gram and full maturation. Fruit samples were collected in the bearing stage. Part of the fruits were sown to obtain seedlings from which were colleted the first and third pair of leaves. Plant materials were dried, ground and then used for the caffeine termination. Caffeine was extracted by the hot water method and determined by spectrophotometry at 273nm. The results showed that for the both coffee species the caffeine content in the first and third pair of leaves of the seedlings increased linearly with increasing caffeine content in the seeds of the plants from the same variety in the field. Therefore, the first and the third pair of leaves of the seedlings were considered to be efficient to estimate of the caffeine content in the seeds of the mature plants. Under field conditions the first pair of leaves showed caffeine content higher than older leaves, mainly for the Coffea canephora. Coffee fruit in the maturation stage presented the lowest caffeine content in the leaves. The first pair of leaves sampled in the beginning of fruit growth was the most efficient plant material to estimate the caffeine content in the seeds as compared with the older leaves and with the more advanced time of the fruit development. The alkaloid contents were slightly lower in the fruit peel (shell + parchment) as compared with seeds. The caffeine content in the seeds increased linearly with increasing N content",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is the nutrient absorbed in higher quantities by bean plant and it is considered a quality element because it is part of all plants protein composition. The management and fertilization techniques are still the best strategy used to maximize the efficiency of N use and to permit that producers get the maximum profit from fertilizer use. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of N sources: urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and poultry manure, in the same amount (60 kg of N ha-1) applied with or without incorporation, in covering (V4 phonological stage), on the production components and yield bean. This work also evaluated the leaf analyses to N, P, K, Ca and Mg. The experimental area placed in Palotina, Paraná, Brazil, was sowed in a Red Latosol (Oxisol), on October 19, 2002. The cultivar Iapar 31 was used and the harvest occurred on January 17, 2003. The experimental design was a complete randomized block in a factorial scheme 5X2, with four replications. The sources and application forms of N influenced the response of bean to nitrogen fertilization. The mineral sources ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea, when applied with incorporation, provided greater contents of leaf N. The poultry manure without incorporation resulted in greater yield from common bean crop. The nitrogen mineral sources incorporation, always benefited the production components and the yield, when compared to the application without incorporation. Opposite side was observed to poultry manure.",

The results showed that B. bassiana and M. anisopliae reduced significantly the mean longevity of the adults about 6.7 and 4.7 days respectively. B. bassiana induced 26% and 21% of total and confirmed mortalities, respectively, while M. anisopliae caused 15% and 9% of total and confirmed mortalities, showing that the isolate of M. anisopliae was less aggressive. Therefore, in function of the presented results the combination of M. anisopliae, B. bassiana, and O. sokolowskii in the integrated management of P. xylostella may be an excellent alternative for optimizing the cabbage growing system.",

Facing those problems, an evaluation of the field and greenhouse trials was carried out in order to check the efficacy of postemergence sequential application of flumicloracpentil to control this weed. Sequential applications of flumicloracpentil were more efficient than a single application, promoting, at least, 86% of weed control on the 24th day after the second application of the sequential treatments. All the evaluated combinations of flumiclorac rates once sprayed at two true leaves stage, promoted adequate control of E. heterophylla. Comparing the greenhouse and the field results, it was concluded that, under field conditions, the canopy provided by the crop helps to improve the weed final control.",

Significant presence of genotype-environment interaction has been verified. Analyses of adaptability and stability are important to obtain complementary information of the common bean cultivars value tests, in relation to cultivars evaluation bulletins. The aim of the present study was to evaluate genotype-environment interaction of yield grain, in a 24 common bean genotypes set in Santa Catarina State. Phenotypic adaptability and stability analyses were carried out by the method of Wricke (1965), Lin and Binns (1988) and Annicchiarico (1992). The genotype-environment interaction was significant (P < 0.05). According to Annicchiarico method, the mean value estimate of CH 90-1535 line was 8.2% bigger than the mean value over all environments, with probability level corresponding to a 75%, which is the genotype with greatest reliability. Based on this method, CP 96-72 is also a promising genotype. In relation to Lin and Binns approach, the genotypes with the greatest stability were CH 90-1535 and LP 94-1 lines. For Wricke method, AN 91-22590, LP 96-72 and CH 90-1535 lines were the most promising genotypes. Regarding the methods used, LP 96-72 and CH 90-1535 lines can be useful for future common bean plantations in Santa Catarina State.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the daily behavior of the water potential in corn and of sorghum plants submitted to water stress, relating with the leaf and ambient temperature, were cultivated, in individual pots in greenhouse, five plants of each species. The plants were kept at field capacity until they reached the stage of four leaves. Between that stadium and close to the wilting point the irrigation was suspended and were monitored daily the ambient temperature (Tam), the water potential in the leaf (Ψ folha) and the temperature on the leaf sheet (Tfoext). The plants whose leaves rolled up had their internal temperature measured (Tfoint). The average time of Ψ folha was calculated for both species relating them with Tfoex, Tfoint and the differences among those temperatures. Both species presented behaviors similar to Ψ folha and between 1pm to 3pm they showed the lowest Ψ folha. Despite the significant inverse relationship between Tfoext and Ψ folha, in corn, this relationship does not present enough precision to use the measure os Tfoex in the control of the water status of the plant and the Tfoint was inferior to the Tfoex, becoming a protection mechanism which allows the plant to maintain its metabolism.",

The ever growing interest by the species, mainly due to its important therapeutic properties, has threatened the natural populations, as exploitation has occurred in a rather predatory way. The present study aimed to compare the genetic diversity of four natural populations originated from of the area of the Paraná River basin (Paraná and Mato Grosso States). The individuals were propagated in vitro and characterized by means of RAPD markers. A total of 267 polymorphic marks were obtained from 67 primers. The genetic distance estimates were obtained based on the complement arithmetic of Nei and Li’s similarity coefficient, and the genotypes were grouped according to the UPGMA method. Three populations from the margin of the Paraná River and at Mineiro Island presented low diversity levels among them, though possessing the same propagule dispersal flow. The population located in the proximities of the margin of the Ivaí river (tributary of the river Paraná) presented greater diversity values within and among the populations, suggesting that its preservation should be a priority and that the origin of the genetic variability may be related to the dispersion flow of the vegetative propagules.",

Thus, considering that dehydration extends the shelf life of perishable foods, this research was aimed at providing a contribution for the development of a product referred to as dehydrated 'Fuyu' kaki. A forced air circulation dehydrator was used, equipped with five trays. The peeled fruit was sliced in four different ways: sliced into halves, transversally; sliced into quarters, longitudinally; sliced into quarters, once longitudinally and once transversally; sliced into eighths, by cutting twice longitudinally and then once transversally. The drying conditions adjusted at 80°C for 1 h, followed by 60°C for 23 h resulted in a dehydrated 'Fuyu' kaki of better pleasant in aspect. The slicing method preferred by the samplers was that in which the fruit was sliced into eight slices (eighths). The dehydrated 'Fuyu' kaki, at low residual moistures of 19.7 or 27.4%, were pleasant in aspect and palate, and had good acceptance by samplers. The kaki fruit yielded 16.7 and 18.1% in weight of dehydrated products. Fruit losses during preparation into slices were estimated at 25.5%. The results demonstrated that the dehydrated 'Fuyu' kaki product is an excellent supply of dehydrated fruit",

This prototype was used for soybeans with an initial water content of 17% (w.b.). The samples were collected from the top, middle and bottom of the four cells to evaluate the quality of the grains. The experimental design was completely randomized factorial (3 x 4 x 3), with three temperatures settings for the drying air (30, 40, and 50°C), four drying cells and three evaluation positions (upper, middle and lower). The grains did not undergo quality changes as a function of the drying cells. In the upper part of the drying cells, there was a reduction in the specific grain mass (851 kg m-³), an increase in electrical conductivity (140.02 μS cm-1 g-1), reduction in germination (63%) and oil content (7%) compared with the middle and lower dryer positions. The experimental prototype of the fixed bed dryer allowed a uniform distribution of the heated air in the drying cells, which was effective in the drying operation and in maintaining the quality of the soybean grains.",

    "abstract": "Butia capitata (Mart.) Becc., commonly known as jelly palm, is a palm tree native to the Cerrado biome. It is considered an endangered species owing to intensive extractive exploitation of its fruits, with slow and uneven seminiferous propagation as an aggravating factor. Thereby, there are some bottlenecks related to jelly palm seedling production that needs to be optimized. Light quality and intensity is very important to seedling production, as it controls the metabolism of plants and consequently their growth and development. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of shade nets on the growth and physiological aspects of jelly palm seedlings. The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments, ten replicates and eight plants per replicate, totaling 400 plants. Experimental treatments consisted of the use of shade nets with 50% shading and different radiation intensity: white (985 µmol m-2 s-1), red (327 µmol m-2 s-1), black (433 µmol m-2 s-1), and silver (405 µmol m-2 s-1). Full sun (1000 µmol m-2 s-1) was used as the control treatment. Growth and physiological analyses of the plants were performed after six months of treatment. We concluded that the red shade net increases growth and biomass of Butia capitata plants. However, the use of shade nets had no effect on the tested physiological characteristics of this species. The red shade net is the most suitable for the production of Butia capitata seedlings in the southern region conditions of Minas Gerais State.",

Bayesian analysis using information on prior VCU trials is an alternative to obtain greater precision during genotype selection. The objective of the present work was to select, under a Bayesian perspective, genotypes of the carioca bean from the state of Paraná that combine high adaptability and phenotypic stability, using information from previous VCU assays. This study used data from six experiments conducted in a randomized block design, in which the grain yield of 18 genotypes was assayed. To represent weakly informative prior distributions, the study used probability distributions with high variance; to represent informative prior distributions, it adopted the meta-analysis concept used in prior VCU assays (2007/2008, 2008/2009, 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014). Bayesian inference provided greater precision in selecting carioca bean genotypes with high adaptability and phenotypical stability through the Eberhart and Russell method. The Bayes factor indicated that the use of a priori information gives more accurate results for genotype selection. According to the study, most genotypes are widely adaptable based on informative priors, except for the Bola Cheia cultivar, which has specific adaptability to favorable environments.",

After the application of the treatments, the fruits were stored at 0ºC for 30 days plus 3 days at 25ºC to simulate marketing conditions. The results showed that on the simulated marketing period, all the treatments (except for the control) reduced woolliness and internal browning. Furthermore, both pre-storage and LDPE MAP enhanced the polygalacturonase (PG) activity, the levels of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity. Thus, these results suggest that the pre-storage associated with LDPE packaging increases the shelf life of peaches by up to 30 days under cold storage.",

The experiment was conducted in a protected environment in the experimental Submedium region of the São Francisco River Valley in the period ranging from October to December.

The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with three replicates that were subdivided into plots, where the plots were comprised of four irrigation rates (50, 75, 100, and 125% of crop evapotranspiration – CET), subplots were comprised of the two melon cultivars, and sub-subplots were comprised of samplings for physiological analyses (15, 30, and 45 days after transplanting). The parameters evaluated were stomatal conductance, transpiration, net photosynthesis, relationship CI/CA, and accumulated dry matter. Water stress reduced the stomatal conductance, transpiration, net photosynthesis, CI/CA, and accumulated dry matter. 'Piel de Sapo' showed a higher photosynthetic adjustment than 'Amarelo' melon due to the gas exchange behaviour of the former, and it was, therefore, more tolerant to water stress.",

Four systems consisting of different densities of palm trees (80, 131, and 160 palms ha-1) and a monocrop were evaluated. The rates at which the basal tillers appeared in systems with 131 and 160 palms ha-1 were similar to each other and were slower compared to the monocrop pasture and the system with 80 palms ha-1. Despite the variations, the stability index was always higher than 1.0, which infers a compensatory mechanism between tiller appearance and mortality rate, since monocrop pastures and systems with 80 palms ha-1 have a higher rate of tissue turnover with high rates of tiller appearance and mortality; in contrast, the system with 160 palms ha-1 presents high tiller survival rates. Both the 160 and 131 palms ha-1 systems indicate impaired canopy renewal, as seen in the low appearance rate of basal tillers due to shading. As such, the tillering dynamics of the systems vary according to the density of palm trees, and the smaller tree densities favor the tiller turnover in the first generations evaluated.",

The varieties studied were ‘Amalia’, ‘IPA-6’, ‘M-82’, ‘Mara’, and ‘Nagcarlan’, presenting different fruit formats. Physiological parameters that negatively correlated with BER were plant water potential, leaf area, plant dry mass, relationship between proximal/distal Ca2+, K+ content in the proximal and distal portions of the fruit, and proximal Ca2+ content. Physiological parameters that positively correlated with BER were number of trichomes in the abaxial and adaxial leaf portions, leaf stomatal conductance, distal Ca2+ content bound to the cell wall, leaf transpiration, and fruit length. Our results showed that ‘Mara’ and ‘Nagcarlan’, ‘Amalia’ and ‘IPA-6’, and ‘M-82’ presented low, medium, and high susceptibility to BER, respectively.

After 60 days of culture using leaf discs, callus formation occurred in all treatments, with the highest averages obtained with 10 μM 2,4-D. However, these calluses did not form somatic embryos. For the cultured seeds, the best treatment was the MS medium with 1,000 mg L-1 glutamine and 10 μM 2,4-D without BAP. The supplementation of 60 g L-1 PEG 6000 was sufficient to promote the maturation of the somatic embryos. Histological analyses of the calluses that were formed from leaf discs showed nonembryogenic characteristics. In contrast, the calluses that originated from mature seeds had small and round cells with little vacuolation, which are characteristics of embryogenic structures.",

Fungicide applications are the main control method, but they can be influenced by the occurrence of rain. We aimed to study the control of Asian soybean rust in response to the occurrence of simulated rainfall at different times after fungicide application. The penetrant fungicides trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole (60 + 70 g a.i. ha-1) and azoxystrobin + benzovindiflupyr (60 + 30 g a.i. ha-1) and the nonpenetrant fungicides mancozeb (1,500 g a.i. ha-1), chlorothalonil (1,440 g a.i. ha-1), and copper oxychloride (672 g a.i. ha-1) were tested using two spray volumes: 70 and 150 L ha-1. Rain was simulated from 30 to 240 minutes after fungicide application. Soybean leaflets were collected and inoculated with a spore suspension of P. pachyrhizi (5.0 x 104 mL-1) and incubated in plastic boxes for 20 days. The trials were repeated twice. Nonpenetrant fungicides were more susceptible to rain washing, mainly when the 70 L ha-1 spray volume was used. For the penetrative fungicides, the best control percentages were obtained when the rainfall occurred between 120 and 180 minutes after application, while the protective fungicides had the best control percentages when the rainfall occurred approximately 240 minutes after application. The Asian rust control is affected by the characteristics of the fungicide applied, by the time interval between fungicide application and rain occurrence and by the spray volume.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the quality and antioxidant potential of ‘BRS Cora’ grapes with different training systems and rootstocks in production cycles of the second half of the year under tropical conditions. The experimental design was randomized blocks with sub-subdivided plots over time. Three training systems and two rootstocks were studied in production cycles referring to the second halves of 2017 and 2018. In 2017, the grapes of plants trained with lyre and vertical shoot positioning (VSP) had the highest soluble solids and sugars contents, and in 2018, this response occurred with the overhead trellis system. There was lower variation in titratable acidity between cycles of grapevines trained with VSP and lyre, as well as in those grafted onto ‘IAC 572’. In 2018, lyre with ‘IAC 572’ promoted higher pigment accumulation. Climatic conditions in 2017 provided a higher accumulation of polyphenols and antioxidant activity in grapes of plants trained with lyre with ‘IAC 766’. The efficiency of the training system within each cycle, associated with the effect of the rootstock, resulted in differentiated responses according to climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The intensification of anthropogenic activities on soils contributes to soil loss through erosion. Moreover, the pattern of soil loss in the Cobra River watershed, located in the semiarid region of Rio Grande do Norte, is related to the history of land use and occupation, mainly from agriculture and the red ceramic industry, as well as the climatic seasonality of the region. Thus, the objective of this work was to identify the pattern of soil loss from the Cobra River microbasin in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. For this, the following analyses were performed: a survey of land use class areas for the years 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017 as part of the Mapbiomas project; estimation of basin soil loss for these years; and quantification of areas of erosion vulnerability classes for this period. QGIS software was used to treat georeferenced data. According to the results, the land cover classes in the rich Cobra River microbasin fluctuated over time. Potential soil loss from the watershed increased from 1987 to 2017, with an increase of approximately 20 million megagrams of potentially erodible soil. The study of soil loss in a microbasin located in the Brazilian semiarid region should consider the variation in land cover over time, climatic seasonality and anthropic activity. To this end, it is important to use geotechnology and geoprocessing techniques to conduct a more robust spatiotemporal analysis.",

    "abstract": ". The objective was to study the habitat complexity of mite populations on Caryocar brasiliense trees under natural and cultivated field conditions. The study was performed in the municipality of Montes Claros, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, over 3 years. Three types of areas were studied: 1) Cerrado, 2) pasture, and 3) a university Campus. Several chlorotic spots were detected on leaves with larger populations of Tetranychus sp. and Eutetranychus sp. (Tetranychidae). The greatest numbers of Agistemus sp. (Stigmaeidae) on leaves and Histiostoma sp. (Histiostomidae) and Proctolaelaps sp. (Ascidae) on fruits were observed in the pasture, and that of Histiostoma sp. on leaves in the pasture and on the university Campus. In general, the herbivorous mites (e.g., Tetranychus sp.) found on C. brasiliense plants were correlated with more clayey soils with a higher cationic exchange capacity; larger populations of mites (e.g., Agistemus sp. and Histiostoma sp.) were found on the C. brasiliense trees with the largest crown sizes; and associations between predator mites (e.g., Agistemus sp.) and phytophagous mites (e.g., Tetranychus sp.1) were observed. Greater habitat diversity and more complex plant architectures favored the mite populations. The positive effect of loamier soil on herbivorous mites indicates that these species are adapted to Cerrado conditions. Some recorded species of herbivorous mites can be pests in commercial plantations of C. brasiliense.",

    "abstract": "Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the world’s leading natural textile fibre and is grown in over 60 countries, including Brazil, where it is an important agricultural commodity. The cultivation area currently covers approximately one million hectares in Brazil and has expanded into every region of the country, especially the Cerrado biome. Because of this expansion, it is necessary to analyse the influence of the environment on the genotype behaviour to optimize yields. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare fuzzy logic to traditional methods for selecting coloured-fibre cotton genotypes with high adaptability and yield stability. The experiment was conducted on the 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016, and 2016/2017 crops of the Capim Branco farm at the Federal University of Uberlândia, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The following methods were used to select genotypes for adaptability and stability: the Lin and Binns model, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis and the Sugeno fuzzy logic controller. An interaction of the genotype with the environment that affected yield was detected. Environment 4 (the 2016/2017 crop) showed to the lowest genotype to environment interaction. The fuzzy logic approach showed agreement with AMMI and the nonparametric Lin and Binns method. The linguistic fuzzy logic used in the Sugeno fuzzy logic controller demonstrated the potential for selecting cotton genotypes in plant breeding programmes. The UFUJP-16 and UFUPJ-17 genotypes were adaptable, stable and showed promising yields within the tested environments. The fuzzy logic method was effective for estimating adaptability and stability.",

The experimental design was completely randomized, with treatments distributed in a 4 × 5 factorial scheme, corresponding to four seed priming treatments and five osmotic potentials, with four replicates of 50 seeds in each treatment. The seed treatments consisted of presoaking seeds for 4h in salicylic acid, gibberellic acid, and distilled water and the control treatment, which did not involve soaking. These seeds were germinated at osmotic potentials of 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, and -0.4 MPa, using NaCl as an osmotic agent to simulate the different salinity levels. Among all the treatments implemented, S. hispanica seed priming with salicylic acid was the most efficient in mitigating the salt stress effects.",

Genotypes of the highest (55 and 81) and lowest (23 and 50) physiological quality were selected. Protein content analysis, profiling, and characterization were performed by combining different hydration times. Mass spectrometry involving in-gel digestion and MALDI-ToF analysis was employed for the qualitative identification of proteins. Glutelin extraction detected the enzyme lipoxygenase in genotypes 55 and 81 alone. In plants, this enzyme may be involved in diverse physiological processes, including growth and development, pest resistance, senescence, and response to wounding. In the process of germination, lipoxygenase removes reactive oxygen species during reserve mobilization; therefore, lipoxygenase may be a candidate biochemical marker for high-vigor genotypes.",

The white pulp peaches not submitted to delayed storage developed either one or more of the other physiological disorders. Due to their lower level of pulp firmness, the control fruits of 'Chimarrita' and 'Marli' peaches were classified as woolly fruits. The control fruits of 'Chiripá' peaches, with pulp firmness of more than 30 N, presented leatheriness. High pectinmethylesterase (PE) activity was verified in the woolly fruits. The delayed storage for 48 hours in all the cultivars provided advanced ripening. The delayed storage by 24 hours was effective in the control of physiological disorders in the white pulp cultivars.",

For comparison, an additional 11 isolates of M. cannonballus from Spain were included in the analysis. MCGs were determined through comparisons of paired isolates growing on PDA culture media in the dark at 30ºC in various combinations. The Brazilian isolates were assigned into four MCGs: MCG-1 (n = 35 isolates), MCG-2 (n = 20), MCG-3 (n = 2), and MGC-4 (n = 1). MCG-1 and MCG-2 included isolates from all surveyed areas. The Spanish isolates were assigned into six different MCGs, and none of them were compatible with the Brazilian isolates. The genetic structure was determined using the frequencies of MCGs and genotypic diversity indices. The maximum genotypic diversity was 6.9 and 54.5% for the Brazilian and Spanish populations, respectively. The low level of genetic diversity in the M. cannonballus population from Northeastern Brazil suggests that breeding melons for disease resistance may be a promising strategy for the region.",

For these purposes, the response variable time of cooking bean grains was measured in minutes using a completely casualized experimental design, with two replications, arranged in a 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme (fivefold classification). The following factors were evaluated: bean genotypes (2 levels), salt type (2 levels), salt dose (3 levels), hydration time (2 levels) and storage time (2 levels). The results highlight the importance of unfolding the degrees of freedom of the interaction every time it is significant because the possibility of evaluating the interaction between factors leads to conclusions related to the dependence between the factors. These results are more coherent with biological systems, and the example shown provides a solid basis for minimizing errors in factorial experiments.",

As flower characteristics are essential for determining the commercial value of ornamental species, the main objective of this work was to identify polymorphisms in C. pulcherrima plants that produce flowers of different colors using RAPD molecular markers. For this study, 30 adult plants were randomly chosen on streets located in Jaboticabal city, São Paulo State, Brazil, and leaf samples were collected for DNA extraction. Among these trees, 20 have orange flowers, eight have yellow flowers and only two produce pink flowers. From the 140 tested RAPD primers, 94 primers amplified defined fragments that resulted in 246 bands, which were 100% monomorphic. Thus, a polymorphism was not detected by any of the primers tested. It was concluded that the RAPD technique is not an efficient method for detecting polymorphisms and that more specific molecular markers should be tested. Additionally, the morphological characteristic “flower color” may be controlled by several genes or by the association of them.",

Intercropping was evaluated by land equivalent ratio (LER) and the validation was by gross income determination. The productions of lettuce and marcela did not differ in relation to culture type. The calculated LERs indicated that both intercroppings were effective. However, regarding gross income, it was evidenced that the option of intercropping was economically viable only for the producers of marcela, whereas for the lettuce producers, the single-cultivar presented better performance.",

We evaluated forty-three individuals in the S2 generation, from the backcross between F1 (Cariflora x SS783) and Cariflora, and four accessions from the UENF/Caliman Germplasm Bank. Genetic distances used were Smouse and Peakall (1999), Kosman and Leonard (2005) and weighted index. Clustering among genotypes was performed using the hierarchical unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean analysis (UPGMA) and projection of the distance on the bidimensional plan. A high correlation between genetic distances was observed; however, through UPGMA group analysis, the distance determined by the weighted index provided the complete separation of 52BC1S2-08, 52BC1S2-29 and 52BC1S2-34 inbred lines. Through projection of distances in the plan, Kosman and Leonard (2005) coefficients and weighted allowed the differentiation of individuals in the S2 generation (52BC1S2-08, 52BC1S2-29 and 52BC1S2-34), the progenitor (‘Cariflora’ and ‘SS783’), and the four germplasm bank accessions in a different manner than the Smouse and Peakall (1999) index, which did not provide this discrimination among the accessed genotypes. We conclude that the Kosman and Leonard (2005) coefficient and weighted index are more efficient than the Smouse and Peakall (1999) algorithm on the disposition of the accessed genotypes in dendrograms and in the Cartesian axis displaying genetic similarity.",

Thus, we designed this study to evaluate the influence of soil liming on the leaching of trifloxysulfuron-sodium and pyrithiobac-sodium after simulated rainfall depths in soil columns. In the study, two trials were conducted simultaneously; the first experiment evaluated trifloxysulfuron-sodium (7.5 g ha-1), while the second experiment evaluated pyrithiobac-sodium (70 g ha-1). Both experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with a 2 x 4 x 5 factorial scheme and four replications. The design’s factors corresponded to 2 soil liming conditions (with or without liming), 4 simulated rainfall depths (0, 15, 30, and 45 mm) and 5 depths in the soil column (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm). The trials were repeated, and only the source for the soil neutralization was changed, i.e., dolomitic limestone in Experiment 1 and calcium oxide in Experiment 2. Compared to trifloxysulfuron-sodium, the herbicide pyrithiobac-sodium indicated a greater potential for leaching. With more acidic soils, the leaching potential in limed soils was greater for both herbicides. Only the liming that used calcium oxide provided a significant leaching of trifloxysulfuron-sodium for depths greater than 20 cm. Simulated rainfall ≥ 15 mm provided leaching of pyrithiobac-sodium to a depth of 25 cm at near-neutral soil pH values.",

For the in vitro germination, pollen grains were grown in 10 types of solidified culture medium consisting of different concentrations of sucrose, boric acid, calcium nitrate, magnesium sulfate and potassium nitrate. The pollen grains had the following characteristics: medium size, isopolar and subspheroidal shape, radial symmetry, circular ambit, 3-colporate, elongated endoapertures, tectate exine and granulated sexine. The acetocarmine dye overestimated pollen viability. The media M5 and M8 were the most efficient at promoting the germination of pollen grains.

The data were submitted to a regression analysis of variance trying to establish a functional relationship between losses with grain moisture content among the combined brands, age and rotation of the threshing cylinder. The results obtained allowed conclusions that, the grain losses are independent of the combined brands and age; grain losses which are superior to the tolerance level of 60kg ha-1 do not characterize good harvest performance; that the levels of grain residues reach the minimum limit of discount of 1%; that the break of grains increased with the increasing rotation of the trail cylinder; that the break of grains seems to indicate the non-training capability of the operator in the adjustment of the trail system and that most of the studied machines presented age superior to 10 years of use.",

In experiment II, undertaken on December 1, 1999, the same doses as experiment I and seeds with Mo contents of 0.000 ± 0; 0.062 ± 0.0107; 0.168 ± 0.0119; and 0.335 ± 0.0338 μgseed-1, were used. All seeds came from samples kept under the same environmental conditions, from the field production to storage. Experimental design was designed with randomized blocks, with four replications, and treatments distributed in a 4x4 factorial arrangement. Mo contents in the seeds, ranging from 0 to 0.535 μg.seed-1 in experiment I, and from 0 to 0.335 μg.seed-1 in experiment II, did not alter productivity. The need of molybdenum fertilization has been demonstrated since grain production has increased. In the two experiments, yield components that most varied were seed weight and number of pods per m2. Molybdenum foliar fertilization improved significantly the nitrogenous nutritional status of bean plants and increased organic nitrogen level in the leaf.",

Twenty eight progenies of Coffea Arabica in F3 generation were used, originated from crossings among the “Híbrido de Timor” descendants and cultivars of “Catuaí Amarelo” and “Catuaí Vermelho”. The complete randomized block design was used with six replications and four plants per plot and data were obtained in four initial harvests. The repeatability (r) of bean yield was higher, on the average, and showed a narrow range among estimates (r=0.39 to 0.48), when considering the 2nd, 3rd and 4th combined harvests. Among the methods used to estimate the repeatability coefficient, the main component technique based on the phenotypic correlation matrix was the most adequate, and resulted r=0.48 as well as a determination coefficient of 0.74. Therefore, an early selection needs great care. The correlations indicate that one could start such selection from the second harvest on, using a softer selection",

Symptomatic orchards were selected for CVC with the varieties 'Pêra', 'Valência' and 'Folha Murcha' (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). For each variety, 4 positive reference-plant for CVC (presence of CVC symptoms or molecular analysis by PCR) and 8 plants around of each one reference-plant were evaluated, totaling 36 plants for variety. The detection of the bacteria was conduced by Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. Simultaneously, evaluations through visual symptoms of CVC were conducted. The results of the temporal analysis were obtained using the Monomolecular, Logistic and Gompertz models. The Logistic model was the one that best fit to describe the behavior of the disease in the time, for all the studied varieties. Data showed that the space behavior of the disease differed when the same area was evaluated by visual and molecular methods, resulting in a difference in the space pattern of the evaluated areas. Therefore, the two used methods, symptoms and PCR, were capable of verifying these changes in the presented space pattern, but the molecular analysis (PCR) was better at detecting the happened changes.",

After 120 days of sowing, the development of the plants was evaluated per vase, starting from the height and the number of tillers, and the production of dry matter in the aerial part and in the root. At the same time, the amount of P in the soil and the macronutrients in the aerial part and in the root were determined. The 200 mg dm-3 application of P in the substratum with low amounts of nutrients improved its nutritional value and promoted the development of the plants. The high level of N (300 mg dm-3) harmed the development and the production of dry matter of the black oats. The largest production of dry matter of the black oats was associated to the concentration of P in the soil being close to 100 mg dm-3, and in the aerial part the concentration of P was 2.7 g kg-1.",

The Tukey test was applied and it was observed that the plant dimensions of height, diameter of the head, length of the largest leaf, medium number of leaves per plant, the plant total and dry mass presented significant difference among the treatments, the largest values being found for T1 and the smallest ones for T3. The length and mass of the root, micronutrients and macronutrients constituent of the leaves did not present significant difference. The indexes found for fecal coliforms did not indicate lettuce contamination in none of the treatments. T2 did not present significant difference when compared with T1. Hence, this indicates that T2 can be used instead of T1.",

Taking this fact into account, the research aimed at evaluating the efficiency of three acidity procedures in process. These procedures were estimated into 4.3, 4.2 or 3.9 pH to low the fresh heart-of-palm pH. This was done in order to decrease the fresh heart-of-palm pH to the canned one pH value, that is below or equal 4.5. Only the acidity procedure with the pH value estimated into 4.3 produced values superior to 4.5 in some canned peach palm. The canned heart-of-palm in brines with 4.0% was the most preferred one. The sweet taste of the fresh heart of palm was notable only in canned with brine of 2%. The acidity procedure with the pH estimated into 3.9 can be safely recommended to the heart-of-palm processing in industry. Nevertheless, the acidity procedure in each lot must be considered an obliged practice, because according to current and previous research studies, it is common the palm variation pH in natura. These recommendations, when efficiently applied, will result in positive food security for the agro industrialization, independently of the chosen brines.",

This work was carried out at Iguatemi Experimental Farm of the State University of Maringá (UEM) aiming to evaluate the influence of plant density increase on coffee agronomic traits, as well as on fruit and grain yield. The experiment was implanted in October, 1997, using coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plants of ‘Iapar 59’ cultivar. The plant densities evaluated were 3,333; 5,000; 6,666; 10,000 and 20,000 plants per hectare. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with three replications. The agronomic traits evaluated were plant height, leaf area, stem diameter, plant top diameter and number of plagiotropic ramification. Coffee fruits volume and weight, as well as grain yield per area and per plant, were also evaluated. The results indicated that plant populations near 14,000 plants per hectare showed better results in developing the characteristics evaluated; however, the higher production per plant was achieved with the density of 10,000 plants per hectare. The grain yield with plant density increase had linear response in the first year and quadratic response in the second. The highest production per area was achieved with plant populations of 20,000 plants per hectare in the first year and near 15,000 plants per hectare in the second year.",

This experiment was carried out in a vegetation environment at the irrigated agriculture unit of the State University of Maringá, State of Paraná in order to study the effect of three nutritious solutions with distinct electrical conductivities, applied to two different outflows, on the lettuce cultivation. The following production variables were analyzed: number of useful leaves, number of non-useful leaves, and length of the stem. The treatments consisted of a factorial combination of three nutritious solutions with different concentrations (S1=1.2 mS cm-1, S2=2.5 mS cm-1, and S3=0.8 mS cm-1) and two application outflows (O1=1.2 L min-1 and O2=0.8 L min-1) in the cultivation channels. The delineation was performed at random with 3 replications. Thus, the following treatments were used: S1O1 - nutritious solution 1 applied to outflow 1, S1O2 - nutritious solution 1 applied to outflow 2, S2O1 - nutritious solution 2 applied to outflow 1, S2O2 - nutritious solution 2 applied to outflow 2, S3O1 - nutritious solution 3 applied to outflow 1, S3O2 - nutritious 3 applied to outflow 2. The increase in the concentration of the nutrients with different outflows of the solutions did not provide a significant increase in the number of useful leaves. However, when analyzing the solution treatment separately, there were significant differences in the number of non-useful leaves between solutions I and II, in relation to solution III.

Foi bastante expressiva a resposta das cultivares quanto as variaveis estudadas em relacao ao suprimento de nitrogenio, porem nao houve resposta para fosforo e potassio. O capim-Basilisk se mostrou mais produtivo que o capim-Marandu, principalmente quanto a aparecimento de folhas, numero de folhas, altura da planta e numero de perfilhos. Evidenciou-se a importância do nitrogenio como ferramenta para manipular a estrutura da planta no periodo de estabelecimento da pastagem.",

Senador Amaral, Araponga, BGH-5747, BGH-5742 and BGH-4550 were the most productive clones, with all having commercial yields above 18,000 kg ha-1. Clone BGH-5744 gave the lowest yield of commercial roots, although it stood out for plant height, diameter and production of fresh mass of aerial part. Further research is recommended to evaluate the effect of calcium-magnesium silicate on the production of Peruvian carrot commercial roots and resistance to diseases.",

At these temperatures, the egg-adult period lasted 14.0; 8.1; 5.5; 4.9; 3.8 and 3.1 days, respectively. The egg, larva, protonymph and deutonymph stages and the egg-adult period presented thermal thresholds of 12.52; 13.85; 14.86; 14.86 and 13.31&deg;C, and thermal constants of 22.32; 14.23; 16.23; 17.3 and 70.16 degrees days. The values for the parameters of the fertility life table, analyzed in conjunction with the values of the different variables of development at different temperatures, showed that the temperature of 30&deg;C is the most suitable for development and reproduction of E. alatus in the laboratory. Therefore, is it apparent that the best temperature conditions for the development of E. alatus are found in the warmer regions of Brazil, such as those observed in northeastern Brazil.",

Mill.] is the maternal progenitor of the commercial strawberry (Fragaria ´ ananassa Duch.), which is characterized by fruits with high organoleptic quality and is well-suited to areas where drought and salinity represent a constraint on crop growth and productivity. We examined the patterns of linkage disequilibrium, genetic diversity and population structure among 54 accessions of F. chiloensis to understand the genetic basis of this species. We used a core microsatellite marker set (n = 95) from a consensus linkage map of strawberry. A transferability rate of 82.1% (78/95) was found, and 38 markers were selected for this study. The SSR primers produced a total of 259 alleles, which varied between 112 and 342 bp. Lower genetic diversity at the species level (HE = 0.17, Shannon's index = 0.28) was found compared to previous studies of this species. No climatic region pattern for SSR diversity was observed. Structure analysis suggests that the accessions are grouped into three significantly differentiated clusters. Pairwise estimates of φST indicated a low degree of differentiation between the three genetic groups (φST = 0.023 to 0.06). These groups are in concordance with potential glacial refugia in the region, with many accessions being an admixture of them.",

Dovyalis fruits from the State University of Western Parana, which was established in 2012, were harvested in March 2016. Dovyalis fruits were collected from several plants and were divided among three lots. After the harvest, were immediately taken to the Post-Harvest Laboratory for evaluation of the antioxidant activity by the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods. The physicochemical characteristics of the fruits and the total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, anthocyanins, respiration, and fruit color were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized, with the study containing three groups and three replicates per group. Dovyalis fruits present high antioxidant capacity and are characterized as acidic fruits, due to the high FRAP activity. Dovyalis fruits have a very attractive color and high acidity, which makes them appropriate for processing. Regarding the antioxidant activity present in the fruit, the most bioactive components are flavonoids and anthocyanins. High ascorbic acid content was observed in mature dovyalis fruits. Dovyalis fruits are considered climacteric.",

The water content was calculated using the oven method of 105 ± 3°C for 24 hours. The modulus of elasticity for the rachis was determined by means of mechanical compression testing. The Poisson's ratios were determined from the results of the longitudinal and transverse deformation of rachis test bodies. The shear tests were performed in two scenarios. In the first one, a blade was used without a tensioner, and in the second scenario, a blade was fixed with a tensioner, characterized by a chamfer at 45°. It was concluded that the modulus of elasticity of macaw palm rachis in the green maturity stage was higher than the values for the mature stage of ripeness.",

The discriminant analysis (DA) was based on soil physical and chemical properties and was used to differentiate soils developed from I- and S-type granites across contrasting climatic conditions in northeast Brazil. The DA identified the highest values of organic carbon, clay and plant nutrients as key variables to recognize soil profiles derived from I-type granites. In contrast, the greater sand contents and Al saturation distinguished soils developed from S-type granites. These results were related to the mineralogical characteristics of each granite type, such as a high percentage of silica-bearing minerals in the S-type granites. The highest concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, and P in I-type granites were found in feldspars, amphiboles, and apatite. These elements account for the majority of nutrients derived in their soil profiles. However, it seems that the harsh conditions of the humid tropical environment equalized the effect of the rocks on weathering rates-the difference in chemical index of alteration is more extreme in the dry region.",

Interspecific hybrids resistant to M. enterolobii were selected that can be used as rootstocks or in new crosses for the development of the guava breeding program.",

Seed germination was evaluated with two factorial experiments: 1) harvesting time, fruit ripening, and pre-germination treatment; 2) storage and light requirements. The response variables were germination percentage, mean germination time, and seedling vigor. Seeds harvested at the beginning of the season appeared to be less dormant and they were not influenced by fruit ripening or pre-germination treatments. By contrast, seeds harvested at the end of the season were influenced by fruit ripening and pre-germination treatments. Light and seed storage had a positive effect on germination. Mean germination time varied from 12 to 40 days, and vigor index was positively influenced by potassium nitrate. V.quercifolia seeds are photoblastic positive at constant temperatures and their dormancy can be influenced by harvest time, fruit ripening and a storage period.",

The seeds were dried at 40, 50, 60, and 70°C, until their moisture content reached 8.5 ± 1% (wet basis). The physiological properties of niger seeds were determined by assessing their germination, germination speed index, mean germination time, cold test, accelerated aging with a saturated solution, emergence percentage, and emergence speed index. The quality of the oil was evaluated using gas chromatography, based on the fatty acid profile. We concluded that drying air temperatures of 40 and 50°C did not compromise the physiological quality of niger seeds. However, the 70°C drying temperature seriously impaired seed quality.

Sixteen agronomic traits were considered, and 40 Conilon coffee (Coffea canephora) accessions were evaluated. This study showed that the flexibility in selecting traits by researcher preference, graphical visualization, and Procrustes statistic through criteria 1 and 2 is a fast and reliable alternative for decision-making.

We evaluated the effects of applying a silicon (Si) slag on BFB suppressiveness in two melons cultivars as well as in soil chemical attributes and plant growth and nutrition. Slag was incorporated into the soil at concentrations equivalent to 0.00, 0.12, 0.24, 0.47, 0.71, and 1.41 g kg-1 of silicon. Plants were inoculated with Acidovorax citrulli 20 days after emergence. Results showed that amending the soil with Si slag improved the resistance of two melon cultivars against bacterial fruit blotch. Such an effect is probably related not only to the Si uptake by plants but also to changes in soil characteristics and improvement in plant nutrition. Both hybrid cultivars (AF4945 and Medellín) increased biomass, nutrient and Si accumulation as a function of Si doses applied to soil. According to Si concentration and Si to Ca ratio in plant tissue, both cultivars are regarded as intermediary Si-accumulators. We also observed that an intermediate dose of Si (0.71 g kg-1) posed better results on controlling melon bacterial fruit blotch than the highest dose tested",

    "abstract": "In vitro culture systems based on liquid culture media are considered to be more effective than semisolid culture medium systems. Liquid culture media systems provide better nutrient availability for plant tissues, easier culture handling, and the potential for scaling up and automation. However, in vitro liquid culture requires more careful handling due to the potential for contamination and the possibility of negative effects, such as hyperhydricity or vitrification, that hinder the growth and development of the plant material. Temporary immersion bioreactors have emerged as a workable alternative for capturing the benefits of liquid media, though semisolid systems are still traditional. Many studies have shown that silicon (Si) is a beneficial plant nutrient. Silicon might have a positive effect in both semisolid and liquid in vitro systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of silicon on the micropropagation and acclimatization of banana plants cultivated in vitro by comparing liquid temporary immersion bioreactor technology and semisolid traditional culture systems. Different silicon concentrations (0 and 1 mL L-1) and culture systems (liquid temporary immersion bioreactor and semisolid traditional culture) were evaluated over a 36-day period. The growth characteristics plant size, fresh and dry weight, and number and length of leaves and roots were evaluated. After the 36-day in vitro growth period, plants were transferred to a greenhouse for acclimatization and were evaluated after 30 days for the same growth characteristics used in the in vitro studies. The temporary immersion bioreactor system resulted in greater growth of banana plants compared to the traditional semisolid system. Temporary immersion bioreactors also showed a positive interaction with Si and resulted in higher values for all growth characteristics in the acclimatization phase.",

Seeds were inoculated into Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium supplemented with 4 µM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) to induce NCs and in culture medium without plant growth regulators to form normal seedlings. Samples collected at 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days of culture were analyzed. All parameters assessed showed the same variation pattern. However, seeds inducing NCs showed significantly lower starch (6.0 mg g-1 FM), carbohydrate (10.7 mg g-1 FM) and GDM (11.0%) levels than seeds forming normal seedlings after 21 days in culture. On the other hand, the protein content (9.1 mg g-1 FM) was significantly higher during induction. NCs induction process through seeds is the result of gene reprogramming in the explant, which leads to morphological, biochemical and metabolic alterations. This involves dedifferentiation, high cell proliferation, high energy demand and protein synthesis, which is related to elevated metabolic activity.",

The laboratory and image information were then arranged and prepared by clustering samples into classes based on the following soil attributes: texture, organic matter, base saturation (V%), CEC and total iron. Following this classification, mean spectral curves were generated for each attribute class. Spectral curves were used as endmembers for the generation of maps using MESMA. Maps of the same attributes were also generated using geostatistical analyses. Based on the two generated maps, a cross-tabulation was used to evaluate the accuracy of MESMA for mapping soil attributes. Agreement was high for maps of the texture, organic matter, CEC and total iron. We conclude that the methodology used in this work was efficient for mapping soil attributes.",

Different units sizes were simulated on the basis of known production values for the number of plants per row. To verify the independence or randomness of fruit production, a test run was applied to the units within the rows of individual and grouped harvests and in the same unit between individual and grouped harvests. There was a greater randomness of production in units with a higher number of plants. Using a lower number of harvests randomizes the production of units as the harvests are carried out. Groupings of harvests and units formed by four and five basic units are the most efficient combination for reducing non-randomness in the production of Italian Zucchinis.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the desiccation tolerance of Rhamnidium elaeocarpum Reissek seeds through physiological and biochemical alterations. Fruit were collected from the municipality of Jaupaci, Goias State, Brazil, when the water content of their seeds had a 37% wet basis (w.b.) and the seeds were subsequently kept in a drying oven with air circulation at a temperature of 35ºC until a water content was reached of 20 to 12% (w.b.). The following parameters were evaluated: germination, germination speed index, emergence, emergence speed index, electrical conductivity and respiration rate. Furthermore, the electrophoretic profile of the isoenzymes: catalase, peroxidase and esterase, the enzymatic activities of endo-β-mannanase and α-amylase and the electrophoretic analysis of heat-resistant proteins were performed. A higher germination speed and respiratory rate was obtained for seeds with a water content of 12% w.b., and the activity of catalase isoforms was more pronounced in seeds with a higher degree of dehydration, which was in contrast to peroxidase, showed decreased activity. The seeds contained heat-resistant proteins of low molecular weight that ranged from 48.7 to 13.2 kDa. We found that the acquisition of drying tolerance in R. Elaeocarpum Reissek seeds is associated more with catalase than with esterase and peroxidase.",

The study was conducted during the agricultural years 2006/07 and 2007/08, and the treatments included no-mechanical-treatment tillage and the use of a rotary shredder, crimper-roller, and mechanical disintegrator for millet plants before sowing the cotton. Evaluations were performed for the residue fragmentation, emergence speed, percent of soil cover during the cycle and yield of the cotton crop. The emergence speed was faster in the management with the rotary shredder. In 2006/07, the no-tillage treatment showed a rate of loss for soil cover that was 46 percent greater than the disintegrator treatment. The rotary shredder and the disintegrator yielded greater soil coverage during the cultivation cycle, and the yield was highly correlated with the soil cover at 75 days after emergence. The management of the millet residue affected the cotton plants for the two-year study period.",

Coffee berries were dried at temperatures (T) of 35, 45, 55 and 65ºC and at relative humidities (φ) of 25, 35, 45 and 55%, forming 16 different sets of conditions, with an initial moisture content for all conditions of 2.27 dry basis (d.b.), dried until 0.11 d.b.

Samplings were maintained in an olive orchard located in Maria da Fe, south of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and infested branches were stored in emergence containers to recover parasitoids. Another group was kept in Flanders batteries to evaluate the rate of parasitism in approximately 100 scales. Sixteen parasitoid species were collected during the sampling period, and the most common species were Coccophagus caridei (Brèthes) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), Diversinervus elegans Silvestri (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), and Mesopeltita truncatipennis (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), the latter of which was most abundant and frequent.

    "abstract": "Fig tree (Ficus carica L., Moraceae), which originated in the Mediterranean Basin, is one of the many fruit trees grown in Brazil, with ‘Roxo-de-Valinhos’ being the exclusively used cultivar. In this context, research aimed at the improvement of this species to develop highly resistant and adaptable cultivars is paramount. Thus, the present study aimed to maintain fig accessions in an in vivo active germplasm bank (AGB) at the Faculty of Engineering of Ilha Solteira (FEIS), São Paulo State University (UNESP), as well as to characterize the agronomic traits of these accessions based on quantitative descriptors of genetic parameters and observe gains with the selection of specific genotypes to illustrate the AGB in terms of genetic variability. A total of 36 F. carica genotypes were evaluated in the field at the Teaching, Research and Extension Farm (FEPE) of the FEIS, UNESP. Qualitative traits, fruit parameters (e.g., insertion of the first fruit, fruit stalk length, fruit length, fruit diameter, and average fruit mass), and accumulated plant dry mass were measured. In addition, genetic parameters, variance components, and descriptive statistics, including genetic and environmental variances, heritability and average heritability of clones, coefficients of genotypic and environmental variation and their ratio ( ), general average, and selection gain, were evaluated. The selected fig tree accessions showed genetic variability in the assessed traits, exhibiting good heritability and achieving selection gains. For instance, the first 10 classified clones exhibited a heritability of 80.2% and achieved a selection gain of 98% for accumulated plant dry mass. Therefore, the maintenance of in vivo AGBs allows agronomic studies, offering promising results for continuing the breeding programs and preserving the genetic variability of species.",

    "abstract": "Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is an important tuber vegetable for human health worldwide owing to its nutritional value and productivity. Consumption of orange-fleshed sweetpotato is beneficial to combat vitamin A deficiency in the world, including Brazil, as these tubers are rich in β-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. The genotype × environment interaction is one of the greatest challenges in plant breeding, specifically in the selection and approval of cultivars. In this context, adaptability and stability analyses are warranted to evaluate the performance of various genotypes in terms of general or specific adaptations to certain environments and to identify genotypes responsive to environmental variations. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genotype × environment interaction as well as to estimate the adaptability and stability of sweetpotato genotypes for identifying and selecting promising candidates for breeding. The experiments were performed in four environments: Vera Cruz in São Paulo, Selvíria in Mato Grosso do Sul, and one organic and another intercropped production system in Sete Barras in São Paulo. A randomized block design with two replicates was adopted. A total of 265 genotypes were tested, and the orange-fleshed sweetpotato cultivar ‘Beauregard’ was used as the control. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model was used to study environmental stratification, adaptability, and stability. The genotype × environment interaction was evident in all environments. The genotypes CERAT21-13 (marketable root yield, 22.30 t ha-1 in the four environments), CERAT29-26 (27.74 t ha-1), and CERAT52-22 (20.24 t ha-1) were the most adapted in general to the four environments. CERAT25-23, CERAT29-23, and CERAT29-26 were the most adapted to the environment in Vera Cruz; CERAT29-26, CERAT34-14, and CERAT56-32 to the environment in Selvíria; and CERAT31-10, CERAT35-19, and CERAT52-22 to the two environments in Sete Barras.",

The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design in a factorial scheme (4 × 2), with four cultivars and two production systems (monoculture and crop-forest integration), and four replicates per treatment. All soybean cultivars in the crop-forest integration system showed plant stagnation due to the shade level of the palm trees, as well as a reduction in the leaf area index and chlorophyll content in the leaves. Regarding reproductive parameters, grain, and oil yield, the cultivars responded differently between the production systems, revealing an interaction between the genotype and the environment. Our methodology was not favorable to soybean production; therefore, the management of spacing between palm trees and the selection of soybean genotypes that are more adapted to shaded environments are strategies that can allow for the integrated production of these species.",

This study aimed to apply a biometric alternative to minimize residual variance and maximize selection parameters by parent-progeny regression, interim controls, and mixed linear models intrinsic to breeding. The obtained data were subjected to the assumptions of the statistical model, which identified the normality and homogeneity of the residual variances and model additivity. Subsequently, two analysis scenarios were created. The first preserved all information obtained in the experiment, both from segregating families and pure-line cultivars, and was called original scenario. The other scenario preserved progeny data, but the residual variability of controls was restricted using as criterion observations contained between the interval of the first sample standard deviation. Thereby, an acceptable residue limit could be obtained. Both scenarios were submitted to three consolidated frequentist methods (genitor-progeny regression; sum of squares of augmented block design with interim controls; and mixed linear models, wherein random genetic effects are taken as weighted genetic parameters by the genealogical matrix). Restricting residual variation in parents or controls can maximize genetic parameters and genetic gains in soybean breeding. Significant heritability estimate gains were obtained in the augmented blocks with interim control approach. Mixed linear models with random genetic effects can be considered a great tool to obtain genetic parameters in experiments with a high magnitude of common and regular treatments.",

    "abstract": "Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important species in the cucurbit family with a large economic importance in the world. Two melon cultivars commercially important in Brazil are ‘Yellow’ and ‘Gaúcho’. In addition to their economic importance, these two cultivars display phenotypic differences in aroma, a major trait determining fruit quality. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) impart the different aroma found in this fruit and their biosynthesis is associated with fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Using RT-qPCR techniques, the expression of seven genes (CmLOX9, CmLOX18, CmBCAT1, CmArAT1, CmPDC1, CmADH1, and CmAAT1) was determined during ripening. The lipid pathway played a strong role in determining aroma composition in non-climacteric ‘Yellow’ melons. Most volatiles decreased during ripening, explaining the non-aromatic characteristic of this cultivar. In climacteric ‘Gaúcho’ melons, the amino acid pathway was the main one related to the biosynthesis of esters, which contribute to the aroma of this cultivar. Volatile products of the branched-chain amino acid pathway correlated with CmADH1 and CmAAT1 expression, demonstrating their role in volatile synthesis in this climacteric melon cultivar. In addition, CmPDC1 contributes to the formation of aldehydes at the beginning of this pathway.",

After harvesting the dryland species, farmers usually return with rice in the following cropping season, with costs associated with dismantling ridges before sowing rice. The possibility of sowing rice directly on residual ridges should be investigated to avoid these costs. The objective was to verify the ecophysiological adaptability of rice sown on residual ridges from the previous dryland crop in lowlands, and to identify possible factors impacting the physiological performance of rice plants in this new production system. The experiment was installed in the field in a randomized block design with 5 treatments and 12 replications. The treatments considered the plant’s position in the field and in the irrigation furrow. The parameters of the growth analysis were calculated using the classical method. There was no significant damage to rice plants in any part of the field, and there was no difference between plants at the top or bottom of the furrow. Therefore, there is no need to dismantle residual ridges from previous dryland crops before planting rice in the succeeding cropping season in the lowlands of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Rich in oil and protein, canola is a significantly promising crop and is widely explored as an alternative to grain cultivation in the winter period. Recently, canola oil has been largely consumed due to a variety of health benefits and low production costs. Nonetheless, impasses such as determining the correct sowing date and optimizing harvesting methods make it difficult to expand cultivation. Accordingly, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of two canola hybrids on three sowing dates and distinct harvesting procedures. The study was conducted in Cachoeira do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, on three sowing dates (2019, 2020, and 2021), with two hybrids (Hyola 433 and Hyola 575 CL). The methods of direct harvesting, direct harvesting with the application of adjuvant, cut-row, and cut-row with the application of adjuvant were evaluated. The main yield components were determined, in addition to biochemical parameters, such as oil and protein content and determination of oil quality (acid, peroxide, iodine, extinction, and saponification indices). Appropriately, this study indicated that canola is significantly sensitive to climatic conditions, mainly to temperature and sowing time, reducing grain and biomass yield in late sowing and resulting in serious harvest losses. Oil and grain protein contents were affected by climatic conditions. Nevertheless, the protein content was not affected by late sowing. Canola oil presented significant chemical conditions, with a correlation between the crops with higher oil yield and better oil quality.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the increase in soil stiffness, induced by variations in bulk density and water content at the tire-soil contact interface, causes a reduction in the contact area. For this, we examined the contact area from different tire-ground contact scenarios and compared the measurements and simulations using a contact area description model. Front and rear tractor tires were used for the measurement of the contact area under tilled soil, sugarcane field, unpaved road, and paved ground scenarios, which induced different bulk densities and water content levels. The results revealed that soil stiffness reduced the tire-soil contact area. The tire-soil contact area increased as the water content increased and the bulk density was reduced. For the front tractor tire, the theoretical contact area was similar to the values found for tilled soil, but there was a large difference between the measurements (2,200 cm2, for the tilled soil) and the theoretical estimates (3,100 cm2) for the rear tractor tire (likely induced by tire dimensions). Our results suggest that increases in soil stiffness reduce the tire-soil contact area. The higher the soil bulk density and the lower the soil moisture, the lower the contact area. The results also revealed that the tire tractor tread might reduce the contact at the hard surface, making the shape of the contact area more geometrically irregular and different from those predicted by models using regular geometry (e.g., cycles, ellipses, or rectangles). This study suggests that two-body (soil and tire) contact models for deformable surfaces should be used in future tire-soil contact models of agricultural field vehicles.",

Parameters examined include soil water retention (%), nutrient leaching (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) analyzed through the water collected after natural drainage, as well as various plant growth parameters such as stem height and diameter, and fresh and dry stem and leaf mass. The highest soil water retention was observed in treatments with 1.5 and 2.0 g kg-1 of hydrogel polymer. Regarding nutrient leaching, the treatments with 1.5 and 2.0 g kg-1 of hydrogel polymer exhibited the lowest values, resulting in reductions of over 85% for all accumulated nutrients leached by the end of the crop cycle. The application of hydrogel, especially at higher doses, also enhanced sugarcane growth, notably increasing fresh stem mass. These results suggest that hydrogel polymers could serve as a sustainable solution for controlling nutrient leaching in sugarcane cultivation, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental preservation.",

The selected parents, UNI01 and UNI05, were sourced from the active germplasm bank of Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros, Janaúba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.

Qualitative traits assessed included flower corolla color, immature fruit color, and shapes of longitudinal and transversal fruit sections. Quantitative traits encompassed mean flowering and fruiting days. We employed chi-square tests (χ²) to evaluate segregation patterns. The descriptor \"corolla color\" exhibited codominance, with a white corolla and purple borders linked to heterozygous genotypes. Dominant inheritance controlled the color of immature fruits, primarily purple. Genetic inheritance for transversal and longitudinal fruit shapes remained unexplained in the tested segregations. Parental and segregating generations displayed similar flowering and fruiting cycles.

For the depth from 0,0 to 0,10 m, the treatment with crops succession of cultures presented smaller values of SPR comparatively to rotation of cultures. This can be attributed to the fact that in the superficial layer, in function of the different spacings among-lines, these caused smaller dryer cycles and humidity with consequent smaller SPR for the succession of cultures in this depth. Values of SPR considered as critics to the growth of plants (larger than 2 MPa) were observed mainly in depth from 0,15 to 0,20 m, for treatment succession of cultures. This result can be due to presence of a foot-of-plow result from previous tilts of introduction in experimental area.

The present work was developed at the experimental station of the São Paulo State University/Ilha Solteira Campus, State of São Paulo, Brazil, in a Dark red latosol. The experimental design was the randomized completely blocks with twelve treatments and four replications, arranged in a factorial scheme 2x3x2, aiming to study: cotton cultivars (IAC 23 and CNPA ITA 90), plant density (6, 10 and 14 plants m-1); application systems of growth regulator (mepiquat chloride) with single application at 72 days after emergence (DAE) (1,0L ha-1) and in four times (0,1; 0,2; 0,3 and 0,4L ha-1), at 28, 43, 57 e 72 DAE. It was concluded that the application systems of the growth regulator do not affect the yield. The cotton plants with parceled application of growth regulator showed lower values of stem diameter and height when compared with single application. The IAC 23 presents stem diameter higher than the CNPA ITA 90. The CNPA ITA 90 presents fiber percentage higher than the IAC 23. The effect of growth regulator application system under the plant height depends of the plant population and the cultivar. The CNPA ITA 90 presents higher averages of fiber length, uniformity and tenacity. The parceled system of growth regulator application presets the higher values of uniformity and fiber length",

This study was developed during two years in order to evaluate the productive efficiency of intercropping corn - common bean, using different populations of plants in relation to monocropping system. A randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Intercropping influenced all agronomic characteristics of common bean, mainly the number of pods plant-1. The characteristics less affected were the number of grains pod-1 and the weight of 100 grains. The population of 125,000 common bean plants ha-1 produced more in the smaller population of corn (30,000 plants ha-1). However, the population of 250,000 common bean plants ha-1 fitted better to intercropping and it developed well in the two populations of corn plants (30,000 and 50,000 plants ha-1)",

The no-tillage system has presented positive results in soil erosion control and improvement of the soil fertility. The periodic chiseling of the soil for the control of the superficial compaction in no-tillage has frequently been used in the management system of clay texture soils. The objective of the present study was to evaluate some chemical properties of a Eutrophic Oxisol under two soil management systems, implanted 10 years ago: no-tillage with crop rotation (NT) and no-tillage with crop succession using chiseling of the soil before the summer crop and direct sowing of the winter crop (DD). Soil samples were collected in 2002 at the depths of 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.40 and 0.40-0.60m. It was evaluated the following soil chemical properties: soil organic carbon, available P (Mehlich-1), pH (CaCl2), Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+. pH values were higher in DD in the 0.05m depth, lowering to the 0.20m depth, which was different of NT. In the 0-0.20m depth was verified that DD presented higher cation exchange capacity, Ca+2 and P available compared to the NT; in NT was observed higher P available in 0-0.05m depth. Both management systems presented identical values of Mg+2 and K+ in soil profile",

This work was carried out to evaluate TDR and ECHO applications on a tropical soil Typic Paleudalf, which presents 73% of clay, commonly found at the Northeast region of Paraná, Brazil, and on a “washed sand” material. Mathematic models were fit, by linear regression analyses, to describe relations between soil volumetric water content and apparent soil dielectric constant (Ka) and between soil volumetric water content and electric potential.

Thus, the stem diameter, height, leaf number, dry matter production of the airy part of the roots, as well as the macro and micronutrients were evaluated after 80 days of the plantation. Thus, the silicate application to yellow-red Argisoil samples promoted quadratic increment in the height, stem diameter and in production of dry matter of passion fruit. The largest changes development was associated to the improvement of the soil fertility (saturation for bases = 57%; Ca = 20mmolc dm-3) and in the nutritional plants state (Ca - dry matter = 7.4g kg-1)",

Aiming at determining the effect of soil's water levels on the parthenolide contents of plants aerial parts, this experiment used feverfew [Tanacetum parthenium (L. ) Schultz Bip. ], grown in 5-L vases, with substratum kept at 100%, 90%, 70% and 50% field capacity. In the substratum highest water availability levels, plants showed larger height, more leaves, higher total leaf area and higher parthenolide content. In the lowest water availability level, the following decreases were verified: 16% in plants height, 13% in number of leaves, 14% in leaf area and 28% in parthenolide content, and an increase in the proline content. This suggests that higher water levels in soil are more appropriate for producing plants with larger parthenolide content.",

The no-tillage system had greater height of insertion of string beans, amount of string beans, height of plants, water contend and soil bulk density. Greater values of soil resistance to penetration were verified in the tillage, though higher productivity was observed. The coverings and the soil tillage systems influenced the productivity of soybean plants. The vegetal coverings promoted improvement of the ground with reduction of the compactation in some layers of the soil. The oats/millet association is a viable option of soil covering predecessor of soybean. The no-tillage practice showed to be the adequate management technique for the type of soil studied.",

On this research we tested the hypothesis that BNR can induce resistance on soybean against the foliar blight caused by R. solani anastomosis group (AG) 1 IA. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate BNR isolates isolated from peanuts, snapbeans and soybean according to their ability for inducing resistance on soybean against the foliar blight disease, under greenhouse conditions. This research evidenced the role of BNR inducing resistance on soybeans against the foliar blight. However, both the occurrence and effectiveness of the phenomenon of induced resistance are dependent on the soybean cultivation season",

It was verified that the highest K levels (exchangeable and non-exchangeable forms) derived from the finest particle size fractions: clay and silt. The K moving trough soil layers was associated with the presence and action of percolating water in the soil profile. The role of irrigation was significant in the distribution of the different K forms in the soil. Irrigated plots showed the best distribution of K from the surface down to 60 cm of depth. Statistical significant effects of the doses of K on the non-exchangeable K forms could be explained by the translocation of K from soil solution to soil exchange complex, and from that to strongly retained forms. Amounts of K absorbed by the plants were greater than the variation of exchangeable K content, suggesting that non-exchangeable forms are being taken up.",

The study was developed using a soil classified as Ultissoil, in Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks in split-plot portions, with the portions being the soil management factor (carried out under no-tillage system and soil prepared with chisel plow) and the split-plot the evaluation period factor (4 and 18 months after soil was prepared with chisel plow), with four replications. The results indicated that the chisel plow action, after the 4-month period, significantly reduced the resistance of the soil to penetration, down to the performance depth of the soil furrow made by the chisel plow (0.30 m). After the 18-month period, the effect of the chisel plow action on the resistance of the soil to penetration took place only in the superficial layer of the soil (0.05 and 0.10 m). In the area cultivated under no-tillage, the effect of chisel plow action on the resistance to penetration tends to disappear in a period of 1.5 years. The amount of dry matter in the soil surface under no-tillage was 30% higher in the soil prepared with chisel plow over the 4-month period.",

The significant difference observed between mean values of C1 and C2 cycles was attributed to the smaller population size in C1 generation. Individuals were distributed into three large clusters and 20% of the individuals were placed in a group different from their original cycle.

    "abstract": "The objective was to evaluate the forage yield and structural responses of spineless cactus ‘Orelha de Elefante Mexicana’ (OEM) (Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw) at different planting densities. The experimental design was a randomized block with five treatments and four replicates, during two production cycles of 12 months each. The evaluated densities were 20,000; 25,000; 33,333; 50,000; and 100,000 plants ha-1. The increase in planting density caused a linear reduction in plant height, width, and mass, as well as in number of primary, secondary, tertiary, and overall cladodes. It also caused a linear increase in cladode area index, dry and green yield, water use efficiency, and forage accumulation rate. The increase in planting density promoted a quadratic effect on cladode thickness and dry matter content. Cladode thickness decreased with planting densities up to 47,500 plants ha-1 and increased from this point onwards. As for dry matter content, there was an increase up to the planting density of 61,428 plants ha-1 and a decrease from this point onwards. The increase in planting density of spineless cactus ‘Orelha de Elefante Mexicana’ caused changes in structural responses and in forage yield. The use of greater planting densities increased forage yield.",

Thirty eggs of the pest were deposited on leaves of the respective cultivars, and exposed to each species of the parasitoid for 48 hours in controlled conditions, where they were kept until the emergence of their descendants. The parasitism rate was higher on BRS 8H cotton with better parasitism of T. atopovirilia and T. exiguum, followed by T. pretiosum. The parasitism viability was above 90%, and sexual ratio ranged from 0.79 to 1.00 on both cotton genotypes, but with lower values for T. exiguum, followed by T. atopovirilia. The number of descendants per parasitized egg of H. virescens was similar among parasitoid species, with values from 1.69 to 1.9. Overall, T. atopovirilia achieved better results on both cotton cultivars, differing from T. pretiosum. Thus, the performance of these species can be affected by cultivars. The results suggest that differences between plants are the causes of variation in the results of Trichogramma parasitism in the same culture.",

The hypothesis of this work is that the lime levels reduce the zinc availability in soil for the plant. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions without temperature control, in pots with 17 dm3 of ‘dystrophic Red Latosol’, medium texture. The statistical design was of randomized blocks, in a 3 x 5 factorial scheme, with four replicates. The treatments consisted of liming to reach three basis saturations: 40, 60 and 80%, combined with five zinc levels: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg dm-3. Only one plant per pot was grown up to 174 days after emergence (first mature raceme), at which point the morphologic and production components of plants were evaluated. Higher lime levels resulted in greater number of seeds per plant and dry matter of seeds per plant. There was interaction of basis saturation and zinc in plant height, in dry matter of root and in length of raceme (masculine part and total). However, none of these increases reflected a significant difference in weight of 100 castor bean seeds.",

Race 29-3 is incompatible with 'Ouro Negro' and compatible with 'Golden Gate Wax'. Primary leaves of ten-days-old F2 plants were detached and inoculated by immersion into an inoculum suspension. Immediately following immersion, each F2 leaf was placed in a Petri dish containing a filter paper previously moistened with distilled water. These dishes were incubated in a BOD at 20oC, under a 12h daily light regime. The humidity in the dishes was maintained by addiction of 1.5 mL of distilled water in filter paper, under a three days regime. As control, the remaining primary leaves of ten-days-old F2 plants were inoculated using the conventional inoculation method. Both inoculation methods were efficient in evaluating the reaction of the common bean to U. appendiculatus. The resistance/susceptibility screening of the F2 population confirmed the monogenic dominant nature of the rust resistance controlled by the Ur-ON gene in both methods.",

The experiment was performed using four seed lots of bell pepper hybrids in two periods, and the evaluations involved germination, seedling emergence, seedling emergence speed index, saturated salt accelerated aging and image analysis. The use of seedling imaging analysis by SVISis a new approach for bell pepper seed vigor evaluation. Both the software and traditional tests provided sufficient information for seed vigor analysis, enabling the segregation of the analyzed seed lots. Thus, the new method fulfills the requirement for an efficient, rapid, cost-effective and standardized method that allows comparisons among laboratories and avoids human influence on the interpretation of the results. SVIS can be considered a feasible option to be included in quality assurance programs of the bell pepper seed industry.",

    "abstract": "This work evaluated the changes in quality in early-harvested ‘Gold’ pineapple after coating with wax and exposure to 1-Methylcycloprepene before or after coating. The storage conditions and the experimental period simulated those of shipping and marketing, assuming that Ceará,Brazil, is the production site andEuropeis the marketplace. Evaluation was performed after harvest, upon removal of the fruit from cold storage, and every three days during room storage. Evaluations included visual quality of the fruit, shell yellowing, mass loss, flesh color, soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids to acid ratio, ascorbic acid, total soluble sugars, reducing sugar, phenolic content, and yellow flavonoids. Low temperature was the key variable for maintaining fruit quality during storage and simulated shipping. Waxing had a remarkable effect on visual quality, delaying yellowing and reducing shell dehydration. Those effects were not enhanced by the application of 1-MCP. 1-MCP treatment resulted in the maintenance of total phenolic content and retention of yellow flavonoids. Fruit flesh became lighter, while yellow color became more vivid during storage. Sugars and pH varied little during storage, while the decline in TA was more intense in waxed fruit. 1-MCP and waxing may be combined to preserve external and internal quality.",

Each orchard was evaluated at different times. The ZINB model with random effects in both link functions provided the best fit, as the inclusion of these effects accounted for variations between orchards and the numbers of diseased plants. The results of this model show that older plants exhibit a lower probability of acquiring HLB. The application of insecticides on a calendar basis or during new foliage flushes resulted in a three times larger probability of developing HLB compared with applying insecticides only when the vector was detected.",

    "abstract": "Cotton is one of the largest agricultural commodities that generate various sources of foreign exchange and employment worldwide. However, water deficiency is an environmental factor that limits the production of this crop, especially in semi-arid regions. We evaluated pyruvate supplementation to mitigate the effects of water stress on colored cotton. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse. We studied two forms of pyruvate supplementation (SP1- via seed and foliar and SP2- only via foliar); three conditions of irrigation management of the plants: water restriction in the vegetative phase (VE), flowering (FL), and vegetative and flowering (VE/FL); and additional treatment (total irrigation throughout the crop cycle and without pyruvate supplementation). The experimental design included a randomized block in a 2 × 3 + 1 factorial scheme. The factors resulted in seven treatments with three replications, with a total of 21 experimental units. Gas exchange, enzyme activity, and production of components were evaluated. Water restriction in the vegetative phase does not cause losses in BRS Jade cotton when supplemented with pyruvate. However, in the flowering and vegetative phases plus flowering, it reduces gas exchange and production components and increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes in relation to plants under full irrigation. Supplementation with pyruvate via seed plus foliar (SP1) was better for BRS Jade cotton grown under water restriction.",

To do so, 215 eucalyptus clones were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with 30 replicates and one plant per plot in four environments. At 36 months of age, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and pilodyn penetration (PP) were measured. Two MTME models were fitted, for which residuals were considered homoscedastic and heteroscedastic, with the best MTME model selected using Bayesian information criterion. The harmonic mean of the relative performance of the genotypic values (HMRPGV) was used to determine stability and adaptability. Of the two models, the heteroscedastic MTME model had better fit and provided greater accuracy. In addition, genotype-by-environment interaction was complex, and there was low genetic correlation between DBH and PP. Rank correlation between the clones selected by the MTME models was high for DBH but low for PP. The HMRPGV facilitated clone selection through simultaneous evaluation of stability, adaptability, and productivity. Thus, our results suggest that heteroscedastic MTME model / HMRPGV can be efficiently applied in the genetic evaluation and selection of eucalyptus clones.",

Four treatments were evaluated: secondary forest, perennial pasture, and perennial pastures recovered for five years and eight years, both of the latter through corn + brachiaria intercropping. The contents and stocks of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C, and N from the soil organic matter particle-size fractions, as well as the carbon management indexes (CMI) of the 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30, and 0.30–0.40 m layers were evaluated. The perennial pasture environment presented the highest total soil C and N contents; however, when observing the granulometric fractions and CMI, these increases were qualitative in relation to the secondary forest. Pasture recovery over eight years contributed to an improvement of soil quality similar to secondary forest, indicating that an increase in SOM quality, quantity, and recovery time related to increased pasture capacity to accumulate C and N in the soil.",

The first experiment (Experiment I) was conducted according to a completely randomized design (factorial scheme 2 × 2 × 2 + 1) with six replicates: two types of biochar (cattle manure biochar and rice husk biochar), with and without acidity correction [addition of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate (PA) in a proportion of 4:1 (Ca:Mg) to raise the soil base saturation to 60%], with or without the addition of 120 mg dm-3 of phosphorus (P) as ammonium phosphate, and a control treatment (without biochar, acidity correction, and P). Based on the results of Experiment I, a second experiment was conducted according to a completely randomized design, with five treatments (doses of biochar from cattle manure) and four replications. Rice husk biochar, as a conditioner of soil chemical properties, had less prominent effects than cattle manure biochar. Cattle manure biochar functioned as a corrective for soil acidity and a source of nutrients (mainly phosphorus). The dose corresponding to 5.46% of the soil volume led to the maximum grain production by common bean plants.",

Storage roots showed an increase of more than 50% in starch content 14 months after planting. The cultivar IAC 118-95 is distinguished by the higher harvest index, allowing earlier harvesting, with possible valorisation of the leaves as industrial raw material. Variables showed different degrees of inter-relationships amongst themselves.

Two-hundred soybean seeds from 40 genetically modified cultivars were collected in packages to measure the physical properties of the seeds. First, principal component analysis was performed to verify the interrelationships between the variables and soybean cultivars. Next, a boxplot was constructed for each variable, considering the groups obtained after analyzing the main components. Finally, a scatterplot containing the Pearson's correlations between the variables was constructed. We identified two clusters of cultivars: C1 and C2. The unit-specific mass was the physical property that contributed the most to the formation of C1, whereas the other physical properties contributed to the formation of C2. Soybean cultivars comprising C1 were similar to each other only in unit specific mass, and the cultivars allocated to group C2 were similar according to all the other properties evaluated. These results can serve as a guideline for genotype selection for soybean genetic improvement to minimize variations in the physical characteristics of the seeds and obtain greater efficiency in the processing stages. Thus, the equipment manufacturing industry and seed processing units can implement projects and equipment adjustments to manage the post-harvest and seeding processes of soybean seeds efficiently.",

Our study aimed to evaluate the potential interactions between soybean-grass intercropping with residual nitrogen in a no-tillage system. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a subdivided plot scheme. The main plots in the summer season were: 1) soybean monoculture; 2) soybean - Aruana Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Aruana) intercropping, and 3) soybean - Congo grass (Urochloa ruziziensis cv. Comum) intercropping. The subplots were the nitrogen rates of 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1, applied as side-dressing in maize and grasses during the autumn-winter season. Here, the results of the summer seasons are shown. To do so, the parameters evaluated were soybean agronomic traits, dry biomass production, and macronutrient concentrations of plants intercropped. The main effects and interactions were studied. Our findings showed that soybean-Aruana Guinea grass intercropping is an alternative to no-tillage system implementation. Moreover, residual nitrogen from the autumn-winter season directly interfered with the dry biomass production of grasses intercropped with soybeans in the summer season. In short, the systems studied seem suitable for implementing a no-tillage system, which aims to neutralize degraded pastures and produce forage for ensilage. Despite the changes in macronutrient concentrations within the intercropping system and residual nitrogen, and among intercropped crops over the years, Congo grass intercropped with soybeans in the summer season showed great capacity for phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium cycling.",

Jumbo (Lycopersicon esculetum Mill.). The experiment was carried out in the county of Marialva, north of Paraná, in area of Terra Roxa Estruturada Eutrófica. The experimental design used was randomized completed with four replicates, as each plot was composed by two lines of plants driven by vertical tutor. Fourteen days after the transplant 10 pulverizations were accomplished with weekly intervals. The treatments were: Aminon- 25, Microfol, Biofertilizers without micronutritious, Biofertilizers plus micronutritious, Aminon-25 +microfol, as the treatment without any product to check. The treatments that contained micronutritious, increased the number of fruits for plant, not differing statistically from each other, however. Regarding to the racemo number, the treatments that contained biostimulants were the best ones.",

In this work, the measures of the global solar radiation are compared, monitored by actinography, and by a piranometer of Kipp and Zonen (I model CM3), instrument of larger precision, in different conditions of sky covering. The data were collected in the Experimental Station Agrometeorologic of the State University of the West of Paraná - Campus of Cascavel (lat. 24º 53`South, long. 53º 23`West, alt. 682m), in the period of January to December, 2001. The found deviations were 18.95% in days of clean sky, 15.78% in days of partially cloudy sky, 4.50% in days of cloudy sky and 15.11% without considering the type of sky covering, showing that the solar irradiation obtained by the actinograph is underestimated independent of the conditions of sky covering",

Virus-free hardwood cuttings of the following rootstocks were used: ‘Ripária do Traviú’; ‘Kober 5BB’; ‘Campinas’ (IAC 766); ‘420-A’; ‘Schwarzmann’ and ‘Jales’ (IAC 572). Cuttings measuring 6.0 mm of width were prepared with a cut below the node in the basal portion and a cut in the internode in the superior portion, leaving 4 buds per cutting. Thus, the cuttings were submitted to the following treatments: Stratification in water during 48 hrs and No stratification in water. The cutting was performed in plastic bags containing soil growth medium, leaving 2 buds below and 2 buds above the soil surface. A randomized design with 4 replications and 10 plants per plot was used as a statistical model (2-factor arrangement). After 90 days, the following parameters were evaluated: porcentage of rooting cuttings; number of roots per cutting; and fresh and dry matter of roots. The porcentage of cuttings with shoot growth was also evaluate weekly, starting 28 days after the cutting, totalizing eight evaluations. According to the main results, it was possible to conclude that: a) the stratification of cuttings provides the highest porcentage of rooting cuttings for ‘Jales’ and the highest number of roots for ‘Kober 5BB’ and ‘Campinas’ rootstocks; b) ‘Jales’ presents the lowest number of roots per cutting; c) the fresh and dry mass, and the porcentage of cuttings with shoot growth are higher when they are submitted to the stratification treatment",

Parameters evaluated were: pondered medium diameter of the aggregates in the planted line, percentage of thin ones < 2.0 mm, plants velocity emergence index. The combination between the charges applied by the press wheel and the soil water contents did not influenced the thin percentage < 2.0 mm. The soybean plants emergence velocity was affected by the applied charges and the water contents. The maximum charge of 140 N applied by the press wheel on the seed caused a superficial incrusting of the soil.",

    "abstract": "Determination and removal of the time delay in corn crop maps. Due to the great amount of information collected at a low cost, the harvest mapping has been the development key for Precision Agriculture. However, mistakes can happen in this process. The main of them, the time delay, is described as the time spent among the cut of the plant by the bar of the platform and the passage of the grain for the sensor of productivity, and the correlation of this flow with the correct position of the combine when the culture was harvested. The spatial dependence analysis by the best adjustment semivariogram method and their parameters determined the best time delay. The variance of nugget effect measures the small amount variation in a group of space data. Dependence between the nugget effect and the time delay can be supposed. Thus, the variation of the nugget effect should be minimized with the true time delay. For the semivariogram analysis, the data of moisture productivity, moisture and elevation were divided in 12 subareas and each area had the determined time delay, varying from 3 to 27 second for moisture productivity and moisture and from 0 to 3 seconds for elevation. The best adjustment semivariogram method to determine the time delay was satisfactory, in spite of the atypical conditions, that is, high natural variability of the data for the three factors, proving changes of the time delay in a small area.",

The experiment was conducted in an entirely randomized delineation, with six P treatments: T0-control (substratum without P addition), T1-50, T2-100, T3-150, T4-200 and T5-250 mg dm-3, with five replications and 20 seedlings per replication. After 60 days, the seedlings presented a 98.2% survival rate and good root formation. The height varied in function of P levels, with maximum production up to the P dose of 250 mg dm-3; 60 days after the transplant, similar behavior for leaf area and dry matter production was observed. Furthermore, the P incorporation increased the phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) accumulation in vegetable tissues. Seedling growth was positively influenced by P levels, and the maximum growth occurred up to the P dose of 250 mg dm-3,/sup>. In conclusion, this characteristic showed that the species requires high levels of P during initial growth, under the tubette system.",

The results showed that Shiitake cultivation is recent and increasing in this region, and that growers have a high education level. Shiitake cultivation is mainly located in rural areas, with both Brazilians of Japanese descent and native Brazilians growing it. The most commonly used trees are eucalyptus and mango. The high level of log contamination is perhaps due to growing without temperature or moisture control and to the inappropriate growing system. In 2004, there were 45,000 Shiitake-inoculated logs in this region, and the yield stood around 200 g of fresh mushroom/log.

    "abstract": "There is already a great number of practical experiences with agroecological transition in the coffee plant (Coffea arabica L.), in small properties at the South region of Minas Gerais state, which inspired this research. The experiment was installed in a coffee crop (variety Catua・Amarelo, spacing 4.0 x 0.7 m and 6 years) age located in Lavras, (Minas Gerais state, Brazil). After the first year of agroecologic transition, the effects of organic and conventional management in the nutrition and productivity were evaluated. The experimental design used was the lattice balanced 4x4 in factorial scheme 3x2x2 with five replications and four additional treatments. The used organic management is efficient in the supply of N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, and Fe for the coffee plant in production. The treatments of organic management showed a similar productivity to the conventional one due to the existence of nutrient reserves in the soil.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus in the literature regarding how many subsamples are needed to perform accurate on-farm soil penetration resistance (SPR) mapping. Therefore, the objective of this study was to define the number of subsamples per sampling point needed to quantify the SPR. The experiment was performed in a 4.7 ha area and employed a 50 × 50 m grid system (18 sampling points). The SPR was evaluated using a digital penetrometer in two different years with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 15 subsamples per sampling point. The SPR maps produced with increasing numbers of subsamples were compared to the reference maps (15 subsamples) using the relative deviation coefficient and Pearson´s linear correlation. A reduction in the number of subsamples promoted an increase in the variability of the SPR data. Generally, the results from this study suggest the use of at least four subsamples per sampling point to achieve SPR maps with a coefficient of relative deviation less than 10% (30% maximum error per point around the mean) and significant correlation with the reference maps (15 subsamples).",

For selectivity in ingestion tests, EES and EHS at the LC50 did not affect the survival rate of the predator, but EESA (0.39% and 5.47% for the LC50 and LC99, respectively) reduced the survival rate to zero in less than 7 days, resembling chemical treatment with Decis®. Extracts applied to the eggs of an alternative prey reduced the consumption of eggs and therefore the predatory capacity of the ladybug, which led to a decrease in oviposition, egg viability and ultimately a reduction in predator fecundity.

The essential oil was extracted through the hydrodistillation of the lemon balm leaves and yarrow leaflets dehydrated in a forced ventilation oven at 40°C. The chemical analyses of the essential oils were performed using GC-FID and GC-MS. Intercropping showed a reduction of vegetative growth. However, intercropping increased the lemon balm essential oil content. On the other hand, these parameters did not change in yarrow.

Results indicated that tolerant cultivars increased their instantaneous WUE in comparison to susceptible ones; however, there was a difference between cultivars since Pinto Villa had a higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, leading to a higher water cost to produce seed than Pinto Saltillo. Furthermore, ycf2, rrn16, rpoC2, hardy, ndhK, erecta and ycf1 WUE genes were only overexpressed in Pinto Saltillo under limited water conditions, which turned out to be the most WUE efficient cultivar. Therefore, the component mechanisms of WUE are different even between drought tolerant cultivars and the mechanisms by which the tolerant cultivars increased their instantaneous and integral WUE were different.",

This work was carried out to evaluate the effect of an increasing nitrogen rate on maize agronomic performance under different variation coefficients of plant spatial distributions at the sowing row. The experiment was conducted in Lages, Santa Catarina State, South Brazil. Three variation coefficients (VC) of plant spatial distribution (0, 50, and 100%) were tested. At the 0 level, seeds were evenly distributed 17 cm from each other. In the other treatments with uneven spatial distributions, the distances between two neighbouring seeds ranged from 2 to 54 cm. Four nitrogen side-dress rates (0, 125, 250, and 375 kgN ha-1) were evaluated. The increase in VC of plant spatial distribution decreased the leaf area and the relative chlorophyll content of the index leaf at silking, regardless of the nitrogen rate. When the variation coefficient of seed placement was enhanced from 0 to 100%, such behaviour contributed to a decrease in the number of kernels per ear and the grain yield. Therefore, increasing the amount of N was not an efficient strategy for preventing yield losses caused by irregular plant spatial distribution at the sowing row.",

This study assessed the genetic divergence and population structure of sugarcane accessions that are the parents of the RB05 Series of the Sugarcane Breeding Program of Brazil. The DNA of 82 accessions was evaluated using 36 simple sequence repeat markers. The Jaccard similarity coefficient and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean clustering method were used to generate a cluster that was divided into 17 distinct groups derived from probabilistic models. The similarity coefficient used in both cases showed that the degree of similarity varied from 0.4716 (RB971551 x RB965586) to 0.9526 (RB936001 x SP89-1115), with a mean of 0.8536. This result demonstrates a high similarity between the 82 accessions and confirms Wright’s F statistic (0.125), which indicates moderate genetic variability. The less-similar crosses suggest that breeders seek a higher number of crosses using cultivar RB965586, highlighting the RB971551 x RB965586 and RB965586 x RB855511 crosses. The results demonstrate that crosses such as RB936001 x SP89-1115 and RB945954 x RB896342 should be avoided because of their high genetic similarity.",

For Inv-CW in the 1st cycle, the highest activity occurred with 0, 30, and 50% shading. However, the interaction for Inv-V leaf activity was not significant in the 1st and 2nd cycles. The highest activity observed for Inv-V was in the fertilized plants, suggesting that fertilization increased the enzymatic activity. The activity of the invertases increased both under 30-50% shaded conditions and in full sun. Furthermore, invertase activity was directly linked to the osmoregulatory system. The reduction in RS was related to a low photosynthetic rate, and an increase α and β-amylase was associated with the use of reserve energy sources to meet energetic needs.",

The data were subjected to Tukey’s test (p ≤ 0.05). There was a growth increase, especially in plant shoots. The reduction in lipid peroxidation, as indicated by lower malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, can be explained by an increase in antioxidant activity when SA and Spd were added. When compared to CAT and APX, SOD was the least responsive enzyme to the addition of both SA and Spd in salt-stressed plants. SA and Spd partially reduced the effects of moderate salt stress in both plant species; however, Spd addition had better results than SA in terms of suppressing oxidative stress.

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of the chemical composition of soybean seeds and the efficiency of seed mineral supplementation on physiological quality and field performance. Two seed lots (high and low levels of mineral nutrition), with or without supplemental macro- and micronutrients, of three soybean cultivars (BMX Potência RR, BMX Turbo RR, and BMX Magna RR) were used. For the laboratory experiment, a completely randomized design with four replications was used. To evaluate the physiological quality of the seeds, the water content, first count, germination, 1,000-seed weight, and length and dry weight of the seedling were determined. For the field experiment, a randomized block design with four replications was used, and seedling emergence and grain yield were evaluated. Seeds with higher nutrient content produced seedlings of greater vigor and higher grain yield for all of the cultivars studied. The use of mineral supplementation in seed lots with low nutrient content resulted in greater vigor under laboratory conditions. The increase in grain yield after mineral supplementation depends on the quality of the seed lot.",

    "abstract": "Anthracnose, which is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is one of the most widespread and important diseases of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the world. The objective of the present study was to characterize the genetic resistance of the Beija Flor cultivar by inheritance and to conduct allelism tests. The inheritance test was conducted in the F2 population derived from the Beija Flor (resistant) x TU (susceptible) cross inoculated with race 2047 of C. lindemuthianum. Furthermore, allelism tests exhibited a fitted segregation ratio of 15R:1S, thereby indicating the independence of the Beija Flor gene from the following previously characterized genes: Co-1, Co-2, Co-4, Co-42, Co-6, Co-12, Co-14, Co-15, and Co-Pe. Based on the aforementioned results, we are proposing the symbol Co-Bf to designate the new anthracnose resistance gene in the Brazilian Andean common bean cultivar Beija Flor. This cultivar is an important source of resistance to C. lindemuthianum that should provide a valuable contribution to the common bean breeding program for anthracnose resistance.",

The number of pollen grains per floral bud (NGPB), number of pollen grains per anther (NGPA), number of anthers per flower bud (NAB), number of ovules per flower bud (NOB), and the P:O ratio of each species were estimated. All species had a P:O ratio over 2,000 and were classified as xenogamous. P.guajava presented the highest values for all characteristics evaluated, with the NGPB at 3,777,519, the NOB at 584.50 and a P:O ratio of 6,462.82. Similarly, P. cattleyanum had a P:O ratio of 5,649.89 (NGPB 762,736 and NOB 135). However, P. guineense was considered facultative xenogamous, with P:O of 2,085.75, the NGPB at 741,484 and the NOB at 355.50. Thus, it was concluded that the studied species have a preference for allogamy and require many pollen grains to fertilize each ovule, demonstrating that the transfer of pollen to the stigma is not very specialized.",

Phaeomoniella chlamydospora is one of the pathogenic fungi associated to esca disease, but its interaction with the plant under excess of salt remains unknown. Under controlled in vitro conditions, Vitis vinifera L. plants were exposed to 0, 20 and 100 mM NaCl and inoculated with P. chlamydospora. Both inoculation and salt stress decreased the levels of chlorophylls, which was aggravated when both factors were combined. NaCl 100 mM and, mostly, inoculation, decreased maximum fluorescence (Fm), variable fluorescence (Fv) and Fv/Fm. The activity of a-amylase decreased in plants exposed to 100 mM or inoculated but no synergic effect of these factors was observed; the activity of sucrose synthase was inhibited only by inoculations, whereas invertase was stimulated at 20 mM, but decreased with inoculation. Data support that both excess of salt and fungi inoculation negatively affect photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism, and that they also decrease amylase activity, which may play an important role in the increased levels of starch found in inoculated plants.",

The use of mathematical modeling to simulate rainfall is a tool used to circumvent this problem and to simulate the operation of water systems in different scenarios. The present study applies mathematical modeling to the hourly pluviometric precipitation data simulation. A pluviographical data set from October 1980 to December 2007 was used in the study. Precipitation data sets were obtained through daily pluviometric digitalization from the Meteorologic Station of Epagri at Urussanga, in southern Santa Catarina, Brazil (latitude 28º 31’ S and longitude 48º 19’ W). To simulate the hourly rain series, the stochastic model was modified based on the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulses model with six parameters. Those parameters were fitted by minimizing a function related to the analytical expressions that define the average, variance, and autocorrelation coefficient at lag 1 and the probability of a dry period related to the estimated values from the observed data. Ten series were simulated for 100 years of data. Data analyses and results showed that fitting Bartlett-Lewis model parameters makes it possible to simulate hourly rainfall while preserving precipitation statistical properties at several temporal aggregation levels. In general, the probability of dry periods tended to be overestimated.",

    "abstract": "Twenty lettuce accessions from the UENF Germplasm Collection were assessed for genetic diversity using RAPD markers. Multivariate statistical techniques were used, such as grouping analyses, using the Tocher and Single Linkage methods. Analysis of 55 polymorphic markers, obtained with 25 primers, showed that there was sufficient variability in the material studied to be exploited in future breeding programs. The ‘BGH 4060’ and ‘Grand Rapids’ accessions were the most dissimilar, while ‘BGH 4325’ and ‘BGH 4326' were the most similar. There was high agreement between ecogeographic origin and molecular similarity. It was further found by the stress statistic (Kruskal, 1964) and by the correlation between number of markers and increase in ideal formation of groups that 50 polymorphic markers is the optimum number for genetic diversity study in the assessed accessions.",

    "abstract": "Grapes are widely grown in various regions of the world; in Brazil, viticulture is considered to be an important form of agriculture. There are two distinct market branches: wine and other distilled alcoholic products and natural juice, plus the domestic consumption. The production of wine, grape-juice and by-products from the wine industry occurs in twelve Brazilian regions, with a larger concentration in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo. Grape-crop management depends upon such agro-meteorological variables as temperature, solar radiation, atmospheric humidity and water availability, since these can greatly influence both crop yield and quality. For regions where most of the rain coincides with the development and maturation of the fruit, the search for alternative management is justified, the aim being to mitigate that impact over the quality of the fruit, particularly with respect to wine production. An experiment with grape-wine was carried out in Jundiaí (SP), at Centro de Fruticultura do Instituto Agronômico (Fruit-growing Center of the Farming Institute), IAC (23º06’ S; 46º55’ W, 715m). The search was focused on the microclimate modification in the environment of cultivated grapes, from its conduction in a partially modified crop-cultivation environment, as well as to evaluate the impact of this practice on the growth and development of the crop. A comparison was made by observing the growth of the same culture in a natural environment. The results showed that the use of a plastic cover to cultivate grapes created a micro-environment that was characterized by a decrease in the levels of solar radiation, an increase of the maximum temperatures and the persistence of higher saturation deficit levels",

    "abstract": "Producers in the northeastern semiarid region of Brazil have been cultivating irrigated corn. The commercialized product comprises mainly green ears and silage. However, the irrigation of crops for dry grain has been questioned regarding costs and price competitiveness in relation to the same non-irrigated product cultivated in other regions. In recent years, the use of drip tapes and fertigation has spread among corn producers in the region. The aim of this study was to determine the N dose, via fertigation, which provides the maximum economic production of corn for dry grain, in two crop seasons (summer and winter), in the semiarid region of Brazil. The experimental design was performed in randomized blocks, with four replications. In both crops, the treatments consisted of four doses of N (0, 80, 160, and 240 kg ha-1) applied in the form of urea. In the hybrid corn (Bt Feroz), the N content was evaluated in terms of leaves, grain yield, gross and net incomes, the rate of return, and the profitability index. Independent of the crop season, the yield of dry grain (5,441.03 kg ha-1) was highest when the corn was fertigated with a dose of 104.05 kg ha-1 N. The highest net incomes of the dry grain were obtained with 80 kg ha-1 N in summer (R$ 1,190.78 ha-1) and 160 kg ha-1 N in winter (R$ 2,757.54 ha-1). The winter crop was more favorable to the economic production of dry grain.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of calcium silicate and copper sulfate on anthracnose intensity and nutrition of bean plants. The experiment was conducted using an experimental design in randomized blocks following a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement, (four levels of calcium silicate and four levels of copper sulfate) and two additional treatments (plants without inoculation and plants sprinkled with Benomyl). Four evaluations of the incidence and severity of anthracnose were done, in addition to measuring total leaf area. At the end of the evaluations, incidence and severity data were integrated over time, obtaining the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). Contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Si and lignin were determined in the aerial part. A linear decrease of the intensity AUDPC was observed with the increase of the doses of calcium silicate. The severity AUDPC was influenced by the doses of copper, obtaining a reduction of 35% on the higher dosage. The supply of silicon and copper altered the content of the K, Mg, S, Zn, Ca and Si in the aerial part of the bean plants.",

Five treatments were used: soil without cover, covered with black plastic, covered with laying oats, covered with harvested oats, and covered with oat straw in natural form, for growing three cultivars of lettuce. A randomized blocks design was used in a split-plot system, with four replications. It was concluded that soil covered with oat straw promoted satisfactory lettuce production, as well as adequate Mn and Zn content in plants, equivalent to those found in studies conducted under different growing systems; the soil covered with black plastic promoted satisfactory production and higher Zn content after the first year, and lower Mn content after the second year.",

The induction medium was MS, supplemented with organic complements constituted of sucrose, myo-inositol, thiamin, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid and AIB. The regeneration medium differed from the induction medium because it does not have AIB. The treatments consisted of variable times of permanence of the explants in the induction and regeneration media (induction/regeneration): 0/25; 5/20; 10/15; 15/10; 20/5 and 25/0 days. The experimental design was completely randomized, with six treatments and four repetitions, with each experimental unit represented by five test tubes. The maximum rooting and the maximum length of the largest leaf were obtained around 16 days after the branches were incubated in the induction medium. For the variables ‘number of roots’ and ‘larger prolongation of the branches’, the maximum results were obtained after approximately 15 days in the induction medium. Therefore, this work concludes that, for good rooting pattern, the permanence of the branches in medium of induction for a period of 15 to 16 days is essential.",

Two fertigation techniques were used, one denoted by conventional control system and the other by computerized control system. In the conventional control system, the nutrient solution was applied by using fixed time intervals between fertigation events. In the other system, the application occurred according to transpiration estimates, which were performed by the control algorithm of the computerized system. Under cloudy conditions, the EC of the drained nutrient solution decreased in both systems as a result of low transpiration and high leaching fractions, which mitigated substrate salinization. However, under high values of solar radiation, EC increased due to low leaching fractions. The results demonstrated that, under cloudy conditions, the computerized control system reduced effluent volumes by 54% as compared to the conventional control system and, simultaneously, prevented substrate salinization by maintaining mean EC values of the drained solution in the range from 2.9 to 3.5 dS m-1.",

After three cuts, dry mass produced by the forage was estimated in order to obtain the values of the nutrients exported by the plant. Only after this procedure did the application of the doses of N take place. The production of dry mass - DM, crude protein - CP, neutral-detergent fiber – NDF, and acid-detergent fiber – ADF, were influenced by cuts; increasing N fertilization increased the production of DM, CP and decreased ADF and NDF, providing better forage quality. The fertilization with phosphorus and potassium can be done based on DM production or P and K content in soil.",

Deviation of linearity (p < 0.05) was observed for aeration time on dry matter. a positive linear effect was observed (p < 0.05) on ADF, NDF and soluble carbohydrates content, but negative for ammoniacal nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility of dry matter. For organic acids content, deviation of linearity was observed on acetic acid, with the lowest content (1.5% of DM) observed after 8 hours of aeration, and a negative linear effect was observed for lactic and butyric acids, as well as for pH values. There were no effects on ethanol concentration, which remained very high (22% of DM), regardless of aeration time. Aerobic stability of silage worsened with the increase in aeration time.",

Different weed control managements can induce distinct changes in soil structure. One important soil physical attribute used for the analysis of modifications in soil structure is the soil water retention curve (SWRC). The objective of this work was to verify the use of physico-hydrical attributes to understand the effect of weed control managements on soil structure. Two soil layers (0–0.05 and 0.10–0.15 m) and six weed control managements divided into two groups were analyzed: I. no soil disturbance and ground cover (no weed control, post-emergence herbicide, mechanical mower); and II. soil disturbance and no ground cover (hand-hoe weeding, rotary tiller, pre-emergence herbicide). An area of native forest was used as reference. The results showed that the volumetric water capacity derived from the SWRC can be an interesting tool to evaluate the impact of weed control managements on soil structure. Evaluations of the air-filled porosity variation for different pressure heads also presented interesting findings. Distinct results of the weed control managements were found for the different depths analyzed in relation to the forest.",

The similarities between the sample subunits were calculated by the Jaccard Similarity Index, and the species diversity with the Shannon Diversity Index and Pielou Evenness Index. The horizontal vegetation structure was characterized by density, frequency, dominance and the values of ecological importance, and diametric distribution were assessed by the Spiegel procedure. The families Vochysiaceae, Fabaceae and Sapindaceae were highly represented, and Qualea paraensis, Aspidosperma discolor and Matayba arborescens were the most important species. A high diversity and low ecological dominance were found, and the diametric structure of the trees presented a negative exponential distribution.

    "abstract": "The experiment was performed at the Campus of Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia - UESB, in Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia-Brazil, from November 2005 to February 2007, aiming to evaluate the effect of pruning and harvest time on cassava agronomic characteristics. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with three replications. The treatments were arranged according to a 6 x 2 factorial scheme, with six harvest times (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 days after pruning) and two cultivation systems (with and without pruning). The results showed that pruned plants presented low aerial part weight and low productivity of tuberous roots, though a reduction of dry matter, starch and flour production was not observed, which were evaluated in kg ha-1. Tuberous roots, starch and flour production increase linearly with the harvest times. Cooking time was influenced by pruning. Pruned plant roots showed higher cooking time when compared to the roots of non pruned plants.",

    "abstract": "Several diseases are difficult to control specially in subtropical regions and perennial hosts where the pathogen survive easily within the plant. The aim of this study was to identify which pathogens are surviving after end of one season and at the beginning of the next season to inform which pathogens represent potential risk as primary inoculum to the next season. Survival of pathogens on apple tree twigs was evaluated during dormancy and on beginning of vegetative growth in four orchards located in the two main apple production regions: Palmas and metropolitan region of Curitiba, in Paraná State, Brazil. For this purpose, 10 cm long asymptomatic twigs were collected from 10 randomly selected plants, 24 twigs per plant. Half of the twigs were left directly (without disinfection) in humid chambers for 30 days at 25ºC. The other half of the twigs were disinfected and kept in a freezer for 12 hours at -16ºC by the Over Night Freezing Incubation Technique (Onfit) and then kept in a humid chamber for 30 days at 25ºC. The fungi Colletotrichum sp., Botryosphaeria sp., Alternaria sp., and Fusarium sp. were detected in the two sampled dates and methodologies in all evaluated regions. Neonectria ditissima was only detected in both orchards from Palmas. The genera found surviving on twigs were confirmed molecularly by BLASTn and were pathogenic in wounded fruits from the cultivar ‘Gala’. Our results indicate that pathogens are surviving in orchards after winter treatment and throughout the apple season, being potential sources of inoculum for infections in flowers and fruits, where the pathogens detected cause important diseases as bitter rot, Neonectria fruit rot, white and black rots, and possibly cause Alternaria and Fusarium rots which have not been extensively studied in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "One way to reduce mineral fertilizers is to use alternative fertilizers instead, such as the byproducts from the food industry. In the present study we evaluated the effects of sugarcane bagasse ash on the physiology, growth, and development of sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.). We conducted an experiment in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with two sunflower cultivars (Multissol and Catissol), five sugarcane bagasse ash doses (0.0, 3.125, 4.687, 6.25, and 7.812 mg ha-1), and 5 replicates. At 85 days after planting we determined the plant height; leaf number; stem diameter; internal and external diameter of the flower chapter; leaf area index; shoot dry weight; net assimilation rate; dry mass production rate; relative and absolute growth rate; extravasation of electrolytes; relative water content; photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, and the chlorophyll a/b ratio); and soluble carbohydrates, proteins, and proline. The height, number of leaves, and shoot dry mass increased due to the availability of nutrients contained in the ash. The incorporation of ash into the soil increased the photosynthetic activity (chlorophyll a and b) of both sunflower cultivars. The diameter of the stem, leaf area index, and relative growth rate of both sunflower cultivars increased with increasing ash dose. Therefore, the ash can be used as an alternative fertilizer, complementing or replacing mineral fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "Water and salt stress conditions affect germination and seedling emergence. It is known that physiological priming can not only trigger different mechanisms to increase the speed and uniformity of germination, but also influence the antioxidant defence system of the seeds, especially in adverse conditions. In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological seed quality and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in seeds of Petroselinum crispum induced to tolerate saline stress through osmo-priming. Seeds were placed in polyethylene glycol solutions with three osmotic potentials (-0.5, -1.0 or -1.5 MPa) for 2, 4 or 6 days. Subsequently, they were placed on substrates moistened with sodium chloride solution (NaCl), in concentrations that generated osmotic potentials of -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8 or -1.0 MPa, to germinate. The germination percentage, germination speed index, seedling length, fresh weight, dry weight and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were evaluated. Germination and germination speed index decreased linearly with the increase in NaCl concentrations, indicating the species sensitivity. As for length, fresh weight and dry weight of seedlings, this effect was more expressive from the potential of -0.4 MPa. The vigour and activity of SOD, POD, and CAT enzymes were reduced in unprimed seeds, emphasising the effectiveness of the technique. The induction of tolerance to saline stress can be related to the activity of the antioxidant system observed in seeds.",

To this end, plant material was polymerized in glycol methacrylate resin, cut into sections, and stained using toluidine blue (0.05%) or via histochemical staining with PAS/naphthol blue black. Anatomical analysis of plant structures revealed the presence of phenolic compounds and sclerenchyma tissue, which in turn are expected to negatively impact the development of adventitious roots.",

Tobacco budworm, Chloridea virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is one of the most major pests of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in Brazil. This pest damages leaves, flowers, pods, and grains. Plant resistance to insects is an important tactic of pest management, which usually facilitates and reduce costs of implementing an Integrated Pest Management for farmers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the resistance in chickpea cultivars to C. virescens. Six chickpea cultivars were evaluated for antixenosis, initial antibiotic parameters, and behavior under field conditions. The cultivars BRS Kalifa and BRS Cícero were less attractive in a free-choice test, while Jamu 96 and BRS Kalifa were less attractive in a no-choice test. BRS Kalifa and BRS Toro leaves had a higher trichome density. Jamu 96 and BRS Toro had higher contents of oxalic and malic acids. C. virescens larvae in BRS Cícero, BRS Toro, and BRS Kalifa showed the lowest weights. Jamu 96 pods were the least damaged, and BRS Aleppo and Jamu 96 had the highest yields. The chickpea cultivars Jamu 96 and BRS Aleppo, which had resistance levels and mechanisms, can be used in integrated pest management programs to control C. virescens.",

However, information on management of this disease is still limited. This study aimed to determine the in vitro sensibility of X. vasicola pv. vasculorum to different chemicals and to evaluate the control of bacterial leaf streak on corn under greenhouse conditions. In vitro tests were carried out with kasugamycin, copper sulfate, copper oxychloride, copper hydroxide, cuprous oxide, bioactive copper, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, methyl thiophanate, and tebuconazole at the dosages of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg mL−1. Four strains of X. vasicola pv. vasculorum were included in the study. The minimal inhibitory concentration for kasugamycin ranged from 50 to 200 μg mL–1, whereas to the inorganic copper compounds varied from 5 to 50 μg mL–1 and to the bioactive copper was 100 μg mL–1. Further, mancozeb and tebuconazole inhibited the bacterial growth at the dosage ranging from 5 to 20 μg mL–1 and 50 to 400 μg mL–1, respectively, depending on the X. vasicola pv. vasculorum strain. Chlorothalonil and methyl thiophanate did not inhibit the growth of the bacterium at any tested concentration. The control of bacterial leaf streak under greenhouse conditions was investigated on corn plants of the cultivar IPR 164 at the V3 phenological vegetative stage, sprayed with kasugamycin (3 mL L–1), copper oxychloride (1.5 mL L–1), bioactive copper (1 mL L–1), mancozeb (2 g L–1), tebuconazole (1 mL L–1), and chlorothalonil (2 mL L–1). The corn plants were inoculated with a 108 CFU mL–1 suspension of the RL1 strain of X. vasicola pv. vasculorum. Only copper oxychloride significantly reduced disease severity. However, this copper compound caused phytotoxicity to the corn plants at the tested concentration.",

    "abstract": "The cultivation of special corns, such as baby corn, has had a positive influence on the economy of the country. Despite its importance, there is still a need for studies aimed at increasing production and planting areas of the crop. Phytosanitary studies are of particular interest, as the cultivation of such crops is susceptible to a series of pathogens, such as Bipolaris maydis, Exserohilum turcicum, and Puccinia polysora. The use of resistant cultivars is the most effective way to prevent the occurrence of these diseases. Thus, the present study aimed to identify popcorn lines that have the potential for baby corn production and are resistant to the main leaf diseases that affect the crop. The experiment was conducted in randomized blocks with four replications of 30 lines in each area, during two planting seasons. The area was located at the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo (IFES) Campus of Alegre, situated in Rive district, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Using the obtained data, the area under the disease progress curve was obtained. Subsequently, analysis of the joint variance of the data was conducted, and when a significant effect was found, a grouping of means test was conducted. The Mahalanobis distance for each pair of lines was also calculated, and the genetic distance matrix was used to construct a dendrogram using the UPGMA method. Considering the averages obtained for the three diseases (Southern corn leaf blight, Northern corn leaf blight, and Southern rust), lines L61, L63, L65, L683, L684, L685, L691, L694, and L695 were identified as possible donors of resistance alleles for multiple diseases. Multivariate analysis efficiently grouped the lines L61, L63, L684, L685, and L691, which are described as most resistant in the univariate analysis.",

    "abstract": "To be considered drought-tolerant, a tomato cultivar is required to present some level of tolerance at all developmental stages of plant growth. Since drought tolerance is a stage-specific phenomenon, genotype assessment must be performed separately at all developmental stages. In this study, we used a multi-trait index based on factor analysis and genotype-ideotype distance (FAI-BLUP index) to properly rank 49 tomato genotypes according to their tolerance to drought stress conditions at germination and seedling stages. Seeds of 47 introgression lines, which cultivar M82 is considered drought-sensitive, and the Solanum pennellii wild accession LA 716, which is considered drought-tolerant, were subjected to a control condition, where seeds were soaked in distilled water, and a drought condition, where seeds were soaked in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (-0.3 MPa). Drought stress, induced by PEG, had a significant impact on all nine germination and growth performance-related traits; there was a reduction in shoot length (SL), total length (TL), initial germination percentage (IGP), final germination percentage (FGP), germination velocity index (GVI), and germination rate (GR). In contrast, the root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) and time to reach 50% germination (T50) increased under drought stress. Root length (RL) was less affected by drought, and in some genotypes, it was even increased. As expected, LA 716 ranked closest to the drought tolerance ideotype. IL 1-4-18, IL 2-3, IL 1-2, IL 9-2, and IL 10-1 were the most drought-tolerant at the germination stage. These results will serve as guidance for breeders who are aiming at developing drought-resistant tomato cultivars.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of graphite on the longitudinal deposition of soybean seeds using mechanical and pneumatic feeders at different distribution velocities. The experiment was performed on a static simulation-test bench, with a completely randomized design with two varying factors: graphite dose (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 g kg-1 seed) and distribution velocity (5, 7, 9, and 11 km h-1 for the pneumatic feeder; and 3, 5, 7, and 9 km h-1 for the mechanical feeder). To assess the homogeneity of seed distribution, the frequency of parameters such as double, flawed, and acceptable spacings, coefficient of variation, and precision index were evaluated from five repetitions of 250 spacing each. For the pneumatic feeder, the optimal values to maximize precision of seed deposition were 4.6 g kg-1 and 6.7 km h-1 of graphite dose and distribution velocity, respectively. In turn, the optimal values to minimize undesirable spacing while maximizing accuracy with the mechanical feeder were 4.9±0.6 g kg-1 and 4.9±0.3 km h-1. Overall, regardless of feeding mechanism, the use of graphite promoted greater efficiency in the distribution of seeds owing to the higher level of fluidity inside the reservoir; however, high doses can cause the opposite effect. In addition, an excessive increase in speed influenced seed distribution negatively.",

Therefore, there is growing interest in this crop among researchers in the pursuit of increased yields and better cultivation conditions. Asexual propagation is the most commonly used method for propagating grapevine seedlings, with cuttings used for rootstock formation and subsequent grafting of materials to form the canopy. The rootstock is responsible for support, water, and nutrient uptake, thus determining the vigor of the plant; therefore, it is essential to understand the suitable conditions in which roots can thrive and thereby enhance plant growth. The type of cutting, type of substrate, and application of exogenous auxins are among the factors that interfere with the rooting of grapevine rootstocks, and determining and implementing the best combination of these factors could provide for more vigorous plants. Reviewing high-quality published scientific research from diverse countries is a method of identifying data, grouping information, and obtaining reliable answers.

    "abstract": "The morphogenic characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens were studied in function of different fertilization. The study was conducted in a green house evaluating two Brachiaria cultivars (B. brizantha cv. Marandu and B. decumbens cv. Basilisk) and five different fertilizations (no fertilizer, P, N, NP and NK). The assay was conducted in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme in a completely randomized design, with four repetitions. The morphogenic evaluations included leaf emergence, leaf elongation rates and filocron. The answer of the cultivars was quite expressive to the studied variables relative to nitrogen supply and its combination with phosphorus and potassium. The Basilisk grass was more productive than Marandu grass. The nitrogen importance as a tool to manipulate plant structure was evidenced.",

    "abstract": "The influence of different management agricultural practices such as disk harrowing, mowing and use of perennial green fertilizer (Pueraria phaseoloides) between rows of rubber-trees (Hevea brasiliensis) was studied on the penetration resistance of the soil. It was evaluated in different depths in a “Latossolo Vermelho distrófico textura argilosa A moderado caulinítico hipoférrico relevo plano” (LE) in the rural area of Jaboticabal and in a \" Argissolo Vermelho -Amarelo distrófico abrúptico, Tb, A moderado, textura areia média, fase floresta tropical subperenifólia e relevo suave ondulado\" (PVA) in the rural area of Tabapuã, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Treatment effects were evaluated on the resistance to soil penetration developed by the cone, and the values of the dynamic resistance for the depths of 0-10,10-20, 20-30 e 30-40 cm were obtained. Soil samples were collected to evaluate gravimetric moisture and bulk density for each experimental plot, at the same time the soil penetration resistance was measured. The results indicated higher levels of penetration resistance, bulk density and lower values of soil moisture in the upper layers of the plots that received mowing management. The values of mechanical resistance, shown by the “LE” in all depths, were higher than the critical limit for the development of roots, which may limit the development of the rubber-tree roots on every depth.",

If the behavior of these attributes presents spatial dependence, then it is recommended to use geostatistics to describe this spatial structure and to estimate values in non sampled places. In order to have good estimates, unbiased, precise and robust estimators are necessary. Many studies use the classic estimator of Matheron, however, the use of a robust estimator is recommended to data with long tail or asymmetrical distribution. The objectives of this study were to use Cressie and Hawkins’ estimator to generate experimental semi-variograms of Phosphorus, Potassium and soybean yield in an experimental agricultural area, to produce their contour maps and to correlate them through crossed semi-variogram. This experiment resulted in maps that illustrate the spatial variability of the variables and their correlations, used as a management tool or documentation in a modern agricultural practice.",

Cuttings were taken from a virus-free stock plant, leaving one leaf in the upper part and one node in the base. Cuttings were prepared with a cut below the node in the basal portion and a cut in the internode in the upper portion, leaving each one with 20cm of length and 0.5cm of diameter. After that, the cuttings were placed in plastic boxes containing different types of growth medium, in a mist chamber. A randomized design was used as statistical model, with six treatments and five replications. Each plot was composed by ten cuttings. After four weeks, proper rooting was observed, and the following parameters were evaluated through image analysis using SIARCS&reg; software: root area; total root length; root diameter classification. The dry weight of roots was also evaluated. It was possible to conclude that: a) there was a strong positive correlation between the parameters area and root length obtained from image analysis with the dry weight of roots; b) hull rice coal provided the highest area and length of roots for both rootstocks; c) the root area of ‘Campinas’ rootstock was higher than ‘Jales’, independently of the growth medium used; d) the total root length of ‘Campinas’ rootstock was higher than ‘Jales’ only when hull rice coal medium was used",

To compare simulated data with experimental results, a cornfield experiment was carried out with the following treatments: five irrigation water depths and two coefficients of uniformity of water application. Based on simulations and on experimental conditions, it was concluded that the penalization imposed by the model influenced severely the corn crop yield, for treatments with soil water deficit.

It was possible to conclude that the starch from waste water was totality retained into the soil columns, percolating only hydrolyzed sugar and water. Results also showed that the concentration of cyanide and the DBO and DQO rates from percolated waste water were over the maximum rate permitted by Environmental Law to be used in the soil; 87.07% of all present solids in the waste water of manioc starch are organic matter and that justifies its high DBO (and/or DQO).",

The timing of harvest was R9, R9 + 15, and R9 + 30 days. No significant differences among treatments for incidence of fungi, total of fungi and seeds germination percentage were observed for first time of sowing, when the harvest of the seeds was carried out at the stage R9. There was a significant increase in percentage of fungi incidence and reduction in seeds germination with delay of harvest, in all treatments in both times of sowing",

This work aimed at investigating the influence of sewage sludge, with or without addition of lime, in the balance of the soil and in the maize dry matter production. The experiment was carried out in pots under greenhouse conditions, utilizing two samples of soils, collected at a 0-15 cm deep layer: the first sample (S1), with clay texture, was collected from eutrophyc Red Latosol in direct seeding, and the second sample (S2), with sand texture was collected from dystrophic Red Latosol. The following treatments were used in soil S1: T1A – control; T2A – 9 t ha-1 sewage sludge; T3A – 18 t ha-1 limed sewage sludge (9 t ha-1 sewage sludge + 9 t ha-1 unslaked lime); T4A – 9 t ha-1 unslaked lime; and for soil S2: T1B – control; T2B – 9 t ha-1 sewage sludge; T3B – 18 t ha-1 limed sewage sludge (9 t ha-1 sewage sludge + 9 t ha-1 unslaked lime); T4B – 9 t ha-1 unslaked lime; T5B – recommended liming. The maize dry matter shoot, cultivated at sandy dystrophic Red Latosol, increased with sewage sludge without lime. The application of limed sewage sludge increased the amounts of Mg and P (S1 e S2) and Na (S2). The increased pH contents may constitute a limiting factor for its application.",

The chemical analyses were: pH (H2O), total C and N, available P and K, and exchangeable Na+, Ca+2, Mg+2. The treatments with the best results showed significant effects following the maturation phase. The exceptions were C and N, which presented only individual effects. In general, the organic matter proportions (5:0:0), (3:2:0), and (2:3:0) resulted in a significant increase in the availability of nutrients. Biofertilizers with optimal organic matter proportions may be used to produce organic substrates that are more effective and have the potential to be applied as alternatives to soluble NPK fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is one of the most important cereal crops in the world. In Brazil, the acreage of grain sorghum during off-season is quite expansive. Most of this area is the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome that is similar to a Savannah and is characterized by high acidity and soluble aluminum at toxic levels for plants. The aluminum acts as a limiting factor in achieving high yields. The purpose of this work was to phenotype sorghum hybrids for aluminum tolerance. Eighteen hybrids were evaluated in a nutrient solution containing {0} or {27} µM Al3+. The work was carried out in a growth chamber at the Embrapa Maize and Sorghum, from April 4 to May 30, 2014. The lines ATF 13B (susceptible) and ATF 14B (tolerant) were used as check cultivars. Based on the Net Root Growth after 120 hours (NRG120), Net Root Growth (NRG168) after 168 hours and Relative Net Root Growth after 168 hours (RNRG168), it was possible to distinguish tolerant hybrids from susceptible ones. The high aluminum saturation reduced root growth by 70%. The hybrids BRS 310 and BRS 373 were tolerant to aluminum stress under nutrient solution. The hybrid BRS 330 was clustered in an intermediate group, with an approximately 50% root growth reduction. The other hybrids were susceptible with significant root reduction.",

The enzymatic systems evaluated were: superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and α-amylase, and the expression of heat-resistant proteins. The enzymatic activity was quantified through the software ImageJ®. Millet seeds lost desiccation tolerance when the radicle reaches 1 mm of length.

The objective of this work was to investigate the resistance mechanism of glyphosate-resistant C. sumatrensis biotypes by determining the expression levels of the constitutive gene epsps and two ABC transport protein-coding genes designated m7 and m11 with RT-qPCR. Two biotypes of C. sumatrensis were evaluated: one resistant and one susceptible to glyphosate. The treatments consisted of the absence or application of two doses of glyphosate (1,080 and 8,640 g a.e. ha-1). Plant leaves were collected at 1 and 4 days after herbicide application. No difference was observed in epsps gene expression between the studied biotypes. The expression of the m7 and m11 genes revealed that both genes had higher relative expression in the resistant biotype with the application of glyphosate at both doses. The overexpression of the m7 and m11 genes in the resistant biotype treated with glyphosate reveals that these genes play a role in herbicide resistance. These genes may be involved in the sequestration of glyphosate into the vacuole lumen in the resistant C. sumatrensis biotype studied.",

Two wheat cultivars were used (BRS Parrudo and TBIO Sinuelo). Herbicide applications were observed to decrease the length and projected area of the shoots by 52 and 46%, respectively, as well as reduce the length, surface area and root volume when compared to the control treatment without application. The hydrogen peroxide concentration, as well as the enzymatic activity of guaiacol peroxidase, was observed to rise only in the treatments where the herbicides were applied. Physiologically, an increased hydrogen peroxide output was revealed, while the guaiacol peroxidase enzymatic activity increased in both cultivars, but with no effect noted in the superoxide dismutase enzymatic activity. The shoot and root morphology were negatively influenced, showing a rise in the enzymatic activity and hydrogen peroxide concentration in the seedlings from the desiccated plants.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to verify the potential of chelate-based products containing calcium, copper, manganese, and zinc for the management of Pantoea ananatis, Puccinia polysora, Cercospora zeae-maydis, Exserohilum turcicum, Diplodia macrospora, and Pseudomonas avenae in crop maize growth in the summer season, as well as their influence on agronomic characteristics. The treatments included commercial chelate-based products of amino acids with the elements calcium (15%), copper (5%), manganese (15%), and zinc (10%) at doses of 0.5 kg ha-1, 0.3 L ha-1, 0.4 kg ha-1, and 1 L ha-1, respectively; fungicides (20% azoxystrobin and 8% cyproconazole at a dose of 0.3 L ha-1 + 25% propiconazole at a dose of 0.4 L ha-1); and water. The tests were carried out under field conditions for two consecutive years with two simple hybrids. The plant height, stem diameter, number of rows per ear, number of grains per ear row, productivity and mass of one thousand grains, as well as the severity of leaf diseases, were all evaluated, and chemical analysis of the leaves was performed. In the 2016/2017 growth season, for the number of rows per ear and number of grains per row, the fungicide treatment showed the highest values, whereas for the mass of one thousand grains and productivity, the chelate treatments did not differ from the fungicide treatment and were different from the water treatment. In the 2017/2018 growth season, for the mass of one thousand grains and yield, only the fungicide treatment was different from the water treatment. For all the chelates studied for both hybrids, there was no difference in nutrient content before and after foliar application. It can be concluded that calcium, copper, manganese, and zinc products may influence agronomic traits but not the severity of the diseases evaluated in these two hybrids of maize under the edaphoclimatic conditions in which the study was carried out.",

As informações sobre os teores de acilaçúcares, bem como dos números de adultos mortos e ninfas vivas de mosca branca dos genótipos em teste, foram obtidas de outros estudos. Foram realizados contrastes entre as médias dos genótipos F2, para a densidade de tricomas, número de adultos mortos e de ninfas vivas de mosca branca. Não houve influência do tricoma tipo IV na resistência do tomateiro à mosca branca. A presença de adultos mortos do inseto nas plantas com este tipo de tricoma, bem como a ausência ou pequena quantidade de ninfas vivas, são explicadas pela ação dos acilaçúcares carreados por esse tipo de tricoma",

The experiment consisted of 42 full-sib families divided into three trials with 16 families and 3 witnesses in common in randomized blocks, with four blocks and 12 plants per block. The characteristics evaluated in the experiment were number of bunches per plant (NBP), bunch weight per plant (BWP) and bunch average weight per plant (BAW). The estimation of variance components showed that there was greater genetic variance within families than between families. The heritability for all traits was high, above 0.75, and the coefficient of environmental variation was low to moderate for all traits (between 4 and 13). Tocher’s method separated families into seven groups, whereas the UPGMA method identified six groups. To use the best families in diallel crosses, families 15, 14, 22, 21, 28, 37, 33 and 39 were selected based on individual performance as determined by the Scott-Knott test and genetic diversity by grouping.",

Nine accessions of wild Manihot species, M. esculenta ssp. flabellifolia, M. esculenta ssp. peruviana, and M. carthaginensis ssp. glaziovii, and two clones of M. esculenta (Cigana Preta and Sacaí) were evaluated under laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% RH, and a 12-h photophase. Daily observations during the mite life cycle stages (larva-adult) were recorded. The data were subjected to an analysis of variance, a Scott-Knott test (5%), and Singh criterion, cluster, and principal component analyses. The larval-adult period ranged from 5.53 to 7.01 days: the longest period was observed on an M. glaziovii accession (GLA-19-DF) and the shortest on an M. flabellifolia accession (FLA-025V). The UPGMA method allowed the division of the genotypes into six groups, with the greatest distance between the FLA-025V and GLA-19-DF accessions. The first two main components explained 77.50% of the total accumulated variation. The association of the longest cycle duration of M. tanajoa with the lowest larval-adult viability suggests that GLA-19-DF is less favorable to mite development compared to the other accessions. Significant variability among the genotypes was observed.",

The logistic model adequate fit to rust severity progress data (R2 &gt; 0.90) in the two years. Principal component analysis (PCA) using all data, irrespective of the year, identified area under the disease progress curve, initial inoculum and disease progress rate as the best variables to differentiate reactions to rust. When PCA analysis was conducted separately for each year, different disease-related variables were selected as a principal component, and cultivars were classified in three groups of susceptibility. There was inconsistency in the grouping of some cultivars, which was likely due to varying environmental conditions between the years. However, ‘Coral’ was consistently grouped in the low susceptibility group and ‘Chimarrita’ and ‘Granada’ in the high susceptibility group.",

Intercropping is an option for planting in better areas, but there is a lack of research on crop shade tolerance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of period and intensity of artificial shading on mass partitioning and root yield on Peruvian carrot ‘Amarela de Carandaí’. The treatments were four shading intensities (18, 30 and 50% of shading with Sombrite® cover and full sun), imposed either from 30 to 120, or from 30 to 210, or from 120 to 210 days after planting (DAP), totaling 10 treatments at harvest (210 DAP), with four repetitions. Light restriction above 18% from 30–210 DAP and from 120–210 DAP reduced marketable root yield. The marketable root yield was less reduced when shading was imposed earlier (30–120 DAP) than later (120-210 DAP) on the growth cycle. Regarding light competition, Peruvian carrot should be intercropped with crops that promoted up to 50% of shading from 30-120 DAP, or up to 18% of shading from 120 to 210 or 30-120 DAP.",

Four characteristics were evaluated: C1, determined by two genes with 50 and 30% effects on expression of the characteristic; C2, governed by three genes with 50, 20 and 10% effects; C3, regulated by two genes, each with 40% effect; and C4, controlled by two genes, each with 50% effect. The IM was efficient at detecting OTL in all evaluated characteristics; however, for characteristics determined by two genes with effects between 40 and 50%, the OTMM was more efficient at detecting and localizing OTL in simulated marks. In contrast, the IM method was more efficient at detecting and localizing OTL in simulated marks when the gene effect ranged from 10 to 30%. As a result, because oligogenic characteristics are governed by genes with greater effects, the OTMM was considered the most efficient method to be used for this type of characteristic.",

A survey of 200 scientific studies was conducted to examine how much basic information was provided on the application method. The amount of descriptive detail concerning the insecticide application method was found to be below the minimum requirements. In particular, there was insufficient detail concerning the spray droplet spectrum (no information in 173 studies evaluated – 86.5%), operating pressure (38 studies – 19%), solution concentration (52 studies – 26%), distance and position of spray nozzles in relation to the target (114 studies – 57%), temperature (128 studies - 64%), relative humidity (134 studies - 67%) and wind speed (145 studies – 72.5%). All the studies evaluated contained information on the application rate used (L ha-1). To change this situation and reestablish the importance of the application method, we propose a simplified method description for the application of phytosanitary chemicals. Use of the proposed minimum methodological description is practicable for insecticide treatments and will also enable them to be accurately repeated.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was compare two soil survey methods. The first was performed by methods traditionally used to distinguish landscape units and soil class discrimination. The second was based on soil class distinction through orbital spectral response. In order to establish soil characteristics and their classification, soil samples were collected at two depths in a grid system, with a distance of 500 meters between points. With these samples, physical and chemical analyses were carried out. In the sampling points, the apparent reflectance of the soil, from the orbital image, was determined and, through cluster analysis landscape units were established. In order to evaluate the resemblance reliability between the landscape units established in each method, the Kappa index was used, the value set for the confusion matrix was 0.43, indicating high quality in the comparison, showing that the non-conventional method was as close as the one carried out by photointerpretation.",

Two experiments were conducted: one in a greenhouse and another in field conditions. In the greenhouse, the study used a completely randomized design, in a 6 x 2 factorial scheme, with four replications. The first factor was six fertilization levels of 04:14:08, and the second two soil types (low and high fertility). The experiment in field conditions used randomized blocks with 6 treatments (0, 75, 150, 300, 450 and 600 kg ha-1 of 04-20-10 fertilizer 04:20:10) and 4 replications. The fertilization with 04:14:08 in low fertility soil promoted greater height of the plants from the beginning until the end of the cycle, whereas in ground of high fertility responses were evident only in the first 43 days of growth. The fertilization resulted in an increase in sesame grain yield when cultivated in low fertility soil, reaching maximum values in the dose of 550 kg ha-1 of 04:14:08 fertilizer. In field conditions, there was no response from fertilization with respect to the dry matter and yield of sesame grains cultivated in second crop conditions.",

The physiological and sanitary quality of the seeds was evaluated by standard germination test (first count and final count), accelerated aging test, modified cold test and blotter test. The potassium fertilization increased both germination and vigor of the canola seeds. The total of fungi was lower on seeds produced by the application of K amounts ranging from 50 to 60kg ha-1 of K2O.

This study also aimed to determine an appropriate time as a biofix to predict the occurrence of generations of G. molesta using a degree-day model. Adults of the oriental fruit moth and insect predators were sampled by plastic bottle traps with peach juice and yellow sticky traps, respectively. The influence of abiotic and biotic factors was evaluated by simple correlation analysis. The highest population peaks of G. molesta were observed in May, July and October. The correlations suggest that low environmental humidity might have been a factor of mortality to G. molesta. A negative impact on natural enemies caused by high number of insecticide applications may have been responsible for the high pest density from 1998 to 1999. The date that peach trees developed vegetative and flower buds appeared to be suitable to initiate the degree-day accumulation to predict generations of G. molesta. These results should help the implementation of programs based on predicting population peaks of adults aiming insecticide application.

The treatments were a combination of forward speeds (5.56; 8.10 e 10.21 km h-1) and covering conditions of the soil (spontaneous vegetation, oat black desiccated and oat black desiccated and rolled). The results showed that medium and maxim draw bar pull, as well as power requirement, were influenced by the type of soil covering and forward speed. The covering type did not influence fuel consumption, although the forward speed did. The wheel drive slip was not influenced by any of the studied factors.",

The bunching onion propagation was through cuttings and the chicory's through seeds. Harvest was done at 90 days after planting/sowing, when the plants were cut very near the soil. The average height of bunching onion plants was 28.4cm and 32.1cm for chicory, the bunching onion average number of shoots 0.49 millions ha-1 and the average yield of bunching onion fresh and dried phyto-masses 2.46 t ha-1 and 0.22 t ha-1, respectively; chicory's (10.21 t ha-1 and 0.96 t ha-1, respectively) were not influenced significantly by the number of plant rows by plot. The inter-cropping system induced an increase of 9.8cm in bunching onion height when compared to mono-cropping system. The greatest number of chicory leaves was with three rows in mono-cropping system and with four rows in inter-cropping system. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), considering fresh phyto-mass yields of those species cultivated under respective number of rows were 1.93 for bunching onion under three rows and chicory under four rows (C3Al4) and of 1.59 for bunching onion under four rows and chicory under three rows (C4Al3). Under the conditions in which the work was carried out, the greatest gross income to the producer was with C3Al4 inter-cropping system, because it resulted in monetary increases of R$ 13,919.70 and of R$ 7.068,15 when compared to bunching onion (3 rows) and to chicory (4 rows), respectively, under mono-cropping systems",

This work was proposed to evaluate the effects of different soil management systems in peach palm inter rows on chemical and physical properties of a dystrophic Red Latosol. Treatments evaluated included weed control with herbicides (HB); soil covered with sugarcane bagasse (SB); alternate green manures with velvet bean and oats cropping as inter-row crops (VA); inter-row manual weed control (MC); inter-row slashing mechanical weed control (slashing) (MWC) and inter-rows cropping of pigeonpea (PG). The following physical properties of the soil were evaluated: bulk density, porosity, soil water content and soil resistance to root penetration and the chemical properties of the soil: pH, Al+3, Ca+2, Mg+2, P, K+, sum of bases, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and organic carbon. The soil samples were collected in the layers of 0-0.05 m, 0.05-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.40 m. Higher soil water contents were found at SB. For soil resistance to root penetration smaller values were detected in treatments, which accounted for higher soil water content (SB). Soil bulk density, soil porosity, carbon contents, sum of bases and CEC did not differ among treatments. Values of pH, Al+3, Ca+2, Mg+2, K+ and V% were influenced by treatments, with a positive increment in those treatments with specific weed control (HB and MWC), while for P, the treatments HB, MC and MWC stood out positively.",

The experiment was developed under field conditions in a dystrophic red latosol of average texture. The sewage sludge was obtained at Sanepar, a state company of water treatment. The experiment used randomized blocks constituted by six treatments with sewage sludge (doses: 0, 6, 20, 40, 60 and 80 t ha-1) with four repetitions and five sampling periods (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after the sewage sludge incorporation). The biosolid was applied in soil by throwing and incorporated by revolving mechanically the arable layer (0-20cm). The soil received dolomite limestone in the beginning of the experiment. Soil samples were collected in the incorporation periods in order to evaluate metal elements available in the soil in different sewage sludge doses. Each sample was dried in the air and sieved in a 2mm size frame. They were homogenized and the concentrations of the elements were determined by the atomic absorption spectrometric method in the DTPA extractor solution. The application of sewage sludge showed an increase of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and CTC and at the same time showed a pH reduction. The concentrations of Cd, Ni, Co, Pb and Cr were not detected, because the method detection limit was not reached. The results showed that the Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn availabilities in the soil gradually increased as increased sewage sludge doses applied and were superior to the control treatment",

Different techniques are employed to detect pathogens in bean plants; however, only a few slow and inefficient methodologies can be used to detect Cff. Hence, there is a need for rapid and efficient techniques to detect Cff for disease management. The objective of our study was to develop a technique to effectively detect Cff in the leaves of infected bean plants by optimizing a previously developed method. We modified the extraction method by reducing the amount of water used, replacing seeds with leaf tissues (obtained from the veins and petioles) and using CffFOR2 and CffREV4 primers specific for Cff. Our optimized method exploits a concentration gradient generated in the plant tissue through osmosis to disrupt the plant cell wall and efficiently isolate bacterial cells. DNA extracted from the isolated bacterial cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. This method allowed efficient detection of Cff in leaf tissues.",

However, the potential of the cultivar to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia to fix N2 has not yet been assessed. Here, field experiments were conducted to assess the efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in the cultivar, and to compare this to the efficiencies of other genetic materials widely grown throughout Brazil (BRSMG Madrepérola and Pérola). Experiments were conducted on two Oxisols in Minas Gerais State, Brazil (one during the dry season in the south, and the other during the winter season in the Alto-Paranaíba region), under a no-tillage system over maize stover. A randomized block experimental design was implemented in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement with four replicates. Individual and combined Analysis of Variance were performed and the data were normalized. Homogeneity of the residual mean squares was observed. Significant effects of factors were identified by Scott-Knott tests and F tests. The BRSMG Uai cultivar responded to inoculation with the rhizobial strain CIAT 899, with yields similar to those achieved upon fertilization with 80 kg ha-1 of N-urea and to the yields of the BRSMG Madrepérola and Pérola cultivars inoculated with the same rhizobial strain. In terms of commercial use, this cultivar may be successful under either of the management practices adopted for N supply, and from the perspective of plant breeding, it has potential for inclusion in breeding programs directed toward improving BNF.",

The process was carried out in darkness at room-controlled temperature. Germination began in the second day after the imbibing practice, while sprouts development came on until the sixth day, with 86% germination percentage. Eight days after sowing, weights were put on sprouts to create a physiological stress as well as to increase ethylene synthesis and improve the quality of produced sprouts. They were also submitted to microbiological tests, whose values were superior to 1.1 x 104 NMP g-1 for fecal coliforms, with acidity of 2.64% and a pH of 5.48, with low acidity. There was no growth of Salmonella or Escherichia coli, once the levels were lower than 10 UFC g-1. The physiochemical analyses, in 100 grams of sprouts, presented 54.34 g of carbohydrates; 6.24 g of crude fiber and 25.56 g of protein. Non-trained taster persons were submitted to sensory tests in order to compare, according to palatability, which was more acceptable – sprouts of alfalfa or beans. The acceptability of lentils was 73.3%, with only 13.3% of rejection and 13.3% of indifference; these results were inferior to beans, which had 96.7% of acceptability and 3.3% of rejection, as well as alfalfa, which had 83.3% of acceptability and 10.00% of rejection. According to the low rejection and indifference, it is possible to suggest that the studied variety of lentil can be used in the production of sprouts, as a nutritional nourishing complement.",

Two brassica cultivars, cabbage Da Georgia and broccoli Ramoso Piracicaba Precoce, were used and were treated with the following sinigrin solutions: 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 mg mL-1 in solution 5% of Tween 20® and a control with Tween solution. Duration and viability of larval and pupal periods, pupal weight, longevity and sex ratio, female fertility, incubation period and egg viability were evaluated. The corrected reproductive potential index (PRC) was also calculated. The means were analyzed by the multivariate analysis of grouping and of main components. The PRC treatments presented 0.2 mg mL-1 in cabbage with larger reproductive potential. The multivariate analysis provided discrimination of treatments regarding the smaller tested concentration. By the results it is possible to conclude that low concentrations of sinigrin, in cabbage and broccoli, allow better development for P. xylostella.",

The process was carried out in darkness at room-controlled temperature. Germination began in the second day after the imbibing practice, while sprouts development came on until the sixth day, with 86% germination percentage. Eight days after sowing, weights were put on sprouts to create a physiological stress as well as to increase ethylene synthesis and improve the quality of produced sprouts. They were also submitted to microbiological tests, whose values were superior to 1.1 x 104 NMP g-1 for fecal coliforms, with acidity of 2.64% and a pH of 5.48, with low acidity. There was no growth of Salmonella or Escherichia coli, once the levels were lower than 10 UFC g-1. The physiochemical analyses, in 100 grams of sprouts, presented 54.34 g of carbohydrates; 6.24 g of crude fiber and 25.56 g of protein. Non-trained taster persons were submitted to sensory tests in order to compare, according to palatability, which was more acceptable - sprouts of alfalfa or beans. The acceptability of lentils was 73.3%, with only 13.3% of rejection and 13.3% of indifference; these results were inferior to beans, which had 96.7% of acceptability and 3.3% of rejection, as well as alfalfa, which had 83.3% of acceptability and 10.00% of rejection. According to the low rejection and indifference, it is possible to suggest that the studied variety of lentil can be used in the production of sprouts, as a nutritional nourishing complement.",

Thus, we studied the effect of tissue maturation on successive collections of mini-cuttings grown in a semi-hydroponic system. Likewise, we evaluated potential multiplication via the mini-cutting technique by assessing the survival and productivity of mini-stumps as well as the formation of adventitious roots and the root vigor. We made 32 sprout collections during two years in a clonal mini-garden. From these collections, mini-cutting experiments were installed throughout several seasons. Mini-cuttings of 8±1 cm long were prepared, planted in boxes with vermiculite and carbonized rice husk (1:1 v/v) and placed in a greenhouse. After 70 days, we evaluated the adventitious rooting percentage as well as the adventitious root and aerial vigor of the mini-cuttings. The appropriate survival of mini-stumps (68%) and the annual production of mini-cuttings per square meter (2,227) reflected the efficiency of the semi-hydroponic system for this species. The increasing rooting, multiplication rate and root vigor indicate no maturity in the course of the collection of mini-cuttings in P. angustifolia mini-stumps.",

The experiments were conducted in a Federer augmented block design with additional checks in two generations (F3 and F4). Resistance to thrips was evaluated by its natural infestation and the symptoms of attacks by the insect. They were also evaluated using agronomic trait indicators of interspecific segregating with cultivated species. The results indicated that the selected progeny exhibited high resistance to thrips compared to commercial genotypes, and they had the amphidiploid as the insect resistance source. Some progenies selected as resistant also had good production traits, but with the degree of suitability to the A. hypogaea L. genotypes still low, the use of a backcross as an alternative for the introgression of resistance genes and the consequent recovery of adapted genotypes of superior recurring parents is suggested.",

Microsatellites were not efficient in determining the genetic diversity between C. walkeriana groups (native and improved). The difficulty in determining the genetic distance between the different genotypes can be attributed to the complex mating system of the species and to a weak genetic barrier that facilitates the development of hybrids.

    "abstract": "The present work has aimed to assess the consideration of the appropriate variation sources of the statistical model and their impacts on the conclusions plant breeding. The Value for Cultivation and Use test was conducted to assess three common locations (Lages, Ponte Serrada, and Canoinhas) and four non-common locations (Chapecó, Guatambu, Urussanga, and Campos Novos). The grain yields of six bean genotypes were evaluated in order to represent the imbalance between the common and non-common locations. The statistical analysis considered two situations: i) union of the location factors and cultivation years, with a single variation source called environment and ii) decomposition of the mean square values of the two factors, location and year. According to the simplified analysis (environmental variation source), the F test for the genotype factor was highly significant (p = 0.0006). On the other hand, the hypothesis test for the genotype factor was not significant (p = 0.7370) when the decomposition of mean squares was used. The simplified analysis presents some erroneous points, such as the use of a mean residue to test the hypothesis of the genotype factor, since this factor is composed of several sources of variation, and there is no exact F test. However, approximate F tests can be obtained by constructing linear combinations of average squares. This fact notes the relevance of considering the appropriate sources of variation within the statistical model, with a direct impact on the conclusions and recommendations of cultivars with superior performance.",

This condition was first reported in Brazil at the end of 2009. The disease is currently present in most of the countries that produce this crop. The aim of this research was to develop risk maps of P. kuehnii infection using temperature and relative humidity data, provided by 389 automatic weather stations throughout the country. A spatial distribution analysis was carried out to assess the number of daily hours of favorable conditions for spore germination in each region. In the central-south region, where the main sugarcane producing states are concentrated, two distinct periods were observed during the three years studied. Higher favorability occurred from October to April, and lower favorability occurred from May to September. The opposite relation was observed on the coast of the north-eastern region, where conditions were more favorable to the disease from May to September. The validation data were confirmed by the results of Pearson’s correlation between sugarcane orange rust infection under field conditions and the proposed maps. In conclusion, risk maps obtained using data from automatic weather stations could contribute to the monitoring of the risk of infection by sugarcane orange rust.",

MG-5 Vitória plants cultivated under water deficit. Plants were evaluated taking into account leaf gas exchanges and crop yield parameters. The study was carried out under greenhouse conditions, and the water deficit was imposed by irrigation withholding until the first sign of leaf wilting in 50-days-old plants. A control treatment was maintained, with plants under daily irrigation and the same P concentrations. Phosphorus supplying caused positive effects on plant growth parameters, mainly in leaf area and new shoot formation. Water deficit reduced stomatal conduction and net CO2 assimilation in all treatments. However, a significant improvement was observed in gas exchange recovering after re-hydration in the plants with additional P supplying, which could support faster growth improvements after a dry season.",

The stomatal response is not only affected by these modified environmental conditions, but also by others such as canopy temperature. Thus, an irrigated bean crop tend to present modifications in stomatal conductance (Gva) and transpiration in relation to a non irrigated common bean crop. Gva and transpiration were measured with steady-state null-balance porometers. Results showed that transpiration rate correlated better with canopy temperature in conditions of sunny leaves than of shaded leaves. The relation between Gva and air temperature, and between DPV and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) reinforce the interaction of the environmental variables with stomatal response. Gva values presented negative exponential correlation with air temperature and DPV, for values between 20 and 35°C, and 0.5 to 3 KPa, respectively, and an exponential increase when correlated with PAR, even when valuer were above 2000 µmol m-2 s-1.",

Six genotypes representing two groups (group I - susceptible: group II - resistant) were crossed in a partial diallel mating design. The genotypes were evaluated for disease expression using a rating scale from 0 (resistant) to 4 (susceptible). Estimates of GCA were negative and significant for the accessions PI 420145 and PI 482398, which can be suggested for crosses aimed at obtaining melon lines resistant to GSB. There is a reciprocal effect for the resistance of melon genotypes to Didymella bryoniae, especially when PI 482398, PI 420145, and PI 140471 are crossed with JAB-20. Such results indicate that maternal effects may be involved in the resistance to gummy stem blight.",

Our objective was to evaluate the immediate and latent effects of the dehumidified air on the vigour of the seeds. Our vigour analysis method was based on the Rules for Seed Analysis (RAS), and our results showed an immediate significant difference in seedling percentage, but the germination level did not have an effect at 5% (Dunnett's test). In latent effects, at 5% (Tukey test), there was a reduction in the germination percentage and emergence rate, but it was not possible link such variations to the drying process. The germination potential was classified as \"highest vigour\", and it was possible to conclude that dehydrating drying air with UTA constituted a method capable of maintaining seed quality and germinative vigour.",

The splitting of the poultry litter rate during the rainy season preserves the soil K content, prevents the accumulation of soil P and increases the efficiency of the increasing yields of the organic whole-plant corn silage crop. The reapplication of pre-sowing poultry litter can lead to an accumulation of P and Ca in the soil but favors fresh matter and cob dry matter yields in the dry season. The splitting of the poultry litter rate for whole-plant corn silage can guarantee technical and environmental sustainability in rainy years, but on the other hand, the reapplication of this organic fertilizer only at pre-sowing can increase the fresh matter yield and protein quality of organic whole-plant corn silage cultivated in an Inceptisol in the dry season.",

Two parental field corn populations, four backcrossed SS populations, four SS intervarietal hybrids (SS-IH), eighteen SS single hybrids (SS-SCH) and two controls were evaluated in two environments over two crop years. The SS-IH and SS-SCH categories presented the highest ear yield, and SS-SCH presented the highest ear yield without husk (11.3 t ha-1). Although SS-SCH was the most productive category, it presented the lowest husk coverage quality. The ear yield and husk cover traits expressed the highest heterosis based on the midparents. The hybrid genotype categories (SS-SCH, SS-IH and controls) had the greatest ear length and diameter, as well as plant and ear height. It was possible to conclude that the techniques used to exploit heterosis are efficient in increasing SS yield but not husk coverage, since this trait requires productive parents. Single-crosses, such as LCSH-116 x LP8HS-129 and LCSH-116 x LP8HS-130, stood out as promising genotypes for registration since they recorded high husk coverage yield and quality.",

The objective of this study was to create a classification of welding quality to estimate the percentage of scion survival. The patch and flute grafting techniques were used in a greenhouse and in the field. Survival was evaluated 270 days after grafting (DAG). At 60 DAG, observations of the graft connection region were made with the naked eye, classifying the connections into four welding classes. After 160 DAG, transverse cuts were performed on each class and visually and anatomically evaluated. Flute grafting presented higher initial survival (79%), but at 180 DAG, the survival rate of both techniques was similar (48% for flute and 41% for patch). There was greater scion survival for the class that had only two regions in contact with discontinuity in the bark. Stabilization of survival occurred after 180 DAG, regardless of the welding class. Visually, there were differences in welding quality; however, anatomically, all classes presented vascular connections. The visual welding quality assessment underestimated the percentage of scion survival. However, the vascular connection and development of parenchymatous tissue are promising for diagnosing grafting success.",

    "abstract": "The search for alternative energy sources has fomented the study of several crops. The macauba palm crop, for instance, has been highlighted because of its particular relevance in Brazil due to its wide distribution across Brazilian territory and its potential for yielding high amounts of oil per cultivated hectare. However, the species is still most commonly harvested via extractivism, which results in low yields. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the dynamic behavior of the fruit-rachilla system when subjected to mechanical vibration to gather baseline information for the subsequent development of macauba harvesting machines. The fruit-rachilla system of the species was modeled for different fruit maturation stages and plant accessions. Natural frequencies and modes of vibration were determined by the stochastic finite element method (FEM), adopting the specific mass and the modulus of elasticity of the system as random variables, which enabled us to compile a dataset of natural frequencies based on the variability of the system properties. The mean values of the natural frequencies obtained in the vibration assays were 26.02 Hz at the green maturation stage and 21.22 Hz at the ripe maturation stage. The mean values of natural frequencies found in the simulation by stochastic FEM, referring to the third mode of vibration, were 26.05 Hz at the green maturation stage and 21.23 Hz at the ripe maturation stage. We concluded that the natural frequencies of the macauba fruit-rachilla system on the basis of different plant accessions showed a decreasing behavior during fruit maturation. The modes of vibration characterized by pendulum displacement did not differ among plant accessions or between fruit maturation stages.",

This study developed methodologies to estimate soybean leaf area using neural networks and considering different leaf shapes. A field experiment was carried out from February to July 2017. Data were collected from thirty-six cultivars separated into three groups according to the leaf shape. Multilayer perceptrons were developed using 300 leaves per group, of which 70% were used for training and 30% for validation. The most important morphological measures were also tested with Garson’s method. The artificial neural networks were efficient in estimating the soybean leaf area, with coefficients of determination close to 0.90. The left leaflet width and right leaflet length are sufficient to estimate the leaf area. Network 4, trained with leaves from all groups, was the most general and suitable for the prediction of soybean leaf area.",

In this context, the objective of this work is to assess whether there is bio-agroeconomic return in associations of beet-cowpea by the optimization of population densities and spatial arrangements of the component crops. Experiments were performed in randomised complete block designs with treatments arranged in a 4 × 3 factorial scheme, with four replications. The first factor was the population densities of cowpea (100, 80, 60, and 40% of the recommended population in single crop - RPSC) in association with beet, and the second factor was the spatial arrangements (2:2, 3:3, and 4:4), formed by beet (B) rows alternating with cowpea (C) rows. The competition and agronomic indices evaluated were aggressiveness, competitive ratio, land equivalent ratio, actual yield loss, intercropping advantage and the productive efficiency index. The economic indicators evaluated were gross income, net income, rate of return and profit margin. High agro-economic efficiency can be obtained in the cultivation of beet and cowpea intercropping when well-managing the factors of production, population densities and spatial arrangement of the component crops. The greatest agro-economic return of the cowpea and beet intercropping was obtained in the population densities of 40 and 100% of RPSC for cowpea and beet, respectively. The 2:2 spatial arrangement between beet and cowpea crops was the one with the best productive performance and higher indicators of economic return. The cowpea was the dominant crop while the beet was dominated.",

    "abstract": "Cohesive Oxisols are widely used for cultivating eucalyptus in the Coastal Tablelands of the northeastern region of Brazil. However, mechanization and plant cultivation in these soils are difficult because of their cohesive layers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify better combinations between tillage systems and types of fertilization to improve the physical attributes of cohesive soil, with the aim of improving eucalyptus growth. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 4 × 2 factorial scheme (soil preparation × fertilization). The tillage systems tested were: i) conventional tillage (CT) - one plowing combined with two harrowings, ii) minimum tillage (MT) - subsoiling down until 0.57 m depths in the planting line, iii) no-tillage type 1 (NT1) - planting in 0.3 m-deep pits, and iv) no-tillage type 2 (NT2) - planting in 0.6 m-deep pits. The types of fertilization tested were mineral (MF) and organic fertilization (OF). The diameter of the soil aggregates was reduced after being subjected to any combination of cohesive soils. Furthermore, OF provided the best levels of plant-available water, attenuating the adverse conditions of the cohesive layer. MT, NT1, and NT2 improved the soil physical attributes when compared to CT. Therefore, the combination of either NT1 or NT2 with OF, followed by the combination of either NT1 or NT2 with MF, was determined to be the best way to cultivate eucalyptus on cohesive soils.",

Studies related to gene expression and enzyme activity in coffee seeds under drying are important for understanding the effects of drying on their physiological quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular aspects of seeds under different drying methods and associate them with physiological quality. Coffee seeds with different water contents were dried both slowly and rapidly. Enzymatic activity was analysed, as well as the expression of genes that encode the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxiredoxins, isocitrate lyase, and endo-ß-mannanase. There was a significant effect of drying speed and final water content on enzyme activity and on the expression of the different genes analysed. In seeds under rapid drying, there was greater expression of the genes that encode the enzymes catalase and endo-ß-mannanase. Greater expression of the 1 CYS PRX and SOD genes and greater activity of the ICL isoenzymes were found in seeds with superior physiological quality, but greater activity of the endo-β-mannanase and CAT enzymes occurred in seeds with lower physiological quality.",

Genetic dissimilarity is fundamental in the identification of individuals in terms of traits of interest, although it is rarely considered in relation to seeds that are tolerant to thermoinhibition. The aim of this study was to ascertain the relationship between defoliation of lettuce plants and seed yield/physiological quality, as well as the genetic dissimilarity among genotypes with regard to seed thermoinhibition. We used 35 lines of biofortified lettuce, the cultivars Uberlândia 10000, Belíssima, UFU MC BIOFORT1, and Everglades (tolerant to thermoinhibition), and Grand Rapids and Verônica (susceptible to thermoinhibition). The seed yield and physiological quality of the genotypes with and without defoliation were evaluated, artificially aged, and germinated at four temperatures in a factorial arrangement. The genetic dissimilarity was estimated by Tocher graphing and the UPGMA clustering method, based on the Mahalanobis generalized distance (D 2 ii). Four UFU genotypes and Grand Rapids had high seed yields. With removal of basal leaves, there was higher seed yield per plant and there was an effect on their physiological quality. The genotypes exhibited genetic variability for thermoinhibition, with UFU-86#2#1#1 and Everglades showing similar performance.",

However, finger drop, is a physiological disorder that causes many postharvest problems, which eventually reduces market value and consumer acceptance. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the anatomical changes that occur in the pedicel rupture area (drop zone) of bananas diploids (BB França) and tetraploid (BRS Pioneira) in three ripening stages. The levels of gene expression involved in the natural ripening process and in the development of finger drop, was also investigated. The accumulation of their mRNAs and those of expansin (EXP1), pectate lyase (PEL1) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein (XTH4) genes already isolated from bananas were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in three ripening stages. BB França presented a higher resistance to finger drop due to the presence of some specific morphoanatomical characteristics, such as larger parenchymal cells and greater deposition of lignin. In contrast, there was degeneration of the pedicel parenchymal tissue of the BRS Pioneira genotype, forming large empty spaces during the ripening of the fruits, mainly in stage 6, which contributed to the finger drop. The diploid BB França is a strong candidate for use in banana breeding programs aimed at fruit drop resistance. This will certainly improve the quality of banana varieties. Moreover, PEL1 proved to be an excellent candidate gene for functional studies of finger drop in bananas.",

In the present study, we analyzed the proteome of the axillary buds of ‘RB966928’ to investigate possible changes in the number of proteins at different cutting stages. Using tryptic digestion followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 122 proteins were identified from the proteome of the axillary buds of ‘RB966928’. Of the 122, respectively 97 and 95 proteins were detected at the first and fifth cutting stages, of which 27 and 25 proteins were unique to the respective stage. Proteins that prevent the misfolding of polypeptides generated under stress were exclusively detected at the first cutting stage. Meanwhile, proteins associated with stress responses and disease resistance were exclusively detected at the fifth cutting stage. The present proteomic analysis in the regrowth cycles and axillary bud development of ‘RB966928’ significantly advanced our understanding of the biological processes linked to the reduction of agricultural productivity of sugarcane with the advancement of cutting age. Absence of proteins to tolerate adverse growth conditions at the fifth cutting stage may be related to reduced agricultural productivity, in addition to environmental stress, soil compaction, nutrient availability, cultural practices, and pests or pathogen attacks at different phenological stages of crops.",

Since the cultivation of poorly drained soils is traditionally avoided, this study aimed to evaluate the possibility of expanding canola cultivation into waterlogged soils using soil surface drainage and different row spacings in lowland areas of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Treatments consisted of the presence and absence of surface drains at 0.25 m depth and row spacings of 0.17, 0.34, 0.51, and 0.68 m arranged in two-factorial randomized blocks with four replications, in 2018 and 2019. In this study, growth traits, yield components, and the final grain yield of canola were evaluated. The increase in lateral branching in canola plants was found to be directly related to waterlogging and negatively affected yield. The use of drains positively impacted the number of pods per plant, seeds per pod, the 1,000 seeds weight, and grain yield. The more intense waterlogging conditions in 2018 resulted in the highest grain yield and superior production traits were obtained with row spacings between 0.41 and 0.48 m. In the absence of waterlogging, the 0.17 m row spacing was more productive. Canola cultivation can occur in waterlogged soils in the presence of surface drainage and at row spacings ranging from 0.40 to 0.50 m.",

Water infiltration into the soil was determined in the field with the concentric-ring infiltrometer method. Bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and microporosity were determined in the soil samples. The permanent CTS application altered the physical properties of the soil and led to a decrease in bulk density. The total porosity, microporosity and macroporosity values in the CTS-applied soil ranged from 44.1–51.7, 34.6–39.4, and 9.1–12.8%, respectively. Water-infiltration rates were significantly influenced by CTS. The cumulative infiltrated water in the soil varied from 21.3–34.7 cm. The basic infiltration rate was lower in the unamended soil and increased with an increase in the rate of CTS application. This study confirmed that the physical soil parameters improved after the permanent CTS application.

For genotyping, 2000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were used, and from all possible gametes to be formed (22000), 5000 were randomly sampled to form each of the 100 individuals of the population of recombinant inbred strains. To obtain the phenotypic information, five characteristics with different levels of complexity were simulated. The comparative study was carried out using data referring to simulated genotypic values of hybrids and parents. Then, aiming to choose the parents destined for hybridization, different traditional selection strategies based on phenotypic analysis and the genome-wide selection methodology were approached. The genomic information resulted in the choice of the best lines and in obtaining superior hybrids when compared with traditional methodologies. The inclusion of the genomic genetic values of the parents in determining the crosses to be carried out increases the probability of generating phenotypically superior hybrids. Thus, the traditional methods of choosing parents for hybridization purposes are effective, but when incorporating the information from genome-wide selection, the choice of parents provides superior and promising results.",

    "abstract": "Black spot (Asperisporium caricae) is one of the main foliar fungal diseases of papaya crops. This disease acts directly on leaves and fruits causing leaf area reduction and fruit deterioration. The quantification of diseases is a fundamental part of the disease management and control process; therefore, a scale is required to help quantify black spot disease. The objective of this work was to propose a standardized methodology to quantify black spot severity in papaya leaves. A scale was developed considering the maximum and minimum values of the disease in the field that included eight levels of severity: 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.3, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0%. Without the aid of a scale the disease is often overestimated, with absolute errors of approximately 75%. When the scale was used, 100% of the evaluators showed improved accuracy and precision, and absolute error was reduced to the 10% range. The scale also provided good repeatability and high reproducibility. The use of the scale provided an improvement in the R2 values, with mean values of 93 and 92 in the second and third evaluations, respectively, demonstrating that the scale is useful for different aspects of the pathosystem of A. caricae, such as for determining the efficiency of fungicides, characterization of varietal resistance, construction of the disease progression curve, and estimation of damage.",

However, these water sources generally have high salinity, which prevents agricultural production. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pre-germination treatments with plant growth regulators and bioactivators on melon seeds to attenuate salt stress caused by irrigation water during germination and seedling development. Two trials were carried out separately with the hybrids, Goldex and Grand Prix. The design was completely randomized in a 4 × 3 factorial scheme (four seed treatments and three dilutions of irrigation water). Seeds were treated with salicylic acid and gibberellic acid and the insecticide, thiamethoxam, in addition to the control. Local supply water, artesian well groundwater, and dilution of these waters at a 1:1 ratio were employed for irrigation. Fourteen days after sowing, morphological and physiological analyses were performed, and the material was collected for biochemical determination. The use of saline well water affected the initial development of melon seedlings of the Goldex and Grand Prix hybrids. Pre-germination treatment of Goldex hybrid seeds with gibberellic acid was inefficient at mitigating salt stress. However, the effects of irrigation water salinity on Grand Prix melon seeds pretreated with salicylic acid and thiamethoxam were attenuated.",

Twenty-three (Experiment I) and thirty-five (Experiment II) genotypes were evaluated in a randomized block design with four replicates and three plants per plot. Twenty fruits per plant were harvested and evaluated for the following quality traits: diameter, mass, skin color (lightness, chroma and hue), firmness, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), SS/TA ratio, and ascorbic acid content. The genetic parameters and the coefficient of repeatability were estimated for each experiment using classical and Bayesian methods. Both approaches achieved similar results on estimating variance components, genetic parameters and the coefficient of repeatability. Genetic parameters showed favorable conditions for acerola selection. The coefficient of repeatability was high for all acerola quality traits.

The objective of this study was to propose and evaluate the performance of a model extracted from artificial neural network training and of new models to estimate the total height of eucalyptus trees. The data used in this study originated from temporary forest inventories conducted in eucalyptus stands in Minas Gerais, Brazil. A multilayer perceptron artificial neural network was trained, and a nonlinear equation was extracted from the best-performing network to predict the total heights of trees. New linear and nonlinear hypsometric models were constructed and fit considering variables related to individual trees (DBH) and stands (plot basal area, age and site index). The new hypsometric models proposed in this study showed satisfactory performance and are effective for estimating the total heights of eucalyptus trees, particularly the model extracted from the artificial neural network and the nonlinear model",

    "abstract": "Tomato is a demanding crop in terms of handling, mainly because irrigation has a strong influence on fruit production and quality. Salinity changes the absorption, transport, assimilation, and distribution of nutrients in the plant. In general, such effects are analyzed using statistical tests. However, fuzzy models allow simulations between points that are not verified in agricultural experimentation. Currently, systems with artificial intelligence have excelled in the field of applied sciences, particularly fuzzy systems applied to mathematical modeling. The objective of this research was to use fuzzy modeling to analyze the biometric variables during the development of hybrid tomatoes under two different conditions: the first concerning different water tensions in the soil and the second concerning different salinity doses in irrigation. To this end, two models were developed based on an experiment carried out at São Paulo State University (UNESP), School of Agriculture, Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. Both models sought to estimate the values of biometric variables of the tomato crop. Thus, two models were developed: Model 1 regarded water tensions and days after sowing (DAS), while Model 2 featured salinity and DAS. Fuzzy models provided results that verified the effects of irrigation and salinity layers. Two Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBS), an input processor with two variables, a set of linguistic rules defined from statistical procedures with percentiles, the Mamdani fuzzy inference method, and the center of gravity method to defuzzification were elaborated for this purpose. The range between −25 and −10 kPa (for Model 1) and between 0.08 and 3 dS m−1 (for Model 2) provided the development within the ideal parameters for the complete development of the plant cycle. The use of fuzzy logic has shown effectiveness in evaluating the development of tomato crops, thus showing potential for use in agricultural sciences. Moreover, the created fuzzy models showed the same characteristics of the experiment, allowing their use as an automatic technique to estimate ideal parameters for the complete development of the plant cycle. The development of applications (software) that provide the results generated by the artificial intelligence models of the present study is the aim of future research.",

Data on rainfall amount and erosivity indices (EI30, EI20, and EI10) were subjected to regression analyses, evaluating the effects of climatic variables on soil and water losses. We could also analyze crop species, conventional and no-tillage systems, and winter and summer seasons. The highest soil and water losses occurred in treatments under conventional tillage. In addition, soybeans treatments increased soil and water losses. Maize under no-tillage was the most efficient practice, as it had soil losses (3.4 times) and water losses (1.5 times) lower than soybeans under conventional tillage. Rainfall amounts and EI30 were better correlated with soil and water losses in conventional tillage treatments. However, EI10 could better explain the soil losses from the conservationist treatment.",

Hydrosensitive paper was used to analyze the droplet spectrum, and the Brilliant Blue tracer was used to detect spray deposition. The DJI Agras T20 remotely piloted aircraft was used to apply the phytosanitary product. Speed, flight height, and application range were maintained at 5.56 m s-1, 2 m, and 5 m, respectively. The flight direction was perpendicular to the crop planting lines. The application rate and hydraulic tip jointly controlled the accumulation of droplets on the target according to its position in the plant canopy. Therefore, remotely piloted aircraft can be used in coffee phytosanitary management, particularly to control targets that predominately occur in the upper third of the plant canopy.",

At the end of the experiment, the dry matter production, N concentration, and N accumulation of plants, as well as nutritional efficiency indices were evaluated. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and regression. The results showed that in plants previously well-supplied with N, N stress induces greater allocation of dry matter in roots, mitigating the effects of subsequent water deficits on shoot dry matter production. Young Mundo Novo plants subjected to N stress followed by increasing water stress maintained a high utilization efficiency (UE). Young Acauã plants well-supplied with N, maintained their N utilization efficiency up to -1.6 MPa of water stress; however, when they were N starved, they underwent a drastic reduction in UE at potentials below -0.22 MPa.",

Previous studies reported improvements in forage production and nutritive value in hybrids and ecotypes; however, information about seed yield and quality in forage bahiagrass is limited. This study aimed to characterize the seed yield and quality of nine P. notatum intraspecific hybrids and three controls: P. notatum ecotypes V4 and Bagual and cultivar Pensacola. Inflorescence density, 1,000-seed weight, seed yield and germination rate decreased in year 2 influenced by weather conditions and ergot. Seed yield ranged from 139 (Pensacola) to 1,158 (Bagual) kg ha-1 among all entries, where Bagual, C18, and V4 produced more than 974 kg ha-1, which was approximately seven times more than Pensacola. Bagual, C18, V4, 336, C15, 225, and D3 showed germination rates greater than 83%. In conclusion, Bagual had the highest seed yield and germination rate, whereas hybrids C18 and 336 showed high seed yield, 1,000-seed weight, and germination rate in both years. Bagual, C18, and 336 should be used in future breeding programs to improve seed production traits. Our study revealed that selection for seed production traits can result in improvements in seed yield and quality in bahiagrass.",

Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between the geographic distribution of species populations and the characteristics of seeds using new techniques such as seed image analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. seeds from spatially dispersed populations using digital images and analyzed their implications for genetic studies. Seed size and shape descriptors were obtained using image analysis of the five populations. Several analyses were performed including descriptive statistics, principal components, Euclidean distance, Mantel correlation test, and supervised machine learning. This image analysis technique proved to be efficient in detecting biometric differences in L. leucocephala seeds from spatially dispersed populations. This method revealed that spatially dispersed L. leucocephala populations had different biometric seed patterns that can be used in studies of population genetic divergence. We observed that it is possible to identify the origin of the seeds from the biometric characters with 80.4% accuracy (Kappa statistic 0.755) when we applied the decision tree algorithm. Digital imaging analysis associated with machine learning is promising for discriminating forest tree populations, supporting management activities, and studying population genetic divergence. This technique contributes to the understanding of genotype-environment interactions and consequently identifies the ability of an invasive species to spread in a new area, making it possible to track and monitor the flow of seeds between populations and other sites.",

Expenses with water for irrigation are shown, in certain situations, equivalent to the current expenses with electric energy to proceed irrigation.",

The major soil classes found in the low land area were Histosol and Entisol which are more adapted for flood irrigation, due to poor drainage soil capacity. While, Ultisol, Inceptisol, and Oxisol are found in high land area, and they are more appropriate for sprinkler and localized irrigation.

Existing quantification methods do not always reflect actual toxicity of the seeds analyzed, which may present lower ricin content even though they are more toxic than seeds presenting a higher content of ricin. This is because these methods actually measure the addition of ricin RCA, which is a compound less toxic than pure ricin. We decided to use in this study, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has been widely used by the pharmaceutical industry. We tested two strains of C. elegans using different methods in 8 experiments. We examined 4 methods of extracting the ricin complex and 3 methods of exposing the nematodes. Among the nematode strains and ricin extraction methods tested, we concluded that the best strain for testing ricin toxicity was the strain called N2 and that the best method for ricin extraction was a rotating bath followed by centrifugation and exposing the nematodes in 24 well plates with a solution of nematodes extracted from the media with destilated waterexposing the nematodes in 24-well plates This method is inexpensive, quick and adequate for the selection of offspring with lower RIP content.",

The harvests were conducted 238 (2007-08), 231 (2008-09) and 237 (2009-10) days after planting. The data were submitted to an analysis of variance each year. The plants produced from large seedlings and RM-corms had a higher fresh leaf weight. Additionally, the dry weight of the RFC-commercial cormels and RFNC-non-commercial cormels was higher with extra seedlings. The plants grown during 2008-2009 had a higher fresh weight of RM and of RFNC than the plants grown during 2009-10. The interaction between the seedling types and crop seasons significantly influence the yield and dry weight of the leaves of RM and RFC, the leaf length of RM and RFC and the leaf diameter of RFC.

Singly cultivated corn was considered the control treatment. Intercropping did not cause corn plant development to show any significant difference compared with that of the singly cultivated corn plants. When sown in furrows, the number and dry matter contents of the kudzu plants were higher than sowing by broadcasting. The number of plants and the dry matter of the plants increased with the number of seeds. Prior to sowing soybean, the incidence of weeds decreased as the number of kudzu seeds at sowing increased.

When they were not subjected to delayed storage, the white pulp peaches presented pulp browning after 14 days of cold storage plus two days out of the cold room. From the results observed in the analysis of soluble solids, titratable acidity and decay development, these peaches showed an increased level of ripening. In both cultivars, delayed storage for 48 hours resulted in increased ripening and decay. Delayed storage for 24 hours was effective in controlling pulp browning and in maintaining the quality of the white pulp peach cultivars.",

The climatic variable data used in the modified simulation of the soybean crop models were temperature, insolation and rainfall. The data set was taken from 33 counties (28 Sao Paulo state counties, and 5 counties from other states that neighbor São Paulo). Among the models, modifications in the estimation of the leaf area of the soybean crop, which includes corrections for the temperature, shading, senescence, CO2, and biomass partition were proposed; also, the methods of input for the model's simulation of the climatic variables were reconsidered. The depleted yields were estimated through a water balance, from which the depletion coefficient was estimated. It can be concluded that the adaptation soybean growth crop model might be used to predict the results of the depleted and potential yield of soybeans, and it can also be used to indicate better locations and periods of tillage.",

    "abstract": "The effect of caffeine on mycelia growth of fungi isolated from coffee was evaluated. The fungi were cultivated in decaffeinated coffee agar media added with caffeine at 0 to 1,0 %, and fungistatic effect was expressed by the size of colony diameter. The caffeine degradation by fungal activity in liquid medium was evaluated by HPLC. The antibiosis was proportional to dose, and the inhibition of growth was of 52,8 to 100% of Aspergillus flavus, 9,4 to 72,5% of Fusarium semitectum, 8,8 to 66,8% of Penicillium sp., 5,3 to 54,1% of Fusarium sp., 4,6 to 39% of A. niger and 4,7 to 37% of A. ochraceus. The inhibitory activity declined, probably due to its degradation by the fungal activity. Therefore, the fungistatic effect of caffeine may contribute for coffee quality and sanity",

A PVC Box with 1,0m diameter and 0,7m deep was filled by a sand soil, usually founded on a Northeast Region of Parana State. To identify the wetted front position, some TDR probe were placed horizontally each 0,05m deep, from soil surface to 0,60m. Some TDR probes were installed vertically from soil surface, each 0,08m from punctual source of water. Water was applied by 1,0; 1,8 and 3,4 litters per hour outflow emitter, and TDR readings were done at a 10 minutes interval, after beginning of water application. Results show that good evaluations of wetted front position can be obtained by this methodology use. For the studded conditions, the results showed that drip irrigation time, using this emitter, must be lower than 120 minutes, for the Pupunha palm tree, cultivated at this Parana State Region",

The results showed that crop residue cover incorporation did not show any significant relation to the angle but there was an increase with the travel speed. The random roughness was only related to the angle, not to the travel speed, by increasing the angle there was an increase in the random roughness. An increase in travel speed and angle resulted in a reduction in the medium geometric diameter. The plow shows a satisfactory performance when compared with the literature",

It shows quick senescence, characterized by yellowing, loss of turgecency, development of off-odors, increase in enzymatic activity and loss of nutritional value. Among the techniques that can extend its shelf life, we have cooling and modified atmosphere packaging. There are some factors that interfere in the efficiency of MAP, influencing the speed and the intensity in the atmosphere modification. This work aimed to evaluate the influence of broccoli packed weight (bi-oriented polypropylene film) on its color, odor and enzymatic activity during its post harvest period when stored at 1ºC. Afterwards, a strong influence was verified when packing was used, for in all packaged treatments lower enzymatic activity was observed. It was also observed that, among package treatments, those with more filling weight showed the worst performance about odor, chlorophyll rage and enzymatic activity",

    "abstract": "Simulation models are tools that generate sceneries, considering the several combinations of factors that influence on crop productivity. Cropgrowith models provide with questions involving research, crop handling and planning. This is helpful to understand the genetic, physiologic and environmental interactions. It is also useful at decisions involving cultural practices before and during the field stage of crop, as fertilizer application and irrigation. This study was developed for Palotina region, Paraná state, (24º17' S of latitude, 53º50'30'' of longitude and 333 m of altitude). To simulate growth and development of soybean crop (Glycine max (L) Merrill), Cropgro-soybean simulation model was utilized. Genetic coefficients calibration was done to CD 202, CD 204, CD 206 and CD 210 soybean cultivars, cultivated in Palotina region, Paraná state. After calibration, a simulation of soybean productivity for sowing in November 1st was carried out. The aim was to test the calibrated coefficients in the 25 harvests between 1974 and 1999. According to the analysis, the model presented high sensibility to genetic coefficient variation of the studied cultivars. Rainfall distribution is one of the factors that mostly influenced the Leaf Area Index and productivity. This means that the model strongly penalizes in water deficit conditions. Maximum productivity potential of the four cultivars, for Palotina region, was approximately 3573 kg ha-1.",

In the first experiment the seedlings germination and growth were analyzed and in the second experiment, the back effect of treatments was applied to the seedlings in the beet production when the seedlings from the same combinations of treatment were transplanted on the field. Experimental designs in completely randomized blocks were used respectively in factorial plots of 4 X 2, with three replications. The treatments resulted from the combination of four nutritive supply methods – M1) by fertirrigation; M2) full time floating hydropony; M3) daily floating hydropony from ten to fifteen hours; and M4) full time floating hydropony alternated by fertirrigation; and two substrates: S1) Plantmax®-HT and S2) crushed sugar cane. Results show that in the nursery phase, the fertirrigation (M1) was more effective in the emergency of the seedlings, M2 was more effective in the growth of the seedlings, while in the field phase, M1 and M2 were more productive. The crushed seedlings contributed to the greatest final plant population of the culture and it did not differ from the industrialized substrate production.",

For water evaporative demand of approximately 3mm d-1, the treatments with corn and wheat crops residues, which represented mulching layer of 50 and 100% of dry matter, the water evaporation rate reached only the first evaporation stage. For treatment with 50% of dry matter with residues produced by bean crop, the evaporation stage moved beyond the first evaporation stage. Finally, for mulching with 100% of bean crop dry matter, the rate of soil water evaporation was influenced by the evaporative demand tested.

The data were submitted to analysis of grouping by the UPGMA Clustering Method, starting from the Mahalanobis distance.

The aim of this study was to verify the variability level in two Eucalyptus grandis nucleus populations. Thus, 39 individuals were evaluated – 19 in population 1, and 20 in population 2. Fourteen microsatellite primers were measured, identified and analyzed using GeneScan and Genotyper software through an ABI Prism 3100 automatic sequencer. The number of alleles in each primer varied between 5 and 15 in population 1, and from 8 to 18 in population 2. Heterozygosity was higher in population 2 – 0.869, versus 0.843 in population 1. Mean genetic distance among individuals was 0.6220 in population 1 and 0.6112 in population 2. After individual molecular characterization, a database was compiled to allow the control of these improvement programs in different selection cycles based on population genetic parameters.",

Eucalyptus seedlings grown in a greenhouse were used to obtain a hypothetical water demand. Meteorological data were used to estimate the demand (evapotranspiration) and offer (rainfall over the greenhouse coverage). The probability distribution of Wakeby presented the best fit for the rainfall data; therefore, a Wakeby distribution was used to model the flow-duration curve of the greenhouse coverage. For a payback period (T) of 10 years of surplus water demand and water supply deficit, a reservoir with 13.60 m³ was obtained. The proposed methodology combined the simultaneous occurrence of the events to enable the scaling out of a reservoir with high safety to supply the required demand (T = 100 years) and therefore enables a lower cost of deployment compared to each approach separately (T = 10 years).",

Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of N and K fertilizing on fruit production, leaf chlorophyll and N and K nutritional status of apple cv. ‘Julieta’ grown in Brazilian tropical semiarid. The experimental design used was randomized blocks with treatments disposed in a factorial arrangement (4 x 4) referring to nitrogen doses (30, 60, 90, and 120 g of N plant-1) and potassium doses (30, 60, 90, and 120 g of K2O plant-1), with three replications and three plants in each parcel. ‘Julieta’ apple trees propagated by grafting (with ‘M9 filter and Maruba rootstock) and transplanted in 2013 were used in this study. The following variables were evaluated: i) fruit production (kg plant-1); ii) number of fruits (in a plant); iii) leaf chlorophyll index (‘a’, ‘b’, and total); and iv) leaf N and K concentrations (g kg-1). N and K doses effects depend on the consecutive production cycles of apple cv. ‘Julieta’ grown in tropical semiarid. An adequate N supply is very important for the subsequent production cycle. K fertilization until 120 g plant-1 of K2O is not enough to supply K demand of apple cv. ‘Julieta’ grown in tropical semiarid. In tropical semiarid, 60-90 g plant-1 of N through fertirrigation is enough for ‘Julieta’ apple production.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of fertigation, banana biomass as a soil covering under drip and micro-sprinkler irrigation system on the root growth and distribution and their relations with chemical soil attributes, soil water availability, and productivity. This work was conducted in a field with banana 2.5 × 2.0 m spacing and irrigated every two days using a drip and micro-sprinkler irrigation system during the first crop cycle. The experiment followed a random block design with six treatments, two irrigation systems, two fertilization methods of fertigation and side-dressing, as well as two cultivation types with and without soil covering. Roots were collected from each plot using soil monoliths and digitalization allowed the determination of root length density, and diameter at several distances from the plant and at different soil depths. Total root length, density, and distribution by diameter were evaluated based on the treatment interactions with respect to the distance from the plant and the soil depth. Our results showed that the combination of the irrigation system, fertilizer application and soil covering influenced root growth and distribution. In addition, we found that the better soil conditions for root growth were in drip or micro-sprinkler systems with fertigation and cultivated biomass covering.",

The following variables were evaluated: weight loss; color; pulp firmness; soluble solids (SS); titratable acidity (TA); SS/TA ratio; rottenness and sensorial characteristics. The weight loss was smaller in fruits treated with wax. ‘Esmeralda’ peaches showed small firmness in the treatments with 75% and 100% of wax. Fruits treated with wax with 50%, 75% and 100% showed small percentage of rottenness. The sensorial evaluation showed that acidity and astringency in fruits treated with wax decreased. The utilization of 50% wax, associated with cold storage, reduced weight loss and rottenness, maintaining the pulp firmness. Thus, it is possible to store peaches cv.

The vineyard was established in July, 2000, using the ‘IAC 766 Campinas’ as the rootstock. For each variety, 20 uniform grapevines were used, cultivated in pergola system in a 4.0 x 1.5 m spacing. The maturation of the grapes was evaluated considering the evolution of the following contents of the must overtime: pH, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and the TSS/TA ratio, from around 50 days after flowering up to 7 days after harvest. Considering the total cluster per tree, cluster mass and number of trees per hectare, the production per tree and productivity of each variety were estimated. The diameter and the mass of berries were also characterized. It was verified that ‘Tannat’ showed appropriate characteristics for grape processing.

The genotypic correlation between the number of bunches per plant and the yield was negative, indicating that when genotypes with a higher yield are selected the number of bunches decreases. In general, the signal of the genotypic correlation differed was opposite to the one from the environmental correlation, evidencing that genetic and environmental factors influence the number of bunches and yield through different physiological mechanisms.

N contents increased until the rate of 62 kg ha-1 N, and experienced reduction after that level. The N rates provided linear effects in Ca, Mg and Mn contents, being negative for Ca and positive for the others. P contents had little reduction with increases in millet and millet+jack-bean straws. K contents increased until rates near 50 kg ha-1, with reduction after that level under all the straws with millet presence. Under millet and dwarf-guandu straws, the reduction occurred starting at small N rates. S contents increased quadratically, only under straws where millet was present.

Constatou-se apenas um gene responsável pela ocorrência de listras na semente e outro pela cor bege clara ou escura de fundo da semente tipo carioca. Para os caracteres presença ou ausência de halo e tipo de semente igual ou diferente da cultivar Rosinha, foram identificados dois genes em cada caso. Excetuando-se a presença de listra, certamente estão também envolvidos genes modificadores no controle dos demais caracteres. Considerando todos os caracteres, esperam-se 11,26% das plantas F2 produzindo sementes do tipo carioca ideal e 12,82% das plantas com sementes do tipo rosinha",

    "abstract": "O resfriamento de produtos agrícolas secos em altas temperaturas, apesar de técnica e economicamente vantajoso, tem sido relegado a segundo plano porque não se tem conduzido experimentos a respeito. A razão desses não terem sido conduzidos foi devido à ausência de modelo de simulação capaz de viabilizar sua utilização em fluxos contracorrentes, uma vez que a simulação matemática permite a obtenção de resultados em curto período de tempo e com poucos investimentos financeiros. O modelo de simulação de secagem em fluxos contracorrentes da MSU, o modelo mais completo atualmente disponível, tem solução de natureza logarítmica positiva, o que dificulta sua obtenção. Nova demonstração daquele modelo resultou em outro com solução de natureza logarítmica negativa, o que lhe garante convergência para o resultado. Após otimização desse novo modelo em cada sistema de secagem onde for utilizado, torna-se possível dimensionar não apenas resfriamento em fluxos contracorrentes de produtos secados em altas temperaturas, mas também viabiliza o dimensionamento de sistemas de secagem e de pré-aquecimento nesse tipo de fluxo",

    "abstract": "Genetic engineering has amplified the possibilities of crop breeding and supported sustainability ideals. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the preferred transformation system, since it produces transgenic plants with more stable transgene expression and inheritance. The agrobacteria and plant tissue must be co-cultivated in conditions that allow gene transfer. This study aimed to evaluate how co-cultivation time and temperature affect the transformation of immature maize embryos of the Hi-II hybrid (model genotype) and the Brazilian BR 451 variety with A. tumefaciens EHA101:pTF102. The pTF102 plasmid carries a uidA reporter gene that enables transient transformation to be quickly verified by GUS histochemical assays. Increasing the co-cultivation period from three to five days at 20°C resulted in a higher number of GUS positive embryos and blue spots per embryo in the BR 451 Brazilian variety, indicating better bacterial T-DNA transfer into the target explant cells. This condition raised the BR 451 response level to match the response level of the Hi-II control genotype, indicating that this Brazilian variety is suitable for genetic transformation.",

The seeds were collected during three consecutive years and from different areas of the Cariri region. The seed collection areas comprised two sites in the municipality of Boa Vista and one in the municipality of São João do Cariri. The diaspores had their water content determined and were submitted to the following tests: germination, seedling emergence, first count of germination and seedling emergence (within 5 days), and speed of germination and seedling emergence. The treatment means were compared using the deviance statistic. The collection years and collection areas were compared by the Tukey test at a 5% probability level. The comparison between mother trees was made through principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The detected variation in the quality of M. urundeuva diaspores is dependent on environmental conditions. The physiological quality of M. urundeuva diaspores varies according to mother tree, collection area and year. Mother trees of groups 1 and 2 are the most promising since they included representatives of all three areas and produced diaspores of high physiological quality.",

Estimates and validation of statistical parameters were conducted using the “gamlss” package in the R software. Generalized linear mixed effects followed the binomial, the beta-binomial and the multinomial distribution with the logit link to explain data based on the following explanatory variables: seed germinator, plastic tray position on every tier of shelves, illuminance conditions (light and darkness) and seed lots. We did not find differences in proportional responses from seed germinators, but we did find differences in the illuminance conditions, plastic tray position on the tiers of shelves in the seed germinators and seed lots. The estimates of the generalized Akaike information criterion (GAIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), global deviance (GD) and Bayesian information criterion of Schwarz (BIC) indicate similar goodness-of-fit for the binomial and beta-binomial models. All of the models indicate that the position of the germination tray on every tier of shelves and illuminance conditions affected the proportions of normal seedlings. The seed germination in the plastic tray on the uppermost position under fluorescent day light lamps had an effect on the proportion of normal seedlings of Stevia.",

We evaluated two experiments for validation of cultivars with 12 treatments set up in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and plots composed of 50 plants. Each plant was considered as a basic unit. Estimates of ideal plot size were made by maximum curvature of the coefficient of variation, linear-plateau segmented model and by the resampling methods. We discussed the variations in the parameter estimates for different plot sizes. Divergence was seen among the plot sizes estimated by the different methodologies. Increasing the number of plants per plot led to a higher experimental precision to the point that the increase was no longer significant.

The parents and 89 F2 plants were genotyped with 51,128 SNP markers, of which 910 polymorphic markers were used to construct the map. The results revealed 11 linkage groups, with an average of 82 markers per chromosome and average distance of 1.26 cM between markers. Recombination analysis of the SNPs indicated that markers 2_12850 and 2_00188, located in linkage group 11, flanked the cpi gene at a distance of 6.7 cM and 5.64 cM, respectively. The introgression of linkage group 11 with the cowpea reference map revealed short distances (from zero to 0.6 cM) for these markers, indicating a strong association with the cpi gene. The constructed map and cpi mapping provide basic information that can assist the genetic breeding of more efficient cowpea plants for BNF by marker-assisted selection.",

Data were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial design with three replications, in which the first factor comprised the two methods of pre-treatment on soil aggregates: without pre-wetting (WOPW), which considered the moisture of the aggregates in the field, and with pre-wetting (WPW), which considered the slow wetting of aggregates through capillarity on wet filter paper for 24h. The second factor consisted of four soil classes: Typic Dystrustept (Cambissolo Aplico distrófico in Embrapa), Typic Hapludult (Argissolo Amarelo distrófico), Rhodic Kandiudult (Nitossolo Vermelho distrófico), and Anionic Acrudox (Latossolo Vermelho distróferrico) and considered horizons A and B. The pre-wetting significantly increased the values of the weighted average diameter, geometric mean diameter and aggregate stability index. In soils with high organic carbon content, the practice of pre-moistening did not provide variation in aggregation.",

To address this issue, this study investigated the efficacy of silicon, either alone or in combination with Trichoderma harzianum and organic matter, in mitigating salt stress in forage sorghum. The experiment took place in a saline Fluvisol in Parnamirim, a semiarid region of Pernambuco, Brazil, and followed a randomized block design with five treatments and four replicates: sorghum (control); sorghum + Si; sorghum + Si + OM (organic matter); sorghum + Si + T (T. harzianum); and sorghum + Si + T + OM. Sorghum plants were assessed over three cycles (initial cut and two regrowths) from June 2021 to April 2022. The combined treatments of Si + OM, Si + T, and Si + T + OM increased plant growth by 42.17, 35.49, and 27.51%, respectively, compared to the control. Similarly, these treatments led to biomass accumulation gains of 39.42, 40.44, and 31.77% in sorghum plants relative to the control. Silicon alone did not yield significant growth or biomass accumulation improvements. The application of silicon in conjunction with T. harzianum and/or organic matter shows promise in enhancing forage sorghum growth under saline stress conditions in semiarid regions.",

This study aimed to determine root growth, depth, and distribution of sunflower plants under different water stress conditions, such as deficit or excess, in two soil classes and sown during two distinct periods. Experiments were conducted after sowing at the beginning of September (first crop season) and at the beginning of January (second crop season) in an Ultisol (Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil) and an Oxisol (Panambi, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil). Water condition treatments applied from stage V6 included control, water deficit, and water excess. Roots were collected using an auger drill during the first crop season. The variables analyzed comprised root length density and accumulated root within the soil profile. During the second crop season, sunflower roots were visually assessed in the soil profile after trench excavation. Root system depth and root dry mass were evaluated during both sowing periods. Results indicated that sunflower root penetration is deeper in Ultisol than in Oxisol. Water deficit promotes root depth, while water excess promotes root growth near the surface. Sowing during the first crop season results in deeper root penetration and higher root dry mass production compared to the second crop season.",

    "abstract": "Monosporascus cannonballus Pollack &amp; Uecker and Macrophomina phaseolina Tassi (Goid) are phytopathogenic fungi responsible for causing \"root rot and vine decline\" in melon (Cucumis melo L.). Currently, cultural management practices are predominantly employed to control these pathogens, as the use of pesticides not only has detrimental environmental impacts but has also proven ineffective against them. These fungi have already undergone molecular characterization, and their genomes are now available, enabling the targeted search for protein targets. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel target proteins that can serve as a foundation for the development of fungicides for effectively managing these pathogens. The genomes of M. cannonballus (assembly ASM415492v1) and M. phaseolina (assembly ASM2087553v1) were subjected to comprehensive analysis, filtration, and comparison. The proteomes of both fungi were clustered based on functional criteria, including putative and hypothetical functions, cell localization, and function-structure relationships. The selection process for homologs in the fungal genomes included a structural search. In the case of M. cannonballus, a total of 17,518 proteins were re-annotated, and among them, 13 candidate targets were identified. As for M. phaseolina, 30,226 initial proteins were analyzed, leading to the identification of 10 potential target proteins. This study thus provides new insights into the molecular functions of these potential targets, with the further validation of inhibitors through experimental methods holding promise for expanding our knowledge in this area.",

Synthetic fungicides are used to treat downy mildew with handheld backpack and tractor sprayer applications, with high chemical exposure by operators. As important tools for maximising yield, application technologies must be studied to optimise control efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of fungicide spray application using Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) for the control of downy mildew in grapevine, with different spray volumes. The study was divided into two experiments using 4 vine lines, 10 blocks and 5 treatments with different mixture volumes: Experiment 1 with RPA application of 5 mixture volumes - 0, 22, 44, 66, and 88 L ha−1; Experiment 2 with RPA application of 3 mixture volumes - 44, 66, and 88 L ha−1 and a backpack application of one mixture volume - 800 L ha−1. Coverage percentage, droplet density and volume median diameter (VMD) were evaluated. Downy mildew severity on grapevine leaves was assessed using visual analysis and a diagrammatic scale. The application of 44 L ha−1 provided the greatest coverage and droplet density in the upper and middle strata; however, the backpack application had a better droplet distribution than the RPA application. Treatments of 44 L ha−1 with RPA and backpack application (800 L ha−1) provided the best disease control. In the trellis system, RPA application must be improved because of the low coverage in the lower parts of the plant, and further studies with different spray nozzles and application heights are needed.",

This approach helps map areas with potential for the occurrence of endemic, threatened, or potentially invasive species. Panonychus ulmi (Tetranychidae) is of global economic importance, commonly associated with apple orchards and grapevines. Potential distribution modeling is used to predict areas with environmental suitability for the distribution of a species and/or group. Considering that predictive models on national or regional scales present better data reliability, the present study aimed to analyze the distribution of P. ulmi in Brazil through bioclimatic inferences. The presence of species, bioclimatic variables, and MaxEnt algorithm were used to define a predictive model. The median performance rate of the model was 0.992, indicating its robustness. The variable that made the greatest contribution to the model was the average temperature of the coldest quarter (Bio11). The predictive model of the ecological niche indicated that the southern region of Brazil is environmentally favorable for the adaptation of this mite. The data obtained helped us understand the geographical distribution of P. ulmi in Brazil, and climatically suitable areas for its occurrence were inferred. We believe that this tool can offer indirect assistance to the agricultural sector, especially the producers of apples and grapes in Brazil regarding the presence of P. ulmi.",

This work aimed to evaluate the soil CO2 efflux in coffee plantations cultivated in agroforestry and full-sun systems during the winter in high-altitude tropical climate regions. The work was carried out at three family farms (RO, GI, and PA) in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Two treatments were established: coffee with and without trees, and 20 sampling spots for soil and gases. The air and soil temperatures in the agroforestry systems were lower than in the full-sun systems. The soil moisture content in agroforestry systems was higher than full-sun only on the GI. Except for the agroforestry systems in PA, all the other systems showed an increase in CO2 efflux with increasing soil moisture. This increase was more pronounced in agroforestry systems (RO), followed by full sun (RO). On the GI farm, this correlation was lower in the agroforestry system. Soil CO2 efflux was positively correlated with soil temperature and negatively correlated with total nitrogen, labile carbon and total organic carbon. Therefore, despite the microclimate stability promoted by the agroforestry systems in the winter, no decrease in the soil CO2 efflux was observed when compared to full sun systems.",

    "abstract": "Zeyheria tuberculosa, a native species of Brazil known for its significant potential in silviculture and genetic improvement, holds prominence among various species. In this study, our objective was to assess the diversity, genetic structure, and feasibility of establishing a seedling seed orchard (SSO) for this species. A total of 71 progenies were collected from different locations and were used in our experiment in Ijaci - MG. We genotyped 92 individuals (nine families with eight individuals, two families with seven individuals, and one family with six individuals), specifically selecting those with the highest predicted genetic values, using ten ISSR primers. The molecular markers employed effectively detected polymorphism (PIC = 0.44). The population exhibited moderate to high genetic diversity, as evidenced by observed (AO = 2.00) and effective alleles (AE = 1.61), Nei's diversity index (H* = 0.35), and Shannon's diversity index (I* = 0.52). Molecular variance analysis indicated significant genetic differentiation between the progenies (Φst = 0.19), yet the majority of the variation was observed within them (80.1%). Employing a Bayesian approach, we identified the formation of two distinct genetic groups, further confirming the non-genetic structure of the population. These findings affirm the potential of the Z. tuberculosa progenies to contribute to the establishment of a seedling seed orchard, supporting genetic improvement strategies and the conservation of the species' genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Strawberry cultivation possesses unique features, including the need for high-quality seedlings adapted to the cultivation environment and proper fertigation management. These elements influence plant growth and production. This study evaluated the growth and dry matter partitioning of strawberry plants of the cultivar \"Albion\" at different seedling ages (0, 14, 28... 196 DAT) using two fertigation methods: open-loop and closed-loop systems. Fifteen evaluations occurred throughout the cultivation cycle, spanning from planting to 196 days after transplanting (DAT), with the study replicated over two consecutive years. We evaluated dry matter partitioning among roots, stems, leaves, senescent leaves, flowers, commercial fruits, and non-commercial fruits. We also measured root volume and length, besides counts of leaves, flowers, and both commercial and non-commercial fruits. Despite no significant differences between fertigation systems for most variables, the closed-loop system shows promise, contingent on proper nutrient solution management. The partitioning analysis revealed that fruits, followed by leaves, were the primary consumers of photoassimilates.",

This study aimed to evaluate the collection of local cassava conserved by four traditional communities of Jangada in terms of ethnobotanical/socioeconomic and genetic aspects. Socioeconomic and ethnobotanical analyses were carried out with 40 farmers using qualitative techniques and descriptive statistics. Seven microsatellite markers were used for genetic analysis. A total of 182 cassava citations were verified, 31 of which were different. The Broto Branco variety was the most frequent (94.3%), followed by Vermelha Gaiadeira and Liberata (82.9 and 77.1%, respectively). The calculated median age for farmers was 56 years. Spearman’s coefficient indicated a positive correlation between the increase in farmer’s age and the number of cultivated local varieties. Few varieties are planted by many farmers, and most are planted by few farmers. High genetic diversity was observed, and most of the variability occurred within communities (88%). Two groups were formed in the cluster analysis, with two communities in each group. The propagule circulation network helped to understand the genetic similarity of communities with the closest geographic location. Cassava cultivation plays an important role in the studied communities, which maintain a high ethnobotanical and genetic diversity and relevant knowledge about the cultivated varieties.",

This study aims to contribute to sustainable regional development by evaluating the effects of inoculation, co-inoculation, and the application of starter mineral nitrogen (N), either individually or in combination, on soybean growth and yield. Eight field experiments were conducted from 2018 to 2021 in two municipalities within Alagoas, covering soybean cultivation areas ranging from the first to the fourth year. The experiments followed a randomized complete block design with four replications, employing a factorial arrangement of treatments. The first factor encompassed five levels related to inoculation technologies and N management: 1) Inoculation with Bradyrhizobium; 2) Inoculation with Bradyrhizobium combined with N basal fertilization; 3) Co-inoculation of Bradyrhizobium + Azospirillum; 4) Co-inoculation of Bradyrhizobium + Azospirillum + N fertilization at the base; and 5) Control treatment without microbiological inputs or nitrogen fertilizers. The second factor involved the evaluation of different soybean cultivars, with two materials assessed in 2018 and three cultivars in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Results demonstrated that seed inoculation with Bradyrhizobium led to increased soybean grain yield in first-year cultivation areas. However, N basal fertilization, commonly known as starter fertilization, did not result in yield improvements compared to the use of microbiological inputs alone. Soybean cultivars BRS 9383 IPRO and FTR 3191 IPRO exhibited greater responsiveness to seed inoculation with Bradyrhizobium.",

    "abstract": "It is common to observe conventional methods for estimating soybean crop yields, making the process slow and susceptible to human error. Therefore, the objective was to develop a model based on deep learning to estimate soybean yield using digital images obtained through a smartphone. To do this, the ability of the proposed model to correctly classify pods that have different numbers of grains, count the number of pods and grains, and then estimate the soybean crop yield was analyzed. As part of the study, two types of image acquisition were performed for the same plant. Image acquisition 1 (IA1) included capturing the images of the entire plant, pods, leaves, and branches. Image acquisition 2 (IA2) included capturing the images of the pods removed from the plant and deposited in a white container. In both acquisition methods, two soybean cultivars, TMG 7063 Ipro and TMG 7363 RR, were used. In total, combining samples from both cultivars, 495 images were captured, with each image corresponding to a sample (plant) obtained through methods AI1 and AI2. With these images, the total number of pods in the entire dataset was 46,385 pods. For the training and validation of the model, the data was divided into subsets of training, validation, and testing, representing, respectively, 80, 10, and 10% of the total dataset. In general, when using the data from IA2, the model presented errors of 7.50 and 5.32% for pods and grains, respectively. These values are considerably lower than when the model used the IA1 data, where it presented errors of 34.69 and 35.25% for pod and grain counts, respectively. Therefore, the data used from IA2 provide better results to the model.",

The experiments were conducted in Curitibanos, Santa Catarina State, Brazil, during 2019 and 2020, using the garlic cultivars Chonan and Ito, respectively. A randomized block experimental design was employed, consisting of 16 treatment groups with four replications. The design incorporated a 2×8 factorial arrangement, involving two weed management strategies (coexistence and control) and eight crop-weed coexistence periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 130 days after crop emergence – DAE). The study evaluated the weed community and recorded data on the number of bulbs, bulb diameter, as well as total and commercial bulb yields of garlic crops. The results indicated average losses of 24.3% in total bulb yield and 28.9% in commercial bulb yield. Critical periods for effective weed control were identified as 6 to 126 DAE in 2019, 5 to 126 DAE in 2020 for total yield, 3 to 126 DAE in 2019, and 5 to 126 DAE in 2020 for commercial bulb yield.

Data on morphological and meteorological variables were collected in five locations (Hidrolândia, Itaberaí, Palmeiras de Goiás, Piracanjuba, and Silvânia) during the year 2020. Morphological characteristics assessed included plant height, number of branches, and leaf area index (LAI). Meteorological variables considered were average air temperature, global solar irradiance, thermal sum, and soil water availability. Pearson correlations, canonical correlations, and multivariate Stepwise regression were employed to analyze the relationships between morphological and meteorological variables. The study revealed that soil water availability significantly impacts tomato crop development, indicating the need for improved irrigation management. Adequate irrigation management contributed to an 86.1% increase in plant height and a 79.7% boost in leaf area index, while average air temperature influenced a 34% increase in the number of branches. In conclusion, proper irrigation management is crucial for enhancing tomato crop growth and development and optimizing water use.",

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility of using low-density marker panels to predict the genetic merit of C. arabica for a range of desirable agronomic traits. For this purpose, GWS analyses were performed using the G-BLUP method with panels of varying marker densities, selected based on marker effect magnitude. The results indicate that employing lower-density panels might be advantageous for this species' improvement. Models based on these panels yielded accurate predictions for various traits and demonstrated high agreement in terms of selected individuals compared to more complex models.",

Statistical analysis of mixed models confirmed the presence of genetic variability among kale genotypes. We examined the Smith and Hazel, Mulamba and Mock, Z-index, and FAI-BLUP indices. Smith and Hazel, Mulamba and Mock, as well as Z-index, were found unsuitable for leafy kale selection in breeding programs. The FAI-BLUP index demonstrated superior performance, aligning with the specific objectives of the kale breeding program and offering desirable gains.

Parameters were manually calibrated through a trial-and-error process until the estimates closely matched the observed data. Model evaluation involved comparing observed and simulated data using statistical indices. The most favorable results were obtained for live biomass, leaf mass, and stem mass (with modeling efficiency exceeding 0.55 in the rainfed system and surpassing 0.34 for the irrigated system). Estimates of soil water content exhibited better accuracy for shallower soil layers (0 to 0.30 m). The calibration of the APSIM-Oats model for black oats yielded satisfactory estimates for live biomass under rainfed conditions.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to optimize both agronomically and economically leaf green mass productivity of kale and its agronomic components when fertilized with equivalent biomass amounts of the hairy woodrose (Merremia aegyptia L.) and roostertree (Calotropis procera Ait.) spontaneous species from the Caatinga biome in two cropping seasons. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with five treatments and five replications. The treatments consisted of equivalent biomass amounts of hairy woodrose and roostertree at doses of 16, 29, 42, 55, and 68 ton ha-1, on a dry basis. In each experiment, a treatment without fertilization (control) and a treatment with chemical fertilization were used. The maximum optimized physical efficiencies of the kale commercial leaf productivity and number of leaf packets per square meter were 16.92 ton ha-1 and 6.97, respectively, when the amounts of the green manure biomass of 56.41 and 48.63 ton ha-1 were incorporated into the soil. The optimized maximum net income of 47,841.44 BRL ha-1 and rate of return of 2.47 reals for each real invested were obtained when the amounts of the green manure biomass were 53.26 and 64.31 ton ha-1 added to the soil. The use of M. aegyptia and C. procera biomass as green manure is a viable technology for kale producers in monocropping in a semi-arid environment.",

    "abstract": "The use of integrated agricultural production systems has been expanded due to the multiple functions they perform. Although soil structural studies have elucidated the relationship of these systems with plant development, adjustments are needed to incorporate the diversity of management systems employed. Thus, the hypothesis of this study was that integrated cropping systems mitigate soil structural degradation and increase the agronomic performance of crops. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the biological soil loosening potential containing paiaguás grass and the effectiveness of integrated systems in promoting the agronomic performance of soybean plants and to model the least limiting water range (LLWR) considering the adopted management regimes. An experiment was performed based on a randomized block and split-plot design. In the plots, the traffic intensity (0, 2, 10, and 30 passes of an agricultural tractor. In the subplots, soybean cultivation was performed under the three management systems (simple: monoculture grains; integrated: intercropping between grass and grains; and pasture in monoculture). The following soil physical quality indicators were determined: bulk density (Bd) and LLWR; these indicators are related to phenological development attributes and soybean productivity. The integrated agricultural production systems promoted biological soil loosening and improved soybean yield. The use of Paiaguás grass in monoculture enhanced edaphic benefits and enabled greater grain production compared to grain monocropping. The least limiting water range was an efficient parameter for modeling the physical behavior of the soil, and the application of the LLWR was improved by considering penetration resistance reference values specific to each management system. Our results highlight the soundness of using the LLWR in evaluating the response of soybean to physical changes in soil due to compaction, and the reference values for penetration resistance contribute to greater accuracy in the LLWR and the physical diagnosis of soil properties.",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions significantly impact the performance of sweet potato genotypes, necessitating the study of genotype x environment (GE) interactions to select genotypes adaptable to varying cultivation conditions. This study aimed to assess GE interactions in sweet potatoes for animal feed and identify high-performance genotypes suitable for different seasons. We conducted two tests during the Brazilian winter of 2019 and summer of 2020. Employing a partially balanced triple lattice experimental design with 100 treatments (92 sweet potato genotypes and eight controls) and three replications, we measured vine green matter yield (VGMY), percentage vine dry matter (PVDM), vine dry matter yield (VDMY), percentage of root dry matter (PRDM), and roots dry matter yield (RDMY). We ranked genotypes, highlighting the best performers for individual and combined seasons. Significant differences in VGMY, PRDM, and RDMY were observed for GE interaction. VGMY, VDMY, and PRDM favored the summer season, while PVDM and RDMY performed better in the winter season. Genotypes 2018-31-713, 2018-72-1438, 2018-31-666, 2018-12-252, 2018-19-461, 2018-19-389, 2018-38-946, 2018-31-689, and 2018-37-864 proved most suitable for VGMY and VDMY across growing seasons. Genotypes 2018-28-514, 2018-15-268, and 2018-19-443 demonstrated potential in percentage vine dry matter.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful nonparametric tools for estimating genomic breeding values (GEBVs) in genetic breeding. One significant advantage of ANNs is their ability to make predictions without requiring prior assumptions about data distribution or the relationship between genotype and phenotype. However, ANNs come with a high computational cost, and their predictions may be underestimated when including all molecular markers. This study proposes a two-step genomic prediction procedure using ANNs to address these challenges. Initially, molecular markers were selected either directly through Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) or indirectly based on their importance, identified through Boosting, considering the top 5, 20, and 50% of markers with the highest significance. Subsequently, the selected markers were employed for genomic prediction using ANNs. This approach was applied to two simulated traits: one with ten trait-controlling loci and heritability of 0.4 (Scenario SC1) and the other with 100 trait-controlling loci and a heritability of 0.2 (Scenario SC2). Comparisons were made between ANN predictions using marker selection and those without any marker selection. Reducing the number of markers proved to be an efficient strategy, resulting in improved accuracy, reduced mean squared error (MSE), and shorter adjustment times. The best ANN predictions were obtained with ten markers selected by MARS in SC1, and the top 5% most relevant markers selected using Boosting in SC2. As a result, in SC1, predictions using MARS achieved over a 31% increase in accuracy and a 90% reduction in MSE. In SC2, predictions using Boosting resulted in more than a 15% increase in accuracy and an 83% reduction in MSE. For both scenarios, computational time was up to ten times shorter with marker selection. Overall, the two-step prediction procedure emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the computational and predictive performance of ANN models.",

    "abstract": "Brazil is the third-largest producer of fruits in the world, with yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) as one of its main crops. This species requires cross-pollination, with Xylocopa bees being the primary pollinators due to its self-incompatibility. The presence of Solanum lycocarpum close to passion fruit orchards can serve, due their flowers, as an attraction for pollinating bees, improving the production of the crop. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: i) investigate whether the planting of S. lycocarpum close to the passion fruit orchard increased the richness and abundance of bees; ii) evaluate whether the implementation of trap nests in the passion fruit orchard and close to S. lycocarpum attracted bees to nests in this location; iii) record the time of greatest foraging activity of Xylocopa frontalis in the passion fruit orchard; and iv) quantify the number of natural nests of X. frontalis in the passion fruit orchard during the experimental period. A total of 48 seedlings of S. lycocarpum were planted and divided into two rows along the eastern border of the yellow passion fruit crop. Bees were recorded for 15 minutes each hour from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm. During the remaining 45 minutes, the posts were inspected for natural bee nests. The frequency, abundance, species richness, and indices of Shannon-Winner, Simpson, and Pielou equitability indices were assessed. The most common species were X. frontalis, Apis mellifera, and Trigona spinipes. The flowering of S. lycocarpum near passion fruit orchards positively influenced the increase in the number of nests and species richness of pollinating bees, indicating that this plant, close to passion fruit orchards, can contribute to fruit production. Finally, we showed the preferred times for bee foraging and the period in which insecticide application should be avoided.",

One effective approach is determining the optimal plot size, which can reduce experimental error. While frequentist methods are commonly employed for this purpose, Bayesian approaches offer distinct advantages. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the optimal plot size for chickpea experiments using the Bayesian approach and compare the results with those from the frequentist approach. We conducted two control experiments (with no treatments) involving eight cultivation rows, each spanning seven meters in length, with 50 cm spacing between rows and 10 cm spacing between plants. We evaluated the central six rows, totaling 60 plants per cultivation row. At the end of the growth cycle, we assessed seed count, seed weight, harvest index, and shoot dry mass. Data collection was conducted at the individual plant level. We determined the optimal number of plots using both the frequentist approach (modified maximum curvature method) and Bayesian approach, employing informative and uninformative prior distributions. The optimal plot size varied depending on the specific experiments and the variables under analysis. However, there was consensus in the estimation of the optimal experimental plot size between the two approaches. We recommend using 15 plants as the optimal plot size for chickpea cultivation.",

However, reports have indicated the potential for late nodulation in this species, contributing to increased grain production. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of late nodulation in common beans and its contribution to plant growth. Experiments were carried out by testing two inoculation strategies: rhizobial inoculation (1) in different sections of the root system and (2) at different phenological stages. Plants were harvested at flowering and the beginning of pod filling. When the first strategy was applied, both inoculation on the seeds and throughout the pot volume resulted in greater nodulation compared to the uninoculated control. However, shoot biomass accumulation remained unaffected. When the second strategy was applied, supplementary inoculation at different stages did not improve nodulation or plant growth compared to seed inoculation. We conclude that neither method promoted effective late nodulation of common beans and that seed inoculation was sufficient to promote good vegetative development of common beans.",

    "abstract": "Soil bulk density (BD) serves as a crucial physical property for characterizing soils and assessing the quality of their management systems. Various methods, including the Core, Clod, and Jolly balance (JBM) methods, are employed for BD measurement. However, these methods can yield significantly different measurements due to analytical errors. This study aims to assess the accuracy of these methods in a clayey Oxisol under different management conditions, while also identifying primary experimental errors in BD determination and strategies for their mitigation. Different statistical approaches were employed to analyze the impacts of sample volume, paraffin temperature, and management systems on BD determination methods. Method accuracy exhibited variation among management systems, particularly notable in secondary forest (SF) areas. In these areas, Core-based BD measurements were 37% lower than those obtained by the Clod and JBM methods. This disparity can be attributed to the higher macroporosity observed in SF, leading to greater sample volume loss and smaller volumes analyzed by the Clod and JBM. A correlation between paraffin temperature for sample coating and clod volume was observed, with paraffin temperature affecting BD measurements only in clods larger than 69.9 cm3. The paraffin temperature inducing the lowest mean error for larger clods was 92°C. For clods smaller than 69.9 cm3, BD measurement errors arose due to inadequate sample volume. Representative elementary volume was identified as a means to mitigate BD overvaluation by the Clod method. A volume of 99 cm3 proved effective in reducing mean BD errors to 5%, making it suitable for both field sampling and laboratory analytical procedures.",

The duration of the post-embryonic period of the insects fed with D. saccharallis eggs increased (20.1 days) in relation to that fed with S. cereallella (19.3 days) eggs. There was no effect of the food provided on the other parameters evaluated. D. saccharallis eggs can thus be used to feed C. raimundoi",

    "abstract": "The present work was developed in four agricultural seasons, in different localities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil: Pindorama (96/97), Tatuí (96/97 e 97/98), Votuporanga (96/97, 97/98, 98/99 e 99/00), which are sand soils; Campinas (96/97, 97/98 e 99/00) sand loam soils and Ilha Solteira (98/99), Ituverava (96/97 ) and Miguelópolis (97/98 e 98/99) clay soils. The experimental design was completely random blocks with four replications. The cotton cultivar was the IAC 22 with four lines disposed in 20 m-2-plots. Treatments were: 1-Ridge application (12-60-50 kg/ha of N-P-K); 2- a third part of the fertilizer on the ridges and the remaining amount by casting; 3- a fifth part of the fertilizer on the ridges and the remaining amount by casting; 4- Cast fertilization casting (12-60-50 kg/ha of N-P-K); 5- Cast application (0-60-50 kg/ha of N-P-K); 6- Cast fertilization (12-00-50 kg/ha of N-P-K).; 7- Cast fertilization (12-60-00 kg/ha of N-P-K); 8- Cast fertilization (0-60-50 kg/ha of N-P-K) and 50 kg of N/ha by covering; 9- Cast fertilization (0-60-0 kg/ha of N-P-K). It may be concluded that, in traditional cultivated cotton fields, cast fertilization can be useful, mainly by nutrient accumulation during the years. It is possible to use higher amount of the fertilizer by casting and lesser amount in seed ridges; Phosphorus and potassium can be applied together or separately, by casting before sowing, and nitrogen must be applied by covering; Continually fertilized fields can be fertilized by casting, without sowing application and with nitrogen and nitrogen and potassium application by covering.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate five lisianthus cultivars in different plants densities in pot of three liters. The cultivars Echo Champagne, Echo Pink, Mariachi Pure White, Ávila Blue Rim and Balboa Yellow were evaluated in density of three, four and five plants per pot. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with three replications in a 5x3 factorial scheme. The density of three plants provided larger number of flowers and leaves compared to the other densities. The density of three plants per pot is the most recommended for the growth of lisianthus. Mariachi Pure White, Avila Blue Rim and Balboa Yellow cultivars showed good results of production.",

In this study, photosynthetical rates of ten different leaves of a coffee plant were obtained during a day. The daily variation in photosynthetic rates showed a peak between 7:00 h and 9:00 h with higher values measured for the leaves positioned at the sunrise direction and northern orientation. Lower values were consistently observed for leaves at inner position of the plant. After 9:00 h, despite the increase in photosynthetically active radiation, photosynthetic rates decreased steadily to reach negligible values at sunset. The reductions on photosynthesis rates can also be attributed to increasing stomatal resistance. Since number of leaves is highly variable in coffee plants, those results make evident how difficult is to integrate and estimate whole plant photosynthesis by taking the average of 10 leaves.",

The highest losses in cotton harvest occurred in the lower third and on the soil, both of which exhibit a spatial dependence model, according to geostatistics, demonstrating that they do not occur in a randomized process and are related to the specific plant. There was a relationship between the plant populations with losses in the cotton crop. The plant population can influence the spatial dependence of losses.",

The conversion of forest to sugarcane plantation was found to result in higher sugarcane soil pore lacunarity than that of native forest soil, while the porosity was found to be lower. More precisely, this study shows that native forest has more porous soil with a more uniform spatial distribution of pores, while sugarcane soil has lower porosity and a more heterogeneous pore distribution. Moreover, validation through multivariate statistics demonstrates that lacunarity can be considered a relevant index of clustering and can explain the variability among soils under different land use systems. While porosity by itself represents a fundamental concept for quantification of the impact of land use change, the current findings demonstrate that the spatial distribution of pores also plays an important role and that pore lacunarity can be adopted as a complementary tool in studies directed at quantifying the effect of human intervention on soils.",

The methodology used was descriptive from an agricultural database of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply (SEAB), of the National Register System of Storage Units (SICARM), interviews were also made with agroindustrial cooperatives and official agencies. It was identified that in Paraná State there is an insufficiency of 17.75% of total static capacity of warehouses to comply with the total grain production (soybean, 1st and 2nd corn crops, and wheat). The results showed that the total dynamic capacity of warehouses is sufficient in the mesoregions of Eastern Center, Southern Center, Northern Center, and Metropolitan. Therefore, storage units vary uniformly in most municipalities, not following the growth of total grain production in the state of Paraná.",

Some deterministic assumption-free methods such as the inverse distance weighting can also be applied to predict spatial data, but their output is limited for graphical solutions (mapping). We adapted a computer-based prediction method called Circular Variable Radius Moving Window (CVRMW) that is based on two others: moving window kriging (MWK) and inverse squared-distance weighting (ISDW). The algorithm is developed to meet an objective function that minimizes the index of variation of the spatial observations inside the moving window. A code in R language is presented and thoroughly described. The outputs include the range of the spatial dependence as the radius calculated at every target location and the standard error of the predicted values, mapped to provide a useful tool for spatial exploratory analysis. The method does not make any assumptions about the spatial process, and it is an alternative for dealing with spatial heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Soybean represents a valuable source of food for humans and animals and the quality of the seeds has great importance for the establishment and high productivity of this crop. Soybean seeds require continuous improvement, which is dependent on a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate seed germination. To investigate whether the method of water absorption into soybean seeds could lead to abnormal seedlings, and if this could be associated with cytogenetical consequences, we premoistened the seeds of three cultivars; M 6410 IPRO, M6210 IPRO, and BMX Potência RR by direct immersion (fast method), use of a wet substrate (intermediate method), and by moist atmosphere (slow method) with distilled water at 25ºC for 24 hours. We investigated the normal and abnormal seedlings, electrical conductivity, mitosis, cell death, and the chromosomal abnormalities index. The comet assay was applied to investigate DNA fragmentation. Direct immersion in water induced seedling growth inhibition and caused cytological alterations associated with genotoxicity effects in the studied soybean genotypes. Slow premoistening of the seeds increased seedling performance as a result of higher final germination percentage (above 85%), reduced abnormal seedlings (below 5%, on average), and reduced the electrical conductivity of seeds. All three genotypes of soybean seeds lost their ability to withstand the imbibitional damage induced by direct immersion as abnormal seedlings increased. We concluded that the fast water absorption by seeds poses a threat to genomic integrity owing to its potential for genotoxicity to DNA, manifesting as breaks or loss of whole chromosomes. Slow premoistening of the seeds resulted in a longer time period to deal with damage. Stabilized seedling growth was provided by altering cytogenetic responses during uptake of water by soybean seeds through the maintenance of cell viability.",

    "abstract": "Signal grass (Urochloa decumbens) and guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) are African grasses that are well established in the Brazilian Savannah and we tested their adaptation to different light intensity. Plants were grown for 45 days under 0% shade (full sun) and 25, 40, and 80% induced shade to evaluate their photosynthetic performance. Light curves showed higher values of electron transport rate, photochemical quenching, and effective quantum yield in plants subjected to 0 and 25% shade for signal grass and in 25 and 40% shade for guinea grass. The potential quantum yield evaluations revealed that signal grass felt the effects of excessive light around 11:30 am on plants subjected to 0 and 25% shade. Conversely, guinea grass showed these photoinhibition effects at the same shade level but in a longer time range (9:30 am to 1:30 pm). As shade increased, there was a reduction tendency of the pigment content in signal grass and the opposite was observed for guinea grass. Stomatal conductance showed different values during the day and among different shade levels and there were no differences in relative water content between treatments and species. Results indicated better photosynthetic performance for signal grass under high intensity and better photosynthetic performance for guinea grass subjected to intermediate and higher levels of shade. Altogether, the results indicate that guinea grass seems to be a more appropriate choice for silvopasture systems.",

    "abstract": "Organic agriculture systems have the nutrients supplied by plant or animal by-products, bioinoculants, and compost-based products as earthworm composts and green manures. However, the quantitative and qualitative parameters of soil amendments depend on their sources, and soil amendments are generally not sufficient to supply the nutritional requirements of maize crops. Moreover, specialty maize requires high levels of N. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate specialty maize varieties supplied with two microbial inoculants applied in two inoculation methods. These factorial treatments were compared with their checks (varieties without inoculation), and the interaction among these factors was also investigated. The trials were carried out during the growing season in 2017–2018 in the State University of Maringá. The popcorn trial followed the randomized complete block design where the factorial 3 × 2 × 2 + 3 had five replications. The trial with white grits maize followed the same experimental design but the factorial scheme was 2 × 2 × 2 + 2 with three replications. Both trials had maize varieties and two species of microbial inoculants (Azospirillum brasilense and Methylobacterium sp.) applied in two inoculation methods, in the seeds and the foliar spray at V4 stage of plant development. The response traits were grain yield and the components of crop production. In both trials, we verified that the majority of the interactions among the factors was non-significant (p &gt; 0.05), indicating the independence of these factors. Furthermore, the microbial inoculants had no beneficial effects on the traits. The possibility of a higher crop yield did not confirm the application of the inoculant in the stage V4. The organic compost may be the key point in mitigating the treatments with microbial inoculants due to the availability of N in the first stages of plant development. The traits also suggest the necessity of more trials about the influence of microbial inoculants on specialty maize production.",

    "abstract": "The study of promoters has become essential to elucidate genetic regulation and allow new genetic transformation strategies through plant biotechnology. The challenge is to discover and validate promoters that can regulate gene transcription spatially and/or temporally. The goal of this work was to validate genes associated with tissue-specific promoters of bananas obtained from in silico sequences and selected from the DATAMusa databank. Gene expression was quantified using RT-qPCR from different tissues: leaves, flowers, roots, unripe pulp, ripe pulp, unripe peels, and ripe peels of two different genetic groups: Prata-Anã (PA; group AAB) and Grand Naine (GN; group AAA). After the analysis of the expression of genes associated with the promoters, normalization was performed with the most stable reference genes (TUB and L2) selected using the RefFinder tool. It was determined that five genes were specific or expressed to a greater extent in some tissues than others. The EMB-23 gene was highly expressed in ripe pulp and flowers of GN, EMB-26 in the ripe pulp of GN, EMB-27 in flowers of GN, EMB-28 in roots of PA and ripe pulp and roots of GN, and EMB-31 in roots and flowers of GN and PA, and unripe pulp of GN. The in silico analysis was efficient in the identification of spatial/time-specific genes, thereby decreasing analysis time and cost, making future genetic transformation studies focusing on the application of these tissue-specific promoters possible.",

However, in some cases, disregarding the assumptions of ANOVA can lead to spatial dependence. In such cases, to ensure greater experimental precision, it is necessary to consider the study of spatial dependence. This study was carried out to compare the estimates of experimental precision of the traditional analysis of variance with those of the analysis of variance using an autoregressive (ANOVA-AR) model in corn experiments under different N conditions when evaluating grain yield. Data were obtained from 14 experiments using lattice designs conducted in 2012, 2014, and 2015 in the following counties in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul: Caarapó, Dourados, Glória de Dourados, and Laguna Carapã. Of the 14 experiments, 7 were performed with N fertilization (ideal) and 7 experiments were performed under stressful conditions (zero or low). Both analyses were compared by considering estimates of reduction of the error mean square, coefficient of determination, F-value, and selective accuracy as well as the difference in the order of 25% of the genotypes of each experiment (from 13 to 56 genotypes, considering the size of the experiment). Differences in the error mean square and genotype mean square were slightly more evident in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 experiments but the use of ANOVA-AR did not promote major changes. The analysis of variance with an autoregressive model provided parameter values of experimental precision similar to those expressed by traditional analysis of variance. There was no difference in terms of correlated errors in experiments under different N conditions.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of water restriction on soybean tolerance to defoliation in the vegetative and reproductive periods of development. Two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse located in Lages, Santa Catarina State Brazil, during the 2017/2018 growing season. Cultivar NA 5909 RG was subjected to three WR levels (none, moderate, and severe) and five defoliation levels (0, 17, 33, 50, and 67%). Defoliation occurred at the V6 stage in the first experiment and R3 in the second. WR occurred for 7 days after defoliation. LA at R2 and R5 after defoliation at V6 and R3 decreased by 27.5 and 64.6%, respectively, regardless of WR. LA between V6 and R2 was not influenced by WR or defoliation. Moderate or severe WR reduced plant ability to recover LA between R3 and R5. Severe WR decreased grain production by 22.2% in the vegetative period and 21.2% per plant in the reproductive period compared to that of the control, regardless of defoliation. The highest defoliation level reduced grain production per plant by 24.7 and 24.3% relative to the control at stages V6 and R3, respectively, regardless of WR. WR imposed at the vegetative and reproductive stages did not increase defoliation sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic variation and diversity of cassava for breeding purposes based on the pasting properties of starch, for food applications. The viscosities of the starches, extracted from 1031 accessions, were obtained using a Rapid Visco Analyzer. The best linear unbiased predictors were calculated for five critical points of the viscograms, which were then used to cluster the accessions based on the discriminant analysis of principal components. The wide phenotypic variation identified from the viscograms reveals the high potential for selection gains, especially for pasting temperature and setback. Certain strong correlations indicate that selection based on a specific viscogram trait can be used for indirect selection (e.g., the correlation between peak viscosity and breakdown [0.85]). The lowest Bayesian information criterion identified five different groups. Groups 3 and 4 exhibited high pasting temperatures, while Groups 3 and 5 exhibited low setbacks. Group 3 also exhibited low viscosity and breakdown. However, we focused on selecting cassava accessions with a high pasting temperature and low setback, as these are the most important traits for industrial applications. The predicted genetic gains from the selection of the top 15 cassava accessions for increasing pasting temperature and decreasing setback were 4.40% and 53.17%, respectively. The increased pasting temperature (~72.89°C) and high amplitude of setback (~600 cP) due to selection can guide the utilization of the cassava germplasm for breeding and provide a basis for further studies to develop varieties with added value, especially in the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Among the forage species, especially in semiarid ecosystems, cactus pear is exceptional because of its high tolerance to adverse conditions and high productivity. Due to this alone, several studies have been conducted to identify the main technologies for this crop. Despite being consolidated and integrated, the cactus pear production system has limited accessibility, technical assistance, and availability of information for those dedicated to its production. This study aimed to present a digital platform, website, and applications to provide technical information on the cactus pear and demonstrate the efficiency of these applications through experimental data. On this digital platform, applications were made available for predicting the productivity of cactus pear using artificial neural networks (ANN) on a computer with routines in the R software and by simple linear regression (SLR) on smartphones on the Android system of the MIT App Inventor 2 platform. In addition, using the smartphone app, it is possible to obtain the cladode area through multiple linear regression (MLR). It is also possible to obtain the estimates of the experimental plot sizes by the maximum modified curvature, linear and quadratic methods with plateau response, relative information, comparison of variances, and convenient plot size. The platform provides technical information associated with the cactus pear crop from different sources (dissertations, theses, articles) and formats (video classes and teaching resources), offline for applications, and online with download for publications, dissertations, theses and articles, video classes, and several didactic resources. The biomathematical models integrated with the applications were highly precise in predicting the phenomena, in which the variation explained by the models in the prediction of responses for future observations had R² values of 0.95, 0.72, and 0.92, respectively, for productivity with computer-ANN and smartphone-SLR, and for the cladode area with a smartphone - MLR.",

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate whether the application of amendments reduces penetration resistance (PR) in the short term and describe the spatial variability of PR in the surface horizon of an Aquic Argiudoll under no-tillage in northeast Argentina. Four treatments, consisting of surface applications of 7.5 Mg ha−1 poultry litter (PL), 3.0 Mg ha−1 gypsum (G), the combination of PL+G, and untreated control (T), were arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Two more treatments were added to the experiment 12 months later, consisting of PL reapplications on half of the surface of the PL+G and PL treatments (PL+G+PL and PL+PL, respectively) in a split-plot design with three replications in 4×20-m plots. PR was determined in the field with an Eijkelkamp penetrologger following a 2-m long transect perpendicular to the sowing direction at 10 different spots separated 0.2 m from each other. The spatial variability was quantified for each treatment using semivariograms. The highest PR was observed in the T treatment (1.96 MPa) and the lowest PR in PL+G+PL (0.21 MPa). All treatments showed a high spatial dependence (94.9 to 99.9%). Treatments with PL reapplication (PL+PL and PL+G+PL) showed profiles with lower PR and more homogeneous kriging maps. PL reapplication on PL treatments showed no effects on PR values. However, PL reapplication on the PL+G treatment led to positive effects in all PR ranges. Thus, the PL+G+PL treatment, which had the highest PR values, showed a decrease in PR from 54.17 to 6.65% with the reapplication 12 months later. The addition of organic and inorganic amendments reduced specific compacted soil areas on the surface horizon of an Aquic Argiudoll under no-tillage.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the influence of vegetative canopy height on the agronomic characteristics and grape must and wine physicochemical properties of a ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ vineyard in an espalier-trained system. The evaluated parameters comprised agronomic characteristics of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ grapevines and physicochemical compositions of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ musts and wines, as well as their phenolic compositions (anthocyanins, stilbenes, and flavonoids), and impact on wine contents of methoxypyrazines (volatile compounds that impart vegetal or earthy odors to wine, which are considered undesirable in large intensity). To that end, four heights of the vegetative canopy were tested: 60 cm (T1), 80 cm (T2), 100 cm (T3), and 120 cm (T4). The experiment was carried out in a commercial vineyard in the region of “Campanha Gaúcha” (Dom Pedrito, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil) during the productive cycles of 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, and 2018/19. The main agronomic parameters were measured: estimated productivity per plant and hectare, and mean weight and number of clusters. All wines were elaborated by the same traditional winemaking methods. The physicochemical analyses of must and wines were performed by infrared spectroscopy using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and the phenolic analysis by high-efficiency liquid chromatography and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Methoxypyrazines were quantified using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that treatments did not influence agronomic parameters. However, technological maturation (sugar accumulation) had interesting results for plants managed at higher canopy heights, with respective results obtained for wine. Treatments had little influence on individual quantification of anthocyanins, although cycles had a high influence on their profile. The wines had low concentrations of methoxypyrazines and did not differ among treatments.",

    "abstract": "The selection of superior sweet potato genotypes using Bayesian inference is an important strategy for genetic improvement. Sweet potatoes are of social and economic importance, being the material for ethanol production. The estimation of variance components and genetic parameters using Bayesian inference is more accurate than that using the frequently used statistical methodologies. This is because the former allows for using a priori knowledge from previous research. Therefore, the present study estimated genetic parameters and selection gains, predicted genetic values, and selected sweet potato genotypes using a Bayesian approach with a priori information. Root shape, soil insect resistance, and root and shoot productivity of 24 sweet potato genotypes were measured. Heritability, genotypic variation coefficient, residual variation coefficient, relative variation index, and selection gains direct, indirect and simultaneous were estimated, and the data were analyzed using Bayesian inference. Data from 11 experiments were used to obtain a priori information. Bayesian inference was a useful tool for decision-making, and significant genetic gains could be achieved with the selection of the evaluated genotypes. Root shape, soil insect resistance, commercial root productivity, and total root productivity showed higher heritability values. Clones UFVJM06, UFVJM40, UFVJM54, UFVJM09, and CAMBRAIA can be used as parents in future breeding programs.",

The sequential specification of experimental points, seen as treatments in a 2k factorial design, results in a high-order bias in some factors, which is caused by the accumulation of −1 or +1 signals. This study aimed to propose new designs generated by the simulated annealing technique, respecting the main A-optimal and D-optimal optimality criteria as random execution orders that minimize the order bias. This approach allowed the generation of 24 and 25 factorials, which were compared to the designs in standard order. The simulated annealing technique is a viable method to generate optimal designs with the same efficiency as the usual designs to obtain A-optimal and D-optimal designs with new execution orders, which minimize the effect of order bias relative to standard order designs. Regarding efficiency, the generated designs were precise in the variance of model parameter estimates, similar to the original designs.",

    "abstract": "Metarhizium anisopliae is the better characterized entomopathogenic fungus. This mold attacks many insects that represent plagues of agriculture. The objective of this work was to analyse its vegetative development and sporulation in different medium composition. The vegetative growth was analysed by average of colony diameter of each strain in 15 days growth at 28oC in complete medium, Saboraud medium and potato-dextrose-agar (PDA). A fragment of each colony was transferred to 0,01% Tween 80 and counted in hemocitometer, to sporulation evaluation. The vegetative growth was better in Saboraud medium. The sporulation was higher in complete medium for three strains and another three responded better to PDA. These results have indicated that the environmental factors interfere, in a particular manner, in each moment of Metarhizium cycle. This study justifies more researches about genetic and environmental mechanisms that control development of this fungus.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of organic, organomineral and mineral fertilizers on soil contamination by enteric pathogens, using poultry manure as the organic fertilizer. Manure was applied in field experiments at rates of 7.0 ton. ha-1 (maize crop, 2008/2009), 8.0 ton. ha-1 (wheat crop, 2009) and 14 ton. ha-1 (maize crop, 2010/2011). Organomineral fertilizer was applied at the same rates but was comprised of 50% manure and 50% mineral fertilizer. At 30 and 70 days after fertilization, the organic fertilizer and the upper 0-5 cm layer of the soil were tested for the presence of helminth eggs and larvae and enteropathogenic bacteria. Fecal and non-fecal coliforms (Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringes) were found in the organic fertilizer, but neither Salmonella spp. nor enteroparasites were detected. The population of enteropathogenic bacteria in the soil was similar among the treatments for all crops at both evaluation times. The population of thermotolerant coliforms in the organic fertilizer was larger than the maximum level allowed in Brazil, but neither the organic or nor the organomineral fertilizer contaminated the soil.",

In cross Parula × Blue Silver, the AUDPC was managed by additive, dominance and epistasis of two major genes (model B-1), however, it was controlled by mixed one major gene and additive dominant polygenes in cross TD-1 × D-97603 (model D-1). Genetic variation and heritability was higher in major genes than polygene for all the crosses showing that AUDPC was mainly controlled by major genes. The genetic behavior of the AUDPC revealed that stripe rust resistance was controlled by mixed interaction of one to two major genes plus polygenes.",

    "abstract": "There are several factors that may compromise the initial establishment of wheat crops, reduce the plant populations, and consequently affect yield components and grain yield. The objective of this study was to produce reseeding recommendations for wheat crops affected by reduced plant stands based on an economic analysis of the yield cost and the expectation of financial return. Experiments were conducted during two agricultural years (2011 and 2012) in the Experimental da Coxilha area, which belongs to the Department of Plant Science of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). Random removals of wheat plants were undertaken, corresponding to 0, 20, 40, and 60% of the initial population of plants for the following cultivars: Fundacep Horizonte, Marfim, Fundacep Campo Real, Mirante and Quartzo. The characteristics that were evaluated included the number of plants and ears, as well as the grain yield. The Fundacep Horizonte, Marfim and Fundacep Campo Real cultivars were stable and able to compensate for losses caused by reductions in the plant stands. The yield production of Mirante and Quartz cultivars was dependent on the number of established plants and therefore relied on good establishment of the initial crop and no subsequent losses. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that the Mirante and Quartz cultivars do not compensate for reductions in plant populations and need to be reseeded if the number of plants is not appropriate. In such cases, the economic viability of reseeding can be quantified. In contrast, the Fundacep Horizonte, Marfim, and Fundacep Campo Real cultivars are more stable, and reseeding is not economically justified at these locations.",

    "abstract": ". High CO2 atmospheres have been reported to be accountable for slower ripening processes of many fruit species. In modified or controlled atmosphere storage of mangoes (Mangifera indica L.) delayed ripening is attributed to the effects of CO2 on ethylene biosynthesis, which is reduced under CO2 concentrations beyond 10%. In the present work the objective was to determine if those elevated CO2 atmospheres on ethylene synthesis could be attributed to the action of CO2 upon ACC oxidase. Mature green or tree ripe `Tommy Atkins` mangoes were, in four experiments, held in a flow through system of either 10 or 25% CO2 mixed to 5% O2 or only air for 14 or 21 days at 5, 8 or 12°C. Mangoes in the 25% CO2 atmosphere did not produce detectable levels of ethylene, whereas under 10% CO2 the production rates were significantly suppressed at 5 or 8°C. However, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) concentrations in mango mesocarp tissue at retrieval from storage were similar to the air controls and ACC synthase activity was not completely inhibited. The direct effects of CO2 concentrations on ACC oxidase activity is to be considered the most important factor in inhibiting ethylene biosynthesis of mangoes under 25% CO2 atmospheres.",

The plant height at planting, number of leaves at planting, and number of leaves at 7 days after planting were measured. The final number of leaves, final plant height, shoot dry matter, root dry matter, and total dry matter were measured after acclimatization. Stem cuttings between 20 and 25 mm in diameter should be used to produce cassava seedlings with the rapid multiplication method.

The homogeneity of the historical series was tested using the run test, and the historical trend was tested by the Mann-Kendal test. The magnitude of the trend was estimated with simple linear regression, and the descriptive statistics were calculated. For marketing on Mother’s Day, there was no historical trend that implied a change in the planting date of gladiolus for any of the development cycles. For marketing on All Souls’ Day, there was a positive historical trend only for the early and intermediate cycles I and II; thus, the increase in air temperature implied a delay of 9.2 days, 9.5 days and 6.9 days for the planting date, respectively, indicating that a shortening of the gladiolus development cycle occurred, mainly in late winter/early spring.",

The experimental design was a randomized block with ten treatments and four repetitions. The characteristics that were evaluated were the root classification (long, average and short roots); commercial, non-commercial and total yield; dry plant weight and root fresh weight. Both the planting season and the cultivar played important roles in agronomic performance throughout the experimental period. In May and June, the highest average yields and plant growth were obtained (43 and 45 t ha-1 yield, respectively). Hybrid cultivars showed better performance than open-pollinated cultivars in terms of yield. The Brasília, BRS Planalto, and Kuronan varieties showed poor performance in all the evaluated characteristics.",

The yacon culture has recently grown in popularity as it has high productive potential in mild climates and multiple benefits to human health. This study aimed to determine the lower and upper base temperatures, cycle duration, and thermal constant for the yacon culture, based on phenological data from field experiments that were carried out during three growing seasons (fall, winter, and spring) in 2013. The experiments were conducted in the municipality of Ibatiba in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, in a randomized block design with four replicates. The lower base temperature was determined using methods of the lowest standard deviation in days and degree-days, relative development, and variation coefficient in degree-days for two subperiods: emergence to maturation, and onset of tuberization to maturation. The upper base temperature was determined by the standard deviation and coefficient of variation methods, both in degrees-days. The relationship between meteorological elements and the onset of tuberization was also investigated. The lower base temperature values determined for yacon were 12.5ºC in the two subperiods studied with a base temperature above 34.0ºC. The productivity of these tuberous roots was higher in the fall because of the longer cycle, lower temperature, and lower photoperiod. In turn, a higher thermal sum was needed to initiate tuberization with the delay of planting.",

The objectives of this study were to identify the ideal traits for selecting common bean lines in the F3 generation to obtain an adequate sieve yield and to identify the best lines for sieve yield by applying early generation selection. Two trials were conducted in two locations during the 2016/2017 crop season. These trials were composed of 300 F3 populations and two parents (used as checks). The experimental design used was an augmented block design without repetition for the treatments (lineages). After harvest, the grain yield, yield components, and sieve yield (SY) were evaluated. In conclusion, selection in the F3 generation can be performed for sieve yield, considering the traits SY12+13, SY14, and relative grain yield, as they present the highest values of heritability and greatest correlation between genotype and performance in the evaluated environments. Additionally, the lines selected to continue in the breeding program are composed of the 15 best lineages for traits SY12+13, SY14, and relative grain yield. Preference should be given to lines that excel in more than one of these traits.",

During the 2005/2006 agricultural year, an assay was conducted in the wet and dry cropping seasons, at three IAPAR Experimental Stations, totaling six environments. Complete randomized blocks, with 20 genotypes and three replications were used. Each plot had two lines of 5 m, 0.5 m between rows, and 15 plants m-1. Number of days to flowering and physiological maturity of the grains and grain yield were assessed. The individual and combined analyses of variance indicated significant differences among genotypes, environments and for the G x A interaction, at 1 and 5% levels of probability, revealing that the evaluated genotypes performed differently according to the environment in which the tests were performed. The following lines were selected: LPSIA04-103, LPSIA04-104 LPSIA04-106 and LPSIA04-108. All lines showed precocity (shorter number of days to flowering and physiological maturity of the grains), high grain yield and wide adaptability.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to develop a hydrological model for the simulation of the water balance in agricultural areas. The model uses a double exponential equation to represent the rainfall profile and uses the Green-Ampt-Mein-Larson equation to estimate the soil water infiltration rate. To evaluate the model, monthly and yearly rainfall and runoff data were obtained from four experimental plots located at the State University of Santa Catarina, UDESC, in the period from 2003 to 2008. The four treatments were bare soil (BS), conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT). The simulation was carried out using two synthetic rainfall series, one adjusted on a monthly basis (SAMB) and the other adjusted on a daily basis (SADB). The parameters for the Green-Amp equation modified by Mein-Larson (GAML) were adjusted, and the best combination was found to be the replacement of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) by the constant infiltration rate (fc) and the estimation of the wetting front head pressure as a function of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturation zone (ψ(Kw)). There was not a significant difference between the observed annual mean runoff and the annual mean runoff estimated by the model.",

The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with two replications, in a split-split plot design. Six grasses (Xaraes, Mombaça, Tanzania, Pioneiro, Marandu and Estrela) constituted the plots, six irrigation depths (0, 18, 45, 77, 100 and 120% of the reference) the split-plots, and two seasons (autumn/winter and spring/summer) the split-split-plots. In order to vary the application of irrigation depths, a line source sprinkler system was used. The effect of the cultivars, annual seasons and irrigation depth in the two studied characteristics were analyzed. The Pioneiro grass presented the greatest height, while Estrela provided the largest soil cover. The higher temperature in the spring/summer season provided an increase in the height and did not affect soil cover. The soil cover answered positively to the increase in irrigation depth. During the autumn/winter season, the increase in irrigation depth provided an increase in height, and during the spring/summer season, and did not affect or reduce the height of the grasses.",

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the biological and agronomic productivity of plants grown under N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, and Zn deficiency. The results were compared with plants grown with all macro and micronutrients. Plants cultured without N and P completed their cycle, but had lower yield than those cultured with complete nutrition. Additionally, they had green-grayish leaves, and purple petiole and veins. Plants cultured without B died between 30 and 37 days after sowing, and without S they did not produce fruits. These results show the importance of S and B to this Brassicaceae.",

Nas espigas reduzidas, a produtividade foi afetada pelo estresse hidrico indicando que apos a antese o estresse pode aumentar a limitacao por causa de taxas mais altas de enchimento e translocacao de materia seca duas semanas apos a antese. Nas espigas reduzidas, o maior fornecimento de nitrogenio durante a antese elevou a produtividade porque maior translocacao de materia seca nao esta associada a maior fotossintese. O nivel mais alto de nitrogenio nao foi capaz de aumentar a translocacao quando todas as folhas, exceto a bandeira, foram removidas.

The common bean lines Golden Gate Wax (gene Ur-6) and Ouro Negro (gene Ur-ON) were crossed to obtain a F2 population, which was inoculated with race 29-3 of U. appendiculatus. Race 29-3 is incompatible with ‘Ouro Negro’ and compatible with ‘Golden Gate Wax’. Primary leaves of ten-days-old F2 plants were detached and inoculated by immersion into an inoculum suspension. Immediately following immersion, each F2 leaf was placed in a Petri dish containing a filter paper previously moistened with distilled water. These dishes were incubated in a BOD at 20°C, under a 12h daily light regime. The humidity in the dishes was maintained by addiction of 1.5 mL of distilled water in filter paper, under a three days regime. As control, the remaining primary leaves of ten-days-old F2 plants were inoculated using the conventional inoculation method. Both inoculation methods were efficient in evaluating the reaction of the common bean to U. appendiculatus. The resistance/susceptibility screening of the F2 population confirmed the monogenic dominant nature of the rust resistance controlled by the Ur-ON gene in both methods.",

A antecipação do manejo (40 DAS) permitiu redução no uso de herbicidas e melhor controle de Commelina benghalensis. Fomesafen (125 g i.a./ha), aos 19 dias depois da semeadura (DDS), viabilizou sistemas seqüenciais de manejo que atingiram elevados níveis de controle, sendo a sua seqüencial (19 DDS/ 27 DDS) satisfatória, mesmo quando o manejo não foi eficiente. M1 foi deficiente no controle de C. benghalensis, possibilitando substituir 2,4-D por seqüenciais de sulfosate/diquat ou sulfosate/(paraquat+diuron), tanto para Ipomoea grandifolia como para C. benghalensis",

The producer prices are above average from January to June and below it in the remaining months. The commercialization margins did not show trends of growth or decline in the period analyzed. Causality is from producer to wholesaler. The elasticity of price transmission was inferior to one, implying that, at moments of price rise at producer level, the margin of the wholesaler decreases, the opposite occurring in the case of a decrease in producer prices.",

OR 1 cultivar, on the other hand, was not recommended, since it presented the lowest productivity. Finally, results showed that treatment II presented better productivity than treatment I, probably because of its great percentage of organic matter, which, sometimes, can inhibit aluminum.

The treatments were the following: 5 and 30 seconds; 5 minutes; 1, 4, 8 and 12 hours in solution of 1000 mg L-1 of IBA. The experimental design was entirely randomized, with seven treatments, four replications and 12 cuttings for parcel. After the application of the IBA, the cuttings were placed in expanded polystyrene trays with 72 cells, with turf as substratum, and taken root in a greenhouse with intermittent mist. After 185 days the evaluation of the experiment was carried out. The fast immersion, for a period of 5 and 30 seconds in solution of 1000 mg L-1 of AIB, was statistically more favorable to the rooting of the cuttings, being statistically superior to the other times of immersion. The times of immersion longer than one hour presented phytotoxic effect. The 30-second immersion in a solution of 1000 mg L-1 of IBA is recommended for the herbaceous cuttings of young plants of the ‘Fuerte’ avocado.",

Two trials were carried out; in experiment one, excised shoots were randomly taken from “Caricia” and “Princesa”, and in experiment two, intact and excised shoots of “Caricia”, “Princesa” and “Gala” (control) were collected. After collection, both shoot types were exposed to artificial chilling accumulation (4.0 ± 0.5°C) from 0 to 1200 chill units (CU). Bud break of mixed buds of “Caricia” and “Princesa” was higher than 50% between 0 CU to 1200 CU, irrespective of shoot type. Bud break of “Gala” mixed buds exceeded 50% only in intact shoots after accumulating 900 CU. The mean time to bud break of “Caricia” and “Princesa” diminished with increasing chilling accumulation and stabilized after ~600 CU, depending on the type of shoot and the year of experimentation. The low-chill apple cultivars tested in this work showed shallow dormancy, but they required moderate cold accumulation (800 – 1150 CU) to fully satisfy their chilling requirements. Thus, although their shallow dormancy makes them suitable for cultivation in chill-deficient environments, they cannot be considered low-chill cultivars.",

The use of resistant genotypes plays an important role in the management and control of the disease and is the most environmentally sustainable approach to disease control. Citrus canker incidence was recorded in an experiment on nine genotypes of the sweet orange variety ‘Pera’ grafted on four rootstocks. The experiment was started in 2010 and the incidence of citrus canker on the leaves was recorded on a quarterly basis. The incidence data from the experiment were analyzed using a zero-inflated Beta regression model (RBIZ), which is the appropriate method to describe data with large numbers of zeros. Based on the residual analysis, the data fit the model well. The discrete component of the explanatory variable, rootstock, was not significant as a factor affecting the onset of disease, in contrast with the continuous component, genotype, which was significant in explaining the incidence of citrus canker.",

The scale was constructed to increase assessment efficiency and align the estimations more closely with the actual values. Two assessments with the diagrammatic scale and one without were conducted with an interval of seven days. The evaluators using the proposed scale presented estimates with better levels of precision, accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability than those using a conventional method. The proposed diagrammatic scale was shown to provide a reliable estimate for assessing the symptoms of heat injury on the canopy of in Coffea arabica L. seedlings. Therefore, it is possible to standardize heat injury evaluation methods using this diagrammatic scale, allowing for data comparisons with different cultivars.",

The F1 (winter 2016), RC1 (summer 2016/2017), and RC2 (winter 2017) populations were developed through emasculation and pollination procedures. In the winter of 2018, segregating populations were evaluated in the field using a randomized block design. In the three generations developed in a greenhouse, it was observed that the best crossbreeding combinations, verified by the number of grains, were obtained with the male parent BRS 179. Under field conditions, all segregating populations were considered moderately susceptible and susceptible to type II resistance. In type III resistance, all segregating populations, except for CIGM90.909/BRS 179 and BRS 179, showed values above 50%. Thus, it was evident that the crossings performed with the male parent BRS 179 generated better resistance to the disease.",

The application of the adjuvant showed toxicity, causing damage to the skin of the fruit. The fruit with the greatest symmetry had the lowest levels of soluble solids and the highest toxicity. The application of growth regulators associated with hand pollination was not efficient, presenting a low percentage of fruit fixation for Annonaceae cultivars. None of the studied treatments produced parthenocarpic fruit (without seeds).

Most of the information on clubroot control is derived from studies in temperate regions. Here, management strategies were evaluated to reduce broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck) crop losses owing to clubroot in tropical mountain regions. The first experiment revealed the effect of green manure from coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), sweet corn (Zea mays L.), and spontaneous vegetation (control) associated with broccoli seedlings of 4 different sizes. In the second experiment, the effect of soil amendments (limestone and steel slag) in conjunction with poultry litter (fresh or composted for 45 days) and without poultry litter (control), was assessed. Both field experiments sought to evaluate the disease intensity, plant development (root growth, biomass, and nutrient accumulation), and yield. Sunn hemp and coriander biomass resulted in higher healthy root volumes and dry weights of broccoli. However, such benefits were not derived from corn treatment. Compared to smaller seedlings (10 mL cell and 20 days of age, and 16 mL cell and 24 days of age), the use of larger seedlings (35 mL cell and 28 days of age, and 50 mL cell and 32 days of age) resulted in lower intensity of clubroot and increased the average yield by 143% in summer crops. Steel slag, like limestone, corrected soil acidity and resulted in plant growth; however, clubroot intensity was not significantly affected. Fresh and composted poultry litter increased the percentage of diseased roots compared with the control; however, broccoli yield was not affected by the treatments. Using green manure (sunn hemp or coriander) and well-developed seedlings is recommended as a strategy to reduce losses induced by clubroot during broccoli cultivation.",

The experiment was carried out in a screened environment at the Western Paraná State University (Unioeste), Campus of Marechal Cândido Rondon, Paraná State, Brazil. Atemoya grafts (Thompson, African Pride, and Gefner) were collected from plants from the CATI seedling nursery, located in São Bento do Sapucaí, São Paulo State, Brazil. Grafting was performed using 1-year-old araticum rootstocks with 8–10 mm in diameter at a height of 15 cm from the ground and grafts measuring, on average, 8.5 cm in length, 10 mm in diameter, and three buds. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement (three grafting methods: cleft graft, whip and tongue graft, and chip budding × three cultivars: African Pride, Thompson, and Gefner), with four replications and 10 seedlings per replication, totaling 40 seedlings per treatment. The percentage of graft success (%), percentage of sprouting (%), number of sprouts, number of leaves, and longest sprout length (cm) were assessed at 60 days after grafting. The cleft graft method is efficient for producing atemoya seedlings. The cultivar African Pride can be grafted onto rootstocks by the cleft graft and whip and tongue graft methods, as they promote a higher percentage of graft success. The Annona sylvatica rootstock has potential for the production of atemoya seedlings, but chip budding is not viable.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of genomic selection (GS) in plant and animal breeding programs has led to the development of software that fits models based on unique scenarios. Accordingly, several R packages have been developed for GS. The lmekin function from the coxme R package was one of the first functions implemented in R to fit models with random family effects using the pedigree–based relationship matrix. The function allows the user to provide the covariance structures for the random effects; thus, the GBLUP model can be fitted. This fitting process consists of replacing, in the traditional BLUP model, the additive relationship matrix derived from a pedigree by the additive relationship matrix derived from markers. Thus, the objective of this study was to employ the lmekin function in the context of genomic prediction by comparing the results of this function with those obtained using five R packages for GS: rrBLUP, BGLR, sommer, lme4qtl, and lme4GS. The comparisons were performed considering the computational times and predicted values for a wheat dataset and simulated big data. In addition, we implemented a 5-fold cross-validation scheme through considering the values predicted by the lmekin function for the wheat dataset. The results indicated that the lmekin function was effective in predicting genomic breeding values considering multiple random effects and relatively small sample sizes. The rrBLUP package processed the fastest for the scenario with only one genetic random effect, and the high temporal efficiency of the sommer package was confirmed for the scenario with more than one genetic random effect. Differences in computational times occurred because of the different algorithms implemented in the packages to estimate the variance components.",

The data were simulated and composed of 2,025 individuals from two generations and 435 markers randomly distributed across five chromosomes. The simulated phenotypes presented symmetrical, skewed, positive, and negative distributions. Data were analyzed using RQR considering nine quantiles (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and traditional methods of genomic selection (specifically, RR-BLUP, BLASSO, BayesA, and BayesB). In general, RQR-based estimation of the GEBV was efficient—at least for a quantile model, the results obtained were more accurate than those obtained by the other evaluated methodologies. Specifically, in the symmetrical-distribution scenario, the highest accuracy values were obtained for the parameters with the models RQR0.4, RQR0.3, and RQR0.4. For positive skewness, the models RQR0.2, RQR0.3, and RQR0.1 presented higher accuracy values, whereas for negative skewness, the best model was RQR0.9. Finally, the GEBV vectors obtained by RQR facilitated the construction of genomic growth curves at different levels of interest (quantiles), illustrating the weight–age relationship.",

The experiment was carried out in the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 growing seasons. The fruit were evaluated at harvest and after eight months of CA-ELO (0.5 kPa O2 + &lt;0.5 kPa CO2/1.5 ± 0.2°C/92 ± 2% RH) storage, at chamber opening, and after 7 days of shelf-life at 23 ± 3°C and 60 ± 5% RH. The quality of the fruit was evaluated through of soluble solids, flesh firmness, titratable acidity, fruit color, and physiological disorder incidence (sunburn and flesh browning), in addition to enzymatic activity and concentration of functional compounds. There was no significant effect of the summer pruning time on fruit flesh firmness, soluble solids, titratable acidity, and rot incidence after storage under CA-ELO plus 7 days of shelf life. Summer pruning in February resulted in fruit with higher peel red color development, which in general contains a higher concentration of functional compounds at harvest (total phenolic compounds and total antioxidant activity), and lower flesh browning incidence in ‘Fuji’ apples stored under CA-ELO. The nitrogen (N) concentration and nitrogen/calcium ratio (N/Ca) in the second growing season were lower in fruit from plants pruned in February, compared to no summer pruning or earlier pruning. The superoxide dismutase and peroxidase enzyme activity were lower in fruit from treatments with summer pruning in January and February, whereas the polyphenol oxidase enzyme activity was lower when summer pruning was conducted in February.",

    "abstract": "Cotesia flavipes parasitizes Diatraea saccharalis, a pest that causes major losses to sugarcane production. The mass production of C. flavipes and its subsequent release onto sugarcane is one form of biological control of D. saccharalis. An essential factor for successfully fighting this pest is the development of host diets that can increase the efficiency of C. flavipes production. Palm oil contains saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated linoleic acid. However, little is known about the effects of palm oil on C. flavipes production in the laboratory. Different concentrations of palm oil were added to the D. saccharalis diet and its nutritional indices were analyzed. Subsequently, the production and sex ratio of C. flavipes were determined. Our results indicated that the addition of higher palm oil concentrations to an artificial diet generated a high relative consumption rate (RCR) in D. saccharalis, and consequently a high relative metabolic rate (RMR), which resulted in a lower production of the parasitoid. In contrast, the lowest palm oil concentration in the artificial diet generated a low RMR and resulted in high-efficiency conversion of ingested food (ECI), enabling D. saccharalis to yield more C. flavipes. This suggests that palm oil influences the quantity of D. saccharalis ingested, which determines the number of C. flavipes that will be generated. In this study, supplementation of a D. saccharalis diet with 0.25% palm oil increased the production of C. flavipes. Therefore, this level of palm oil supplementation can aid in the production of C. flavipes on a laboratory-scale. Further research, including increasing the number of parasitoids, must be performed to mass-produce the augmentative releases of C. flavipes to manage D. saccharalis.",

The objective was to compare rootstock varieties combined with this scion to identify those with the best agronomic performance and precocity of production, in addition to Phytophthora gummosis resistance. The experiment was carried out in Capitão Poço, northeast region of Pará, and the following seven rootstock genotypes were evaluated: ‘Sunki Tropical’, ‘BRS O S Passos’, ‘BRS Bravo’, ‘BRS Donadio’, ‘Citrandarin Indio’, ‘BRS Matta’, and ‘LVK x LCR-038’. A randomized block experimental design was used, with three replications and 10 plants per plot. The evaluated characteristics were: plant height (m); crown volume (m3); number of ripe fruit per plant; total yield of ripened fruit per plant (kg plant-1); cumulative fruit yield (fruit kg plant-1); and average productive efficiency (fruit kg m-3 of crown). The average productive efficiency was high. For early selection, the best rootstocks in terms of yield, stability and adaptability were Sunki Tropical, BRS O S Passos, and Cintradarin Indio. The fruit number had the greatest direct effect on fruit yield, and crown pruning was directly harmful. Further studies to understand the complex interaction of G x E for BRS Donadio and Sunki Tropical should be carried out.",

    "abstract": "Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) can be transmitted by several aphid species in a semi-persistent mode, with Toxoptera citricida being the most efficient vector. In Brazil, mild CTV isolates are used for pre-immunization of citrus trees against severe isolates. We aimed to determine the capacity and efficiency of T. citricida in separating the viral complex into haplotypes from three well-characterized CTV isolates (PIAC, CS1, and Forte Rolândia). Single-aphid transmission assays were conducted to determine CTV transmission efficiency. The results showed that T. citricida transmitted only haplotypes from the PIAC and CS1 isolates, with efficiencies of 8 and 4%, respectively. Both isolates caused mild CTV symptoms in Brazil. However, isolate Forte Rolândia, which causes severe symptoms in citrus trees, was not transmitted by T. citricida. The detection of CTV haplotypes from PIAC and CS1 isolates in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) plants after a single aphid transmission occurred at different time points. The first haplotype observed was from PIAC 150 days after citrus was challenged by a single aphid, followed by CS1 at day 210 after transmission. In addition, differences in the single-strand conformation polymorphism patterns between the CTV isolates and CTV haplotypes were determined, suggesting that an aphid can acquire and transmit only one CTV haplotype to citrus plants during phloem feeding. The study of the mechanism of transmission by the vector can increase our knowledge of the interactions among hosts, vectors, and pathogens, which are often neglected.",

    "abstract": "This work aimed to estimate the genetic diversity in accessions of Opuntia ficus-indica collected in 13 regions of the semiarid region of Bahia. A total of 65 accessions were evaluated in a randomized complete block design, with three replications, at the Rio Seco experimental station belonging to the State University of Feira de Santana, Amélia Rodrigues-BA. Characterization of the accessions was made through the evaluation of 17 descriptors, namely 11 agronomic and six bromatological. The average Euclidean distance was used to estimate the genetic diversity among accessions. The shortest distances were obtained for accessions from the same collection site while the largest were observed in accessions 54 and 62 (10.32 DE) and 63 and 3 (10.22 DE). The analysis of canonical variables indicated cladodes total number (CTN), plant width (PW), CL, plant height (PH), ether extract (EE), and dry weight (DW) for discard as they presented the lowest contribution of the data set variation. Principal component analysis and K-means method were used to establish the clusters, and the formation of four groups was indicated. The first two principal components captured 52.5% of the total variation present in accessions. The descriptors with the greatest contribution to the variation observed in O. ficus-indica were total cladode photosynthetic area (TCPA), cladode area (CA), and cladodes width (CW). There is divergence between cactus forage accessions collected in the semiarid region of Bahia. This information will allow the use of these materials for the formation of segregating populations in the genetic improvement program of the State University of Feira de Santana. The accessions of groups III and IV should be explored by the forage cactus breeding program, as they presented greater productive potential.",

The study consisted of 20 experiments: 12 evaluated 10 hybrids of honeydew melons and 8 evaluated 13 hybrids of yellow melons. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three replicates. Analysis of variance was performed to estimate the repeatability and genotypic determination coefficients. Variability in accurately predicting the genotype was observed for different number of repetitions between the evaluated characters and melon types. In the yellow melon, experiments with three repetitions allowed the accurate identification of superior genotypes with 81.1 and 61.9% certainty for productivity and soluble solids, respectively. In the honeydew melon, 62.4 and 71.2% accuracy was obtained for productivity and soluble solids, respectively.",

This study simulated C and N stocks and their compartments in a crop-livestock-forest integration system in the edafoclimatic conditions of the Maranhão Cerrado using the Century 4.5 model. The evaluated areas were native Cerrado vegetation (NV) and crop-livestock-forest integration (CLFI). The calibration process gradually modified the model parameters to better fit the simulated and observed soil C and N stocks. The best fit between the data was obtained after changes in the main parameters (DEC3(2), DEC4, and DEC5) that controlled the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter. C and N stocks increased by 14% and 15%, respectively, over 14 years after replacing NV with CLFI. The slow compartment of C presented greater sensitivity to changes in management, with an increase of 47% compared with that of NV. The active compartment increased by 31% and the passive compartment remained constant for over 14 years. Future scenarios, where pasture was maintained between the eucalyptus trees and the scenario that allowed the soybean, corn, and Brachiaria rotation between the trees, were more effective, accumulating approximately 37 Mg C ha-1. The continuous contribution of residues from the trees and pasture increased C and N stocks in the long-term in the slow fraction, where the total organic carbon increased from 32 to 36 Mg ha-1 when NV was replaced with CLFI. The model predicted the C and N stocks with accuracies ranging from 1 to 11% of the observed values",

    "abstract": "Fig orchard expansion requires knowledge of the thermal requirements of genotypes available in different climatic regions. The budburst of fig cultivars was assessed by biological single-node cutting and exposure to artificial chilling. Cuttings from five cultivars were collected during two crop seasons, subsequently packaged in a horizontal position in a cold chamber (8 ± 0.5ºC), and artificially chilled for 0, 40, 80, 120, and 160h. Cuttings were preserved under controlled conditions (23 ± 1°C, RH 85%, and 16h photoperiod). The variables evaluated were the budding velocity, average time and final rate of sprouting, vigorous shoot rate, and average time to leaf opening. The single-node cutting test allowed the assessment of dormancy, which is influenced by the accumulation of chilling in each crop season. The average time and final budding rate varied depending on the temperature requirements for budding. The cultivars were classified on an increasing scale according to their chilling requirements as follows: Pingo de Mel &lt; Roxo de Valinhos &lt; Brown Turkey &lt; White Genova &lt; Troyano. The traditional cultivar in Brazil is Roxo de Valinhos, but all of the cultivars studied had the potential to diversify the fig orchards in this region.",

The results showed an interaction between the different means of culture, temperatures and photoperiods. The mean of culture that best stimulated mycelial growth was CDA at 25ºC under the 12-hour photoperiod. The greatest spore (conidia) production was verified in PDA at 20ºC in the 12-hour photoperiod. There was no sporing of any isolate in the CDA mean of culture.

    "abstract": "This work aimed at evaluating yield capacity and gross income of Folhas amarelas chicory in five periods of cut, and of Brasilia carrot under monocropped system with three (33.3 cm) or four (25.0 cm) rows per plot (100 cm of wide) or intercropped with three rows of chicory (Al3C4) and four rows of carrot (Al4C3) and viceversa. Harvests of chicory were performed 63, 103, 143, 183 and 223 days after sowing and that of carrot in 103 days. Curves of height of chicory plants were quadratic with 23 cm for minimum point, which was reached in 170 days after sowing. The number of leaves of chicory plants was higher in monocropped system being the maximum number of 350 leaves m2 in 164 days, under four rows, and the smallest number was for Al3C4 (195 leaves m2). The highest yields of fresh mass of chicory were under monocropped system, under four rows, in the second period of harvest, while the smallest ones were with Al3C4. For carrots, the use of four rows per plot influenced significantly the total root and commercially big root yields, in monocropped as well as in intercropped system. Land Equivalent Ratios were higher than 1.0 in the second harvest, performed in 103 days. For the chicory producer, the intercropped system was economically viable only in the second harvest with Al4C3 treatment. For the carrot producer, both intercropped systems were viable, although Al4C3 was the best.",

It is desirable to develop reliable and portable techniques to properly assess the water uptake of agricultural crops. An experiment was conducted in the IAC/Jundiaí, state of São Paulo aiming to achieve such developments. An integrated system based on heat pulse technique was designed and built in order to assess water uptake. Different probe configurations were tested, aiming to find the best sensor profile for field usage. Field and laboratory grown maize were used to calibrate the system. Testing the system on maize stems resulted in a coherent relationship between heat transport and sap flux, for two of the sensor configurations tested. Field results of water uptake determination, obtained comparatively with standard methodology, agreed with the daily-paired data and yielded reasonable values based on statistical Willmot index.",

Those villages were chosen for their distinct characteristics of proximity to urban areas. In order to characterize the current socioeconomic situation, several field surveys were performed. The results showed that, due to multi-practice activities, the pluriactivity income increased in Lageado and decreased in Roseira. Regarding the pluriactivity income, the income from agricultural and cattle raising activities represented only 5.71% in Lageado and 11.26% in Roseira. Therefore, it seems that the greatest influence in the socioeconomic results of the families is directly related to the distance between urban and agricultural areas.",

The pre-compression pressure has been used as a procedure for estimating the susceptibility of the soil compaction. The contribution of aggregate size of the soil as well as the effect of water content on soil compaction was investigated in a clay soil during this trial. Disturbed soil samples constituted by aggregated inferior to 2.5 mm A1 and 9.3 to 19.4 mm A2 were submitted to a drained uniaxial compression test. The compression index and pre-compression stress and the behavior of the water content were evaluated. The soil compression index decreased with the increase of aggregate size, showing that the virgin compression lines were parallels only with the values of the soil A2. The pre-compression stress values increased with the reduction of aggregate size and the soil water content. The results of the voids ratios in function of the threshold water content reflect with bigger precision, in soil A2, the regions of the soil behavior to the compaction with all the applied pressures.",

The characteristics evaluated included the number of fallen leaves at 20 and 70 days after application, total leaf dry mass and foliar degreening. The effects of different concentrations and times of application of ethrel were significant during the first seven days. Ethrel application during the second period of vegetative development did not affect the number of fallen leaves over a period of 70 days.",

This study aimed to identify the changes in the reserve metabolites of A. angustifolia seeds throughout storage in order to understand the processes of hydrolysis caused by germination metabolism. Mature seeds were harvested in southern Brazil and stored in an ambient environment and cold chamber conditions. Biochemical analyses were performed for embryos and megagametophytes from seeds stored for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 90 days. Due to seeds being in advanced germination in storage, they were evaluated at 90 days in different early developmental categories: I – seeds with mature embryos, II – seeds with embryos showing apparent elongation along the embryonic axis, and III – seeds with root protrusion. Higher contents of carbohydrate, protein, and amino acids were observed in embryos compared to megagametophytes, and these metabolites were decreased after onset of germination, especially in the embryo tissue. Mobilization of metabolites in megagametophytes would probably increase in later stages of germination. It is suggested that such alterations are not due to deterioration of reserve components, but instead are based on seed metabolism, which remains active after harvest with hydrolysis of metabolites providing energy for germination.",

This study aimed to assess protein, carbohydrate and global DNA methylation (GDM) level dynamics during NCs induction from Vriesea reitzii seeds. Seeds were inoculated into Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium supplemented with 4 µM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) to induce NCs and in culture medium without plant growth regulators to form normal seedlings. Samples collected at 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days of culture were analyzed. All parameters assessed showed the same variation pattern. However, seeds inducing NCs showed significantly lower starch (6.0 mg g-1 FM), carbohydrate (10.7 mg g-1 FM) and GDM (11.0%) levels than seeds forming normal seedlings after 21 days in culture. On the other hand, the protein content (9.1 mg g-1 FM) was significantly higher during induction. NCs induction process through seeds is the result of gene reprogramming in the explant, which leads to morphological, biochemical and metabolic alterations. This involves dedifferentiation, high cell proliferation, high energy demand and protein synthesis, which is related to elevated metabolic activity.",

A dissimilarity matrix was generated by Mahalanobis generalized distance (D²), and clusters were identified by the UPGMA method. It was possible to verify the formation of 8 dissimilar groups based on morphological characters and 5 groups based on morphometric characters, indicating the presence of genetic diversity among accessions. The evaluated morphometric variable with the greatest relative contribution was the length between the central lobe. Based on the dissimilarity matrix, the accessions 16 x 48 were the most genetically distant accessions, followed by 47 x 49.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the productive characteristics, gas exchange and water use efficiency of the banana 'Prata-Anã' clone Gorutuba under different irrigation intervals associated with different emitter heights. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme: two irrigation intervals (daily and every two days) and four emitter heights (50, 70, 90, and 110 cm) in a completely randomized design with four replicates. The irrigation depths applied by the microsprinkler irrigation system were calculated as a function of crop evapotranspiration. The gas exchanges were evaluated during the period of greatest climatic stress, and the productive characteristics were evaluated at harvest. The economic water use efficiency was determined indirectly by considering the production divided by the applied irrigation depth, which was the same in all the treatments. The instantaneous water use efficiency was estimated with an infrared gas analyzer in the critical climatic period. There was no interaction between the irrigation intervals and emitter heights. The two-day irrigation interval resulted in lower values of leaf temperature and photosynthetically active radiation incident on the leaves, resulting in a higher fruit weight and, consequently, higher yields and a higher water use efficiency. The highest fruit weights were obtained at heights of 70 and 90 cm.",

    "abstract": "The high price of rice hybrid seeds is one of the major limiting factors for increasing the use of this technology. An important step toward minimizing high rice hybrid seed cost is developing techniques that help improve hybrid seed yield. Our goal was to determine the proportion of seeds of line A (receptor) and line R (pollinator) that, under mixed sowing, would allow optimized rice hybrid seed production and grain quality. Trials were performed for two growing seasons in the southern region of Brazil. The cultivar INTA Puita was used as a pollinator and line 464 A as receptor. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications. Treatments included six proportions of seeds of the INTA Puita (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, and 24.00%) mixture with seeds of line 464 A (99.25, 98.50, 97.00, 94.00, 88.00, and 76%, respectively). By increasing the percentage of the pollinator seeds (INTA Puita CL) from 0.75 to 24% in the mixture with the receptor (line 464 A), we increased yield of INTA Puita CL grains (7 to 2676 kg ha-1) and hybrid seeds (279 to 1493 kg ha-1). The mixture of different proportions of INTA Puita CL (pollinator) with the receptor (line 464 A) did not change the rice grain quality or the production cost. The cost of production per kg of hybrid seeds decreased quadratically with the increasing percentage of the pollinator (INTA Puita CL), from US$ 6.71 to US$ 1.23. Revenue achieved from the commercialization of the grains of INTA Puita CL with hybrid seeds 464 A showed quadratic increases with the increased percentage of INTA Puita cl in the mixture. Our results showed a potential technique that could be used to improve hybrid seed production, reduce cost per kg of hybrid seed and improve revenue from producing rice hybrid seeds.",

Experimental unity was a vase with 2kg of soil and one plant of lettuce. The replacement of water occurred when the mass of water evapotranspiration of each treatment reached 50% of the water retention capacity. Within the greenhouse was also measured the evaporation by a pan (evaporimeter) with 60cm diameter and 25cm height. The lettuce evapotranspiration was influenced by water and nitrogen treatment. Lettuce evapotranspiration was linearly affected by nitrogen and quadratic affected by water levels. If soil water is no limiting, lettuce evapotranspiration decreases when nitrogen level increases.",

The goal of this study was to assess the effects of irrigated cropping systems and sowing seasons on cowpea yield and profitability in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. Field studies were performed in four experiments during the rainy and dry seasons during 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, which denoted harvests 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A randomized block design was used for each experiment with four replicates and the following treatments for cropping systems: (1) manual weeding; (2) liming and manual weeding; (3) liming and phosphorus (P) fertilization at sowing, nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) topdressing fertilization, and chemical weed control; (4) liming and P fertilization at sowing, K topdressing fertilization, rhizobia inoculation, and chemical weed control; (5) liming and P fertilization at sowing, N and K topdressing fertilization, rhizobia inoculation, and chemical weed control; and (6) seed pretreatment with cobalt (Co) and molybdenum (Mo), liming and P fertilization at sowing, N and K topdressing fertilization, rhizobia inoculation, and chemical weed control. The technology added to cropping systems increased the number of pods per plant, pod length, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight, irrespective of the rainy or dry sowing season. Economic analysis, in turn, showed that the technology decreased the total operating cost despite increasing the cost of mechanical operations, inputs, and materials because of the replacement of manual weeding by chemical weed control. However, these costs were not influenced by the sowing seasons. We concluded that technologically enhanced cropping systems, especially systems 4 and 6, improved grain yield and provided greater profitability, which translated into improved economic benefits for farmers. Conversely, the sowing season influenced profitability, which was higher for dry season harvests, when there was less product offered and prices became higher.",

The tolerance of forage cactus to water and salt deficit makes it a promising solution, in particular Nopalea cochenillifera. The growth curves for species facing these conditions can provide useful information supporting the cultivation and management of natural populations and carry significant biological importance as growth rate assessment contributes to maintaining species viability. The objective of this study was to estimate the plant height and linear dimensions (length, width, and thickness) of N. cochenillifera Giant Sweet clone growing under water and saline stress. The experiment design was completely randomized, comprising a 4 × 4 factorial, with four water and four salinity levels; there were four replications. In order to estimate plant height in N. cochenillifera Giant Sweet clone as a function of the accumulated thermal sum, generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) were used to determine water level, saline level, length, width, and thickness. We constructed models using four distributions: the Weibull, Gumbel, Logistic, and Box-Cox power exponential distributions. The models were evaluated using global deviation and the generalized Akaike criterion. The Box–Cox power exponential proved to be the most effective in estimating N. cochenillifera height. This model enabled information relevant to practical environmental management to be obtained, as it precisely defined the optimum salt application and the required amount of replacement water, together with the cladode width for each plant growth stage using the accumulated thermal sum.",

Curing is known to increase the resistance of tubers to excoriation injury, with the temperature influencing the traumatic phellogen and periderm regeneration, as well as tuber processing quality. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of excoriation procedure and curing temperature on the industrial quality, histological characteristics, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxidative enzyme activity of potato tuber. Tubers with or without excoriation were cured at 8, 14, and 20°C for 15 days. Excoriation did not influence the levels of reducing sugars (RS), as well as polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities. The concentrations of total soluble sugars (TSS) and non-reducing sugars (NRS) were higher in injured tubers, while reduction in curing temperature increased the concentrations of TSS, NRS, and RS. However, the sugar content was adequate as per the criteria of the pre-fried potato industry and potatoes classified in category 2 (USDA/fast-food industry color grading). The reduction in curing temperature also increased the activity of POD, despite the activity of PPO remaining unchanged. Formation of a closure layer from the outer parenchyma cells of the tuber that prevents desiccation and death of superficial cells, was observed. This protection was completed with the formation of the damage periderm. Periderm regeneration is faster at higher temperatures, 15 and 20°C, leading to a lower fresh mass loss and no enzymatic or non-enzymatic browning. The excoriation carried out at 14/20oC for 15 days was sufficient for curing, and for maintaining suitable post-fry quality of potatoes.",

    "abstract": "The management of weeds in melon is hindered by the slow initial growth of the crop, favouring weed infestation and reducing production. During the years 2016 and 2017, weed interference periods were evaluated in two melon hybrids, yellow and frog skin, to determine the time of weed control in the crop. Four-parameter logistic regression was used to determine the critical weed control period (CPWC). The weed species with the highest occurrences in 2016 were Merremia aegyptia, Senna obtusifolia, and Urochloa plantaginea. In 2017, there was a predominance of M. aegyptia, indicating the possibility of successive cultivation, favouring the predominance of species with growth habits similar to melons. The increase in the period of living with weeds reduced the productivity and quality of melon fruits. Coexistence with weeds throughout the cycle reduced productivity by about 50%. The CPWC was 15 to 58 and 10 to 45 for frog skin and 12 to 52 and 4 to 50 days for yellow melon in 2016 and 2017, respectively, considering a productivity loss of 5%. These results underscore the importance of adopting strategies that allow melons to grow free from the presence of weeds, especially before they are fully established in the growing area.",

Inside the protected environment, it is essential to study the physiological responses of plants to the wavelength, periodicity, intensity, and direction of light in the photosynthetic process. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different intensities of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) used as an extended photoperiod in a greenhouse on the production of basil seedlings. A completely randomized design, in a 2 × 4 factorial scheme, with four replications of 20 seedlings per plot was used. Two basil varieties, sweet basil (green color) and purple basil (purple color), were evaluated under three intensities of supplementary PAR, which were 375, 411, and 438 µmol m-2 s-1, and control, in the absence of supplementary PAR. The seedling height, stem diameter, shoot dry matter, root dry matter, total dry matter, leaf area, ratio between plant height and stem diameter, ratio between plant height and shoot dry matter, ratio between shoot dry matter and root dry matter, and Dickson quality index were evaluated. Results show that higher intensities of PAR used as an extended photoperiod favor the quality of basil seedlings produced in a protected environment.",

A completely randomized design consisting of 13 treatments was used for resistance or susceptibility testing. The bacterial suspension was inoculated and the following were assessed: disease severity, 16 days after inoculation; area under the disease progress curve, calculated separately at 4, 8, 12, and 16 days after inoculation as well as the sum of data calculated on all the assessment days; and the disease resistance class. The genotypes UFU 215#1 and UFU 215#2 had significantly high carotenoid concentrations. The genotypes UFU 66#4, UFU 215#1, and UFU 215#7 showed high bolt resistance. All genotypes were classified as resistant or moderately resistant to the P. carotovorum isolate, UFU A7.",

    "abstract": "The selectivity and efficacy of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PROTOX) inhibitor herbicides in cassava varieties depend on product formulation, dosage, and soil texture. The aim of this study was to assess the selectivity and efficacy of flumioxazin and sulfentrazone in the cassava variety ‘IPR B36’ and the clone ‘VN 117’. Two experiments were carried out: one in a clayey soil and one in a sandy soil. Both experiments were laid in a split-plot randomized block design with three replicates. The two cassava varieties were used as main plots, with subplots consisting in 10 treatments including, flumioxazin at 50, 75, 100, and 125 g ha-1; sulfentrazone at 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g ha-1; one weed-free control, and one unweeded control. Flumioxazin (≥75 g ha-1) and sulfentrazone (≥250 g ha-1) achieved mean weed control rates &gt; 70 and 90% in both types of soil for up to 90 days after application. Flumioxazin exhibited fewer residual effects on the cassava varieties than sulfentrazone, particularly in clayey soil. Flumioxazin was selective to the different cassava varieties planted in both soil types, whereas sulfentrazone was more selective in clayey soil. PROTOX inhibitors were effective in controlling weed growth in cassava plots, and there were no varietal differences in herbicide selectivity; however, the use of sulfentrazone should be restricted to maximum spray rates of 250 g ha-1 in sandy soils.",

    "abstract": "Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. is a pioneer plant native from Brazil that has great importance due to its secondary metabolites (essential oil and Brazilian green propolis) and its potential in the recovery of degraded areas. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the propagation techniques of B. dracunculifolia by sexual reproduction and asexual propagation of male and female stem cuttings. For reproduction, female individuals from a natural population were periodically monitored for their reproductive development and their diaspores were collected to evaluate the maximum dry mass accumulation to determine physiological maturity. The germination test was performed by testing four temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 20–30°C), in addition to the germination speed index (GSI) and first count. For vegetative propagation, stem cuttings (8 cm) of male and female individuals were treated with an indole butyric acid (IBA) solution at 0, 1,500, 3,000, 4,500, and 6,000 mg L−1. The cuttings were evaluated for mortality, survival, rooting, sprouting, leaf retention, callogenesis, number of roots, and average length of roots (cm) after 120 days. The physiological maturity of diaspores occurred at 40 days after anthesis, which was the best time for collection in the field. The temperatures of 25 or 20–30°C should be used in the germination tests of the species. The first count was identified four days after sowing and the last count after 11 days. The rooting of B. dracunculifolia cuttings is very low. Sex did not influence the evaluated parameters, but increasing IBA doses positively influenced rooting, number of roots, and average length of roots and negatively influenced calluses formation.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the application of shear strength and its correlations with leaf blade morphological and chemical variables as a tool capable of detecting differences between species and accessions of the genus Paspalum in the early stages of a forage plant breeding programme. A total of 13 Paspalum accessions from two species (Paspalum atratum and Paspalum regnellii) were subjected to analyses of shear strength, which also analysed the neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, lignin, and digestibility. Morphological measurements were also performed to standardize the shear strength per unit of leaf tissue. The experimental design consisted of complete randomized blocks, with four replications and eight cuts performed over 2 years. Shear strength was evaluated for its potential usefulness for detecting differences between accessions of the same species and the correlations of accessions. It was possible to use the shear strength measured with the texturometer to detect differences between species and accessions of the Paspalum genus. The results showed significant correlations of shear strength and neutral detergent fibre (r = 0.49), and negative correlations were found between digestibility and shear strength (r = -0.55). These correlations were maintained when the strength variables were standardized according to the morphological variables. Thus, shear strength can be used in the initial stages of the selection of species of the genus Paspalum.",

Plant tissue samples were collected from seven producing areas and the DNA was extracted using the CTAB method. Amplifications were performed by direct PCR using the MpKFI/MpKRI primers, then the PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Amplicons of 350 bp were observed in stem tissue samples from three areas. The identity of the samples was confirmed by sequencing. This study represents the first molecular diagnosis of M. phaseolina associated with watermelon in Northeastern Brazil.

The development of predictive emergence models can contribute to optimizing weed management. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an empirical emergence model of Italian ryegrass based on soil thermal time. For model development, cumulative emergence in two locations was obtained, and the model was validated with data collected in an experiment conducted independently. Three commonly used emergence models were compared (Gompertz, Logistic, and Weibull). The relationship between emergence and soil thermal time was described best by the Gompertz model. The Gompertz model predicted Italian ryegrass emergence start at 300 thermal time (TT), reaching 50% emergence at 444 TT, and 90% at 590 TT. Model validation performed well in predicting Italian ryegrass emergence and proved to be efficient at describing its emergence. This is a potential predictive tool for assisting farmers with Italian ryegrass management.",

    "abstract": "Accurate forest biomass estimates require the selection of appropriate models of individual trees. Thus, two properties are required in tree biomass modeling: (1) additivity of biomass components and (2) estimator efficiency. This study aimed to develop a system of equations to estimate young eucalyptus aboveground biomass and guarantee additivity and estimator efficiency. Aboveground eucalyptus biomass models were calibrated using four methods: generalized least squares (GLS), weighted least squares (WLS), seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), and weighted seemingly unrelated regression (WSUR). The approaches were compared with regard to performance, additivity, and estimator efficiency. The methods did not differ with regard to the mean biomass estimation; therefore, their performance was similar. The GLS and WLS approaches did not satisfy the additivity principle, as the sum of the biomass components was not equal to total biomass. However, this was not observed with the SUR and WSUR approaches. With regard to estimator efficiency, the WSUR approach resulted in narrow confidence intervals and an efficiency gain of over 20%. The WSUR approach should be used in forest biomass modeling as it resulted in effective estimators while ensuring equation additivity, thus providing an easy and accurate alternative to estimate the initial biomass of eucalyptus stands in ecophysiological models.",

    "abstract": "Phytophagous mites can cause economic losses in many crops, including grapevines. The changes in their population levels may be associated with changes in the predator-prey relationship. Knowledge of the distribution of mites in plants is important for planning sampling strategies and facilitating control decisions. The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the abundances of Tetranychus urticae (Tetranychidae) and Neoseiulus californicus (Phytoseiidae), and the correlations between them and environmental factors; (ii) determine their distribution on the top, middle, or base strata of the evaluated grapevines (Vitis vinifera, Chardonnay cultivar) and, additionally, report the first occurrence of damage caused by T. urticae in grapevine leaves in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Sixteen samplings were conducted, divided between the 2018 and 2019 seasons. In each sampling, three leaves from the three strata of the plant (top, middle, and base) were collected from 20 plants, totaling 60 leaves per sampling. The predator-prey relationship and their association with environmental variables were evaluated with multivariate correlation, whereas the number of mites per plant leaf strata was compared using a generalized linear mixed model in R software. It was possible to observe the symptoms of damage caused by T. urticae attacks on grapevines in Southern Brazil, characterized by the presence of yellow spots and general yellowing of the vineyard. Our findings indicate that T. urticae and N. californicus individuals are strongly associated with each other regardless of the environmental variables, and such relationship occurs mainly on the lower strata (middle and base leaves) of grapevines. Thus, by taking into account the damage on the leaves of grapevines and the occurrence of T. urticae and N. californicus majorities on specific strata of these vineyards, we suggest that the lower strata of grapevines should be the priority targets for management strategies to control such mites.",
