    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to provide a synthetic outline of some of the processes of transient nature occurring in caves, focusing on poorly studied general aspects of underground physics and mainly making use of original experimental data. In the first part, the average climatic conditions of a caves, their connection to the external climate, and the general role played by rock, water, air and external morphology are discussed. The variation of the internal temperature withthe altitude is a key parameter for the cave physics: the related energetic consequences are briefly discussed. In the second part, transient processes are considered, and a general overview of main meteorological phenomena occurring underground is given. The physics of thermal sedimentation, of underground temperature ranges, of infrasonic oscillations of cave atmospheres and, above all, of water vapour condensation in caves is synthetically described. The experimental study of these processes is extremely difficult, because they are time dependent and have very small amplitude; the first measurements show, however, that their variability from one cave to another, and from point to point inside a cave, is surprisingly high. To provide a more correct interpretation of underground climatic measurements, for their speleogenetic role and importance in cave environment protection, a better understanding of the processes described here is essential.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of work accomplished by the European COST Action 620, a comprehensive approach to groundwater vulnerability and contamination risk assessment is proposed, taking into account the special characteristics of Slovene karst aquifer systems. The Slovene Approach is consistent with national environmental legislation and enables comparison across European countries. The method integrates temporal hydrological variability in the concept of groundwater vulnerability and offers a new possibility to combine surface and groundwater source and resource protection, which required the development of a new K factor (karst groundwater flow within the saturated zone). The risk analysis considers intrinsic vulnerability, contamination hazards and the importance of the source or resource. It has been first applied to the Podstenjšek springs catchment in southwestern Slovenia and validated by means of two multi-tracer tests with a total of six injection points. The resulting vulnerability, hazard and risk maps are plausible, and the validation confirmed the vulnerability assessment at the representative sites that were selected for tracer injection. The maps provide improved source protection zones and make it possible to identify land mismanagement and to propose better practices for future planning.",

    "abstract": "»Doline«, mednarodni izraz za vrtačo, je najbolj razširjena površinska oblika na krasu. Ime izhaja iz slovanske besede »dolina«, ki pomeni depresijo v topografskem površju. V skoraj 100 letih se je izraz razširil in danes ima v mednarodni literaturi dobro določen pomen. Zaradi tega ga ni mogoče zamenjati s kakim drugim izrazom, npr. »vrtača« ali \"kraška dolina\" kot predlagajo nekateri avtorji (Gams 1973, 1974). Uporaba izraza »sinkhole« kot sinonima za »doline« v ameriški literaturi vodi včasih do podvajanj, saj se izraz »sinkhole« uporablja predvsem za udorno ali pokrito vrtačo. Na podlagi podrobnega preučevanja vrtač na različnih kraških ozemljih je mogoče trditi, da je vrtača lahko tako po strukturi kot po nastanku, kompleksna oblika (Sauro in print, a in b). Vrtačo lahko najpravilneje opredelimo tako, da dodamo pridevnik, ki pojasnjuje posebnosti. Najpomembnejši pridevniki so tisti, ki so vezani tako na morfogenetske mehanizme kot na hidrološke posebnosti. Na podlagi teh pridevnikov je mogoče razlikovati več kategorij in tipov vrtač. Za razumevanje vrtače je najbolj pomembna rekonstrukcija njenega razvoja, pa četudi je ta kompleksen.The doline is the most representative landform of the karst surface. The name derives from the word dolina, a Slav term indicating any depression in the topographical surface. For nearly a century, this name acquired widespread use and a well defined meaning in the international literature; as a result it is not possible to substitute it with another term such as “vrtača” or “kraška dolina”, for example, as proposed by some authors (Gams, 1973, 1974). The use of sinkhole as a synonym for doline in the American literature has also created some ambiguity, because sinkhole is mostly applied in the sense of collapse doline or of cover doline. From the detailed studies of the dolines of different karst areas, it is possible to infer that the structure and the genesis of this form may be complex (Sauro, in press – a – and - b). The most correct way to define a doline is to add an adjective indicating a peculiar attribute. The most significant attributes are those linked to both the morphogenetical mechanism and the hydrological structure. On the basis of these attributes it is possible to distinguish several categories and types of dolines. Most importantly to understand a doline it is necessary to be able to reconstruct its history even if that may be complex, as some dolines formed by specific processes may later further evolve through different processes.",

    "abstract": "O speleogenetskem pomenu vode, ki iz toplega vlažnega zraka kondenzira na hladne jamske stene je napisanega veliko. Kondenzirana voda se hitro uravnoteži z ogljikovem dioksidom v jamski atmosferi, zato raztaplja apnenec in pri tem tvori različne skalne oblike. V članku predstavimo fizikalne osnove in podamo enačbe, ki omogočajo približno oceno hitrosti kondenzacije v različnih pogojih. Zaradi kondenzacijske toplote in prenosa toplote iz zraka na steno, se temperatura stene viša, pri čemer se zmanjšuje razlika temperature med zrakom in steno. To predstavlja robni pogoj za prevajanje toplote iz jame. Pri konstantni temperaturi zraka, hitrost kondenzacije v nekaj dneh pade za več velikostnih redov, dokler ne doseže končne vrednosti, pri kateri se ves toplotni tok prenese na površje. Slednjo za primer krogelnih in valjastih prostorov opišemo kot funkcijo globine rova Z. Pri dnevnih in sezonskih spemembah temperature, značilnih v bližini jamskih vhodov, je hitrost kondenzacije in posledično korozije do 1μm na leto. Teoretične rezultate uporabimo tudi za izračun korozije kapnikov in tipa škrapelj (röhrenkarren), ki jih opisuje Simms (2003). Za pretvorbo hitrosti kondenzacije v hitrost korozije, potrebujemo podatek o stopnji nasičenja vode. V dodatku predstavimo poskus, ki dokazuje, da se voda, ki kondenzira na jamske stene, hitro nasiti tako v primeru apnenca kot v primeru sadre. Condensation of water from warm, humid air to cold rock walls in caves is regarded to play a significant role in speleogenesis. The water condensing to the cave walls quickly attains equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the surrounding air, and consequently dissolves limestone or gypsum forming various types of macro- ,meso-, and micromorphologies. In this paper we present the basic physical principles of condensation and give equations, which allow a satisfactory estimation of condensation rates. Water condensing to a cooler wall releases heat of condensation, which raises the temperature of the wall thus reducing the temperature difference (T between the warm air and the cave wall. Furthermore one has to take into account the heat flux from the air to the cave wall. This defines the boundary conditions for the equation of heat conduction. For a constant temperature of the air initial condensation rates are high but then drop down rapidly by orders of magnitude during the first few days. Finally constant condensation rates are attained, when the heat flux into the rock is fully transmitted to the surface of the karst plateau. For spherical and cylindrical conduits these can be obtained as a function of the depth Z below the surface. When diurnal or seasonal variations of the air temperature are active as is the case close to cave entrances, condensation rates can become quite significant, up to about 10-6 m/year. The theoretical results are applied also to corrosion of speleothems and the formation of \"röhrenkarren\" as described by Simms (2003). To convert condensation rates into retreat of bedrock the saturation state of the solution must be known. In the appendix we present experiments, which prove that in any case the solution flowing off the rock is saturated with respect to limestone or gypsum, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The unique morphology of cave animals has interested biologists at least since the time of Lamarck. After a number of non-adaptive explanations for the morphology of cave animals, especially with respect to eye and pigment loss, a neo-Darwinian explanation, emphasizing constructive morphological changes rather than losses, was put forward by Barr, Christiansen, and Poulson in the 1960’s. Emphasizing convergent evolution (troglomorphy), this paradigm has recently been challenged, with evidence of divergent selection and the widespread occurrence of morphologically similar species in other subterranean habitats, including ones with abundant food and relatively strong environmental fluctuations. An emerging paradigm emphasizes the central role of darkness in convergent evolution, and the role of habitat size and interspecific competition in divergent evolution of subterranean species.Sprememba paradigme o evoluciji jamskega življenjaEdinstvena morfologija jamskih živali, predvsem v povezavi z izgubo oči in pigmenta, je zanimala biologe že od časa Lamarcka.

    "abstract": "Karst environments are extremely vulnerable to degradation and pollution. Although the carrying capacity of these natural environments is low, a variety of human activities is implemented on karst settings generating impacts at the surface and subsurface. To evaluate the degree of disturbance to typical karst environments in the Mediterranean basin, two areas have been selected in Apulia (south-eastern Italy). The human-induced effects are being assessed by applying a recently developed Karst Disturbance Index (KDI), based on a categorical framework encompassing physical, biological, and social aspects, and the evaluation of a number of indicators for each category. Scores are assigned to the indicators, to assess the severity and the extent of the human impacts on the karst environment. Knowledge of the study areas derives from a combined use of direct experience and field surveys, and the critical evaluation of data available from research articles and local organization reports. Since this approach is an holistic and comprehensive method, different scientific branches and law issues have been considered. The results so far obtained for the study areas highlight the urgent need of a sustainable management of anthropogenic activities: for example, quarrying and stone clearing, both extensively widespread, are among the most dangerous practices for karst surface and subsurface landforms in Apulia. These activities are heavily changing the original karst landscape and causing the partial or total destruction of natural caves. This study represents a preliminary evaluation of the human disturbance to karst in Apulia, but has to be necessarily integrated by further applications in other areas of the region, aimed at a better understanding of the potentiality of the approach and its feasibility in different karst settings.",

    "abstract": "Digital elevation models (DEM) are digital representations of topography that are especially suitable for numerical terrain analysis in earth sciences and engineering. One of the main quantitative uses of DEM is the automatic delineation of flow networks and watersheds in hydrology and geomorphology. In these applications (using both low-resolution and precision DEM) depressions hinder the inference of pathways and a lot of work has been done in designing algorithms that remove them so as to generate depression-free digital elevation models with no interruptions to flow. There are, however, geomorphological environments, such as karst terrains, in which depressions are singular elements, on scales ranging from centimetres to kilometres, which are of intrinsic interest. The detection of these depressions is of significant interest in geomorphologic mapping because the development of large depressions is normal in karst terrains: potholes, blind valleys, dolines, uvalas and poljes. The smallest depressions that can be detected depend on the spatial resolution (pixel size) of the DEM. For example, depressions from centimetres to a few metres, such as some types of karren, cannot be detected if the raster digital elevation model has a spatial resolution greater than, say, 5 m (i.e., square 5m pixel). In this work we describe a method for the automatic detection and delineation of terrain depressions. First, we apply a very efficient algorithm to remove pits from the DEM. The terrain depressions are then obtained by subtracting the depression-free DEM from the original DEM. The final product is a digital map of depressions that facilitates the calculation of morphometric features such as the geometry of the depressions, the mean depth of the depressions, the density of depressions across the study area and the relationship between depressions and other variables such as altitude. The method is illustrated by applying it to data from the Sierra de las Nieves karst massif in the province of Málaga in Southern Spain. This is a carbonate aquifer that is drained by three main springs and in which the depressions play an important role in the recharge of the aquifer. A doline density map, produced from a map of 324 detected dolines/uvalas, identifies three main recharge areas of the three springs. Other morphometric results related to the size and direction of the dolines are also presented. Finally the dolines can be incorporated into a geomorphology map.",

    "abstract": "Speleogenesis is the development of well-organized cave systems by fluids moving through fissures of a soluble rock. Epigenic caves induced by biogenic CO2 soil production are dominant, whereas hypogenic caves resulting from uprising deep flow not directly connected to adjacent recharge areas appear to be more frequent than previously considered. The conceptual models of epigenic cave development moved from early models, through the “four-states model” involving fracture influence to explain deep loops, to the digital models demonstrating the adjustment of the main flow to the water table. The relationships with base level are complex and cave levels must be determined from the elevation of the vadose-phreatic transitions. Since flooding in the epiphreatic zone may be important, the top of the loops in the epiphreatic zone can be found significantly high above the base level. The term Paragenesis is used to describe the upward development of conduits as their lower parts fill with sediments. This process often records a general baselevel rise. Sediment influx is responsible for the regulation of long profiles by paragenesis and contributes to the evolution of profiles from looping to water table caves. Dating methods allow identification of the timing of cave level evolution. The term Ghost-rock karstification is used to describe a 2-phase process of speleogenesis, with a first phase of partial solution of rock along fractures in low gradient conditions leaving a porous matrix, the ghost-rock, then a second phase of mechanical removing of the ghost-rock mainly by turbulent flow in high gradient conditions opening the passages and forming maze caves. The first weathering phase can be related either to epigenic infiltration or to hypogenic upflow, especially in marginal areas of sedimentary basins. The vertical pattern of epigenic caves is mainly controlled by timing, geological structure, types of flow and base-level changes. We define several cave types as (1) juvenile, where they are perched above underlying aquicludes; (2) looping, where recharge varies greatly with time, to produce epiphreatic loops; (3) water-table caves where flow is regulated by a semi-pervious cover; and (4) caves in the equilibrium stage where flow is transmitted without significant flooding. Successive base-level drops caused by valley entrenchment make cave levels, whereas baselevel rise is defined in the frame of the Per ascensum Model of Speleogenesis (PAMS), where deep passages are flooded and drain through vauclusian springs. The PAMS can be active after any type of baselevel rise (transgression, fluvial aggradation, tectonic subsidence) and explains most of the deep phreatic cave systems except for hypogenic.The term Hypogenic speleogenesis is used to describe cave development by deep upflow independent of adjacent recharge areas. Due to its deep origin, water frequently has a high CO2-H2S concentration and a thermal anomaly, but not systematically. Numerous dissolution processes can be involved in hypogenic speleogenesis, which often include deep-seated acidic sources of CO2 and H2S, “hydrothermal” cooling, mixing corrosion, Sulfuric Acid Speleogenesis (SAS), etc. SAS particularly involves the condensation-corrosion processes, resulting in the fast expansion of caves above the water table, i.e. in an atmospheric environment. The hydrogeological setting of hypogenic speleogenesis is based on the Regional Gravity Flow concept, which shows at the basin scales the sites of convergences and upflows where dissolution focuses. Each part of a basin (marginal, internal, deep zone) has specific conditions. The coastal basin is a sub-type. In deformed strata, flow is more complex according to the geological structure. However, upflow and hypogenic speleogenesis concentrate in structural highs (buried anticlines) and zones of major disruption (faults, overthrusts). In disrupted basins, the geothermal gradient “pumps” the meteoric water at depth, making loops of different depths and characteristics. Volcanism and magmatism also produce deep hypogenic loops with “hyperkarst” characteristics due to a combination of deep-seated CO2, H2S, thermalism, and microbial activity. In phreatic conditions, the resulting cave patternscan include geodes, 2–3D caves, and giant ascending shafts. Along the water table, SAS with thermal air convection induces powerful condensation-corrosion and the development of upwardly dendritic caves, isolated chambers, water table sulfuricacid caves. In the vadose zone, “smoking” shafts evolve under the influence of geothermal gradients producing air convectionand condensation-corrosion.Likely future directions for research will probably involve analytical and modeling methods, especially using isotopes, dating, chemical simulations, and field investigations focused on the relationships between processes and resulting morphologies.Nova področja speleogenetskih raziskav: Povezava med hidrogeološkimi razmerami, prevladujočimi procesi in tipi jamSpeleogeneza je razvoj dobro (samo)organiziranih jamskih sistemov, ko podzemna voda vzdolž toka raztaplja stene razpok. Najbolj poznane so epigene jame v karbonatih, kjer je poglavitni vir kemične agresivnosti pedogeni CO2. Bolj pogoste, kot se je v preteklosti domnevalo, so hipogene jame, ki nastanejo z dviganjem globokega toka in niso neposredno povezane z lokalnim napajalnim območjem. Prvotni konceptualni modeli razvoja epigenih jam so se preko modela štirih stanj, ki speleogenezo pojasnjuje s frekvenco prevodnih razpok, razvili do računalniških modelov, ki pojasnijo prilagoditev glavnega toka freatični površini. Povezava jamskih sistemov s položajem erozijske baze ni enostavna, saj moramo pri interpretaciji upoštevati višino prehoda iz freatične v vadozno cono. Zaradi visokih poplav v epifreatični coni so lahko temena jamskih zavojev visoko nad erozijsko bazo. Termin parageneza se uporablja za opis razvoja kanalov od spodaj navzgor, ko se spodnji deli zapolnijo s sedimenti. Ta proces pogosto beleži splošen dvig erozijske baze. Vdor sedimentov je tudi razlog za uravnavanje dolgih profilov s paragenezo in prispeva k prehodu jam z zavoji v navpični ravnini v jame uravnane z vodnim nivojem. Različne datacijske metode omogočajo določanje časovnega razvoja jamskih nivojev. Speleogeneza lahko poteka tudi v dveh fazah; v prvi fazi voda ob nizkem gradientu raztopi topen del kamninske matrice (angleško Ghost rock weathering), v drugi fazi pa ob visokem gradientu turbulentni tok mehansko odnese preostali del matrice, pri čemer praviloma nastane labirintni tip jam. Prva faza je lahko povezana z epigeno infiltracijo ali s hipogenim dotokom predvsem na mejnih območjih sedimentnih bazenov. Vertikalna geometrija epigenih jam je pogojena s časovnim okvirom, geološko strukturo, vrsto toka in spremembo erozijske baze. Razvoj mladih (juvenilnih) geometrijskih vzorcev nad nivojem neprepustnih plasti, je povezan s hitrimi tektonskimi dvigi in vrezovanji erozijske baze. V pogojih omejenega odtoka ob spremenljivem napajanju zaradi poplavljanja epifreatične cone nastajajo zavoji v navpični ravnini (angl. loops). Jame vodnega nivoja nastajajo na področjih, kjer je kras pokrit z delno prepustnimi plastmi oz. kjer je speleogeneza uravnotežena z največjimi poplavami. Spreminjanje erozijske baze ob vrezovanju dolin se odraža v jamskih nivojih, medtem ko dviganje erozijske baze diktira razvoj jam od spodaj navzgor (Speleogeneza Per ecensum, PAMS) in nastanek izvirov vokluškega tipa. PAMS se lahko aktivira ob različnih vrstah dviga erozijske baze (zaradi transgresije, rečnega naplavljanja, tektonskega ugrezanja) in pojasnjuje nastanek večine globokih freatičnih jamskih sistemov, razen hipogenih. Izraz hipogena speleogeneza se uporablja za opis razvoja jam zaradi dviganja globokega regionalnega toka. Zaradi izvora iz globin ima voda pogosto visoko koncentracijo CO2–H2S in temperaturno anomalijo. Pri hipogeni speleogenezi lahko sodelujejo številni procesi raztapljanja, ki so povezani z globokimi viri CO2 in H2S, \"hidrotermalnim\" ohlajanjem, korozijo mešanice, speleogenezo žveplene kisline (Sulphuric Acid Speleogenesis, SAS), itd. Zlasti SAS vključuje kondenzacijsko-korozijske procese, zaradi česar prihaja do hitrega nastanka jam nad vodno gladino v atmosferskem okolju. Hidrogeološke razmere pri hipogeni speleogenezi so povezane z regionalnim gravitacijskim tokom, kjer je korozija najmočnejša na območju stekanja in dvigovanja vodnih tokov. Vsak del porečja (obrobni, notranji, globoka cona) ima posebne pogoje. Eden od podtipov je tudi obalno območje. V deformiranih slojih je tok bolj zapleten in strukturno pogojen, pri čemer sta vodni tok in hipogena speleogeneza praviloma vezana na strukturne vrhove (prekrite antiklinale) in na območja večjih strukturnih prekinitev (prelomi, narivi). V prekinjenih bazenih geotermalni gradient \"črpa\" meteorske vode v globine, kar povzroča zanke na različnih globinah in z različnimi značilnostmi. Vulkanizem in magmatizem tudi povzročata globoke hipogene zanke s \"hiperkraškimi\" značilnostmi, ki nastajajo zaradi kombinacije globokih virov CO2, H2S, termalnih procesov in mikrobiološke aktivnosti. Geometrijski vzorci jam v freatičnih pogojih lahko vključujejo geode, 2–3D jame in navzgor razvijajoča se brezna izjemnih razsežnosti. Nad vodno gladino se zaradi termalne konvekcije in kondenzacijske korozije ob prisotnosti žveplove kisline razvijajo različni geometrijski vzorci jam; dvigajoče se razvejane jame, izolirane dvorane in jame vodnega nivoja nastale z delovanjem žveplene kisline. V vadozni coni nastajajo tudi »parna« brezna, ko se na območjih termalnih vodonosnikov topel vlažen zrak dviga, ohlaja in kondenzira vzdolž razpok in jih na ta način širi v brezna. V prihodnosti bodo raziskave speleogeneze verjetno temeljile na analitičnih in modelskih pristopih, izotopskih, datacijskih in geokemičnih metodah ter terenskih raziskavah, ki se bodo osredotočala na odnose med procesi in posledično morfologijo.",

    "abstract": "Dolines are small to intermediate enclosed depressions and are the most numerous karst feature in Slovenia. They are circular in plan form and vary in diameter from a few metres to over a kilometre. They are developed in limestone, dolomite, carbonate breccia and conglomerate and occupy different geomorphic settings. They were formed by various processes like dissolution, collapse, suffosion and transformation of caves to surface features by denudation. Publicly accessible lidar data, provided by a nationwide laser scanning project of Slovenia, was used for this study. To catalogue the dolines, we manually label a fraction of the digital elevation model (DEM) with a binary mask indicating if the area is a doline or not. We then train a slightly modified u-net, a type of machine learning algorithm, on the labelled territory. Using the trained algorithm, we infer the binary mask on the entire DEM. We convert the resulting mask into an ESRI Shapefile and manually verify the results. We note that the training and inference are error prone on types of relief that were less common in the training set (e.g., the relatively uncommon collapse dolines). We believe manual verification mitigates most of these errors, so the resulting map is a good basis for the doline study. We have made our georeferenced catalogue of dolines available at https://dolines.org/ (Mihevc &amp; Mihevc 2021). Dolines are found in most of the karst areas, except mountains where they were eroded by glacial action or covered by glacial deposits. We detected 471,192 dolines and divided them into three genetic types. Most abundant are solution dolines (470,325). The average doline is 9 m deep, has a diameter of 42 m and a volume of 14,098 m3. The density of dolines on levelled surfaces can be as high as 500/ per km2. They are absent from the floors of poljes and steeper slopes, and are less abundant on sloping surfaces. We have identified 314 dolines to be of collapse origin. The mean depth of collapse dolines is 49 m, and 20 of them are deeper than 100 m. The mean volume is 1.2 million m3, with the largest having a volume of 11.6 million m3. Most of the collapse dolines can be found close to ponors or springs or corridors where large underground rivers flow. We have detected 553 suffosion dolines formed by suffosion of sediments in blind valleys or on poljes. This basic data set for dolines enables further study and comparison of dolines with the geology and topography of the karst.",

    "abstract": "In the catchment area of the Unica River two combined tracer tests with fluorescent dyes have been performed aiming to characterize the properties of groundwater flow and transport of contaminants through the vadose zone and well developed system of karst channels in the epiphreatic and phreatic zone in different hydrologic conditions. Tracers were injected directly into the ponors and to the oil collector outlet on the karst surface. Prior to tracing monitoring network has been set up, including precipitation, physical and chemical parameters of the springs and cave streams. Field fluorimeters were used to detect tracers in the underground river and conventional sampling techniques and laboratory analyses were used at the springs. Some of the results were quantitatively evaluated by QTRACER2 Program. During the first tracer test, when injection was followed by rain event, flow through the well conductive cave system was characterized by apparent dominant flow velocities of 88–640 m/h. Breakthrough curves were continuous, uniform and single peaked, and almost complete recoveries were observed. During the second tracer test, when water level was in constant recession, the transport velocities through the well developed karst conduits were significantly slower (apparent maximal flow velocities being 2–4 times lower). Results also show lower dispersivity during the second tracer test, which corresponds to lower flow velocities. The tracer injected at the karst surface arrived with the expected delay (vdom around 9 m/h) and showed irregular and elongated breakthrough curves with secondary peaks. In this paper only tracer test results are presented, which are a part of a comprehensive study of groundwater flow through the complex karst aquifers aiming at improving karst water resources understanding, protection and management. The presented assessment will beyond be utilized for further detailed analysis, studies and modelling.",

    "abstract": "Cave microclimate is important in the study of cave flora and fauna, certain karst processes underground and hydrogeologic aspects of speleothems; thus an understanding of microclimat­ic processes is especially important in the management of show caves. Here, examples are drawn from researchon New Zea­land caves and examined in the context of sustainable cave use management practices. The work considers that the cave man­ager is concerned, firstly, withdefining the desired or optimal level or range of environmental conditions that should prevail and, secondly, withmaintaining them. To do this requires an appropriate and reliable monitoring system. It involves select­ing key indicators to be monitored and setting target standards. Selection of an appropriate monitoring system, however, re­lies on having a good understanding of the climate processes operating, essentially how they work and how they might be appropriately managed. Unlike microclimates in the atmo­sphere-land boundary layer, whichare characterized by verti­cal exchanges, processes determining climate in all but nearly closed caves are dominated by advection of heat and moisture. It is this process that may give rise to distinct spatial and tem­poral patterns of climates in caves. Thermoadynamic aspects of external air-cave air interaction are assessed to explain spatial as well as short term and seasonal variations of thermal and moisture states of the cave atmosphere. The relevance of all this to cave management is discussed. It is argued that cave man­agement is not simply a matter of determining usage levels or carrying capacity of caves; rather, it involves determining en­vironmental management techniques that are appropriate to a particular cave condition or environmental state that should prevail.",

    "abstract": "Shallow geothermal systems for the heating and cooling of buildings will play an important role in the future renewable energy supply. Especially in dense settlements the geother­mal energy utilization for facility heating and cooling is very promising. Therefore, it is important to analyse the damage to Staufen im Breisgau (Germany). In September of 2007, seven geothermal borehole heat exchanger (BHE) drillings were per­formed in a small square directly adjacent to the 16th century town hall in the centre of the town. These led to enormous structural damage to buildings as a function of four different geological parameters: artesian groundwater, two interacting karst formations, strong tectonization, and a swellable anhy­drite formation. Some weeks after termination of the well con­struction, uplift started, and recently (March 2010) reached a magnitude of approximately 26 cm. Actually, some 250 build­ings (March 2010) are involved; showing cracks, tilting, and other effects of the differential swelling movements beneath the foundations. Surface uplifts with rate up to 10 mm/month have been determined using high-resolution spaceborne radar data and radarinterferometric techniques. These amplitudes correlate with data from benchmarks of terrestrial geodetic surveyng. Besides the uplift due to the swelling processes, fu­ture problems could arise from the fact that the gypsum formed from the swelled anhydrite is soluble in water. Thus, sinkholes and other karst related phenomena may occur.",

Kartchner Caverns, Arizona, USA, was opened to the public in November 1999. Some preliminary studies have been performed. Arizona Conservation Project, Inc. (ACPI) established 22 monitoring stations. An evaluation of the impact assessment was obtained. The second case concerns Cango Cave. A simple monitoring network has been installed in September 2000 to be operated for one year. It consists in about 15 rugged data loggers distributed along the cave. Air and water temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, and relative humidity are measured and the values are transferred periodically by a shuttle into a computer outside the cave. A totally automatic monitoring network will be installed in the future after the results of the first simple network are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Doline morphometry has always been in the focus of karst geomorphological research. Recently, digital terrain model (DTM) based methods became widespread in the study of dolines. Today, LiDAR datasets provide high resolution DTMs, and automated doline recognition algorithms have been developed. In this paper, we test different datasets and a doline recognition algorithm using Aggtelek Karst (NE-Hungary) dolines as a case example. Three datasets are compared: “TOPO” dolines delineated by the classical outermost closed contour method using 1:10,000 scale topographic maps, “KRIG” dolines derived automatically from the DTM created by kriging interpolation from the digitized contours of the same topographic maps, and finally “LiDAR” dolines derived automatically from a DTM created from LiDAR data. First, we analyzed the sensitivity of the automatic method to the “depth limit” parameter, which is the threshold, below which closed depressions are considered as “errors” and are filled. In the actual case, given the typical doline size of the area and the resolution of the DTMs, we found that ca. 0.5 m is the optimal depth limit for the LiDAR dataset and 1 m for the KRIG dataset. The statistical distributions of the morphometrical properties were similar for all datasets (lognormal distribution for area and gamma distribution for depth), but the DTM-based methodology resulted larger dolines with respect to the classical method. The planform area (and related characteristics) showed very high correlations between the datasets. Depth values were less correlated and the lowest (moderately strong) correlations were observed between circularity values of the different datasets. Slope histograms calculated from the LiDAR data were used to cluster dolines, and these clusters differentiated dolines similarly to the classical depth-diameter ratio. Finally, we conclude that in the actual case, dolines can be morphometrically well characterized even by the classical topographic method, though finer results can be achieved for the depth and shape related parameters by using LiDAR data.Key words: doline morphometry, LiDAR, interpolation, slope histogram, sink point. Prednost lidarskega digitalnega modela reliefa za raziskavo morfometrije vrtač v primerjavi s podatkovno bazo topografskih kart − primer Agteleškega krasa (Madžarska)Morfometrija vrtač je bila vedno v središču kraških geomorfoloških raziskav. V zadnjem času so pri raziskavah vrtač postale zelo razširjene metode, ki temeljijo na digitalnem modelu reliefa (DMR). Lidarski podatki zagotavljajo visoko ločljivostne DMR-je, razviti so bili avtomatski algoritmi za prepoznavanje vrtač. V tem prispevku smo na primeru Agteleškega krasa v severovzhodni Madžarski preizkusili različne podatkovne baze in algoritme za prepoznavanje vrtač. Primerjali smo tri podatkovne baze: \"TOPO\" vrtače so razmejene na klasičen način z zunanjo zaprto plastnico na topografski karti v merilu 1: 10.000, \"KRIG\" vrtače so v istem merilu s pomočjo kriginga samodejno pridobljene iz digitaliziranih plastnic DMR, in \"LiDAR\" vrtače so samodejno pridobljene iz DMR, ki je ustvarjen iz lidarskih podatkov. Najprej smo analizirali občutljivost avtomatske metode parametra \"mejne globine\", ki predstavlja prag, pod katerim se depresijske oblike štejejo kot \"napake\" in so zapolnjene. V konkretnem primeru smo glede na običajno velikost vrtače in ločljivosti DMR ugotovili, da je optimalna globinska meja za LiDAR ca. 0,5 m in 1 m za KRIG. Pri vseh podatkovnih bazah so bile statistične porazdelitve morfometrijskih lastnosti (logaritemska normalna porazdelitev za prostor in gama porazdelitev za globino) podobne, vendar metodologija, ki temelji na DMR privede do rezultatov, ki kažejo na večje vrtače v primerjavi s klasično metodo. Rezultati območij vrtač (in njihovih značilnosti) so pokazali zelo visoke korelacije med podatkovnimi nizi. Pri globinah so bile korelacije manjše in najnižje zabeležene korelacije (srednje močne) so bile med podatki različnih podatkovnih bazah. Histogrami naklona, izračunani iz lidarskih podatkov, so bili uporabljeni za združevanje vrtač, in ti grozdi razlikujejo vrtače glede na klasično razmerje med globino in premerom. Na koncu smo ugotovili, da lahko v konkretnem primeru dobro določimo morfometrične lastnosti vrtač s klasičnimi topografskimi metodami. Podrobnejše rezultate o globinah in oblikah lahko dosežemo na podlagi lidarskih podatkov.Ključne besede: morfometrija vrtač, LiDAR, interpolacija, histogram naklona, ponor.",

    "abstract": "Apulia region (SE Italy) is particularly prone to karst processes, due to the extensive presence of carbonate rocks. Karst marks the whole region, and represent the main landscape features, with a variety of landforms ranging from large-size dolines, to poljes, and fluvial-karstic valleys; given the configuration of Apulia, a great role is also played by coastal karst landforms. The Salento peninsula, in southern Apulia, is characterized by very low relief and cropping out of different types of carbonate rocks, ranging in age from Cretaceous to Quaternary. Recognition of karst features in this setting, and the likely implications for geohazards, is quite difficult, because of the subtleness of the features, and the facility for man to cancel or modify them. Nevrteheless, the presence of dolines is definitely a typical aspect of the area, which also implies some consequences in terms of risk to the built-up environment.This work focuses on the area of Barbarano del Capo, where two cover-collapse dolines are well known in the geological literature as Vora Grande and Vora Piccola. Despite morphometrical and stratigraphical features have already been investigated, few information are available about the hydro-geomorphological and structural settings of the area. This article presents the results of morphological and structural analyses, aimed at understanding the role played by tectonics in the development of karst features, and their evolution.",

Vrtače so posledica lokalno pospešene korozije. Njihov začetek je v lokalno bolj pretrti kamnini z večjo specifično (površina/volumen) površino, izpostavljeno koroziji talne vlage. Vpliv zdrobljenosti kamnine je bil potrjen z laboratorijskim poskusom. Poznejša rast kotanje sloni na avtomatizmu, ki izhaja iz večje stične površine prst/kamen kot jo ima začetna ravna površina (zdaj odprtina kotanje). Lijakaste vrtače se ob večanju kotanje običajno spremenijo v skledaste, kjer je preseganje večje. Na obliko vplivajo še prepustnost tal in soliflukcija.

Dolines are an effect of local accelerated solution. In initial phase they are connected with more fractured stone, as the grains have greater specific (surface/volume) surface exposed to soil moisture. Effect of stone fracturing on solution was tested in laboratory. Later growth of basin is based on automatism, as the size of soil/stone interface is increased with deepening of the basin. Funnel-like dolines with growth usually convert in a bowl-like form with greater exceeding. The form is controlled also by water permeability of soil and solifluction. In temperate climate the two million year long Pleistocene offered with more moisture from snow and with intensive fracturing of stone better conditions for doline development than the warmer Neogene and Holocene when man's impact in last centuries essentially redused primary forest environment and thus processes in the basins.

    "abstract": "The paper examines representative definitions of karst (21), and discusses some concepts that influenced the modern understanding of the phenomenon. Several trends are discussed that took karst science beyond the limits of the traditional paradigm of karst. Dramatic progress in studies of speleogenesis plays the most significant role in changes taking place in the general understanding of karst. Also important is an adoption of the broad perspective to karst evolution which goes beyond the contemporary geomorphologic epoch and encompasses the entire life of a geological formation. Speleogenesis is viewed as a dynamic hydrogeological process of self-organization of the permeability structure in soluble rocks, a mechanism of the specific evolution of the groundwater flow system. The result is that these systems acquire a new, \"karstic\", quality and more complex organization. Since almost all essential attributes of karst owe their origin to speleogenesis, the latter is considered as the primary mechanism of the formation of karst. Two fundamental types of speleogenesis, hypogene and epigene, differentiate mainly due to distinct hydrodynamic characteristics of the respective groundwater flow systems: (1) of layered aquifer systems and fracture-vein flow systems of varying depths and degrees of confinement, and (2) of hydrodynamically open, near-surface unconfined systems. Accordingly, two major genetic types of karst are distinguished: hypogene and epigene. They differ in many characteristics, notably in relationships with the surface, hydrogeological behaviour, groundwater quality, and the areas of practical importance and approaches to solving karst-related issues. Although views on essential attributes of karst have been clearly changing, this was not reflected in definitions of the notion which are in broad use in the earth-science literature. A refined approach is suggested to the notion of karst in which it is viewed as a groundwater (fluid) flow system of a specific kind, which has acquired its peculiar properties in the course of speleogenesis.Kraška paradigma: spremembe, trendi in perspektiveDokument obravnava reprezentativne definicije krasa (21) in obravnava nekatere koncepte, ki so vplivali na sodobno razumevanje tega pojava. Razpravlja o več trendih, ki so popeljali krasoslovje preko meja tradicionalne paradigme krasa. Dramatični napredek v speleogenetskih raziskavah je igral najpomembnejšo vlogo pri spremembah, ki so se zgodile pri splošnem razumevanju krasa. Prav tako je za razvoj krasoslovja pomembno sprejetje široke perspektive, ki presega sodobno geomorfološko epoho in zajema celoten geološki razvoj. Speleogeneza je predstavljena kot dinamični hidrogeološki proces samoorganizacije stopnje prepustnosti posameznih struktur v topnih kamninah, to je kot mehanizem specifičnega razvoja sistema toka podzemne vode. Posledica tega je, da ti sistemi potrebujejo novo, \"kraško\", kakovostno in bolj kompleksno organizacijo. Ker skoraj vse bistvene značilnosti krasa izvirajo iz speleogeneze, je slednja šteta kot primarni mehanizem za nastanek krasa. Dve temeljni vrsti speleogeneze, hipogena in epigena, se razlikujeta predvsem zaradi različnih hidrodinamičnih značilnosti posameznih sistemov toka podzemne vode: (1) plastoviti vodonosni sistemi in tokovni sistemi po prelomih in žilah različnih globin in stopenj zaprtosti, ter (2) hidrodinamično odprti in plitvi sistemi. Posledično razlikujemo dva velika genetska tipa krasa: hipogeni in epigeni. Med seboj se razlikujeta v mnogih značilnostih, predvsem v odnosih s površjem, po hidrogeološkem obnašanju, kakovosti podzemne vode, ter na področjih praktičnega pomena in pristopov k reševanju vprašanj, povezanih s krasom. Čeprav so se stališča o bistvenih lastnostih krasa spreminjala, se to ni odrazilo v opredelitvi pojma, ki se na splošno uporablja v vedah o Zemlji. Pri predstavah o krasu predlagamo dodelan pristop, v katerem je poudarek na sistemu podzemne vode (tekočine) s specifičnim načinom pretakanja, ki je pridobilo svoje značilne lastnosti prav tekom speleogeneze.",

Karst rocks are represented by a rock salt, less frequently by gypsum and anhydrite. Karst developed especially in relics of planated surfaces. Karst forms are completely comparable with karsts in classical carbonate rocks. Different forms can be distinguished: karren, solution pipes, solution dolines, solution-collapse dolines, uvalalike to polje-like depressions, blind valleys, canyon-like forms, ponors, springs and caves. Two World longest caves in salt were discovered and explored here. Long caves are developed especially in a watertable, large ones in plugs near the seacoast. Caves are often outlets of closed depressions (polje-like). Some caves at bottoms of collapse-solution dolines or swallow holes are subvertical. Karst processes are caused dominantly by dissolution of salt, less frequently of gypsum. The process of subrosion of halite under gypcretes plays the main role.

Geološki vzroki predstavljajo litostratigrafijo, geološko strukturo, površje in globino do talne vode. Obravnavali so področje za točkovne podatke 2.613 vrtač na dveh 30' × 60' kartah s 30 m intervali. Izračunali so % pogostosti vrtač za pet litostratigrafskih enot, pri čemer so ugotovili, da je v Jefferson City dolomitu in Roubidoux formaciji največja gostota vrtač. Opravljena je bila analiza žariščne vsote sosedstva, da bi ugotovili, če ima razporeditev vrtač značilnost združevanja v skupine ali značilnost linearnosti, kar kaže na vpliv geološke strukture. Usmerjenost skupin vrtač na SZ se pojavlja vzdolž projekcije prelomne cone Bolivar-Mansfield v južno-osrednjem Missouriju. Večina vrtač na obravnavanem terenu se nahaja na območjih uravnav in na položnih pobočjih, kar je pogosteje kot na močno razčlenjenih področjih. Močna razpokanost v bližini regionalnih prelomnih con lahko pospeši razvoj vrtač na planoti. Razumevanje kraškega sistema je pomembno za boljše urejanje uporabe zemlje v Ozarkih, vključno z ohranjanjem naravnih virov, urejanjem talne vode in varovanjem okolja, še posebno ker raziskani teren vsebuje možne ekonomsko ugodne zaloge Pb in Zn.The geologic controls on the distribution and development of dolines in the Salem Plateau of the Ozark Plateaus Province, south-central Missouri, USA, was statistically analyzed by using a geographic information system. The controls include lithostratigraphy, geologic structure, slope, and depth to water table. Area and point data for 2,613 dolines in two 30' x 60' quadrangles were compiled on a 30-meter grid. The percent area of dolines was calculated for five lithostratigraphic units, and it was determined that the Jefferson City Dolomite and Roubidoux Formation have the highest density of dolines. A focal sum neighborhood analysis was performed to determine if the distribution of dolines had any clustering or linearity that may suggest structural control. A northwest alignment of doline clusters occurs along a projection of the Bolivar-Mansfield fault zone in south-central Missouri. Most dolines in the study area occur on the plateau areas and on gentle slopes rather than in the highly dissected areas. Intense fracturing near regional fault zones may enhance doline development on the plateau areas. An understanding of the karst system is important for better landuse management practices in the Ozarks, including conservation of natural resources, ground-water management, and environmental protection, especially because the study area includes potential economic lead and zinc mineralization.",

    "abstract": "Since the start of mass production of plastic materials more than a century ago, the problem of accumulating plastic waste in the environment has reached epic proportions. Recently, the problem of smaller plastic particles (microplastic, MP) in the environment has become a widely studied topic, but the amount and types of MP in karst environments are still poorly known. Thus, the objective of this study was to collect and analyse samples from various karst habitats and to try and determine the scope of pollution in karst springs that are in part used as sources for drinking water. Of the potential pollution sources, we sampled rainwater, two discharges from wastewater treatment plants, and a leachate from a landfill. We conducted polymer analyses of potential MP particles using FTIR-ATR. The results showed that eight samples from the Postojna region (Postojna–Planina Cave System, rainfall sample and surface streams) contain up to 444 MP particles per m3. However, 32 samples taken from the Škocjan–Kačna–Jama 1 v Kanjaducah Cave System contain up to 60,000 MP particles per m3, with the bulk of particles found in the sediment samples from Škocjan Caves – Kačna Cave System. Samples from Postojna region contained mostly PET, PU and PA polymers, with a minor inclusion of polymers of plastic sponge used for cleaning. Samples from Škocjan region contained mostly PP, PET and PE polymers, with some of PA and PU polymers. Sediment samples contained much less MP particles compared to water samples, which indicates fast transport through karst aquifer.",

The lower karsted section, where high-density cave formation took place, is preserved as massive breccias commonly displaying a rectilinear pattern in map view. The overlying suprastratal deformation section is characterized by large, circular to linear sag structures containing faults and fractures. Regional distribution of coalesced, collapsed-cave systems commonly appears as large-scale (hundreds to thousands of square kilometers in area), rectilinear patterns with areas of concentrated, coalesced breccias separated by relatively undisturbed host rock. This pattern may reflect development of the paleocave system along fracture swarms. Collapsed-paleocave systems are large, complex features that show broad-scale organization. The complete paleocave system may need seismic data or large, mountain-scale outcrops to define their architecture and distribution.",

    "abstract": "Progress in the understanding of cave genesis processes, as well as the intensive research carried out in the Alps during the last decades, permit to summarize the latest knowledge about Alpine caves. The phreatic parts of cave systems develop close to the karst water table, which depends on the spring position, which in turn is generally related to the valley bottom. Thus, caves are directly linked with the geomorphic evolution of the surface and reflect valley deepening. The sediments deposited in the caves help to reconstruct the morphologic succession and the paleoclimatic evolution. Moreover, they are the only means to date the caves and thus the landscape evolution. Caves appear as soon as there is an emersion of limestone from the sea and a water table gradient. Mesozoic and early tertiary paleokarsts within the alpine range prove of these ancient emersions. Hydrothermal karst seems to be more widespread than previously presumed. This is mostly due to the fact that usually, hydrothermal caves are later reused (and reshaped) by meteoric waters. Rock-ghost weathering is described as a new cave genesis agent. On the contrary, glaciers hinder cave genesis processes and fill caves. They mainly influence cave genesis indirectly by valley deepening and abrasion of the caprock. All present datings suggest that many alpine caves (excluding paleokarst) are of Pliocene or even Miocene age. Progress in dating methods (mainly the recent evolution with cosmogenic nuclides) should permit, in the near future, to date not only Pleistocene, but also Pliocene cave sediments absolutely.",

    "abstract": "A regional unconformity separates the Cretaceous passive margin shallow-marine carbonate sequence of Adriatic Carbonate Platform from the Upper Cretaceous and/or Paleogene shallow-marine sequences of synorogenic carbonate platform in southwestern Slovenia and Istria (a part of southwestern Slovenia and northwestern Croatia). The unconformity is expressed by irregular paleokarstic surface, locally marked by bauxite deposits. Distinctive subsurface paleokarstic features occur below the surface (e.g. filled phreatic caves, spongework horizons…). The age of the limestones that immediately underlie the unconformity and the extent of the chronostratigraphic gap in southwestern Slovenia and Istria systematically increase from northeast towards southwest, while the age of the overlying limestones decreases in this direction. Similarly, the deposits of synorogenic carbonate platform, pelagic marls and flysch (i.e. underfilled trinity), deposits typical of underfilled peripheral foreland basin, are also diachronous over the area and had been advancing from northeast towards southwest from Campanian to Eocene. Systematic trends of isochrones of the carbonate rocks that immediately under- and overlie the paleokarstic surface, and consequently, of the extent of the chronostratigraphic gap can be explained mainly by the evolution and topography of peripheral foreland bulge (the forebulge). The advancing flexural foreland profile was the result of vertical loading of the foreland lithospheric plate (Adria microplate) by the evolving orogenic wedge. Because of syn- and post-orogenic tectonic processes, and time discrepancy between adjacent foreland basin deposits and tectonic (“orogenic”) phases it is difficult to define the exact tectonic phase responsible for the evolution of the foreland complex. According to position and migration of the subaerially exposed forebulge, distribution of the foreland related macrofacies and orientation of tectonic structures, especially of Dinaric nappes, and Dinaric mountain chain I suggest that the foreland basin complex in western Slovenia and Istria was formed during mesoalpine (“Dinaric”) tectonic phase due to oblique collision between Austroalpine terrane/Tisia microplate and Adria microplate when probably also a segmentation of the foreland plate (Adria microplate) occurred.",

    "abstract": "Condensation-corrosion is an active speleogenetical process in thermal caves where high thermal gradient drives air convection. Wall retreat rates are greater than in meteoric caves. Conversely, evaporation produces depositional processes by replacement of limestone by gypsum and by aerosol decantation leading to the formation of popcorns. The Chevalley Aven belongs to Aix-les-Bains thermal-sulfidic cave system. Condensation occurs at the contact of cool walls of large spheres; conversely, evaporation occurs at the output of the narrow passages where the air sinks down from the upper sphere. A weathered layer and biofilms are present where slow condensation occurs. Corrosion distribution varies according to thermal rock conductivity and causes the sphere to develop upwards, laterally, and divergent. This mor­phodynamic pattern favors the development of stacked spheres, isolated by narrow necks, and arranged in a bush-like pattern. This development is clearly active in the vadose zone above the thermal water table. We propose that some avens above wa­ter table hypogenic caves, like Villa Luz (Mexico), may be of condensation-corrosion origin instead of phreatic. Future de­velopment will collect physical and chemical data to calculate the condensation-corrosion budget and assess its role in cave development",

    "abstract": "The Murge (Apulia, southern Italy) is the main karst area in the central part of the region, extending from the inland plateau to the Adriatic coastline. Along this transect, a relief energy of a few hundred meters is reached. Even thoughsuchrelief may seem small when compared to mountain karst areas, actually it is not for Apulia, a very flat carbonate region that acted as the foreland during the building up of the Apenninic Chain in Miocene time. Murge can be subdivided into two sectors: HighMurge, the inland plateau, where remnants of an ancient tropical karst are still recognizable; and Low Murge, closer to the sea, withsmoother karst morphologies and landforms. Here, some of the most remarkable underground karst systems of Apulia are located: the Castellana caves, a show cave that has been opened since 1939 to tourists (only a few months after the discovery), and the Pozzo Cucù karst system. Overall, the two systems (that are located few hundreds of meters apart) are more than 5,5 km long. In addition, many other karst caves are widespread in the territory, showing different typologies, from percolation shafts, to intrastratal caves, to tectonically-controlled caves, down to marine caves along the coastline. At the surface, other interesting morphological features related to karst may be observed, the main one being the Canale di Pirro polje, whichcuts the SE Murge withan E-Wstrike, until its easternmost reachagainst the Murge fault line scarp. This latter is the main morphological feature intervening between the Murge plateau and the Adriatic plain. In this article the karst morphological features of Murge are depicted, putting together surface and underground data, in the effort to contribute to the recognition of the main phases of development of karst processes in the region.",

    "abstract": "Time series analyses are often used for the investigation of karst aquifers, but are only rarely employed in a way of using a large number of spatially distributed time series. Furthermore, only a small number of applications employ other types of hydrologi­cal data apart from rainfall, water level and discharge. The pre­sented study of the Malenščica karst spring aquifer underlines the usefulness of the simultaneous auto- and cross-correlation analysis of daily and hourly hydrological data sets, including discharge, water level, temperature, electrical conductivity and rainfall on a regional scale. The results of the autocorre­lation analysis show that the storage capacity of the spring is moderate, but this does not indicate that the system, whichis characterized by prevailing conduit porosity, is less intensively karstified. This suggests that well-karstified systems of a more complex structure can have higher memory effects than less complex systems. The results of the cross-correlation analysis show that karst springs and watercourses in the investigated area react instantly and simultaneously to rather homogeneous precipitation, yet withdifferent intensity. In suchcases a cross-correlation analysis between rainfall or ponors as inputs and springs as outputs does not provide sufficient information on the hydrogeological functioning of the system, whereas the results of a cross-correlation analysis of electrical conductivity data sets provide valuable information on its functioning and can be easily compared to those obtained by tracer tests. On the other hand, the applicability of a temperature time series in suchcomplex karst systems is limited. A comparative analysis of the results of the time series analyses performed in succes­sive hydrological years has proven that the selection of the hy­drological year can have strong effects on the results of a time series analysis.",

The present work had as an objective, the measuring the coarse particulate organic matter processing and import rates in the subterranean environment. The cave studied was Lapa da Fazenda Extrema I, limestone cave, located in Brazilian savanna biome. Through bimonthly collections, it was observed that the organic detritus penetrated into the cave in low amounts in dry season and high amounts in rainy season. The processing of the organic plant matter in the aquatic hypogean environment was moderate (K-day=0.025), in the epigean environment the processing was predominantly slow (K-day =0.0104). The detritus commonly brought to the interior of the cave were large woods (58.18 g/day), followed by leaves and fragmented material (12.76 g/day), fruits and seeds (0.0069 g/day), animal carcasses (0.002 g/day) and roots (0.001 g/day). The highest richness and abundances of invertebrates were found in the same periods in which there were the highest rates of organic matter import to the cave.Keywords: cave, detritus processing, energy flow.",

We examine the reliability of the most accessible data sources for doline delineation, namely basic topographic maps at a scale of 1:5,000 and ortho-rectified aerial photographs (digital orthophotos) of 0.5 m resolution. Their reliability has been quantified in the Dinaric karst (Krk Island, NE Adriatic Sea). The adequacy of most commonly used morphometric parameters (viz. elongation and circularity) and their variations applied in previous studies are mathematically verified and practically tested. The simulation of an individual method behaviour performed on polygons with increasing circularity and elongation demonstrated their ranges of validity. The efficiency of a particular method was verified by the application to the real dataset of dolines. The optimal variation of an individual parameter (circularity = Pcc/Pd; elongation = ε of the best fitting ellipse) is identified and suggested for use in order to provide uniform results and increase the comparability of future morphometric analyses. Asymmetry (the distance between the centroid of doline ground plan and the centroid of the largest inscribed circle) as an additional parameter for describing doline ground plans has been developed and is proposed for further use.Key words: karst, doline delineating, morphometric analyses, measurement errors, Krk Island.Morfometrične analize vrtač – problem določanja oboda in računanja osnovnih parametrovNezanesljivost korelacij med okoljskimi dejavniki in geometrijo vrtač je spodbudila pregled do sedaj uporabljenih metod določanja oboda vrtač in primernosti morfometričnih analiz, ki sledijo iz teh podatkov.

Pet izmed teh jam je ali pa je bilo urejenih za turistično izrabo: Postojnsko-planinski jamski sistem (Slovenija), Sistem Baget - Sainte Catherine (Francija), Shelta Cave (Alabama, ZDA), Mammoth Cave (Kentucky, ZDA) in Vjetrenica (Bosna in Hercegovina). Prav dejstvo, da imajo lahko močno preurejene jame z visokim številom obiskovalcev tudi pestro favno, kaže, da se oboje ne izključuje. Številne standardne tehnike za vzorčevanje, so uporabne le v maloštevilnih jamah. Te metode so le omejeno uporabne. Onesnaženje je lahko za jamske živali neposredno pogubno ali pa omogoča površinskim živalim, da tudi v podzemlju izpodrivajo. Zato moramo zasledovati tako gostoto favne, kot tudi spremembe v njeni taksonomski sestavi. Ob načrtovanju novih posegov je treba pred kakršnim koli urejanjem raziskati krajevno favno, tako površinsko kot podzemeljsko. Za biološko zasledovanje stanja priporočava naslednje: 1. vzorčenje skozi daljše obdobje; 2. nastavljanje vab v kopenskih in v vodnih habitatih; 3. nastavljanje lončastih pasti v kopenskih habitatih.In 1999, we described the twenty caves and karst wells that have 20 or more species of obligate cave organisms living in them. Among these caves five are developed as tourist caves — Postojna-Planina Cave System (Slovenia), Baget - Sainte Catherine System (France), Shelta Cave (Alabama, USA), Mammoth Cave (Kentucky, USA), and Vjetrenica Cave (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina). For these and other tourist caves, there is a special responsibility to protect this fauna. The very fact that caves with large numbers of visitors and with modifications to the cave can have high species diversity shows that the two are not incompatible. Many of the standard sampling techniques, may work in some caves only; they are of restricted use. Pollution may be either directly detrimental to the cave fauna or may enable surface species to outcompete the endemic cave fauna. Therefore, changes in the quantity of fauna have to be monitored as well as changes in its taxonomic composition. In the case of new tourist installations, the local cave and surface fauna has to be investigated prior to any modifications. For biological monitoring, we recommend one of the following: 1. minimum-time census, rather than minimum-area census; 2. baiting in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats; 3. pitfall traps (baited or unbaited) in terrestrial habitats.",

Early studies of caves applied stratigraphic principles to karst deposits. The majority of cave deposits are breakdown and alluvium. The alluvial materials have been successfully investigated to determine ages of caves, landscape evolution, paleoenvironmental conditions, and paleobiota. Rapid stage changes and the possibility of pipe-full flow make cave deposits different than surface deposits. This and other factors present difficulties with interpreting the cave record, but extended preservation is afforded by the “roofing” of deposits. Dating by magnetism or isotopes has been successful in many locations. Caves can be expected to persist for 10 Ma in a single erosive cycle; most cave sediments should be no older than this.",

    "abstract": "The age of a karst can be defined as the time when the karst rocks were uplifted out of the sea. The other view of the age of karst is to define the age of certain karst features or assemblages of karst features. On the Kras plateau there is a variety of forms that were formed at quite different times, but due to karst evolution, they coexist in today's relief. On the plateau, that is slowly rising, the hydrological zones in karst surface are moving downwards. Streams from the side ceased to flow on the karst and former leveled surface that was formed in conditions of high ground water is dissected by numerous dolines. Blind valleys are incised at the side and some of them show the influence of recent tectonics. The lowering of relief by corrosion exposes caves that have formed deep beneath the surface and creates unroofed caves that become a part of the surface topography. From the morphological comparison of the unroofed caves, blind valleys and levelled surfaces and by dating of the sediment and considering the age of tectonic phases we can reconstruct the evolution and estimate the age of the karst landscape.",

    "abstract": "Climate, and more generally the physical conditions in caves and other subterranean habitats have a profound influence on the biota. At longer time scale (centuries), climate change can force and/or isolate species in subterranean habitats. Not only Pleistocene climate changes, but earlier ones as well, suchas the Messinian salinity crisis were important in this regard. While many speleobiologists assume that caves are nearly constant environmentally and withscarce organic carbon, this is not the case, especially in non-cave subterranean habitats. Many shal­low subterranean habitats, suchas epikarst, seepage springs, and talus harbor highly modified organisms, ones without eyes and pigment and withelongated appendages. Yet these habi­tats are highly variable withrespect to temperature and other environmental factors, and often have highlevels of organic carbon. Overall, the role of these shallow subterranean habitats in the evolution and biogeography of subterranean species may be crucial. On smaller spatial scales, environmental differences, suchas differences in chemistry of epikarst water, may be im­portant in allowing large numbers of species to coexist.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between ancient Greek texts and the physical possibility of focused, distal flow of terrestrial fresh water through the seabed, particularly offshore of karstic coasts. The four ancient texts which were analyzed describe powerful discharges from submarine springs in the eastern Black Sea; the local transport of groundwater through the bed of Turkey’s Bay of Miletus; alleged subterranean–submarine connections between coastal western Turkey and the Greek northeast Peloponnese; and alleged connections between the coastal western Peloponnese and southeastern coastal Sicily. The plausibility or implausibility of these legends was assessed in the context of modern reports indicating that seabed pathways can transport continental fresh water up to 60 km offshore. Other reports identify fresh water in the seabed as far as 160 km offshore, presumably due to marine-induced forces. These documented cases validated ancient claims of nearshore groundwater transport and legitimized transoceanic claims as mythologized extrapolations of local karstic hydrogeology. As submarine fresh groundwater becomes increasingly important in understanding material transport and in identifying potentially exploitable coastal water supplies, ancient stories from past civilizations may give clues to offshore sites meriting further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Epikarst is a weathered zone of enhanced porosity on or near the surface or at the soil/bedrock contact of many karst landscapes. The epikarst is essentially the upper boundary of a karst system but is also a reaction chamber where many organics accumulate and react with the percolating water. The epikarst stores and directs percolating recharge waters to the underlying karst aquifers. Epikarst permeability decreases with depth below the surface. The epikarst may function as a perched aquifer with a saturated zone that transmits water laterally for some distance until it drains slowly through fractures or rapidly at shaft drains or dolines. Stress-release and physical weathering as well as chemical dissolution play a role in epikarst development. Epikarst may be found on freshly exposed carbonates although epikarst that develops below a soil cover should form at a faster rate due to increased carbon dioxide produced by vegetation. The accumulation of soil within the fractures may create plugs that retard the downward movement of percolating water and creates a reservoir rich in organic material. The thickness of the epikarst zone typically ranges from a few meters to 15 meters, but vertical weathering of joints may be much deeper and lead to a “stone forest” type of landscape. Some dolines are hydrologically connected directly to the epikarst while other dolines may drain more directly to the deeper conduit aquifer and represent a “hole” in the epikarst. Water stored in the epikarst may be lost to evapotranspiration, move rapidly down vertical shafts or larger joints, or drain out slowly through the soil infillings and small fractures. Much of the water pushed from the epikarst during storms is older water from storage that is displaced by the new event water.Keywords: epikarst, recharge, vadose zone, karst.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.672",

    "abstract": "Carbonate minerals comprise the largest reservoir of carbon in the earth’s lithosphere, but they are generally assumed to have no net impact on the global carbon cycle if rapid dissolution and precipitation reactions represent equal sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon. Observations of both terrestrial and marine carbonate systems indicate that carbonate minerals may simultaneously dissolve and precipitate within different portions of individual hydrologic systems. In all cases reported here, the dissolution and precipitation reactions are related to primary production, which fixes atmospheric CO2 as organic carbon, and the subsequent remineralization in watersheds of the organic carbon to dissolved CO2. Deposition of carbonate minerals in the ocean represents a flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. The dissolution of oceanic carbonate minerals can act either as a sink for atmospheric CO2 if dissolved by carbonic acid, or as a source of CO2 if dissolved through sulfide oxidation at the freshwater-saltwater boundary. Since dissolution and precipitation of carbonate minerals depend on ecological processes, changes in these processes due to shifts in rainfall patterns, earth surface temperatures, and sea level should also alter the potential magnitudes of sources and sinks for atmospheric CO2 from carbonate terrains, providing feedbacks to the global carbon cycle that differ from modern feedbacks.Keywords: Global carbon cycle, carbonate terrains, organic carbon fixation, remineralization, carbonate mineral dissolution, carbonate mineral precipitation.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.660",

Two major karst types described are a) evolutionary karst which implies continuous karstification but at different stage of maturation and b)rejuvenated karst which is formed by reactivating a formerly developed and subsequently ceased karst structure either by an uplift and/or a drastic decline of erosion base. Description of karst types considering both morphology and hydrogeology revealed that distribution of specific karst types is compatible with the neotectonic evolution of Turkey. Karst in all provinces except the Black Sea and Western Anatolian regions, is developed under the effect of the energy gradient provided by uplift. Different rates of uplift created different sub-types of karst. The climate effect was evaluated as a secondary factor for it has a role of shaping/re-shaping the karst forms rather than controlling the physical and chemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Karst terranes exhibit spectacular landforms that are often exploited as natural parks and show caves, and hosts very important natural resources. Further, karst terranes cover 20% of the Earth’s surface and provides 20−25% of high-quality groundwater for drinking water. The fragility of karst environments makes it highly vulnerable to a variety of different geological hazards (or geo-hazards). This is due to its peculiar geological and hydrological features such as sinkholes and caves. In particular, the strict connection between surface and subsurface features emphasizes the fragile nature of karst. The occurrence of geo-hazards in karst terranes greatly differs from other natural settings. Natural and man-induced subsidence and sinkholes, slope movements favored by karst conduits and caves, flash floods related to inability of the system to manage water from heavy rainstorms, and pollution caused directly or indirectly by human actions are the main types of geo-hazards typical of karst terranes. Although mostly related to natural processes, their occurrence and consequent damage to both the natural and anthropogenic environment are often caused or exacerbated by man. As a consequence, management of karst terranes cannot be enacted without taking into account the peculiar features and behavior of karst terranes and aquifers, and the delicate balance with the different types of geo-hazards that may occur. Specific management actions should, therefore, be pursued in this fragile environment, with the intention of safeguarding the natural resources, biota, and population.Naravne nesreče na Krasu: Vzročni dejavniki in vprašanja upravljanjaKraška območja odlikujejo spektakularne reliefne oblike, ki so pogosto povod za ustanovitev naravnih parkov ali turističnih jam, ter pomembne naravne vire. Kras pokriva okoli 20% kopnega in zagotavlja okoli 20−25 % potreb po pitni vodi. Krhkost kraških okolij so razlog za njihovo visoko dovzetnost za različne geološke in druge naravne nesreče. Razlogi so v posebnih geoloških in hidroloških značilnostih, kot so vrtače in jame. Krhko naravo krasa zlasti poudarja tesna povezava med površinskimi in podzemnimi oblikami. Pojavljanje naravnih nesreč v krasu se močno razlikuje od tistih v drugih naravnih okoljih. Naravno in s strani človeka povzročeno pogrezanje, udori in plazenje so pod močnim vplivom kraških kanalov in jam. Poplave so povezane z nezmožnostjo sistema prevajati nalivne vode. Onesnaženje, ki ga človek povzroči posredno ali neposredno s svojimi aktivnostmi, so poglavitne nesreče v krasu. Čeprav so naravne nesreče večinoma povezane z naravnimi procesi, njihovo pojavljanje in posledično škodo tako za naravno kot antropogeno okolje pogosto povzroča ali pospeši človek. Upravljanje kraških območij zato ne more biti načrtovano brez upoštevanja specifičnih lastnosti in obnašanja kraških pokrajin, vodonosnikov in krhkega ravnotežja med različnimi vrstami nesreč, ki se lahko pojavijo. Zato bi bilo z namenom varovanja naravnih virov, živih bitij in prebivalstva treba uvesti posebne ukrepe upravljanja v tem občutljivem okolju.",

The main changes in environmental parameters are the following: 1. cave air temperature rises 0.2 °C by 1000 visitors/day; 2. a daily increase between 2 and 3 % in relative air humidity, reaching saturation on summer days; 3. CO2 concentration in air increases up to values between 500 and 700 ppm during low visitability periods and 10 times the background value during high visitability periods (2.800 ppm); 4. temperature of the rock rises between 0.02 °C and 0.15 °C/day, and (5) PCO2 of drip water also presents variations, increasing during the big influx of visits and decreasing the saturation index of carbonated minerals.",

This paper integrates karst hydrology with ancient myths and travelogues describing natural features in Arcadia and Argolis of the Greek Peloponnese. The karstic landscapes of these two regions were figuratively represented in the interrelated myths of the Danaids, Poseidon, and Amymone. In a nonmythical report of a historical occurrence, a deer hunter chased a deer into the temporarily flooded polje of ancient Stymphalus, but a sudden dislodging of the sinkhole debris plug caused the lake to drain so rapidly that the hunter and his prey were suctioned helplessly down into the whirlpool. Other ancient narratives described the subterranean connection of the Stymphalian polje and the Argolic springs of Erasinus. Some accounts stemmed from an ancient religious practice of throwing items into waters to propitiate the water gods: In one case, the watery disposition of propitiatory wreaths was determined by interweavings of the surface and subsurface components of the two karstic rivers named Alpheus and Eurotas. In other ancient accounts, certain rivers were said to sink underground at the coastline, travel through the bed of a bay or sea, and resurge as subaerial freshwater springs on the opposite shore of the saline waterbody.",

In order to char-acterize this vegetation type, samples were compared to the 6 plant communities occurring in the neighbourhood of the dolines. Considering the vegetation texture and species com-position, the vegetation of the dolines resembles mainly the extrazonal beechwoods (Helleboro odori-fagetum) and local ravine forests (Scutellario altissimae-Aceretum) that preserve several mountain, subatlantic relict species in this area. Our study revealed that the plant communities characteristic of the karst surface of Western Mecsek are arranged along a moisture and nutrient gradient. In this system, the habitat conditions of the dolines are similar to those of the beech forests and the lo-cal ravine forests, fresh and relatively rich in nutrients. In the karst, dominated by oak-hornbeam and beech forests, effects of the thermal inversion are the most spectacular where beech forests follow turkey oak-sessile oak forests and oak-hornbeam forests on the lower part of the doline slopes. The described vegetation type of these depressions is developed by edafic fac-tors; its identification as a separate association is not supported by the analyses.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 33% of China is karstic. The most extensive karst areas are in southwestern China and cover approximate­ly 540,000 km2. Southwestern China hosts some of the most typical karst landforms in the world and has important high-quality karst water resources. Due to the rapid development of China, karst waters are threatened by various types of con­tamination. Detail field and laboratory investigations in five provinces including several cities in southwestern China were conducted in 2008 and 2009. Eighty-three springs and under­ground rivers were surveyed and water samples collected from eachfor laboratory analyses for major ions. Four main types of karst aquifer contamination were identified based on con­taminant sources: rural and agricultural pollution, pollution from urban development and industry, pollution from mining, and accidental groundwater pollution. Several representative instances for eachtype of contamination and their impacts on the environment are discussed in more detail. Contamination countermeasures of karst waters and a framework for overall management of karst water resources in southwestern China are provided.",

This municipality is the primary calling card for tourism in the state and is one of the most developed areas of ecotourism and speleotourism in the country. The tourism there is entitled ecotourism, and is designed to be sustainable. The present case study focuses on the ecologically sustainable aspects of the speleotourism practiced there, especially the proposals for tourist carrying capacity adopted. The results and discussion provide suggestions for the adoption of a different formulation of carrying capacity focusing on both operational and quantitative aspects. Ecologically sustainable speleotourism in the Serra da Bodoquena should be possible as long as new proposals limiting visitation are adopted which conform to technical environmental management procedures and consider the interests of local stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Within the Cerna Valley in southwestern Romania, over a 100 caves were formed in the Jurassic and Cretaceous limestone that outcrops on the valley walls. Three aspects are prominent when entering most of the caves in this region: the presence of considerable gypsum deposits, the amount of guano, and the cave temperature. High temperature anomalies are uncommon in the cave environment. In certain caves in the lower part of Cerna Valley, however, one can measure air temperatures as high as 40°C. This situation is due to the presence of thermal water pooling or flowing through the caves or to the hot steam that rises along fractures from deeper thermal water pools. As a result, these caves provide a unique set of conditions that allowed for the deposition of a suite of unusual minerals. This study presents the results of fifty-seven mineral samples that were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, geochemical, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope analyses with the scope of linking the cave minerals with likely hypogene speleogenetic processes. Here we document the occurrence of twenty-two secondary cave minerals, among which, apjonite and tamarugite are the first recorded occurrences in a limestone cave environment. The minerals fall into three distinct associations: sulfate-dominated (Diana Cave), phosphate-dominated (Adam Shaft), and sulfate-phosphate-nitrate-rich assemblage (Great Sălitrari Cave). Additional isotopic measurements (δ34S) performed on sulfate speleothems contribute valuable information on both minerals and cave origins.",

    "abstract": "Apulija v južni Italiji je eno izmed »klasičnih« kraških ozemelj italijanskega polotoka, saj je pretežno na močno zakraselih karbonatnih kamninah. Površinske oblike so predvsem kraškega nastanka in že dolgo časa predmet posebnih raziskav. Tri glavne podregije, na katere je običajno razdeljena Apulija (od severa proti jugu: polotok Gargano, planota Murge in polotok Salento), so bile v preteklosti podvržene kompleksnim in močno različnim družbenim in zgodovinskim dogajanjem. Zaradi tega so nastala v raznih delih Apulije, z jezikoslovnega gledišča zelo različna, narečja. Zaradi tega so izrazi, ki jih ljudje v Apuliji uporabljajo za označevanje kraških oblik, tako površinskih kot podzemeljskih, izredno različni. Te izraze so uporabljali nekdaj, a jih tudi še danes. V prispevku so predstavljeni nekateri teh izrazov, uporabljanih za označevanje najpomembnejših kraških oblik. Te izraze skuša avtor analizirati na podlagi geografske razprostranjenosti, etimologije z oziroma na krajevna narečja in oblike ter nastanka opisanih pojavov. Opozorjeno je tudi na današnje primere napačne rabe takih izrazov na krasu v Apuliji.Apulia region, in southern Italy, is one of the classical karst areas of the Italian peninsula, being underlain for most of its extension by intensely karstified carbonate rocks. The landscape presents essentially landforms of karstic origin, which have been the object of specific studies for a long time. The three main geographical sub-regions into which Apulia is generally divided (from north to south, the Gargano Promontory, the Murge plateau, and the Salento peninsula) have been characterized in the past centuries by complex and different social and historical events. These resulted in the development, from a linguistical point of view, of very distinct dialects in different parts of Apulia. The terms used to describe the karst landforms, both at the surface and underground, had subsequently been, and still are, extremely variable throughout the region. This paper illustrates some terms used in Apulia to designate and describe the main geomorphological manifestations of the karst landscape. An attempt is made to analyze the terms on the basis of: i) geographical distribution; ii) etymology, with reference to the local dialects; iii) morphological features and genesis of described landforms. Some cases of misuse of terms in the Apulian karst, even in recent times, are also pointed out.",

    "abstract": "Namen te študije je pokazati tektonske poteze v izbranih kraških poljih in manjših kotanjah Dinarskega krasa. Vrtine in gravimetrične meritve so ugotovile debele neogene nesprijete sedimente in apneniško dno pod gladino morja - kriptodepresije. Sedimenti so deli obsežne akumulacijske ravnine, ugreznjeni v kraška polja v spodnjem pliocenu. Seizmična aktivnost v sedanjosti nakazuje še trajajočo tektonsko aktivnost. Najgloblje (čez 100 m) in najmanjše kraško polje v slovenskem Dinarskem krasu, Globodol, je suho kraško polje v piezometrični vodni gladini. Pliokvartarno grezanje dna je edina možna razlaga za nastanek polja. Na Planinskem polju so znaki podtalne korozije in holocenskega tektonskega grezanja dna. Štiri kraška polja v Ravnih kotarih (Dalmacija) dokazujejo proces uravnavanja jezerskega dna pod plitvim pokrovom aluvialnih sedimentov. Izjemno globoke majhne kotanje so okoli 450 m globoko Rdeče jezero (Hercegovina) in kotanji pri Črnomlju in Kočevju (Slovenija), okoli 300 m oziroma 100 m pod gladino morja. The aim of this study is to show tectonic features in selected poljes and minor basins in the Dinaric Karst. Boreholes and gravimetric measurements show thick Neogene loose sediments and the rocky bottom below the sea level - real cryptodepressions. The sediments make parts of a large plain that subsided at the end of the low Pliocene. The recent seismic activity in this area proves the ongoing tectonic process. The deepest (more than 100 m) and the smallest polje in the Slovenian Dinaric karst, Globodol is a dry polje in the piezometric level. Quaternary subsidence of the bottom is the only reasonable explanation of its genesis. On Planinsko polje there are signs ob suballuvial corrosion and the indicators of the Holocene tectonic subsidence. Four poljes in the Ravni kotari (Dalmatia) are shallow basins in the first stage of development. They prove the process of the bottom levelling below the shallow cover of alluvial sediments. An extremely deep small basin is about 450 m deep Red Lake (Hercegovina) and small basins at Črnomelj and Kočevje (Slovenia), 300 m and 100 m deep below the sea level.",

Medtem ko je bilo v literaturi precej razpravljanja o verjetnem nastanku in pomenu teh oblik, pa je zelo malo podrobnih opisov teh oblik ter definicij tega pojma. Zato je s kupolami precej težav: Kaj je kupola? Kje se kupole pojavljajo? Kakšne so kupole? Ali so kupole povezane z določenimi drugimi oblikami? Ali so kupole oblike v stropu ali oblike, ki jih je strop prerezal? Kako kupole nastajajo? Kako lahko rešimo ta vprašanja? V prispevku je veliko odgovorov na ta vprašanja, toda večji del terenskih raziskav in teoretičnega dela bo treba šele opraviti. Najpomembnejša so podrobna terenska opazovanja in merjenja kupol ter tistih oblik, ki so z njimi povezane. Tako bo mogoče rešiti vprašanje kupol in tako bo mogoče izvedeti še več o nenavadnih jamah, v katerih se kupole pojavljajo.Cupolas are dome-shaped solution cavities that occur in karst caves, and have been described in both limestone and gypsum karst. While there has been considerable discussion in the literature concerning the likely origin and significance of these features, there has been little in the way of detailed description of the features themselves and little attention has been given to the definition of the term. Consequently, there are a number of troubles with cupolas: - What is a cupola? Where do cupolas occur? What are cupolas like? Do cupolas occur with particular types of speleogens? Are cupolas features of ceilings or features intersected by ceilings? How do cupolas form? But how can these troubles be resolved? Tentative answers are given here to many of these questions but a great deal of basic field observation and theoretical work is required to solve them. The most important step would be more field observation and measurement of cupolas and of the particular suite of speleogens that occur with them. The troubles with cupolas can be solved and in the process we will come to understand a great deal more about the unusual caves in which they occur.",

This is the largest cave system in the so-called isolated karst whichconsists of limestone patches of &lt;1 to 10 km2 in size in central and northeastern Slovenia. Huda luknja is developed in one of these patches measuring about 1 km2 in the Triassic limestones—the Paka karst. The researchfocused on the investigation of the epikarst fauna in NE Slo­venia. Temperature, conductivity, hardness and concentrations of various ions in water were measured. Considerable spatial and temporal variation in parameters existed among the drips. However, there was no correlation between the community structure and the parameters. There are six aquatic species and 19 terrestrial species in the epikarst of the Paka isolated karst. In the drips, individuals of epigean, epikarstic and hypogean aquatic taxa as well as terrestrial taxa belonging to the same groups as those in caves in the Dinaric karst were found. Unlike the Dinaric karst, the most abundant group was oligochaetes, not copepods. In general, the biotic diversity diminished from the entrance to deep in the cave. More investigation in the iso­lated karst is required to decide either this is the specific charac­teristic of this karst patchor a general phenomenon of isolated karst.",

    "abstract": "Karst provides a critical physical backdrop for much of the Caribbean's history and many of its existing environmental, agricultural, economic and cultural issues. The karstlands are challenging to human habitation, since they possess a broad array of natural hazards, but they are also at risk of degradation and vulnerable to environmental change. The karst has a rich legacy of pre-Colombian settlement and contains many regional archaeological sites. Unsustainable European colonial agricultural practices degraded the vegetation and landscape severely. The karstlands also played a major role in resistance to colonial authority, and were used by Maroons as both refuges and bases for harassment and guerilla actions. Following emancipation and independence, the karst became a basis for subsistence agriculture, increasingly yielding to commercial agriculture, urbanization and industrial activities, and tourism. Despite hazards such as drought and flooding, human impacts on the karstlands have been long-term and severe. Regional predictions are that anthropogenic climatic change will lead to rising sea levels, changing precipitation totals and the increasing frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and hurricanes. The effects of all these changes will be magnified in the karst, particularly with respect to karst hydrology. Climate change and other human impacts will increasingly threaten already at-risk and vulnerable ecosystems and human communities, necessitating integration of climate change parameters and the adoption of appropriate risk management measures.",

The application of these meth­ods on selected test sites in Montenegro, Algeria and Serbia are described. These methods were applied as part of the researchprogramme conducted in the catchment of Mlava Spring, the largest spring in the Carpathian karst of Serbia.

    "abstract": "Lithostratigraphy and geologic structures are major controls on groundwater flow in alpine karst systems. Understanding these factors is important for the delimitation of drinking water pro­tection zones. The Winterstaude mountain chain, western Aus­tria, belongs to the Helvetic nappes and consists of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, including two karstifiable formations: Örfla and Schrattenkalk Limestone (lower and upper karst aquifer), separated by 60 m of marl. Strata are folded and cut by faults withdisplacements of 40–70 m. Folded carbonate rocks con­tinue below the alluvial valley floor so that the karst system can be subdivided in shallow and deep phreatic zones. This area is suitable for studying the combined influence of folds and faults on groundwater flow in a double-aquifer system. A multi-trac­er test withseven injections aimed at characterising hydraulic connections and linear flow velocities. Results show that (i) plunging synclines form the main drainage pathways in the up­per karst aquifer, withmaximum linear velocities of 91 m/h, while anticlines act as water divides; (ii) recharge into the lower aquifer, whichforms the central ridge of the mountain chain, contributes to springs discharging from the upper aquifer near the foot of the mountain (local flow systems); (iii) the two aq­uifers are hydraulically connected, presumably via faults, be­cause their displacements are in the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the intervening marl; (iv) flow in the upper aquifer continues below the valley floor toward the river, withmaximum velocities of 22 m/h(intermediate flow system).",

    "abstract": "Alpine glaciers store large amounts of freshwater contributing to groundwater recharge during warmer periods, but the inter­actions between glaciers and aquifers have rarely been inves­tigated in detail. The Tsanfleuron-Sanetscharea, Switzerland, is an ideal test site to study glacier-aquifer interactions. It con­sists of a rapidly retreating glacier (2.8 km2) overlying a karst aquifer drained by a spring (mean discharge 600–700 L/s) used for drinking water supply and irrigation. The geometry and structure of the glacier were assessed by means of geophysical surveys, using radiomagnetotellurics (RMT). The estimated ice volume is 1.0 x 108 m3 (0.92 x 108 m3 water equivalent), but the glacier currently loses 1.5 m ice thickness per year. Field obser­vations, flow measurements and tracer tests allowed character­isation of glacier drainage and aquifer recharge. Three recharge pathways have been identified: 1) The main glacial stream sinks into the aquifer via swallow holes 3 km downstream of the glacier mouth; 2) Numerous small meltwater streams sink underground shortly below the glacier front; 3) Subglacial meltwaters and supraglacial streams sink into the glacier via moulins and contribute to aquifer recharge throughfractures and swallow holes underneaththe glacier. Recharge and spring discharge display strong diurnal and seasonal variability, witha general high-flow period during snow and glacier melt from spring to autumn. Preliminary predictions of the future avail­ability of spring water after disappearance of the glacier suggest that the discharge may decrease by 20–30%. Nearly all of this loss will occur in summer and autumn, presumably resulting in temporary water shortage.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the use of computers and the digital techniques for survey processing easily allows to carry out morphometric analysis of caves and karst systems. Morphometric indices have been proposed by many authors in order to describe the genetic features of some particular types of caves, suchas coastal ones, maze caves or isolated voids. Large cave systems can be analyzed throughthe reconstruction of a 3D model. The digital model can be used to evaluate the role of the structural setting or the evolution stages throughthe recognizing of particular levels where epi-phreatic passages are more developed. These levels are particularly significant when a lithological or structural control can be excluded. Some morphometric indices, obtained by the ratios of simple dimension parameters of caves, allow the statistical analysis of large databases, collected in the regional speleological inventories, in the attempt to recognize different geomorphic populations of caves. Further studies and a greater number of analysis could allow to use these morphometric indices to distinguishgenetic categories of caves and to get a useful instrument for the study of the evolution of karst areas.",

Geothermal heat and external climate are the main drivers of the cave’s air temperature, but the ice forming and ablation processes modulate its spatial and temporal characteristics. In the winter half-year, cold air inflow leads to the overcooling of the cave atmosphere and walls and ice formation; while in summer, melting of ice acts as strong thermal sink, keeping the air temperature at 0 °C. In autumn and winter, dynamic cooling of the cave atmosphere leads to ice build-up, whereas in summer, the causality is overturned, the cave air temperature being controlled by the melting ice. The existence of a net heat sink in the cave (melting ice in summer in this case), leads to the overcooling of the non-glaciated parts of the cave as well, a phenomenon that can hamper paleoclimatic reconstructions based on stable isotope studies in speleothems.",

    "abstract": "Significance of hydrological variability in karst is presented, which also discusses factors inducing such variability and consequences it may cause. Groundwater flow in karst aquifers is often characterized by strong variability of flow dynamics in response to different hydrologic conditions within a short time period. Consequently, water table fluctuations are often in the order of tens of meters, differences in flow velocities between low- and high-flow conditions can reach ten or even more times. In dependence to respective hydrologic conditions groundwater flow also results in variations of flow directions, and thus in contribution of different parts of the aquifer to a particular spring. The described hydrological variability has many implications for contaminant transport, groundwater availability and vulnerability. Groundwater level rising reduces thickness of the unsaturated zone and decreases protectiveness of the overlying layers. Higher water flow velocities reduce underground retention. Due to more turbulent flow, transport and remobilization of solute and insoluble matter is more effective. During high-flow conditions there is usually more surface flow and hence more concentrated infiltration underground. Particularly in karst systems that show very high hydrologic variability, this should be considered to correctly characterize, understand or predict the aquifers’ hydrological behaviour and to prepare proper protection strategies.Keywords: karst aquifer, temporal hydrological variability, groundwater flow, transport processes, karst spring, water source protection.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2.644",

In this context, the exact timing of when the gypsum nucleation started and whether its growthhas been constant over time, have been investigated. The preliminary data obtained withthe U–Th disequilibrium method show significant differences in ages for gypsum (between 191 ± 13 kyr for one of the Ojo de la Reina cave crystals and 57 ± 1.7 kyr for the base of Espadas cave’s spar) and have produced a coarse chronological interval of growth. The crystal depositional rates vary from 0.56 to 1.22 mm/kyr, in excellent agreement withthe laboratory tests for gypsum deposition under present conditions performed in the deepest part of the mine. These results are also consistent witha multistage precipitation started at different times in the Naica caves (first in caves at the upper level, where gypsum was subsequently dissolved, and only later in the deeper part of the aquifer under stable conditions) and allow us to improve the knowledge on the speleogenetic evolution of these caves.",

By the analysis of the morphometrical/morphological features of the about 600 initially identified sinkholes, about 50% were interpreted as collapse sinkholes related to karst phenomena, whichare the object of this study. These were geo-referred and organised in a data base, in whichinformation on the geological-structural and hydrogeological features of areas affected by the collapses was also reported. The collapse sinkhole inventory was paralleled by an analysis of the distribution of the main mineral springs (H2S- and CO2- richwaters), of travertine bodies and of extensional faults withlate Quaternary activity, whichwere all considered significant to the study due to the interrelations linking travertines, karst solution processes, CO2- richwaters and faults. Furthermore, withthe aim of investigating the role of seismic shaking in the occurrence of the collapses, the karst collapse sinkhole distribution was compared withthe distribution of stronger historical earthquake epicentres. The results of this regional scale synthesis suggests a possible key to the interpretation of karst collapse phenomena. The latter, in fact, appear correlated to the combination of peculiar conditions, whichmay be envisaged in the presence of active faults and mineral waters. The study, in particular, suggests that karst collapse sinkholes result from enhanced dissolution phenomena related to the rising of fluids of deep origin, for which active faults represent preferred pathways, and favoured by the presence of a relatively shallow water table. In the collapse events, an important role is possibly played by seismic shaking.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic alterations in show caves are well documented in scientific literature. One of the main sources of perturbation derives from visitors, acting as carriers of propagules and organic matter in the cave ecosystems. Such perturbation generally results in a significant alteration of the natural subterranean microbiota. In this study, we characterize the mycobiota of the superficial alluvial sediment (0–5 cm) of the Bossea show cave (NW-Italy) over two sampling seasons, aiming to investigate whether anthropogenic rather than natural factors contribute to the colonization and proliferation of alien mycobiota in the cave environment. We placed eighteen sampling plots at different distances from the touristic pathway that crosses the cave. The distance from the touristic pathway was used as proxy to sort the sampling plots in three groups according the degree of anthropogenic disturbance (high: 0–2 m; intermediate 2–40 m; low: >100 m). Moreover, in order to elucidate the potential effect of other factors, we introduced in our analysis the distance from the subterranean river and the distance from the cave entrance. In each plot, we collected two samples of alluvial sediment, in winter and summer. Fungi were isolated from each sample and identified by means of an integrated morphological approach. We observed a rich and diversified fungal community – 63 taxa of Zygomycota and Ascomycota plus several unidentified yeasts – consisting of both native and alien species. Regression analysis points out a decrease of the abundance and the diversity of viable propagules at increasing distances from the touristic pathway rather than the cave entrance or the subterranean river. Accordingly, the exogenous organic materials passively conveyed by tourists, possibly explains the higher proliferation of alien species in the proximity of the touristic pathway. There was also a seasonal variation in the diversity and abundance of propagules, which we interpreted in light of the peculiar microclimate of the cave. In a second step, we used Indicator Species Analysis to identify the most representative species of the different levels of anthropogenic disturbance. In particular, Aspergillus spelunceus was found to be indicator of low disturbance, whereas Mucor corticola and A. asperescens were found to be indicators of intermediate and high disturbance, respectively.Key words: anthropic disturbance, alluvial sediment, alien species, airborne fungi, environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "Anisotropy and heterogeneity of karstified rocks make them the most problematic media for various interventions which are needed in engineering practice. The long history of attempts to adapt karstic nature to human needs started with the utilization of karstic aquifers: tapping large springs, transferring their waters to the long distances, improving minimal flows or capturing fresh water in coastal areas. During the 20th century the number of other challenges such as building dam and reservoirs, and constructing roads and railways, bridges, tunnels, new settlements open a new era in engineering works but also in collecting new knowledge and experience for the karstology and hydrogeology sciences. Today, almost no engineering projects can be implemented without a proper environmental impact assessment, which establishes a better balance between human and ecological needs.Inženirski izzivi v KrasuAnizotropija in heterogenost zakraselih kamnin sta lastnosti, ki povzročata, da so te najbolj problematičen medij za različne posege, ki so potrebni v inženirski praksi.

Mineralogical study proved relatively uniform mineral composition of the light fraction indicating the main source from weathered sediments of Eocene flysch. Some minerals are derived from weathering profiles and crusts (e.g. gibbsite). Detailed magnetostratigraphic investigations of three profiles defined normal and reverse polarity magnetozones and shows the correlation between the profiles in the Divaška Jama and Trhlovca Cave. The narrow normal magnetozones probably correlate with the Jaramillo polarity event (0.90 to 0.97 Ma) of the Matuyama epoch. Those data indicate the substantial age of cave in which the last phase of filling started before 0.97 Ma and finished before the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary, i.e. around 0.73 Ma. Magnetostratigraphic data of the Divača profile detected two narrow normal magnetozones in the long reverse polarity zone which probably correlate with Olduvai and Reunion polarity events (about 1.67 to 1.87 Ma) of reverse Matuyama epoch or with some of normal magnetozones (about 3.8 to 5.0 Ma) within reverse Gilbert epoch. Data indicate the possibility that the cave was originated during the Messinian period characteristic by sea-level fall and evolution of deep karst in the Mediterranean Basin.",

Beside these simply drowned features, some new ones were formed by the sea level rise. Those are submarine springs, so called vruljas, brackish coastal springs and marine lakes.

    "abstract": "Coastal limestone outcrops, typically with advanced levels of diagenetic maturity (i.e., are telogenetic carbonates), were ex­amined on NorthIsland (Raglan Harbour, Kawhia Harbour, Napier, and Waipu Cove) and SouthIsland (Pohara, Paturau River, Punakaiki, Kakanui, and Kaikoura), New Zealand, to de­termine if flank margin caves, produced by mixing dissolution, were present. In coastal settings, caves in carbonate rock can be the outcome of pseudokarst process, primarily wave erosion, as well as karst processes not associated with freshand sea-water mixing suchas epikarst features and conduit-flow stream caves. Flank margin caves were successfully differentiated from other cave types by the following criteria: phreatic dissolutional mor­phologies at the wall rock and chamber scales; absence of high-velocity, turbulent-flow wall sculpture and sediment deposits; and lack of integration of adjacent caves into a continuous flow path. The active tectonics of New Zealand creates a variable sea-level situation. The relatively short time of sea-level stability lim­its the size of the New Zealand flank margin caves compared to tectonically-stable environments, suchas the Bahamas, where glacioeustasy alone controls sea-level stability. Uplift events can be identified as slow and steady when the flank margin caves are uniformly elongated in the vertical direction, and episodic when the flank margin caves show widening and tube develop­ment at discrete horizons that cut across rock structure. New Zealand flank margin caves contain information on uplift dura­tion and rates independent of other commonly used measures, and therefore can provide a calibration to other methods.",

    "abstract": "Loess “caves” (piping caverns, wells, tunnels) exposed in loess cliffs are rare pseudokarst landforms that can be regarded as morphological equivalents to collapse dolines or sinkholes formed in classical karst terrains. This study presents the results of an investigation into a loess cave exposed in a loess cliff on the right bank of the Danube River near the village of Surduk in the Vojvodina region, Serbia. This study provides a first detailed morphologic description of this young pseudokarstic landform formed by piping erosion, probably partly supported with carbonate dissolution. The loess “cave” has a height of approximately 12 m and average diameter of around 3.5 m. In the middle of the cave ceiling there is a window. Observations indicate that over the last several years, the morphological characteristics of the landform have been stable. The main aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the evolution of the piping process in the thick loess-paleosol sequences in the Vojvodina region, northern Serbia. A key role in the genesis of this landform was the short distance between an initial loess doline and a cliff exposing loess sediments, providing the possibility for the lateral removal of loess material. The presence of Robinia pseudoakacia trees around the initial depression modulated the evolution of the doline and provides support for the loess cavern roof. The nature of the dynamic erosional processes on the steep cliffs of the soft loess sediment indicates a very limited lifetime of this pseudokarstic landform.",

    "abstract": "Features including colonization routes (stream capture) and the existence of both epigean and cave-adapted hypogean populations make Astyanax mexicanus an attractive system for investigating the subterranean evolutionary time necessary for acquisition of the troglomorphic form. Using published sequences, we have estimated divergence times for A. mexicanus using: 1) two different population-level mitochondrial datasets (cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase 2) with both strict and relaxed molecular clock methods, and 2) broad phylogenetic approaches combining fossil calibrations and with four nuclear (recombination activating gene, seven in absentia, forkhead, and α-tropomyosin) and two mitochondrial (16S rDNA and cytochrome b) genes. Using these datasets, we have estimated divergence times for three events in the evolutionary history of troglomorphic A. mexicanus populations. First, divergence among cave haplotypes occurred in the Pleistocene, possibly correlating with fluctuating water levels allowing the colonization and subsequent isolation of new subterranean habitats. Second, in one lineage, A. mexicanus cave populations experienced introgressive hybridization events with recent surface populations (0.26-2.0 Ma), possibly also correlated with Pleistocene events. Finally, using divergence times from surface populations in the lineage without evidence of introgression as an estimate, the acquisition of the troglomorphic form in A. mexicanus is younger than 2.2 (fossil calibration estimates) – 5.2 (cytb estimate) Ma (Pliocene).",

In the eastern part of the canyon system a mountain displaying a dome shape morphology is located. According to OMEGA mineralogical data (OMEGA data orbit 531_3) and further studies the dome appears to consist of magnesium sulphate (kieserite), an evaporitic mineral also found on the Earth. Previous works highlighted the presence of karst-like landforms and morphologies that strongly resemble the evaporitic karst morphologies found on the Earth. Through the analysis of the new MRO HiRISE images we have investigated the Martian landform and the possible processes involved in their formation and shaping in great detail. The analysis carried out show that the landforms observed clearly indicate the presence of solutional processes that also acted in a selective way, highlighting that the Martian dome can be formed of dfferent materials (minerals, grain-size, ect.) with different solutional properties. The results of our observation also suggest that on the dome liquid water must have existed in the past for enough time so that the solution features we investigated could be formed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a case of very special hydrological behaviour of two neighbouring sinking karst rivers, Lika and Gacka, (Dinaric karst of Croatia), is analysed. The Lika River has a torrential hydrological regime. At the Sklope gauging station its minimum, mean and maximum measured discharges in the 1951-2005 period were: 0 (dry) m3/s : 24.5 m3/s : 729 m3/s. During the same period the Gacka River, at the Vivoze gauging station, had the following characteristic discharges: 2.29 m3/s ; 14.7 m3/s ; 71.0 m3/s. While the flow regime of the Lika River is characterised by extremely and very quick changes of discharges, the Gacka River flow regime is unusually uniform. The objective of the investigations made in this paper was to analyse the extremely different hydrological behaviour of the two neighbouring sinking rivers in order to find its reasons. Master depletion curves defined for the two analysed rivers shows that the karst aquifer of the Gacka River is much more abundant than Lika’ s. The difference in the water temperature regime of the two neighbouring rivers is extremely high. At the Lika-Bilaj gauging station the minimum, mean and maximum measured water temperatures in the period of 1964-1991 were: 0.6 °C ; 9.3 °C ; 21.4 °C. During the period of 1964-2005 the Gacka River, at the Covici gauging station had the following characteristic water temperatures: 6.4 °C : 9.1 °C : 11.6 °C. The resident time in the karst underground of water discharging from the Gacka karst springs is much longer than in the case of the Lika River. The most probable explanation for this unusual hydrological behaviour of the two neighbouring karst rivers is that water from the Lika River and its catchment recharges some karst springs of the Gacka River. It is concluded that the Lika River feeds the Gacka River with an average annual discharge of about 5.35 m3/s. This value is different during each year and depends on the hydrological situation. It is very probably higher during the wet years than during the dry ones.",

    "abstract": "Jewel and Wind Cave are two big barometric cave systems in SouthDakota, USA. The entrances of Jewel and Wind Cave are roughly 50 km apart, and until now it is unknown whether their entrances belong to two separate caves or to one muchlarger cave system. One possibility for testing these two competing hypotheses is to measure and analyse the climatic conditions in the vicinity of these entrances and within the caves in detail. In this context, the thermal conditions and air currents are crucial. These in turn can be characterised by the spatial and temporal patterns of the dynamics of air entering and leaving throughthe respective entrances; even thoughthese dynamics are coupled to atmospheric pressure fluctuations outside the caves, they differ for different cave systems and provide a “fingerprint” that has implications for the size and structure of individual cave systems. To give an example, Jewel and Wind Cave as the second and fourth-largest cave systems on earthshow some similarities, but many more noticeable differences regarding their climatological behaviour, despite their close proximity to eachother. The last big measurement campaigns on the climatic systems of the two barometric caves were carried out by Herb and Jan Conn in the 1960s, (Conn 1966). Despite their elementary work, the technical possibilities were very limited in those days. The self-constructed mechanical measurement equipment could only be used for basic measurements. Herb Conn was still able to identify the basic mechanism very clearly. He also carried out a number of different calculations on barometric air flow that remain important up to the present day. During the last 40 years, rapid electronic development has enabled us to use instruments that are far more precise and sensitive. The use of ultrasonic anemometers and dataloggers enables us to take more exact long term measurements. An extensive measurement programme was started in 2001 to fulfil several researchaims, and we are now in a position to decipher the different fingerprints of the caves muchmore reliably.",

Palaeokarst phenomena attest to a very long history of karstification while sediments in some caves offer insight into environmental change during the Quaternary. Limited financial and technical resources, political factors and the dangers posed by massive volumes of unexploded ordnance that remain after decades of war are major impediments to karst area documentation, analysis, planning and management. Assessment of karst extent based on aerial photographs and other remote sensing techniques is complicated by very extensive pseudokarst formed due to bombardment during past military conflicts, including hundreds of thousands of closed depressions formed in both carbonate and non-carbonate rocks. Notwithstanding such practical difficulties, the extent and importance of the karst is such that improved inventory at the national, provincial and local levels is required if satisfactory environmental management and sustainable social and economic development are to be achieved.",

In this paper, we report some meteoclimatic and hydrochemical data for different parts of the cave. Conductivity and water level data from La Gronda channel show that this system reacts rapidly to external meteoric events, indicating the presence of a conductive epikarst. Data on two different drips indicate that the physicochemical parameters, suchas conductivity, pH, δ13CDIC and drip rate depend on the local structural setting and water pathlength. The data presented show that Galleria delle Stalattiti (the focus of the paleoclimate research) has the most stable conditions in terms of temperature, and the dripwaters show constant pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, calcium and magnesium content and δ18O. Drip rate is not affected by rain events and displays long-term trends that require a longer period of monitoring for elucidating their nature. The preliminary data presented here corroborate the hypotheses suggesting Galleria delle Stalattiti as a good example of a \"deep\" hypogean system of Fairchild et al. (2007).",

    "abstract": "An effective carbon loading can be calculated from measured alkalinity and pH of karst waters. The carbon loading is independent of the degree of saturation of the water and does not depend on the water being in equilibrium with the carbonate wall rock. A substantial data base of spring water analyses accumulated by students over the past 40 years has been used to probe the CO2 generation, transport, and storage in a variety of drainage basins that feed karst springs. Carbon loading in the water exiting karst drainage basins depends on the rate of CO2 generation in the soils of the catchment areas and on the partitioning between CO2 dissolved in infiltration water and CO2 lost by diffusion upward to the atmosphere. For any given drainage basin there are also influences due to vegetative cover, soil type, and the fraction of the water provided by sinking stream recharge. Losses of CO2 back to the atmosphere occur by speleothem deposition in air-filled caves, by degassing of CO2 in spring runs, and by tufa deposition in spring runs. There are seasonal cycles of CO2 generation that relate growing season and contrasts in winter/summer rates of CO2 generation. Overall, it appears that karst aquifers are a net, but leaky, sink for atmospheric CO2.Keywords: CO2, karst aquifers, springs, carbon loading.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.659",

Accordingly, such systems have been receiving the attention of managers, environmental agencies and researchers, especially in recent years. The present study collected information regarding the cave invertebrate fauna of the Northwest region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, such as species richness and endemisms, besides the impacts and threats occurring in these environments, identifying caves and more vulnerable areas and proposing conservation actions. Three caves were identified as a priority for conservation: Lagoa Rica cave in Paracatu, and Lapa Nova and Lapa da Delza caves in Vazante. Another three areas were considered in need of conservation actions: regions of Arinos, Paracatu and Cabeceira Grande/Unaí. The main threat found in the area was the conversion of forests into pastures for cattle breeding, registered in the surroundings of 85% of the caves. The main recommendations were the recuperation of the surroundings, awareness raising of the population and biospeleological inventories in other caves of the area. The studied caves were very heterogeneous, presenting unique characteristics. Thus, the study of the highest possible number of caves of the region of interest is always recommended, to aid in conservation and action plans for cave fauna.",

    "abstract": "The epikarst is a permeable boundary between surface and subsurface environments and can be conceptualized as the vadose critical zone of epigenic karst systems which have not developed under insoluble cover. From a hydrologic perspective, this boundary is often thought of as being permeable in one direction only (down), but connectivity between the flow paths of water through the epikarst and the root systems of woody plants means that water moves both up and down across the epikarst. However, the dynamics of these flows are complex and highly dependent on variability in the spatial structure of the epikarst, vegetation characteristics, as well as temporal variability in precipitation and evaporative demand. Here we summarize insights gained from working at several sites on the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas, combining isotopic, hydrogeochemical, and ecophysiological methodologies. 1) Dense woodland vegetation at sites with thin to absent soils (0-30 cm) is in part supported by water uptake from the epikarst. 2) However, tree transpiration typically becomes water-limited in dry summers, suggesting that the plant-available fraction of stored water in the epikarst depletes quickly, even when sustained cave drip rates indicate that water is still present in the epikarst. 3) Flow paths for water that feeds cave drips become rapidly disconnected from the evaporation zone of the epikarst and out of reach for plant roots. 4) Deep infiltration and recharge does not occur in these systems without heavy or continuous precipitation that exceeds some threshold value. Thresholds are strongly correlated with antecedent potential evapotranspiration and rainfall, suggesting control by the moisture status of the epikarst evapotranspiration zone. The epikarst and unsaturated zone in this region can be conceptualized as a variably saturated system with storage in fractures, matrix porosity, and in shallow perched aquifers, most of which is inaccessible to the root systems of trees, although woody vegetation may control recharge thresholds.Keywords: hydraulic disconnection, precipitation thresholds, root zone, plant water use, recharge, epikarst storage, barometric pressure.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.670",

Special interest is attributed to the estimate of carbon flux by considering the conical karst as a whole system. It includes carbon input to karst area, soil respiration, SOC, soil CO2, particulate-dissolved and organic carbon, as well as dissolved organic carbon. The research was conducted between 2012 and 2015. Two study sites were selected to represent different morphological and hydrogeological settings. Carbon input was collected for one year round on the basis of conical hill topo-sequence. Carbon input included in this research was litter fall, plant residue, and organic fertilizer. Incorporated with field measurement, soil samples were also collected for SOC estimation. DIC and DOC were estimated from the underground river of Gilap. The results show that carbon flux in the Gunungsewu karst is favored by the agricultural land uses and practices. Accordingly, the organic carbon input to the karst area is governed by spatial distribution of agricultural land uses and practices. Organic carbon input tends to be in the order of organic fertilizer &gt; litter input &gt; and plant residue. Soil CO2 varies in depth and season. Soil organic carbon also varies seasonally, of which the higher content occurs in the rainy season. Most of the carbon is stored as SOC, 20 % is emitted to the atmosphere through soil respiration, and 9 % is transferred to the deeper zone through a hydrological cycle in the form of dissolved organic carbon and particulate-dissolved organic carbon. The results suggest that carbon sink in the karst area is ten order higher than that previously estimated from DIC.Key words: soil organic carbon, carbon flux, Gunungsewu, Java, karst carbon sink.",

The results were compared to a previous tracer test with similar injection characteristics (the same tracer, injection into shaft vs karren) but with a significantly different vadose zone thickness. For this purpose, direct information obtained through tracer breakthrough curves analysis was modified in accordance with the distance factor, normalised as a function of tracer mass injected, and expressed as a residence time distribution. A conceptual model of flow and transport duality through the karst system was elaborated: part of the tracer flows rapidly through the primary drainage channels, while the other part is predominantly characterised by prolonged retention in less permeable zones. The results obtained support the idea that the thickness of the vadose zone has a very strong influence on residence times and dispersion. The subsequent outflow of the tracer and its detection greatly depend on the meteorological conditions. Our study suggests that the greater the thickness of the vadose zone, the better its protective function. In addition, the study was also relevant from the regional perspective, in that it enabled us to identify more closely the location of the Adriatic–Black Sea watershed.Key words: karst hydrogeology, tracer test, unsaturated zone,conceptual model, groundwater flow and storage, source protection.Vplivi nezasičene cone na značilnosti toka podzemne vode in prenosa topnih snovi v gorskih kraških vodonosnikih - primer Javorniško - Snežniškega masiva (JZ Slovenija)Sledilni poskusi sodijo med metode, ki neposredno prikazujejo značilnosti toka podzemne vode. Zaradi oteženih ali omejenih dostopov do osnovnih podatkov, zahtevnosti terenskega dela in pričakovanega dolgotrajnega podaljšanja pojavljanja sledila se sledilni poskusi v gorskih kraških vodonosnikih redko izvajajo. Glavni namen te študije je bil boljše razumevanje procesov toka in skladiščenja v kraškem vodonosniku in njegovi nezasičeni (vadozni) coni, ki je lahko debela več sto metrov. Opravljen je bil sledilni poskus v osrednjem delu vodonosnika z injiciranjem v brezno. Rezultate smo primerjali s preteklim sledilnim poskusom s podobnimi lastnostmi injiciranja (enako sledilo, injiciranje v brezno oz. škraplje) toda s precejšnjo razliko v debelini vadozne cone. V ta namen so bile neposredne informacije, pridobljene z analizo sledilne krivulje, spremenjene v skladu s faktorjem razdalje, normalizirane kot funkcija količine uporabljenega sledila in izražene kot porazdelitev zadrževalnega časa. Izdelan je bil konceptualni model dvojnosti toka in prenosa topnih snovi skozi kraški sistem: del sledila se pretaka hitro skozi primarne drenažne kanale, medtem ko je za del tega značilno podaljšano zadrževanje v manj prepustnih območjih. Dobljeni rezultati podpirajo trditev, da debelina vadozne cone močno vpliva na zadrževalne čase in disperzijo. Poznejši odtok sledila in njegovo zaznavanje sta v veliki meri odvisna od meteoroloških razmer. Naša študija kaže, da je z večjo debelino vadozne cone njena zaščitna funkcija večja. Poleg tega je bila študija pomembna tudi z regionalnega vidika, saj nam je omogočila, da natančneje opredelimo jadransko-črnomorsko razvodnico.Ključne besede: kraška hidrogeologija, sledilni poskus, nezasičena cona, konceptualni model, tok in skladiščenje podzemne vode, zaščita vodnih virov.",

    "abstract": "Naravne poškodbe kapnikov v Postojnski jami so že dolgo znane. Odlomljene in nagnjene stalagmite je na svojih slikah prvi upodobil Schaffenrath. Nekaj teh poškodb je preučil Hohenwart in kot vzrok odločno izključil skalni podor ali potres. V tem prispevku avtor razpravlja o vzrokih za naravno lomljenje kapnikov. Kot najustreznejši vzrok se kaže jamski led. Ko so bila v višku glaciala stalno zamrznjena tla razširjena po vsej severni, vzhodni in srednji Evropi, je v jamah moral nastajati led. Zaradi tega je najustreznejši dejavnik, s katerim bi lahko razložili starejše poškodbe kapnikov. Nadalje je v študiji predstavljenih nekaj zgodovinsko izpričanih lomov kapnikov iz Postojnske jame. O tem teče razprava z vidika jamskega ledu in predstavljen je ad hoc model nastanka ledu. V stranskih Pisanem in Brezimenem rovu so velike količine polomljenih stalagmitov in stalaktitov v nenavadnih položajih. Jamski led je lahko tisti dejavnik, ki razloži ta pojav. Avtor domneva, da je bila Postojnska jama med zadnjim in prejšnjim glacialom zapolnjena z ledom. V kolikor bi se strinjali, da je vzrok poškodovanim kapnikom jamski led, potem bi nam lahko taki kapniki služili kot pokazatelji, do kod v podzemlje je v raznih glacialih segala izoterma 0o C. Natural speleothem damage has been known from Postojnska jama for a long time. Schaffenrath was the fi rst to depict broken and leaning stalagmites on his pictures from the interior of the cave. Hohenwart analysed some of these damages, clearly excluding rock fall or earthquakes as a cause. Here the author discusses the possibilities, which could cause natural speleothem breakage in general. The most promising cause is cave ice. It must have formed in caves during glacial maxima when permafrost spread throughout northern, eastern and central Europe. Consequently cave ice could be the most prominent factor in explaining non-recent speleothem damage. Next some of the historically known fl owstone breakages from Postojnska jama are presented. These are discussed in view of cave ice and an ad hoc model for the genesis is given. In the side passages Pisani rov and Brezimenski rov there are masses of broken stalagmites and stalactites and speleothem fragments in precarious positions. Cave ice offers an overall process to explain these observations. Thus it is suggested that all or parts of the Postojnska jama were fi lled with ice during the Last and earlier Glacials. If accepting speleothem damage as a consequence of glacial cave ice, then it should be possible to use it as a marker facies for the extent of the zero temperature line during the various glacials.",

    "abstract": "Human-environment relations have some special characteristics on karst terrains, and karstlands are usually less densely inhabited areas principally due to hydrologic, topographic and pedologic reasons. However, the natural factors of karst terrains and socio-economic development are rarely discussed together, and the relationships are usually expressed in qualitative terms. Therefore the aim of this paper is to explore the direct and indirect quantitative impact of natural settings on socio-economic development of karst terrains using GIS-aided, statistical methods as a modern approach within geographic possibilism by the case study of Gömör-Torna Karst (whose Hungarian part is known as Aggtelek Karst, while the Slovakian part as Slovak Karst). Relationships between natural factors (elevation, slope, relative height, distance from significant rivers) and land cover as well as between natural factors and social data (population density, settlement density, mean settlement population, population change, road network density) have been studied by regression analysis in order to determine how strongly these social parameters are influenced by the above natural factors. In certain cases (land cover categories, road network) slope is the best estimator, while in other cases (population density, longterm population change), the distance from significant river provides the best correlation. Many karstlands are depopulating and ageing areas worldwide. So is the case for the Gömör-Torna Karst as well, but there are several interesting questions in connection with it. First, whether it is a recent process or a longterm situation. Second, wether the karst is different from the neighbouring non-karst areas from the viewpoint of demography. Third, whether the karst area is homogeneous from social point of view. Cluster analysis based on demographic changes since 1828 helped to explore inner variations of population scenarios. Certain social characteristics (e.g. unemployment) show a relatively (but only relatively) favorable present position of Aggtelek karst, while the Slovak Karst is economically more disadvantageous. Karst-related tourism is measurable but it has a decreasing trend and it is rather localized around Aggtelek. Human attitude is also an important factor, that is also briefly discussed based on semi-structured interviews with local people.",

    "abstract": "Kozmični žarki povzročajo nastanek kozmogenih nuklidov na površini zemlje in tik pod njo. Za datiranje jamskih sedimentov sta posebej pomembna 10Be in 26Al, ki nastajata v kremenu. Ko je kamen na površini in izpostavljen kozmičnemu sevanju, nastajata v stalnem razmerju. Ko ga zanese v podzemlje, se tvorba kozmogenih nuklidov ustavi, nadaljuje pa se njihov radioaktivni razpad. Ker 26 Al razpada hitreje, lahko iz razmerja med njima izračunamo čas, ki je potekel odkar je kremen pod zemljo. Metodo lahko uporabimo na sedimentih, ki so pokopani oziroma v jami med 0.1 in 5 milijoni let. Na ta način lahko v idealnih primerih izračunamo hitrost vrezovanja dolin. Z opisano metodo smo določili starost najstarejših delov sistema Siebenhengste v Švici. Najstarejši sediment je star 4.4 ± 0.6 Ma in nakazuje, da je na tem območju potekalo zakrasevanje že v pliocenu. Cosmic rays produce nuclides at and near the Earthʼs surface. 10Be and 26Al in quartz are of particular interest for dating cave sediments. These two nuclides are produced at the surface at a fixed ratio. If the quartz is carried from the surface into a cave, the sediment is shielded from additional cosmogenic nuclide production, and the inherited 10Be and 26Al decay radioactively. Because 26Al decays more rapidly than 10Be, the ratio of these two nuclides indicates the time since the sediment was washed underground. The burial dating method can be applied to sediments in the age range of approximately 0.1 to 5 Ma. In ideal cases, we get information about valley lowering rates. If the provenance of the sediment is known, averaged erosion rates of the source area can be estimated. The oldest cave phases of the Siebenhengste system, Switzerland, were dated using cosmogenic nuclides. The oldest sediment is 4.4 ± 0.6 Ma and thus indicates Pliocene karstification of the Siebenhengste.",

    "abstract": "Članek obravnava obalne in podmorske izvire v Bakarskem zalivu. Največ izvirov je ob severovzhodni obali zaliva, kjer je najnižji del kontakta med kraškim vodonosnikom in flišem, ki predstavlja hidrogeološko bariero. Študijsko območje obsega obalo med Črnim in Žminjco, kjer voda izteka koncentrirano v nizu kraških izvirov in difuzno na večih območjih. Ob dvigu morske gladine ob koncu pleistocena so nekateri obalni izviri prešli pod gladino, pojavili pa so se tudi novi, višji izviri. Veliko podmorskih izvirov ni poznanih, vendar na njihov obstoj kaže študija vodne bilance. Zaradi velikega hidravličnega gradienta veliko podmorskih izvirov deluje kot vrulje. Mešanje morske in sladke vode v hidravlično nestabilnem območju je vzrok, da je voda iz teh izvirov po večini brakična.The paper presents coastal and submarine springs in Bakar Bay. The northeastern coast of Bakar Bay is abound in springs, since there is the lowest placed contact between large karst aquifer and flysch lithogenetic complex which forms hydrogeological barrier. Studied area is situated between Črno and Žminjca locations, where water flows out in series of concentrated coastal and submarine springs as well as on the places of a diffuse outflow. A rapid raise of sea-level from the end of the Pleistocene changed the hydrogeological conditions so that coastal springs were submerged and new ones, at higher levels appeared. Some of submerged springs continued to throw out water, that is, they started to function as submarine springs (vrulja) due to a strong inflow from the background and high pressures. Some of them were not registered, although according to water balance analyses of wider area, widespread evidences of groundwater outflow could be expected. Their position reflects geological fabric of the area. Groundwaters have intensive flowing gradient. Their flowing out in hydraulically unstable zone have facilitated mixing of sea- water and fresh-water and as a result spring-water is usually brackish.",

    "abstract": "The karst hydrologic system in Pindul Cave can be categorised as ‘binary’ because it is recharged by the developed cave systems around it and by the Kedungbuntung ponor, which originates from an undeveloped karst system. The main objective of this study is to determine whether there are any differences in the aquifer characteristics that recharge to the Kedungbuntung ponor and the Pindul Cave outlet, using a time-series analysis approach. This analysis was conducted using univariate (auto-correlation) and bivariate (cross-correlation) statistical methods, which analyse data based on the domains of time (time-based analysis) and frequency (frequency-based analysis). Furthermore, the Master Recession Curve (MRC) calculation was conducted to confirm the time-series analysis result. Water level and rainfall data in both locations were recorded every 15 minutes over a six-month period (January–June 2017; N = 17,376). According to the time-series analysis, both locations were recharged by conduit, fissure and diffuse flow components; this observation was also confirmed by the MRC graphs which bore three components of recession. Comparison between the two locations showed that the Pindul outlet releases storage aquifers faster than Kedungbuntung. This condition may be caused by the Pindul Cave outlet having a complex karst system supplemented by a developing system, in combination with recharge from the Kedungbuntung ponor. Meanwhile, the dischargedischarge cross-correlation between the two locations was less able to describe the complexity of the karst aquifers, as can be demonstrated by the tracing test method. In addition, the MRC indicated that the aquifers in the Pindul Cave karst system (which have developed) may still have a large storage capacity. To obtain more comprehensive information, especially with regard to the character of the developed karst system around the Pindul karst outlet, a follow-up study must be carried out over a longer period using several additional methods to support the results of this time series analysis study.Key words: Master Recession Curve, time series analysis, karst aquifer characteristics, Pindul Cave karst system.Aplikacija analiz časovnih vrst za karakterizacijo kraškega vodonosnika z jamskim sistemom Pindul, IndonezijaKraški hidrološki sistem jame Pindul lahko označimo kot binarni, saj ga napajajo okoliški razviti jamski sistemi in ponor Kedungbuntung, ki se steka z nerazvitega kraškega sistema. Glavni cilj te študije je z uporabo analiz časovnih vrst ugotoviti, ali obstajajo kakršne koli razlike v značilnostih vodonosnika, ki napaja ponor Kedungbuntung, in tistim, ki napaja jamo Pindul. Ta analiza je bila izvedena z uporabo univariatnih (avtokorelacijskih) in bivariatnih (navzkrižno korelacijskih) statističnih metod, ki analizirajo podatke na podlagi časovnih in frekvenčnih vrst. Za potrditev rezultatov analiz časovnih vrst smo izvedli tudi izračun glavnih recesijskih krivulj (GRK). Vsakih 15 minut v šestmesečnem obdobju (januar–junij 2017; N = 17.376) so bili na obeh lokacijah zabeleženi podatki o vodostajih in padavinah. Glede na analizo časovnih vrst obe lokaciji napajajo komponente kanalskega, razpoklinskega in difuznega toka; to opažanje so potrdili tudi grafi GRK, ki kažejo na tri recesijske komponente. Primerjava med obema lokacijama je pokazala, da jama Pindul hitreje sprosti uskladiščeno vodo kot Kedungbuntung, kar je posledica kompleksnega kraškega sistema v kombinaciji z napajanjem iz ponora Kedungbuntung. Hkrati pa medsebojna korelacija praznjenja za obe območji manj učinkovito opiše zapletenost kraških vodonosnikov, kar se lahko dokaže s sledilnim poskusom. Poleg tega je MRC pokazal, da ima vodonosnik kraškega sistema jame Pindul še vedno veliko zmogljivost skladiščenja. Za pridobitev celovitejših informacij, zlasti glede značilnosti razvitega kraškega sistema okrog jame Pindul, bi bilo v nadaljevanju treba izvesti dolgotrajnejšo študijo, v kateri bi z uporabo več dodatnih metod ovrednotili rezultate te študije z analizo časovnih vrst.Ključne besede: glavna recesijska krivulja, analiza časovnih vrst, značilnosti kraškega vodonosnika, jamski sistem Pindul.",

Dolga je 40 in povprečno 10 km široka. Večji del te uravnave, zgrajene iz jurskih in krednih karbonatnih kamnin, ima značilnosti kraškega reliefa s številnimi vrtačami. Na manjšem delu, ki ga gradijo paleozojski in terciarni klastični sedimenti in triasni dolomiti, je razvita površinska rečna mreža. Vodotoki, ki so na tej podlagi, na stiku s prepustnimi kamninami izginejo v podzemlje. Tekom geomorfološkega razvoja tega ozemlja se je površinsko odmakano površje zmanjševalo, sledovi tega pa so ostali v obliki slepih in suhih (fosilnih) dolin. Vodni tokovi so se s površja prestavili v podzemlje, kjer so izdolbli podzemeljske kanale, to je speleološke objekte. Delo analizira odnos med procesi, s pomočjo katerih so nastale (danes fosilne) doline in jamski rovi na treh primerih: 1. jamski sistem Matešićeva – Popovaćka jama, 2. Ponor pod Kremenom in Barićeve jame, 3. jamski sistem Varićakova – Panjkova jama.The Slunj plateau is part of the shallow Kordun karst. It extends from the westernmost part of river Una towards the northwest to the confluence of the Slunjčica and Korana, at an average height of 300 - 350 m ofabove sea level. It is 40 km long, and averages about 10 km wide. A larger part of the plateau of Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonate rocks has characteristics of e karst relief with numerous dolines. On the smaller part of the Paleozoic and Tertiary clastic sediments and Triassic dolomites, a surface fluvial network has been developed. The water streams emerging on that basis regularly disappear underground on contact with permeable rocks. During geomorphological evolution of this terrain the area which is being drained on the surface was reduced, and the traces were left in the form of blind and dry (fossil) valleys. The water streams moved from the surface to underground where they formed the underground channels, i. e. speleological objects. This work analyses the correlation between the formation processes of (today fossil) valleys and cave channels on three examples: 1) Cave system Matešićeva - Popovačka cave, 2) Ponor pod Kremenom cave and Barićeve cave, 3) Cave system Varićakova - Panjkova cave.",

Analiza njihove topografije, ugotavljanje morfostratigrafskih ostankov uravnanih površij in različnih rečnih oblik, zaznavanje nekaterih elementov, pomembnih za kronologijo, predstavljenih v tem sestavku, so dovolj, da si je mogoče zamisliti predhodni model geomorfološkega razvoja te gorske skupine. Vodilni morfogenetski elementi so fluvialnega izvora in jih ne določajo le spremembe klime, ampak tudi tektonsko dviganje in/ali spremembe baznega nivoja. Kraške oblike so se razvile predvsem na ostankih fluvialnih oblik ali v skladu z razmeroma neaktivnimi fluvialnimi oblikami. Starost glavnih oblik se razteza čez zelo dolgo obdobje, verjetno v razponu 15 milijonov let. Da so se te zelo stare oblike lahko ohranile, je mogoče razložiti s svojskim geomorfološkim okoljem, ki ga ni zajela poledenitev tekom pleistocena. Primerjava razvojnih modelov večih kraških morfostruktur v Južnih Alpah pomaga razumeti razlike v njihovem geomorfološkem oblikovanju.The Monti Berici constitute the most southerly karst morpho-unit of the Southern Alps and a peculiar type of karst. The analysis of their topography, the identification of a »morpho-stratigraphy« of the relicts of surface planation and of the different types of fluvial forms, and the recognition of the few elements of chronological significance present in this context, allow the delineation of a preliminary model of the geomorphological evolution of this mountain group. The main morphogenetical elements are of fluvial origin and have been determined, not only by the climatic changes, but also by the tectonic uplifting and/or by changes of the base level. The karst landforms have mostly evolved on the relict fluvial forms or in the context of relatively inactive fluvial forms. The age of the main forms extends over a very long time span, probably in the order of 15 millionyears. The preservation of very old forms can be explained by the peculiar geomorphological environment which was not affected by glacial erosion during the Pleistocene. The comparison of the evolution models of several karst morpho-units in the Southern Alps helps to understand the differences in their geomorphological styles.",

Examples from the Brazilian subterranean fauna are presented, using mainly fishes, one of the best studied groups, as a model. Only three taxa including troglobites are object of molecular studies, all in progress. Therefore, molecular clocks cannot be applied yet, and indirect evidence is used. Few phylogenies are available, e.g. for the catfish families Heptapteridae and Trichomycteridae. Theoretically, basal troglobitic clades are older than apical ones, but the possible existence of extinct epigean taxa belonging to such clades hampers the comparison. As well, the limitations of the use degrees of troglomorphism to estimate phylogenetic ages are analyzed with focus on the complexity of the mechanisms underlying morphological differentiation. Paleoclimatic reconstructions based on dating of speleothems from caves in northeastern and southeastern Brazil are available, but limited up to the last 200,000 years, thus useful for relatively recent lineages. Topographic isolation, probable for some fish groups from Central Brazil, is also within the time range of 105 years. Older dated events (in the order of 106 years or more) that may represent vicariant events affecting aquatic lineages with subterranean derivatives are related to the establishment of the modern South American main river basins. In view of the paucity of data useful for estimating the age of Brazilian troglobitic lineages, combined evidence, including morphology, systematics and biogeography, seems to be the best approach at the moment.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the center of Saudi Arabia the anhydrite upper Jurassic Heethformation can be followed N to S. Locally it is punctured by hypogene karst sinkholes. The most prominent are the former Layla Lakes at 22.17°N 46.70°E. The lakes (17 originally) have been drained in the late 1980’s, revealing 19 sinkholes, some of them composites of several subsidence centers. The largest is 1.1 km long, 0.4 km wide and about 40 m deep. Others are less than 10 m across and rather recent. The bottom of the former lakes and the flats around them are composed of thick layers of fine-grained lake chalks. The most striking feature of these sinkholes is the several meters thick tufa covering the vertical walls of the sinkholes. It formed sub-aqueous and is entirely composed of gypsum. Morphologically the tufa displays thick bulbous forms at the bottom changing to conical forms at middle depthto gour-, gutter-, or shovel-like forms near to the former lake surface. The mineralogy and morphology of this tufa appear to be singular world-wide.",

    "abstract": "The Postojnska jama–Planinska jama cave system and number of smaller adjacent caves are developed in the Postojnski kras. These caves are located between two dextral strike-slip fault zones oriented in the Dinaric direction. The caves contain lith­ologically diversified cave fill, ranging from speleothems to allo­genic fluvial sediments. The allogenic clastic material is derived from a single source, Eocene siliciclastics of the Pivka Basin. Small differences in mineral/petrologic composition between the sediments can be attributed to different degrees of weather­ing in the catchment area and homogenization of source sedi­ments. Thick sequences of fine-grained laminated sediments, deposited from suspension are common. The depositional en­vironment was mostly calm, but not completely stagnant. Sucha sedimentary environment can be described as cave lacustrine, withdeposition from pulsed flow. The homogeneity of the pa­laeomagnetic data suggests rapid deposition by a number of short-lived single-flood events over a few thousand years. This depositional style was favourable for recording of short-lived excursions in the palaeomagnetic field. The sediments were originally not expected to be older than Middle Quaternary in age (i.e. about 0.4 Ma). Later numerical dating (Th/U and ESR) indicated ages older than 0.53 ka. New palaeomagnetic data from selected sedimentary profiles within the cave system detected normal polarization in muchof the profiles studied. Reverse polarized magnetozones, interpreted mostly as short-lived excursions of magnetic field, were detected in only a few places. Therefore, we interpreted most of the sediments as be­ing younger than 0.78 Ma, belonging to different depositional phases within the Brunhes chron. Palaeomagnetic properties of two profiles in caves intersected by the artificial tunnel be­tween Postojnska jama and Črna jama had reverse polarized magnetozones and of sediments in Zguba jama, may indicate an age muchgreater than 0.78 Ma. The cave system has evolved over a long period of time, governed by the functioning of Pla­ninsko polje in the relation to the evolution of the resurgence area in Ljubljana Moor further to the east. General stabilization of the hydrological system withlow hydraulic head led to the evolution of caves in epiphreatic and paragenetic conditions over a long time-span. Individual cave segments or passages were completely filled and exhumed several times during the evolution of the cave. Alternation of depositional and erosional phases may be connected withchanging conditions within the cave system, the functioning of the resurgence area, collapse, climatic change, tectonic movement and the intrinsic mecha­nisms of contact karst.",

    "abstract": "Micheline Shehy Skeffington & Nick. E. Scott: Do turloughs occur in Slovenia? Turloughs are karst basins that fill seasonally with mostly groundwater and drain, usually in summer, to reveal a sedge or grassland community. They are often described as being virtually unique to Ireland. The much larger seasonal poljes of the Slovenian karst are considered different to turloughs. However, a series of small temporary karst lakes in the Slove­nian Pivka valley seem remarkably similar to Irish turloughs. Like turloughs, they fill and empty largely through estavelles connecting to underground water systems, which rise and fall with high seasonal rainfall. The Slovenian sites, however, support less wetland communities than Irish turloughs, prob­ably due to drier summer conditions. The plant communities of both systems occur in zones around the basin, related to flood duration. Relevés taken at five Slovenian sites revealed that Petelinjsko jezero, which floods longest each year, is the most similar to turloughs, with, in the lower basin, Eleocharis palustris, potentilla reptans and the unusual form of Ranuculus repens commonly found in Irish turloughs. The difference in climate and terrain means that the Slovenian sites are managed for hay or silage, while the Irish turloughs are under pasture. However, for both, regular flooding precludes much agricul­tural improvement, so that they are now refuges for flora and fauna. A revised definition for turloughs is proposed and a case made for these Slovenian wetland systems to be recognised as turloughs and for the EU Habitats Directive to be amended to include poljes and other similar temporary karst wetland sys­tems as well as turloughs.",

The internal cave geometry of small entrances, intersecting adjacent chambers, remnant dissolutional bedrock pillars, and low arches matches diagnostic features used to separate flank margin caves from epigenic stream caves on one hand, and sea caves on the other. Plava Grota is found, along with adjacent smaller caves, solely in a breccia facies that is most probably of Pleistocene age. This breccia is comprised of clasts derived from diagenetically mature, or telogenetic, Cretaceous carbonate rocks. The clasts are loosely cemented by vadose calcite cements. The breccia facies provide a three-dimensional porosity and permeability structure that behaves hydraulically in a manner similar to the high primary porosity and permeability of young eogenetic carbonate rocks in settings such as the Bahamas or Puerto Rico, and the many flow paths found in highly-tectonized telogenetic carbonate rocks in New Zealand. Plava Grota is the first described flank margin cave from the coastal carbonate rocks of the Adriatic Sea. According to present sea-level position in relation to the cave, fresh-water springs in and adjacent to the cave, general tectonic subsidence of the area and Quaternary eustatic sea-level fluctuations, we propose the hypotheses that the cave was primarily formed during the MIS 5e sea-level highstand.",

Proterozoic carbonate rocks in the basin are constituted by as three main units- the Vempalle dolomite, the Narji and Koilkuntla limestones. These carbonate rocks are of strategic importance for local communities as they provide the main water source for irrigation and domestic use and they are also intensively quarried for cement production and building stones. It is therefore, of primary importance to assess to which extent these carbonate units are karstified so as to provide recommendations for appropriate land and water resource management. The field investigations carried out indicate that these carbonate units are significantly karstified and karstification has been an ongoing process with several phases under variable climatic conditions. As a result, a significant part of aquifer recharge occurs as point-recharge through swallow-holes and groundwater flow is channelized by conduit networks which emerge at karst springs. Karst development was possibly more active during past humid conditions; however karstification is still an ongoing process under the present semi-arid climate especially in the favorable case where karst drains the runoff issued from upstream quartzitic hills. The karstic nature of these carbonate units need to be integrated in future research and development programmes to avoid practices that may lead to unexpected collapses, reservoir leaks, inaccurate groundwater budgeting, etc.",

The paper focuses on the slope formation with respect to the ratios between different magnitudes of governing processes (mechanical and chemical weathering and mass movement). The introduced approach represents a first step in understanding slope processes and does not pose a realistic quantitative comparison with field measurements. However, the results gathered with the model show good qualitative agreement with the field observations. Three different representative cases are studied: dominant mechanical weathering case, balanced mechanical and chemical weathering case and dominant chemical weathering case.",

    "abstract": "Research into the landforms of karst highlands in the middle latitudes began in the “Classical Karst” in the 19th century and has been marked by alternating periods of progress and stability since. In the beginning, the elementary morpho-types were recognized, in particular the circular closed depression defined as the “karst doline”. Later the mid-latitude karst forms were compared with those of other climatic zones, especially tropical humid karst. In recent decades many papers have been published on the morphometry, the fillings, and models of the evolution of the surface karst landforms. It has been emphasized that in the mid-latitude karsts the morphogenesis is the result not only of karst solution but also of several other weathering processes such as cryoclastic (frost) action and other periglacial processes. Examination of the main scientific journals dealing with karst and other geomorphology shows that present day research in karst areas is mostly concerned with very specific subjects, such as speleogenesis, hydrogeology, sedimentology, geochemistry, mineralogy, cave biology, unusual landforms: only a minority of papers focus on karst surface landforms, and among these only a few attempt organic and comprehensive studies of the entire assemblage of relief forms in a karst morpho-unit. In reality, it is evident that the surface landform complex in a karst morpho-unit has to be considered in its entirety and that only such an integrated approach to this complex entity may bring significant progress in understanding. The landforms may be considered from different point of views, but always as a part of a holistic approach, in particular: a) in the geodynamic context of the evolution of the particular mountain group, b) as part of a complex geo-ecosystem, c) in the framework of models based on modern geomorphological concepts. Such comprehensive studies carried out by multi- and inter-disciplinary research teams applying the most modern techniques and methodologies will present stimulating challenges not only for progress in karstology but also in all the environmental sciences.",

However, the creation of national parks on karst terrains and the recent increase of (geo)tourism may influence and even turn these population trends. Our study examines the validity of this statement in the context of Vikos Gorge and Tymphi Mountain (NW Greece). Geological and geomorphological values are presented first, including Vikos Gorge, the glaciokarst landscape of Tymphi and the particular spherical rock concretions. Digital terrain analysis is used to obtain scientifically based, reliable morphometric parameters about Vikos Gorge, and it is found that the maximum gorge depth is 1144 m, the maximum width is 2420 m, and the maximum of depth/width ratio is 0.76. Thereafter, rural depopulation trends are examined and it is found that this region (Zagori) is seriously affected by depopulation. It is observed that there are differences among settlements, and a relative stabilization of population is sensible in only few settlements around Vikos Gorge, which are linked to tourism. As for nature protection, while at the beginning conflicts were perceptible among management and local people, now new conflicts are emerging between growing tourism and nature protection goals.Key words: gorge morphometry, glaciokarst, spherical concretions, rural depopulation, geotourism, national park.Kraške oblike in s krasom povezane družbene spremembe na območju soteske Vikos ter v gorovju Timfi (narodni park Severni Pindi, Grčija)Zaradi neugodnih naravnih razmer, kot so manj rodovitna prst, pomanjkanje vode in svojstvena oblikovanost površja, je kraško površje od nekdaj relativno redko poseljeno, v zadnjem obdobju pa je podvrženo tudi procesom odseljevanja. V zadnjem času je vse več tudi geoturizma in z njim povezanega ustanavljanja geoparkov, ki trend depopulacije lahko tudi obrnejo. Pričujoča študija se nanaša na vrednotenje omenjenih procesov na primeru doline Vikos in gorovja Timfi (SZ Grčija). Najprej so predstavljene geomorfološke in geološke značilnosti območja, kjer so izpostavljene značilnosti soteske Vikos, glaciokras gorovja Timfi in za to območje značilne okrogle skalne konkrecije. Digitalni model višin je bil namenjen morfometrični analizi soteske Vikos. Ta je pokazala, da je njena največja globina 1144 m, največja širina 2420 m, največje razmerje med globino in širino pa 0,76. V nadaljevanju so analizirane značilnosti odseljevanja s podeželja, katerim je najbolj podvrženo območje Zagori. Demografski vzorci kažejo na razlike med posameznimi naselji, kjer je število prebivalcev stabilno le v nekaterih naseljih v bližini turistično zanimive soteske Vikos. Z ustanovitvijo parka so se pojavili tudi konflikti. V začetku so se navzkrižja interesov pojavila med lokalnim prebivalstvom in upravljavci, sedaj pa se konflikt pojavlja ob istočasnem naraščanju turizma in želji po varovanju narave.Kjučne besede: morfometrija soteske, glaciokras, okrogle konkrecije, depopulacija podeželja, geoturizem, narodni park.",

Cave monitoring is uncommon throughout Central America and the Caribbean, and is generally accorded a low priority by agencies responsible for environmental managementand conservation. Exceptions occur only in some protected areas and in a few commercial caves. Fundamentally, it is not recognized generally that there is a need to monitor caves. Beyond that, monitoring is limited severely by paucity of funding, equipment and qualified personnel. Cave monitoring clearly is warranted, however, because cave environments are inherently fragile and because the karstlands are under increasing developmental pressures. In these contexts, selected inventorying and monitoring programs seem advisable in at least some of the more significant caves. Such monitoring programs might focus on physical environments, historic and prehistoric remains, faunal populations, resource extraction, water quality and human visitation. Equally importantly, surface karst environments need to be monitored too, because degradation at the surface will almost inevitably be mirrored by deterioration in underground conditions.",

It is a typical overflow-structural polje, with springs on the southern side feeding the superficial flow of Unica River. The river meanders over the polje towards the terminal outflow area on its northern side, where it sinks back into the aquifer through several ponors. Along the reach in proximity to the eastern border of the polje, the Unica River loses water through several outflow zones into distinct ponors and into a set of small openings and fracture zones. To estimate the outflow rate along these zones, the Unica discharge was measured upstream and downstream to the outflow zone. Seven velocity profiles were recorded with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler and the corresponding discharges were calculated. The measurements were taken within four hours during the flow recession following a partial flooding of the Planinsko Polje. Therefore, six outflow zones were evaluated with an outflow rate ranging between 1 m3/s and 5.6 m3/s. The total loss of water along the eastern border summed up to 18 m3/s under the given hydrological conditions. These results give new insight into the functioning of karst poljes and provide an important input for eventual future hydrological modelling of the area.Key words: polje, outflow, ponors, discharge, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, Planinsko Polje, Unica.",

    "abstract": "The Karangbolong karst is situated in the southern zone of Java where Miocene limestone has been uplifted and has experienced karstification since the late Pliocene. The research documented here aims at exploring morphological characteristic of the area. Special interest is attributed to differentiation of valley or depression morphology, conical karst morphology, and the roles of jointing system and uplift history in their development. The morphology investigation was mostly undertaken using aerial photograph visual interpretation of panchromatic aerial photograph and analytically shaded DEM, as well as field observations. The results show that the general morphological features of Karangbolong karst are characterized by aligned valleys and aligned enclosed depression with three different patterns. The orientation of the valleys and enclosed depressions coincide with the structural pattern of the area, indicating that the formation of aligned valleys and aligned enclosed depressions is preferential dissolution through jointing. The residual hills are typified by conical karst morphology with sharp peaks. It is found that tight joint spacing appears to be the main reason for the sharp peak of the conical hills. Asides from jointing system, morphology of the area is likely governed also by topographical position and gravity sliding of the limestone bed during the uplift. Uplift history has important control on the differentiation of morphology between plateau part and sloping part. Limitation of this research is that the aerial photograph was not rectified well, because the analyses in this research were more on pattern identification. More accurate rectification is needed for better morphometric analyses.Key words: Southern Java, Karangbolong karst, polygonal karst, tropical geomorphology.",

    "abstract": "Jama brez stropa je bila zapolnjena s peščenimi naplavinami dinamične strukture ter teksture svetlo rjave in oker barve. Na vrhu 5 m debelega prereza naplavin so bile rjava prst in skale. Pobranih je bilo 38 vzorcev naplavin. Posamezne magnetne cone nakazujejo, da je naplavina starejša od zgornjega Olduvaja (1,77 M); kot kozinski prerez se konča z reverzno polarizirano magnetno cono in ima dve normalni polarizirani coni. Prerez naplavin je podoben divaškemu. Predvidevamo, da je jama iz mesinskega obdobja in da so naplavine v njej posledica hitrega zvišanja gladine podzemeljske vode po ponovni zapolnitvi mediteranskega bazena z vodo, torej da so bile odložene pred 5,2 milijoni let.A fossil channel was filled by sandy sediments of light brown to ochreous color with dynamic structures and textures (lower sequence) unconformably overlain by remains of collapsed roof with brown and ochreous matrix (upper sequence). The sedimentary profile was about 5 m high. In all 38 samples taken from the profile, only one was cemented. Samples were demagnetised by alternating field (AF) at 10 to 1,000 Oe. The cemented one was demagnetised by gradual thermal process from 80 to 560 °C in the MAVACS apparatus. Detected remanent magnetisation in a natural state varied between 95 and 36,470 pT, values of volume magnetic susceptibility are from 55 to 998 x 10-6 SI. Rocks showed low or medium magnetisation. Normal and inverse polarization was detected after demagnetisation. The primary component of magnetisation and resulting polarity could not be stated in samples with expressive viscose component (up to 90 %). According to arrangement of individual magnetozone, it can be stated that sediments are older than the top of Olduvai chron (1.77 Ma), as the magnetostratigraphic profile at Kozina terminated by reverse polarised magnetozone and contains two normal polarised zones. The profile can be correlated with the Divača profile, not only from the palaeomagnetic point of view, but also from a lithological point of view. We suppose, as in Divača, that the cave is a result of the Messinian speleogenetic epoch and its fossilization was connected with rapid base level uplift after refilling of the Mediterranean basin by water. If this hypothesis is close to reality, the fossilization process can be dated from about 5.2 Ma up.",

    "abstract": "Scarisoara Ice Cave (Romania) hosts one of world’s largest and oldest underground glacier. While no studies were carried out on the existence of microorganisms in this cave’s ice block, our interest is to investigate the presence of microorganisms and their chronological distribution in the cave’s subterranean ice in relationship with past climatic changes. Samples were collected from ice layers of different age (from present to ~900 cal. yrs. BP), and the diversity of embedded microbial communities was assessed by classical cultivation and molecular techniques. The microorganisms from icesediments were cultivated at 4 °C and 15 °C, in the presence and absence of light. Epifluorescence microscopy analysis indicates the presence of autotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes in sunlightexposed ice and water samples. Total DNA was isolated from each ice sample and the bacterial and eukaryotic SSU-rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. The chemical composition and organic content of both deeply buried (&gt;10 m inside the ice block) and surface (supra- glacial pond water) habitats were analyzed in relation to their age and organic composition. This study is the first to report on the presence of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in the subterranean ice block of Scarisoara Ice Cave, thriving in both organic-rich ice and clear ice layers. Phototrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes were identified in sun-exposed recent ice. The composition of cold-adapted ice embedded microbiota varied with the habitat age and organic content, as resulting from dissimilarities in growth curve profiles at two different temperatures. The presence of bacteria and eukaryotes in all the analyzed samples was asserted by PCR amplification of SSU-rRNA gene fragments. These findings can be further used to reconstruct changes in the microbial diversity over the past approximately 5000 years, in correlation with climatic and environmental changes recorded by the ice block.",

    "abstract": "The processes of initiation and development of characteristic surface karst landforms and underground caves are nearly all chemical processes. This paper reviews the advances in understanding of karst chemistry over the past 60 years. The equilibrium chemistry of carbonate and sulfate dissolution and deposition is well established with accurate values for the necessary constants. The equations for bulk kinetics are known well enough for accurate modeling of speleogenetic processes but much is being learned about atomic scale mechanisms. The chemistry of karst waters, expressed as parameters such as total dissolved carbonates, saturation index, and equilibrium carbon dioxide pressure are useful tools for probing the internal characteristics of karst aquifers. Continuous records of chemical parameters (chemographs) taken from springs and other karst waters mapped onto discharge hydrographs reveal details of the internal flow system. The chemistry of speleothem deposition is well understood at the level of bulk processes but much has been learned of the surface chemistry on an atomic scale by use of the atomic force microscope. Least well understood is the chemistry of hypogenetic karst. The main chemical reactions are known but equilibrium modeling could be improved and reaction kinetics are largely unknown.Kemija in KrasProcesi začetka in razvoja značilnih površinskih kraških oblik in podzemnih jam imajo skoraj vsi razlog v kemiji. Prispevek je pregled napredka v razumevanju kraške kemije v zadnjih 60 letih. Kemijsko ravnotežje raztapljanja in odlaganja karbonatov in sulfatov je dobro poznano, kjer natančno poznamo vse potrebne ravnotežne konstante. Tudi kinetika raztapljanja na makroskopski ravni je dovolj dobro poznana, da lahko modeliramo procese speleogeneze. Osnovne mehanizme raztapljanja na atomski ravni še vedno spoznavamo. Kemija kraških vodah, izražena v parametrih, kot so vsebnost raztopljenih karbonatov, indeks nasičenosti in ravnovesje tlaka ogljikovega dioksida, je danes uporabno orodje za raziskovanje značilnosti kraških vodonosnikov. Zvezno beleženje kemičnih parametrov na kraških izvirih in drugih kraških vodah (kemogrami) skupaj s pretočnimi hidrogrami razkrivajo podrobnosti o podzemnem sistemu pretakanja voda. Tudi kemizem odlaganja sige na makroskopski ravni dobro razumemo, raziskave z mikroskopi na atomsko silo (AFM) pa nam omogočajo nova spoznanja o procesih na atomski ravni. Še najmanj je razumljena kemija hipogenega krasa. Glavne reakcije so znane, vendar je že modeliranje ravnotežja pomanjkljivo, še manj pa vemo o kemijski kinetiki.",

Profil je sestavljen iz pasovite karbonatne kamnine z interkalacijami rdečih ilovic. Te so se odložile na erozijsko/korozijsko površino starejše, že močno prekristaljene sige. Pasovita in laminirana karbonatna kamnina profila je sestavljena iz prekristaljenega kalcilutita ter je podobna sladkovodnemu apnencu. Značilna laminiranost nakazuje nastanek iz bogatih organskih filmov. Rdeče ilovice sestavljajo kremen, smektit, vermikulit, gibbsit, pM kaolinit, goethit, atanas, rutil, haematit, kalcit, sljude in glinenec. Vsebujejo tudi pelete z več Mn hidroksioksidov. Rdeče ilovice so ostanki preperevanja, odloženi v z vodo zasičenem okolju. Za v profilu vzete vzorce so značilne srednje do visoke vrednosti Jn kar je posledica velike količine železovih mineralov. Srednja paleomagnetna smer je za skupino normalnih paleomagnetnih polaritet enaka D = 10.6°; I = 55.0°, za skupino reverznih polaritet pa D = 173.0°; I = -31.3°. Zgornji del profila kaže reverzno paleomagnetno smer, ki jo prekinjata dve normalni magnetozoni. Sodeč po razporeditvi posameznih magnetozon sklepamo, da je vrh najvišje normalno polarizirane cone primerljiv z dogodkom Olduvai (1.76/1.79 Ma) kot najmlajšo možnostjo, ostali del profila pa je lahko le starejši.A fossil cave, filled with cave sediments was open in the Črnotiče Quarry. An about 1.75 m high section was analysed. Profile consists of banded carbonate rocks intercalated by red clays which was deposited on corroded/ eroded surface of older speleothems. Banded and laminated carbonate rocks are composed of recrystallized calcilutite resemble freshwater limestones. Characteristics of lamination could indicate its origin from organic-rich films. Red clays are composed of quartz, smectite, vermiculite, gibbsite, pM kaolinite, goethite, anatase, rutile, haematite, calcite, micas and feldspar. They contain pellets with Mn hydroxyoxides. That red clays are weathering products redeposited in water-saturated environment. Samples are characterised by intermediate up to high magnetic values of Jn which is caused by the presence of high amount of Fe-minerals. Mean palaeomagnetic directions are for the group of normal palaeomagnetic polarity equal to D = 10.6°; I = 55.0°, and for the group of reverse polarity than D = 173.0°; I = -31.3°. The top part of the profile shows reverse palaeomagnetic direction interrupted by two normal magnetised zones. According to the arrangement of individual magnetozones we assume, that the top of the highest normal polarised magnetozone could be correlated with the Olduvai event (1.76/1.79 Ma) as the youngest possibility, and therefore the rest of profile must be older.",

    "abstract": "Debelino krovnine je mogoče razporediti v 4 razrede. Za vsakega so značilne posebne površinske in podzemeljske kraške oblike: 1. solni izdanki; 2. tanka krovnina (0,5 - 2 m); 3. zmerno debela krovnina (5 - 30 m); 4. zelo debela krovnina (preko 30 m). Najpomembnejši dejavniki, na katere vpliva debelina krovnine, so: gostota mest, skozi katera prodira voda; količina vode, ki ponika na posameznem mestu; hitrost zniževanja površja solnega telesa; »korozijska« sposobnost vode in velikost ter količina tovora, ki ga prenašajo podzemeljske poplavne vode. Debelina krovnine nad jamo ne vpliva neposredno na jamo. Kaže, da je bolj pomembna debelina kamnine v njenem zaledju in tip dotoka na solno telo. Drugi pomemben dejavnik je debelina krovnine v smislu teže, ki je obratnosorazmerna z udiranjem. Široki rovi v nekaterih jamah so nastali zaradi odlaganja sedimenta v strugi, kar je prisililo vodo, da je tekla vzdolž sten in jih tako pospešeno korodirala v pasu, visokem nekaj decimetrov.Four classes of different thickness of cap rock can be distinguished, each with its special superficial and underground karst forms: 1. salt outcrops, 2. thin cap rock (0,5-2 m), 3. cap rock of moderate thickness (5-30 m), 4. cap rock of great thickness (more than 30 m). The most important factors affected by cap rock thickness are as follows: the density of recharge points, the amounts of concentrated recharge which occur at each recharge point, the rate of lowering the ground surface of salt karst, the dissolution capacity of water and the size and amount of load transported by underground flood-streams into cave systems. The thickness of cap rock above the cave does not influence the cave itself; more important seems to be the thickness of cap rock in the recharge area of the cave and the type of recharge into the salt environment. Another important factor is the thickness of overburden above the cave, which negatively correlates with intensity of breakdown. Wide passages in some caves are developed as result of intensive deposition of bedload, which expel the stream into the side of the passage and are due to enhanced corrosion in the few decimetres high zone above the bottom of passage.",

Problem geotermičnega toka, ki ga prestrežejo vodni kanali, ki v splošnem zaheva tudi izračun temperaturnega polja, obravnavam z inženirskim pristopom, ki pri tem vpelje t.i. faktorje oblike. Tok vode v kraških kanalih zmoti celotno temperaturno polje v okoliškem masivu in sčasoma pritegne nase ves geotermični tok širšega območja. Že majhna količina vode, ki teče v masiv, zmoti temperaturno polje masiva vse do površja. Vpel­java geotermičnega preseka struktur podzemnega odvodnjavanja, omogoča izboljšanje klasične formule za oceno minimalne globine vira geotermalne vode.

The problem of geothermal power intercepted by deep structures and, in general, the temperature field calculations, is converted to classical thermo-engineering problems in terms of shape factors. It is shown that the fluid flow in a conduit perturbs the whole deep rock temperature field until the geothermal flux of a large area is focalised onto the conduit. It is shown that either small water masses flowing into a mountain are able to perturb the rock temperature up to the surface, on sizes that do not depend on water mass dimension, but on its depth, and then on enormous volumes. The introduction of the \"geothermal cross section\" of an underground drainage structure allows us to improve the classical formula of minimum provenance depth of geothermal water. Enlarging factors are applied to the classical estimation in dependence of the ratio between the actual average discharge and the critical discharge Qc, which depends on the conduit geothermal cross section. The geothermal \"umbra cones\"created in the overlying rock by deep underground structures are described. It is shown that the geothermal flux can play a significant role in the underground drainage phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental difference between caves in sedimentary limestones and those formed in a repeatedly-glaciated 40000 km2 region in central Scandinavia that contains over 1000 individual marble outcrops and has nearly 1000 recorded karst caves is the metamorphic grade of the karst bedrock and its negligible primary porosity. Allied to this is the fine-scale foliation and consequent lack of ‘bedding-plane’ partings. Indeed, the foliation is commonly vertical in the western part of the study area, where sub-horizontal openings must be along joints or other fractures. The deepest cave is only 180 m deep, despite outcrop vertical ranges reaching over 900 m. Caves tend to cluster together and are positioned randomly in a vertical dimension, whilst commonly remaining within 50 m of the overlying surface. Additionally, despite some stripe karst outcrops being several tens of kilometres in length, there are no regional scale caves, and karst hydrological system distances are invariably shorter than 3.5 km. Because the caves are relatively short and epigean and there is a complete absence of long, hypogean, cave systems, speleogenesis by the (chemical) inception horizon hypothesis is unlikely. A tectonic inception model is derived that proposes that it is only open fracture routes that could provide the opportunity for dissolution and enlargement into cave passages in the Caledonide marbles. It is hypothesised that the dimensions of these fractures are related to the magnitude, and perhaps to the frequency, of local earthquakes and commonly-small tectonic movements that arose mainly from the isostatic rebound that accompanied deglaciation at the end of each major Pleistocene glacial. The openings formed along inception surfaces between the limestone and adjacent aquicludes and at inception fractures that are entirely within the limestone and are commonly (though not universally) parallel to, or orthogonal to, the foliation. The model builds on reports of a ‘partially detached’ thin upper crustal layer in similar settings in Scotland and is supported by observations of later neotectonic movements, as indicated by sharp edges and slickensides in most present relict cave passages and sporadically on the surface.",

    "abstract": "The article presents an overview of the current status of karst protection in the Philippines. Prior studies indicate that of the 35,000km2 of karst landscape in the country, about 29% is protected . However, protection of karst has not to date been a priority of the Philippine government, and the country has no existing legislation that is directly decreed for protection and conservation of karstlands. Most contemporary karst protection is indirect, in that the karst is located within protected areas established for other, although often related reasons, such as ecological conservation, water supply protection and tourism. However, it appears that the Philippine government is gradually recognizing explicitly the need to protect karst landscapes. The establishment of the National Caves and Cave Resources Management and Protection Act in 2001 and the inclusion of karst water resources in the country’s National Action Plan (NAP) under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) are significant steps towards explicit protection of karst areas. Although the existing legislation only addresses specific facets of karst landscape, it may stimulate additional programs and legislation that will more broadly protect karst landscapes nationally.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a case of very special hydrological behaviour of two neighbouring sinking karst rivers, Lika and Gacka, (Dinaric karst of Croatia), is analysed. The Lika River has a torrential hydrological regime. At the Sklope gauging station its minimum, mean and maximum measured discharges in the 1951-2005 period were: 0 (dry) m3/s : 24.5 m3/s : 729 m3/s. During the same period the Gacka River, at the Vivoze gauging station, had the following characteristic discharges: 2.29 m3/s; 14.7 m3/s; 71.0 m3/s. While the flow regime of the Lika River is characterised by extremely and very quick changes of discharges, the Gacka River flow regime is unusually uniform. The objective of the investigations made in this paper was to analyse the extremely different hydrological behaviour of the two neighbouring sinking rivers in order to find its reasons. Master depletion curves defined for the two analysed rivers shows that the karst aquifer of the Gacka River is much more abundant than Lika’s. The difference in the water temperature regime of the two neighbouring rivers is extremely high. At the Lika-Bilaj gauging station the minimum, mean and maximum measured water temperatures in the period of 1964-1991 were: 0.6°C; 9.3 °C; 21.4°C. During the period of 1964-2005 the Gacka River, at the Čovići gauging station had the following characteristic water temperatures: 6.4°C : 9.1°C : 11.6°C. The resident time in the karst underground of water discharging from the Gacka karst springs is much longer than in the case of the Lika River. The most probable explanation for this unusual hydrological behaviour of the two neighbouring karst rivers is that water from the Lika River and its catchment recharges some karst springs of the Gacka River. It is concluded that the Lika River feeds the Gacka River with an average annual discharge of about 5.35 m3/s. This value is different during each year and depends on the hydrological situation. It is very probably higher during the wet years than during the dry ones.",

The later sites are also characterized by a rich appearance of fossil tubes of autochthonous stygobiont serpulid Marifugia cavatica. The vertebrate record is composed mostly of enamel fragments of rodents and soricomorphs. Absence of rootless arvicolids as well as taxonomic composition of the mammalian fauna suggests the Pliocene age of both sites. For (i) Račiška pečina (with Apodemus, cf. Borsodia) it was estimated to middle to late MN17 (ca 1.8–2.4 Ma), while (ii) the assemblage from Črnotiče II (with Deinsdorfia sp., Beremedia fissidens, Apodemus cf. atavus, Rhagapodemus cf. frequens, Glirulus sp., Cseria sp.) is obviously quite older: MN15–MN16 (ca 3.0–4.1 Ma). In respect to congruence of biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data and a reliable sedimentary setting of the samples we propose to apply the respective datum also as the time of one ancient speleogenetic phase in the Classical Karst.",

For electrical resistivity imaging data collection was used SuperSting R1/IP earthresistivity meter. Electrical resistivity imaging method was applied for researchof material characteristics beneathsurface of karst landforms. Materials withhigher portion of water as fractured bedrock or clay are less resistant to electrical current than unfractured bed­rock. Application of the ERI method has turned out as appro­priate for detailed investigation of surface karst landforms.",

    "abstract": "Statistical analyses have been carried out on a long-term (1878-2004) series of mean annual discharges of the famous karst spring Fontaine de Vaucluse (France) and the mean annual rainfall in its catchment. The Fontaine de Vaucluse is a typical ascending karst spring situated in the south-eastern region of France. The spring has an average discharge of 23.3 m3/s. The average annual rainfall is 1096 mm. Its catchment area covers 1130 km2. Using the rescaled adjusted partial sums (RAPS) method the existence of next five statistically significant different sub-series was established: 1) 1878-1910: 2) 1911-1941; 3) 1942-1959: 4) 1960-1964; 5) 1965-2004. The different spring discharge characteristics during this long period (1878-2004) can be caused by natural climatic variations, by anthropogenic influences, and possibly by climate changes. At this moment it should be stressed that objective and scientifically based reasons for different hydrological behaviour in five time sub-periods could not be found.",

Some of the caves were visited for the first time and explored to a great depth by the scientists, while the Shanidar cave is a world-famous site representing one of the oldest discovered and investigated human settlements. The explored caves are located in well-karstified limestones of the Cretaceous age as well as in younger Eocene limestones. This paper contains the data from the nine largest caves. Their total explored lengths range from a few tens of meters up to several hundred meters. Four caves are fossil, containing only percolated water, while five represent still hydrogeologically active features. Two of them have resulted from the dissolution of carbonate or evaporate rocks stimulated by water oversaturated in H2S which migrated from deeper oil-bearing structures.",

Thereby is the recipitation rate in, is the calcium concentration of the supersatu­rated solution dripping to the apex of the stalagmite, and its equilibrium concentration with respect to calcite and the in the cave atmosphere. From these ingredients a numerical model of stalagmite growth into an equilibrium shape is presented. In this model one assumes idealistically that the water dripping to the apex flows continuously down the stalagmite, spreading out radially. By simple mass balance one finds that the equilibrium radius is , where is the volume of a drop and the drip interval. Furthermore numerical modeling repro­duces the vertical shifting of the stalagmite’s equilibrium shape. Finally an interesting similarity rule is found. If one scales two stalagmites of differing to the same size and chooses their growth axes as common axis and their apexes as common ori­gin, both show identical shapes. In other words regular stalag­mites are similar geometrically. This similarity rule is verified by digitizing the shapes of various natural stalagmites with di­ameters between 5 cm and 20 m. Within small natural varia­tions, the rescaled shapes are identical and close to the shape of the numerical model.",

The hard laminated crust shows distinctive karst surface features of karren. These include kamenitza, rillenkarren, solution pit and solution enlarged fracture (kluftkarren). First two karst features are common and closely associated with dome- and ridge-like morphologies termed caliche tepees or pseudo-anticlines. Kamenitzas or solution basins are dish-shaped depressions with flat bottom and sharp and overhanging sides which resulted from ponding water mostly at the top of caliche tepees. Rillenkarren are solutional flutes separated by sharp angular ridges, with length of less than 15 cm. They are well developed on the inclined surfaces of surface irregularities at or near the top of caliche tepees and form from sheet flow. Solution pits are narrow, cylindrical shaped karst troughs formed by stemflow drainage beneath trees. The kluftkarrens are products of dissolution by channelised surface water flowing along a fracture. The coexistence of caliche and karst features is important to indicate a climatic change from semiarid to humid conditions.",

In case of Canin, elevation and slope histograms show characteristic differences in plateau levels and landforming processes between the northern, western and southern sectors of the mountains. Ridge and valley map (derived from the digital elevation model) and thalweg analysis are used to recognize drainage reorganizations north of the Italian Canin plateau. Potential snow accumulation locations and nunataks are determined based mainly on the slope map. Geomorphological sketch maps and statistical analysis of closed depressions are also carried out in this study supporting the relatively young age of superficial karstification and the strong structural impact. Finally, it is concluded, that quantitative and visual capabilities of GIS are useful in discriminating the effects of glacial, fluvial, structural and karst processes.",

Most of these shafts are infilled by conglomerate (cemented flint, red soil and limestone chips) and appear as pockets in limestone hills. The morphology of the shafts and the characteristics of their infillings suggest that they developed in vadose zone at the base of epikarst limits. This stage probably took place from the end of Early Eocene to the Middle Miocene. A later, different stage of water erosion occurred, most probably during Pliocene/Pleistocene period. This stage led to remove the epikarst zone, and reshaped the area to create a hilly landscape penetrated by infilled shafts.Keywords: Egypt, the Western Desert, karst, shafts, epikarst.",

Observations show how rock surface roughness increases at high rates after four and six months of exposure, passing from initial roughness RMS values between 14 and 32 mm to values between 396 to 492 mm. From the qualitative SEM approach, it can be concluded that the roughness increase relates with the widening of the space between rock grains and results in the isolation and detaching of rock grains.",

The study region is located in northeastern Italy, in the seismic area of the Cansiglio Plateau. The Zöllner type Marussi tiltmeters are installed in a natural cavity (Bus de la Genziana) that is part of an interesting karstic area of particular hydrogeologic importance. The Livenza river forms from a number of springs at the foothills of the karstic massif and flows throughthe Friuli-Veneto plain into the Adriatic Sea. Comparing the tiltmeter signal recorded at the Genziana station withthe local pluviometrical series and the hydrometric series of the Livenza river, a clear correlation is recognized. Moreover, the data of a permanent GPS station located on the southern slopes of the Cansiglio Massif (CANV) show also a clear correspondence withthe water runoff. Here we present the hydrologic induced deformations as observed by tiltmeter and GPS. After heavy rain events we record rapid deformations bothby tiltmeters and GPS corresponding to the rainfall duration. In the following days a slow geodetic motion recovers the accumulated deformation witha distinctive pattern bothin tilt and GPS data, whichcorrelates withthe runoff of the karstic aquifer. The purpose of this researchis to open a new multidisciplinary frontier between geodetic and karstic systems studies to improve the knowledge of the underground fluid flow circulation in karstic areas. Furthermore a better characterization of the hydrologic effects on GPS and tilt observations will have the benefit that these signals can be corrected when the focus of the study is to recover the tectonic deformation.",

Hypotelminorheic habitats are superficial groundwater sites less than 1 m below the surface that exit from seepage springs. Hyporheic habitats are the underflow of streams and rivers. Epikarst is the uppermost zone of karst with extensive small cavities and channels. Nanos hypotelminorheic sites that harbored stygobiotic species had organic carbon values averaging 3.4 mg C L−1, and temporal variability was high. For hypoheic sites in the Rhône River basin and on Nanos Mountain, mean values ranged from 1.4 to 3.5 mg C L−1. In the more extensively studied Rhône River basin sites, temporal variability was low. Epikarst DOC ranged from 0.70 to 1.10 mg C L−1 in three caves in China (Shihua Cave), Slovenia (Postojna Planina Cave System) and United States (Organ Cave, West Virginia).

Here we present a commercially available microbiological kit for cave ecologists, the RIDA®COUNT test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Germany), as a supplementary tool for research and show examples. Simultaneously, lists of microbial indicator groups and cave microhabitats, where this methodology may be applied, are presented. Indicators include certain clinically important human-associated microbes such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus that are easy to quantify with basic cultivation methodology. Relatively higher bacterial counts compared to yeast and moulds on RIDA®COUNT test plates indicate recent and pronounced human impact. Swab samples allow detection of gradients of surface microbial colonization and determination of the microbial load on footprints and fingerprints in caves. In our tests, RIDA®COUNT plates for enumeration of yeast and moulds revealed a similar microbial load between unwashed caving boots and human fingerprints on a metal fence. Similarly, total bacterial counts were comparable between these two surfaces, 5,890 CFU/100 cm2 for unwashed boots and 4,340 CFU/100 cm2 for fingerprints on metal fence. Bacterial counts on walking surfaces in show caves can exceed 10,000 CFU/100 cm2 (Postojna Cave). These examples show that quantification of microbial indicator groups revealed increased microbial load and possible biohazard in the underground. This procedure may be widely adopted as a part of a regular monitoring programme in caves.",

In Central European caves, Troglophilus cavicola, T. neglectus, Faustina illyrica, Amilenus aurantiacus and Scoliopteryx libatrix are the most important vectors of carbon between the epigean and hypogean habitats. In contrast to the general assumption, carbon total contribution to caves via dead bodies is only 0.15% of total migratory biomass, and it is not directly available to troglobionts because of infection with entomopathogenic fungi. In winter, together with predated migratory specimens, carbon input does not exceed 0.3% of the total migratory biomass.

The exceptional good preservation of these landforms and deposits has been used by different authors for the reconstruction of sea level changes and neotectonic movements. Among the many caves discussed by previous authors, most are of marine origin and can preserve signs of old sea level highstands such as notches and marine or continental sediments. However, two caves in particular, Fantasma Cave and Falesia Rocca Rumena I cave, show evidences to be flank margin caves. Both caves are records of rising and falling sea level, and their position and the correlation with marine terraces suggest them to be around 0.8 and 1.1–1.2 Ma old respectively.

Montello je v tlorisu ovalen, dolg približno 13 km v ZJZ – VSV smeri ter širok okoli 5 km. Razvit je v »montelskem konglomeratu« poznomiocenske starosti (mesinij), ki ga gradijo največ karbonatni prodniki zlepljeni s kalcitnim vezivom, debeline do 2000 m. Montello je oblikovan v cel sistem oblik, nastalih zaradi rečnega uravnavanja in vrezovanja, vidnih na osrednji planoti in sedmih živoskalnih uravnanih teras. Terase so vrezane v pobočje opuščene anticedentne doline. Na rečni uravnavi so se razvile vrtače, večinoma iz grezov pa tudi zaradi točkovnega prenikanja. Vsega skupaj jih je preko 2000. Vrtače na sedmih živoskalnih terasah kažejo različen razvoj in različno velikost glede na starost površja. Kaže, da je bil v začetni fazi morfogeneze vrtač vpliv strukture, to je lezik in razpok, šibak; nasprotno pa je bila poroznost odločujoči dejavnik za razvoj kraškega odtoka. The Montello hill is, probably, the most typical morphounit between the karsts developed in conglomerate rocks. It may be considered the classical karst of the conglomerates comparable with the Classical Karst of limestones: the Carso of Trieste. The Montello hill consists in an elliptical plan figure, elongated for about13 km in a WSW-ENE direction and a width of about 5 km. The rock unit involved is the “Conglomerato del Montello” of late Miocene age (Messinian), mostly composed by carbonate pebbles bound by a calcitic cement, which is 2000 m thick. The Montello is shaped by a complex system of fluvial planation and incision forms in which are distinguishable a main plateau and a stairs of seven planation rock cut terraces. The terraces are cut in the slope of a dead antecedent valley. On the fluvial planation forms, dolines, mostly of the draw down type but also of the point recharge type, have evolved. In total more than 2000 dolines are present. In the seven rock cut terraces the dolines show different development and dimensions according with the ages of the surfaces. In the first morphogenesis of these dolines and of the caves the control of the plan structures as the bedding surfaces and the fractures seems to have been feeble; on the contrary the porosity of the conglomerate has been a determinant factors for the developmente of the karst drainage.",

Na načrtih mnogih jam je mogoče razločiti enostavne podorne dvorane in vrste velikih jamskih prostorov, eno glavnih sestavin tamkajšnjih jam, kar kaže na velik pomen teh dveh elementov. Za opis in boljše razumevanje razporeditve udorov so lahko zelo koristni podatki, pridobljeni s pomočjo podrobnega kartiranja različnih podornih struktur, kot so podorni stožci, nagnjena podorna pobočja, prerezi v obliki obokov, »stičišča«, podorni zamaški in kupolaste strukture.A general overview on the patterns of collapse chambers in the karsts of Mallorca is presented. The great significance of single breakdown chambers and strings of large rooms as one of the major constituents of cave patterns is easy to recognize in the cave surveys of many Majorcan caves. Detailed mapping of several collapse features such as breakdown piles, sloped boulder floors, vault profiles, coalescence areas, boulder chokes and dome structures can yield useful information regarding description and better understanding of cave collapse patterns.",

    "abstract": "The EU-TecNet fault displacement monitoring network records three-dimensional displacements across specifically selected tectonic structures within the crystalline basement of central Europe. This paper presents a study of recent and active tectonic fault displacement recorded at Západní Cave in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic). It extends previous geological research by measuring speleothem damage within the cave and monitoring displacements across two fault structures within the Lusatian Thrust Zone. The measured speleothem damage, which are characterised by strike-slip movements, show dextral strike-slip displacement along the WSW-ENE striking fault and sinistral strike-slip displacement along the NNW-SSE striking fault. It is found that the compressive stress σ1 is located in the NW or SE quadrant while the tensile stress σ3 is oriented perpendicular to σ1, i.e. in the NE or SW quadrant. The results of fault displacement monitoring show a long-term dextral strike-slip trend along the WSW-ENE striking fault while the NNW-SSE striking fault presents evidence for uplift of the eastern block. There are notable periods of increased geodynamic activity, referred to as pressure pulses, in 2008, 2010-2011, and 2012. The significant correspondence between the measured speleothem damage and the results of fault displacement monitoring confirm the supposition that, at this site, the compressive stress σ1 persists in the NW or SE quadrant. The presented results offer an insight into the periodicity of pressure pulses, demonstrate the necessity for protracted monitoring periods as a means for better understanding geodynamic processes, and show that it is possible to characterise the displacements that occur across individual faults in a way that cannot be accomplished from geodetic measurements made using Global Navigation Satellite Systems.",

Rezultat ponovne izmere jame je precej večja dolžina, nov načrt jame in številna opažanja, ki kažejo na to, da jama ni nastala z »normalno speleogenezo«, ampak je t.i. fantomska jama. Fantomske jame nastajajo pri delnem preperevanju nečistega apnenca v toplih klimah, v pogojih nizkega hidravličnega gradienta. Ob povečanju gradienta, voda izpere netopni preostanek, pri čemer nastane jama. Članek obravnava geomorfološke značilnosti jam, ki nam omogočajo prepoznavati fantomske jame. Kaltbach cave is developed within the Eocene Hohgant sandstone in the Siebenhengste area in Switzerland. A remapping project of the cave resulted in a huge increase in length. It also produced a complete, updated map and longitudinal section. The cave’s morphology does not fitwiththe“normal”speleogenesis:itisaso-calledphantom cave. Phantoms are created by differential weathering of impure limestone under a preferably warm climate and a very low hydrologic gradient. Once the gradient steepens, the undissolved residual sediments are piped out; the “cave” manifests itself. The paper discusses the geomorphological features that permit to recognize the phantom caves.",

    "abstract": "Caves develop along sedimentary and tectonic discontinuities within soluble rock mass. In the Slovene Classical Kras (Karst), the primary lithologies are limestone and dolomite. Previous research of cave systems in SW Slovenia indicated a clear relationship between cave channel directions with local structural elements, which is also documented in the mapped area. Kačna jama is the longest cave of the Kras Plateau and represents an important part of the underground flow of the Reka River. For structural mapping, we applied a method adopted for the surface of karstic terrains. We documented three NW−SE oriented faults and additionally an equally oriented fracture zone. These structures are parallel to the regional Divača Fault, which was detected in the NW edge of the mapped area. Between them, the cross-oriented fracture zones run, and occasionally bend, towards N−S orientation. The described structure is explained using a complex, divergent-convergent, dextral strike-slip fault-wedge. Among the detected structures, we focus on the Risnik Fault along which the Risnik and Bukovnik collapse dolines are developed, whereas in the Kačnja jama the same fault is manifested by several rock-fall accumulations. During dry-weather conditions groundwater is drained through the fault in the terminal sump at the end of the Ozki rov channel. Whereas during floods, the same fault acts as a hydrogeological barrier, because the previously mentioned terminal sump is no longer capable of transmitting sufficient quantities of groundwater, which in such conditions flow along the fault through a well-developed system of channels in the NW direction. We propose that the Risnik Fault acts as a deflector fault. Geološka Struktura na območju Divače in njen vpliv na spelogenezo ter hidrogeologijo Kačne jameJame se razvijajo vzdolž nezveznosti, sedimentarnega ali tektonskega izvora v zaporedju topnih kamnin. Na Klasičnem Krasu slednje predstavljata apnenec in dolomit. Predhodne raziskave kraških terenov jugozahodne Slovenije so pokazale jasno povezavo med smerjo jamskih kanalov in lokalnih strukturih elementov, kar se je pokazalo tudi na prikazanem območju kartiranja. Kačna jama je najdaljša jama Klasičnega Krasa in predstavlja pomemben del podzemnega toka reke Reke. S strukturnim kartiranjem površine nad jamo, ki je prilagojeno kraškim ozemljem, smo ugotovili potek treh SZ−JV prelomov in ene vmesne razpoklinske cone v enaki smeri. Te strukture so vzporedne regionalnemu Divaškemu prelomu, ki smo ga zaznali na skrajnem SV delu raziskanega območja. Med njimi potekajo prečno usmerjene razpoklinske cone, ki so deloma povite do smeri S−J. Opisano strukturo razlagamo s kompleksnim divergentno-konvergentnim desno-zmičnim prelomnim klinom. Posebej obravnavamo Risniški prelom, ob katerem sta razviti udornici Risnik in Bukovnik, ter nekaj večjih podorov v jami. V odtočni sifon na koncu Ozkega rova nizke vode odtekajo skozi Risniški prelom v smeri regionalnega gradienta. Medtem za visoke vode isti prelom predstavlja hidrogeološko zaporo, saj prej omenjeni odtočni sifon ne zmore več prevajati zadostnih količin podzemne vode in ta odteka vzdolž preloma po dobro razvitem sistemu kanalov v NW smeri. Menimo, da ima Risniški prelom vlogo zapornega preloma.",

    "abstract": "Skriti kras (cryptokarst) je kras, razvit pod prepustnim, vendar netopnim pokrovom. Nastane zaradi vode, ki prenika skozi krovne plasti. V krovnih plasteh se zbira voda, se poèasi preceja skoznje in razjeda matično kamnino. Zaradi tega nastanejo depresije, zapolnjene s pokrovnim sedimentom, in kraški stebri. Zaradi posedanja prepustnega pokrova, nastanejo na površju ulegnine. Če erozija odtsrani krovnino, se razgali relief, za katerega so značilni kraški stebri, razvalinasti relief in vrtače.Cryptokarst is a karst developed beneath a permeable and not karstifiable formation by percolating waters. The permeable rock acts as a storage of water which feeds slow seepage and infiltration enhancing the alteration of bedrock. The resulting forms consist of depressions, filled by the covering sediments, and pinnacles. The sinking of the permeable cover can produce depressions on the topographic surface. Erosion of the cover exposes a landscape characterised by pinnacles, ruinforms and dolines. In the Apulia region, cryptocorrosion surfaces are characterized by solution pipes 4-5 meters deep and with variable width (from a few centimeters to about one meter). Pipes walls are covered by a brownish carbonate crust, from a centimeter to more than 10 centimeters thick. The continental sands are only found in these depressions. The cryptocorrosion process took place late in the Middle Pleistocene on Quaternary marine abrasion terraces covered by no-carbonate sandy-silty continental deposits. The process stopped before the Last Interglacial age in response of an abrupt climatic change that induces a calcium carbonate precipitation and the formation of a carbonate crust.",

    "abstract": "V Savdski Arabiji je bilo raziskanih in izmerjenih več velikih vulkanskih jam v različnih poljih lave. Ena največjih je Ghar Al Hibashi na polju lave Harrat Buqum-Nawasif. To je v glavnem raven rov (400 m dolg in 15 m širok), dostopen skozi majhno brezno, ki se odpira v stranskem rovu. Jama je dolgo služila za skrivališče netopirjem, hijenam, volkovom in lisicam. Zaradi tega je dno jame, deloma iz debelih plasti nesprijetega peska, prekrito s številnimi kostmi in koproliti ter razmeroma velikimi kupi gvana. Nekateri so se bili vneli, zaradi česar so deloma zgorele tudi na njih ležeče kosti. Edine prave kapnike predstavlja nekaj majhnih, rumenih in prosojnih stalaktitov. Tekom treh odprav 2003 je bilo iz jame vzetih nekaj sekundarnih kemičnih odkladnin za mineraloške preiskave. Kljub majhnemu številu vzorcev je bilo do sedaj zaznanih vsaj 19 različnih mineralov, največ takih, ki so povezani z biogeno mineralizacijo kosti in gvana. Trije od teh, pyrocoproite, pyrophosphite in arnhemite, so izredno redke organske spojine, izključno vezane na goreči gvano. Do danes so bili ti minerali znani le iz nekaj jam v Afriki. Zahvaljujoč tem odkritjem ni jama Hibashi le najpomembnejša vulkanska jama v Savdski Arabiji, ampak tudi tamkajšnje daleč najbogatejše mineraloško nahajališče. Zato te raziskave, ki še zdaleč niso končane, potrjujejo novejše domneve, da so v jamskem okolju prav vulkanske jame najprimernejše za razvoj različnih mineralogenih mehanizmov.Several large lava tubes have been explored and mapped in different lava fields around the Saudi Arabia. One of the largest is Ghar Al Hibashi, located in the Harrat Buqum-Nawasif lava field. It mainly consists of a huge rectilinear gallery (over 400 m long and 15 m wide) the access to which is through a small vertical pit reaching a side corridor. The cave was long used as a shelter for bats, hyenas, wolves and foxes. Therefore the entire cave floor, consisting of locally thick uncemented sand, is scattered with a great amount of bones and coprolites, while some rather large guano deposits are also found. Some of these guano deposits caught fire, which partially burnt the bones overlaying them as well. The only true speleothems consist of a few small yellow translucent stalactites. During three expeditions in 2003, a few samples of secondary chemical deposits were collected inside this lava tube to be analysed from the mineralogical point of view. Despite the scarcity of these samples, at least 19 different minerals have already been detected, most of which are related to the biogenic mineralization of bones and guano deposits. Three of them, pyrocoproite, pyrophosphite and arnhemite are extremely rare organic compounds strictly related to the guano combustion, which have been observed until now only in a few caves in Africa. Thanks to these findings Hibashi lava tube is not only the most important volcanic cave of Saudi Arabia but also by far the richest mineralogical shelter of the country. Therefore this research, which is far from coming to an end, confirms the recently advanced opinion that amongst the different cave environments, volcanic cavities are very favourable for the development of different minerogenetic mechanisms.",

To zvrst označuje velika tipološka raznolikost, ki sloni na avtentičnih značilnostih naravnega in kulturnega izvora, nastala pa je kot nasledek uravnotežene gospodarske rabe tal od zgodnjih obdobij dalje. Glavna kvaliteta kraških krajin izvira iz edinstvenih vzorcev rabe prostora, ki pomenijo eno najvrednejših prostorskih dediščin v celotnem Sredozemlju. Toda novejši razvoj, predvsem v družbenogospodarski sferi, je izzval daljnosežne posledice na podeželju, kar močno prizadeva celovitost in tradicionalno skladnost krasa nasploh in njegovih pokrajin posebej. Temeljni namen prispevka je orisati to preobrazbo kot resno grožnjo in veliko izgubo nacionalne kulturne dediščine ter podčrtati odgovornost naše generacije v teh procesih.During a long historical continuity in the karst area a specific landscape type has evolved due to varied climatic, geomorphological, topographic as well as socio-economic conditions. This is characterized by great typological diversity based on authentic features both of natural and cultural origin. These have occurred as a consequence of balanced economic land-uses from early periods on. The main quality of these landscapes is derived from unique agricultural land-use patterns, which constitute one of the most valuable spatial heritages in the entire Mediterranean. However, the recent evolution, mainly in the socio-economic sphere, generated far-reaching impacts in the rural areas which largely affect the integrity and traditional harmony the karst countryside in general and the landscape in particular. The basic intention of the paper is to outline these transformations as a serious threat and immense loss of the national cultural heritage and to emphasize the great responsibility of this generation in these processes.",

Silty loams with guano contain abundant quartz, illite and taranakite and minor vivianite and high concentrations of Cu (2869 mg/kg), Zn (951 mg/kg) and Cd (28 mg/kg). Also sediments mixed with guano are enriched with light REE as well as elevated concentrations of U, Th, Rb and Hg. Sediments with bone fragments contain abundant quartz, illite, calcite and hydroxylapatite and minor carndallite and lower contents of heavy metals. All sediments analysed showed various degrees of contamination by Cu and Zn from dispersed guano. Most of the Zn and Cu in cave sediments and the hydroxyl-apatite crusts are mainly controlled by the iron and manganese hydroxide and the organic fractions, the organic fraction plays an important role in sediment samples with direct influence of guano and in hydroxylapatite crusts while in samples with bone fragments the hydroxide control is dominant. Guano influence on the percolating waters was observed in two cases in the left channel where due to the higher content of orthophosphates saturation in respect to hydroxyl-apatite is present.",

    "abstract": "Področje Kalabrije v južni Italiji predstavlja izreden primer krasa v sadri, ki vključuje tudi evaporitne kamnine triasne do miocenske starosti. Triasni evaporiti se pojavljajo v sekvenci debeli okrog sto metrov na področju obmorskega hrbta na zahodni obali Kalabrije. Na drugi strani pa evaporiti mesinske starosti obširno izdanjajo na vzhodu, v krotonskem bazenu. Pričujoči prispevek opisuje glavne značilnosti krasa v sadri (od površinske kraške morfologije do razvoja jam) na vzhodnem predelu Kalabrije. Krotonski bazen je med najbolj zanimivimi področji evaporitnega krasa v Italiji: tam najdemo različne površinske kraške oblike kot so vrtače, slepe doline, zaprte depresije, globoke in ozke soteske, kjer zasledimo intenzivna pobočna gibanja. Številni vhodi jam so na dnu vrtač. Jama Grave Grubbo, dolga prek 2.500 m, je ena daljših jam v Italiji v evaporitih. Na raziskovanem področju je prišlo do številnih sprememb, še posebno zaradi kmetijske dejavnosti in zaradi nezadostne pozornosti lokalnih oblasti do te izjemne pokrajine. Posebna vrednost krasa v sadri v Kalabriji še ni v celoti ovrednotena. Prišlo je namreč do onesnaženja številnih jam in posledično do znižanja kakovosti vode, ki teče v kras. The Calabria region of southern Italy presents remarkable examples of gypsum karst, involving evaporite rocks ranging in age from Trias to Miocene. Triassic evaporites are limited to a sequence of about one hundred meters of thickness in the Coastal Chain, on the western Calabrian coast. Messinian evaporites, on the other hand, extensively crop out to the east, in the Crotone Basin. The present contribution intends to describe the main features of gypsum karst in the latter area, from the surface karst morphology to the development of caves. The Crotone Basin is among the most interesting areas as regards evaporite karst in Italy: a variety of surface karst landforms is there present, including dolines, blind valleys, closed depressions, and deep and narrow canyons intensely affected by slope movements. Many caves are located at the bottom of the dolines, as Grave Grubbo which, with a length over 2,500 meters, is one of the longest Italian caves in evaporites. The study area has experienced several transformations, mostly due to agricultural activity and to scarce attention paid by local administrators toward this unique naturalistic landscape. The high value of Calabrian gypsum karst is thus not fully exploited, and several cases of degradation of the caves have been registered, even with consequences for the quality of water flowing in the karst systems.",

V času nizkega nivoja morske gladine je sladkovodni tok izdolbel jamski sistem v bližini vodne gladine na tak način, da je raztapljal aragonit v frontalnem faciesu in skupke koral v obstoječih lagunskih plasteh. Ta jamski sistem se je razvijal v bližini površinske erozijske baze.

On the Eastern coast of Mallorca, the reefal complex is overlain by a Messinian shallowwater carbonate complex. There are abundant Paleokarst collapse structures. The Santanyí Limestone beds are affected by V-incasion structures produced by roof collapse of caverns developed in the underlying reefal complex. According to the model, the origin of some of these karst-collapse structures may be related to early diagenetic processes controlled by high-frequency sea-level fluctuations. During lowstands of sea level, freshwater flow might have create a cave system near the water table by dissolution of aragonite in the reef front facies and coral patches existing in the lagoonal beds. This cave system developed near the subaerial erosion surface. During subsequent rise of sea level inner-shelf beds overlaid the previously karstified reef-core and outer-lagoonal beds. Increase of loading by subsequent accretion of the shallow-water carbonates might have produced V-incasion structures by gravitational collapse of cave roofs when these beds were still not completely consolidated.",

    "abstract": "Doline mapping is paramount in the vulnerability and risk assessment of the underground karst environment by identifying cave-ground connectivity points at the surface. However, manual mapping is labour-intensive, slow and subjective, especially on a large scale. Therefore, the present study adopted a GIS-based semi-automatic approach for mapping large and medium-sized depressions/dolines in the Corrente river basin in Brazil, with a particular focus on the environmentally preserved areas of river Vermelho (APANRV Portuguese abbreviation) using remote sensing (DEM and Google Earth imagery) and field-based observations. Seven typical dolines forms (e.g., cockpit with drain insertion, collapse, collapse with river capture, suffosion, solution, cover collapse, and buried) are found from extensive field surveys. As an outcome of the proposed approach, two hundred and thirty-two medium to large-sized dolines have been identified and categorised into three main groups based on the cave density and local geology G1, G2, and G3. The high density of identified dolines (164 known caves) in G1 provides reconnaissance for future speleological works in the preserved areas. Additionally, the presence of a considerable number of dolines in the adjoining areas (G2 and G3) stresses the need to revise the existing boundaries of the APANRV. Results correlate well with the dolines sites marked using field surveys and Google Earth images. This doline mapping may help researchers in the groundwater vulnerability assessment and the protection of speleological heritage preserved in the caves.",

    "abstract": "Electron spin resonance (ESR) dating has been developed for many materials, including hydroxyapatite in enamel, bone, and some fish scales, aragonite and calcite in travertine, molluscs, and calcrete, and quartz from ash, which have many potential applications in karst settings. Although the complexity of the signals in some materials has hampered routine application, research is solving these problems to make the method even more widely applicable. When tested against other dating tech­niques, age agreement has usually been excellent. Generally, the most reliable applications seem to be tooth enamel, some mol­lusc species, calcite deposits, and quartz minerals. ESR dating uses signals resulting from trapped charges created by radia­tion in crystalline solids. Ages are calculated by comparing the accumulated dose in the dating sample with the internal and external radiation dose rates produced by natural radiation in and around the sample. For fossils and authigenic minerals, no zeroing is necessary to obtain accurate ages. In sediment which contains reworked mineral clasts, ESR can be used to date the age of the mineral grain itself if it was not zeroed during ero­sion. For dating the sedimentation age, however, ESR signals must have been zeroed in order to give the correct age. High pressure, heating, and in some minerals, light exposure and grinding can zero an ESR signal, but some like hydroxyapatite have very high stability at surface temperatures. For materi­als that absorb uranium (U) during their burial history, such as teeth, bones, or mollusc shells, the age calculation considers their U uptake by cross calibrating with U series or U/Pb dat­ing or by assuming different uptake models. Some difficulties in calculating the external dose rate can be overcome by ap­plying the ESR isochron method, in which the sample acts as its own dosimeter. In open-air karst environments, changes in the external dose rate due to altered sediment cover, and hence, changing cosmic dose rates, need to be modelled. For all karst environments, sedimentary water concentration and mineralogical variations with time also need to be considered. Many ESR applications are currently used in karst settings, but several more are also possible.",

Age at death was estimated for 128 different individuals by analysing cementum increments, root formation and crown wear of left M1 teeth. After the frequency distribution of specimens through one-year intervals, the mortality trends can be estimated for various lifetime periods, and interpreted in accordance with data for present-day bears. The original death assemblage was presumably juvenile-dominated. Extremely fragile molars of less than 6 month old cubs did not get preserved. Yearlings are the most numerous age class in the fossil population from the Mokrica cave. Mortality drastically dropped after cave bears survived their first hibernation in the second winter. The lowest mortality rate was observed in the 9-15 years age group, when cave bears would be expected to be in their prime. The oldest age recorded by cementum analysis is approximately 30 years, which indicates that the maximum life span was similar to present-day bears. Study of dental tissues shows that the mortality in the cave was seasonally restricted – the majority of deaths in the cave occured during winter and in early spring. Sex structure of the fossil population has been studied on the sample of 750 canines. The significantly higher proportion of males in the group of older juveniles and subadults could be explained by the fact that the weaning period is more critical for males also in present-day bears. In young adults and prime adults the mortality was presumably higher in females. The sex structure of adult bears, especially in the sample of older individuals, indicates that the Mokrica cave was used as winter den mostly by solitary males.",

For the hydrological year 1975, total runoff from the Cerknica Polje catchment (475 km2) is estimated at 620 million m3 of water or 17 m3/s. In the observation year, the strongest lake volume increase in terms of discharge was 135 m3/s, whereas the strongest lake volume decrease was 60 m3/s. According to calculations, maximum possible inflow to the Cerknica Polje was 232 m3/s. In the hydrological year 1975, calculated mean outflow from the Cerknica Polje through ponor caves and ponors at the bottom of the polje was 23.69 m3/s and maximum calculated outflow was 91.75 m3/s.",

    "abstract": "The tectonic setting of W Slovenia is characterised by NW-SE trending dextral strike-slip fault systems and moderate seismicity. Monitoring of tectonic movements along five presumably active faults or in their vicinity using TM 71 extensometers was set up in 2004. In five years of monitoring some clear trends of displacement were established. The morphologically most prominent fault in W Slovenia is Idrija Fault having a total length of more than 120 km. The average lateral displacement measured along a crack in its inner fault zone in Učja valley was 0.26 mm/year. Short-term rates were even greater and reached 0.54 mm/year. Raša Fault monitoring site at the foot of Vremščica Mt. established first an average uplift of SW block for 0.16 mm/year and left-lateral displacement of 0.16 mm/ year. It was followed by down-slip of the same block at the rate of 0.37 mm/year. In Postojnska Jama two instruments, 260 m apart, were installed at the fault zone, which extends about 1 km northeast from Predjama Fault. We detect small tectonic deformations, dextral horizontal movement of 0.05 mm in 5 years for Postojna 1 and extension of 0.03 mm in 5 years for Postojna 2. Both devices recorded similar reactions to some earthquakes with magnitude range 3.1-5.2 and epicentral distance of 12-95 km. The amplitude of individual peaks is in the order of 0.08 mm. The monitoring at Kneža Fault started at the end of 2006. In two years clear oblique displacement was established with left-lateral rate of 0.06 mm/year and uplift of SW block for 0.06 mm/year. Monitoring in Pološka Jama situated in vicinity of the Ravne Fault started in 2008. Preliminary results show 0.08 mm of horizontal displacement between two limestone beds. Established displacements proved the active tectonic movement of all monitored faults. Observed deformation rates can be compared with the regional deformation rate in W Slovenia established from GPS measurement, which is in the order of 2 mm/year.",

Nine speleogenetic phases can be recognised ranging in age between Cambrian and Holocene. Optical microscope and diffracto­metric analysis of active flowstone deposits have shown them being composed of alternating calcite and aragonite layers. The textural and chemical characteristics of these layers, obtained by SEM and EDAXanalysis, suggest them to be related to varia­tions in the depositional environment inside the cave, whichin turn are probably correlated to external climatic oscillations.",

The TOC and NO3–, representing tracers from the soil that infiltrate throughthe unsaturated zone, were found to vary inversely withthe Mg2+ content, whichis a natu­ral indicator of groundwater residence time. Furthermore, a strong, direct relation was found between TOC and the natu­ral fluorescence associated withhumic and fulvic acids. Bothparameters respond similarly to rainfall events, exhibiting sig­nificant increases during recharge followed by reductions dur­ing recession. This relation means that TOC mainly originates from organic acids. The results document rapid infiltration pro­cesses witha lag of less than one day following rainfall, whichis typical of a karst aquifer withconduit flow, rapid drainage and limited natural regulation. The combined use of conventional hydrochemical parameters and natural organic tracers facili­tates aquifer characterization and validates the vulnerability to contamination.",

The mean cave temperature was 15.6°C in 2009, witha seasonal amplitude of &lt;0.4°C. Access of tourists to the cavern produces thermal anomalies of &lt;0.15°C, whichare recovered overnight in most cases. During days withhighvisitor num­bers, cumulative thermal anomalies may persist from one day to the next, causing an increase of cave temperature for longer periods. However, this anthropogenic effect disappears soon after the number of tourists reduces, lasting less than a week in most cases. Cumulative thermal anomalies are &lt;0.02°C dur­ing most of the year and &lt;0.1°C in periods withlarge number of visitors. The anthropogenic effect on cave temperature is non-persistent and has a small magnitude in comparison withnatural oscillations. Thus, long-term absolute temperatures ob­tained from Eagle Cave are not affected by visitors. The input of thermal energy caused by tourists is absorbed as latent heat by the cave (causing evaporation), whichprevents the increase of baseline temperatures in the environment. A condensation process occurs over cave walls and speleothems. This is the re­sult of cooling the atmosphere during the thermal equilibra­tion withcave walls once visitors leave. Althoughcondensation is found in Eagle Cave, the magnitude of the process is not enoughto cause any significant condensation corrosion that could damage speleothems as a result of the tourist visits. The cave is in thermal equilibrium withsurface temperatures, and calibration studies will produce suitable results for palaeocli­mate studies despite being a tourist cavern.",

Groundwater was pumped for a period of 30 days, from three wells at the Klarici pumping station, and from well B-10/06, with a common capacity of 470 L/s. The fact that pumping caused a decrease in the water table in well B-10/06 by only 17 cm at a pumping rate of 265 L/s suggests that larger quantities of groundwater could be pumped from this well. The tracer experiment, performed at the B-10/06 temporary pipeline discharge area, showed that no pumped water was returned to the area of the exploited wells during the pumping test. Tracer uranine, which had been injected at the effluent from the pumped water from the well, was detected only at the Sardos Spring. The intensive pumping resulted in changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of oxygen in the water, due to a greater impact of the water from the intergranular SocaRiver aquifer on the karst aquifer.The chemical quality of groundwater from well B-10/06 is adequate for the purpose of drinking water supply. The presence of bacteria in groundwater is typical of karst aquifers and the water needs to be disinfected for further use.Keywords: groundwater, Classical Karst, Brestovica – Klariči aquifer, pumping test, tracer test, geochemical analysis.",

    "abstract": "The most conspicuous six examples illustrating ascending (perascensum) speleogenesis linked with deep faults/fault systemswere selected from Slovakia and Czech Republic. In the past,the caves have been described as product of phreatic, epiphreaticand vadose speleogenesis related to the evolution of localwater courses and valley incision, and linked mostly with Pleistocenegeomorphic evolution. Our analysis illustrates severalcommon characteristics of caves: (1) they developed along or inclose vicinity of deep faults/fault zones, commonly of regionalimportance; (2) the groundwater ascended due to deep faults/fault systems mostly as results of deep regional circulation ofmeteoric waters from adjacent karst or nonkarst areas; (3) the3D mazes and labyrinths dominate in cave morphology; (4)speleogens (e.g., cupolas, slots, ceiling channels, spongework,rugged phreatic morphology especially along slots) indicateascending speleogenesis in deep phreatic to phreatic environments;(5) they exhibit poor relation to the present landscape;in some of them fluvial sediments are completely missing inspite of surface rivers/streams in the direct vicinity; (6) strongepiphreatic re-modelling is common in general (e.g., subhorizontalpassages arranged in cave levels, water-table flat ceilingsand notches) and related to the evolution of the recent landscape;(7) recharge structures and correlate surface precipitatesare poorly preserved or completely missing (denuded) on thepresent surface in spite of fact that recent recharges broadlyprecipitate travertines; (8) caves can be, and some of them are,substantially older than the recent landscape (Pliocene, Miocene),and (9) caves were formed in conditions of slow water ascent, which differentiate the process from faster vauclusianascending speleogenetical models. Any of described caves containsclear diagnostic features of real hypogene caves. There aremissing evidences that at least heated groundwaters took partduring speleogenesis of studied caves, nevertheless, somewhatincreased water temperature can be expected during speleogenesisat least in some of caves. Any of described caves cannotbe directly characterized as product of thermal waters or hydrothermalprocess (i.e. as real hyperkarst sensu Cigna 1978),therefore they do not represent hypogenic caves.",

Karst pastures are characterized by shallow rocky soils, high pH, and dry, warm conditions, whereas karst meadows have developed on deeper soil, with more humus and moisture and neutral to alkaline pH. The data set included a table with 100 phytosociological relevés of the studied grasslands and a matrix with 15 functional traits determined for 180 plant species. we found high species richness in these grasslands but no statistically significant differences in species richness between karst pastures and meadows. Differences in floristic composition were analysed with Detrended Correspondence Analysis, which supported a clear division between the two vegetation types and indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of soil humidity and nutrient availability. We also detected several differences in plant functional traits between meadows and pastures. Some of the traits indicate greater resource availability on karst meadows (in particular, high SLA, low LDMC). In contrast, karst pastures have more slow-growing species with a combination of traits that can be interpreted as an avoidance strategy in relation to disturbance (e.g., grazing) in low productive habitats (e.g., low SLA, high LDMC, early flowering species and plants with rosette). A lower relative proportion of competitors (C) and ruderals (R), and a higher relative proportion of stress-tolerators (S) in karst pastures also suggested that these grasslands generally experience higher intensities of stress when compared to karst meadows, presumably owing to lower resource availability on stony, shallow soil. we could conclude that karst meadows and pastures differ significantly in both floristic composition and functional trait means, owing to their distinctive land-use (disturbance) and environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "High frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) is usually applied for cavities detection in a shallow subsurface of karst areas to prevent geotechnical hazards. For specific projects, such as tunnel construction, it is important to detect also larger voids at medium depth range. However, dimensions of classical rigid low frequency antennas seriously limit their applicability in a rough terrain with dense vegetation commonly encountered in a karst. In this study recently developed 50 MHz antennas designed in a tube form were tested to detect cave gallery at the depth between 12 m and 60 m. The Divaca cave was selected because of a wide range of depths under the surface, possibility of unknown galleries in the vicinity and a rough terrain surface typical for Slovenian karst. Seven GPR profiles were measured across the main gallery of the cave and additional four profiles NE of the cave entrance where no galleries are known. Different acquisition and processing parameters were analysed together with the data resolution issues. The main gallery of the cave was clearly imaged in the part where the roof of the gallery is located at the depth from 10 m to 30 m. The width of the open space is mainly around 10 m. Applied system was not able to detect the gallery in the part where it is located deeper than 40 m, but several shallower cavities were discovered which were unknown before. The most important result is that the profiles acquired NE of the cave entrance revealed very clearly the existence of an unknown gallery which is located at the depth between 15 m and 22 m and represents the continuation of the Divaca cave. Access to this gallery is blocked by the sediment fill in the entrance shaft of the cave. The results of the study are important also for future infrastructure projects which will involve construction of tunnels through karstified limestone and for speleological investigations to direct the research efforts.Keywords: ground penetrating radar, cavity detection, spatial resolution, limestone, Divača cave.",

In the investigated area the vegetation cover, as a reliable indicator for specific karstic circumstances, is being differentiated in a great number of syntaxa (plant communities) that encompass over 2,500 vascular plants. On the surface of about 100,000 ha identified were up to 236 plant associations, 116 alliances and 63 vegetation orders that belong to 34 classes. This amounts 34% of total of vegetation classes at the European level and 100% of so far known vegetation classes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, over 80% of classes at the level of Montenegro and Croatia.There have been identified nearly 450 endemic and relict species, which is why most of the identified communities are endemic and relict ones, not only at the level of association but also at the level of higher syntaxonomic categories, such as alliance and order. The highest diversity level characterizes those communities that make a direct contact with the calcareous geological foundation either in rock crevices or screes on limestone.

Almost all important karst springs in this area are captured for water supply. A sustainable management of this source of groundwater is of strategic importance, not only as drinking water supply but also for the economy. For these reasons, many hydrogeological monitoring studies have been carried out over the last decades. However, no consistent regional overview of the hydrogeological functioning of Trnovsko-Banjška planota was available and we decided to study this area with more direct approach based on 3D geological and hydrogeological models. The so called KARSYS approach was developed in Switzerland and applied primarily to characterize groundwater reserves within a karst massif, and to sketch the main flow-paths carrying groundwater from recharge areas to the respective springs. The delineation of spring catchment areas in karst regions was better defined and interactions between catchments were interpreted. These results can be used to improve the management of karst waters in the studied area.",

    "abstract": "Lampenflora consists of phototrophic organisms which grow near artificial light. In caves with artificial lighting, a vegetation of aerophytic cyanobacteria and algae, bryophytes and ferns can be found around lamps; these communities represent an alteration of the underground environment and may cause damages both to speleothems and cave fauna. The development of lampenflora is a typical problem for show cave management.A floristic research of bryophytes and ferns (land plants) of lampenflora was carried out in 2012 in Grotta Gigante, a very well-known show cave of the Trieste Karst (NE Italy), in order to compile a species inventory. 26 sites near artificial lights of different kinds were sampled in the dark zone of the show cave. 16 moss species and 2 ferns were found; no liverworts were observed. The most common species are the mosses Eucladium verticillatum, Fissidens bryoides, Oxyrrhynchium schleicheri, Rhynchostegiella tenella and the fern Asplenium trichomanes; 7 moss species were found only in one to two sites. Some moss species belong to the flora of natural cave entrances of the Italian Karst, while other are typical of disturbed, open habitats. Various moss species and A. trichomanes are colonizing areas around LEDs and fluorescent lamps installed in 2009 along the cave’s pathways for safety lighting.Species richness of bryophytes and ferns of lampenflora in Grotta Gigante is the highest compared to other recently investigated show caves in the neighbouring Slovenia. Lampenflora of Grotta Gigante conforms to that found in other Slovenian show caves starting from the ’40. The main ecological factors affecting lampenflora identified in this work are: light intensity, water availability, type of substrate, morphological features of surfaces, presence of clay. Aspects of species ecology and distribution in the cave are discussed.",

However, informations about anurans in Brazilian caves including different biomes and lithologies are scarce. This study sampled 223 caves divided into different biomes (Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado and transition area) and lithologies (Conglomerate, Granite, Iron-ore, Limestone, Marble, Quartzite, and Sandstone) distributed in eleven Brazilian states. To determine the anuran composition (presence/absence), a single sampling event was conducted in each cave by a team of three researchers in the period 1999−2011, following acoustic and visual search methods. We recorded 54 species distributed 18 genera and 11 families. The caves in the Amazon biome had the highest number of species, followed by caves present in the Cerrado, Caatinga, transition area (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado) and the Atlantic Forest. The caves in the Iron-ore lithology had the highest number of species, followed by the Limestone, Sandstone, Quartzite, Granite, Marble and Conglomerate caves. The anurans proved to be very diverse in Brazilian caves, with this high species richness related to the large amount of biomes and lithologies sampled. The family Leiuperidae had the highest richness and the species Scinax fuscovarius the highest frequency of occurrence in the caves. Also recorded were tadpoles and immature forms inside caves suggesting that not all the species are accidental, and that some species may be using these environments for shelter, protection, food and, even reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Karst areas in densely populated and industrialized areas in Brazil are under severe environmental pressure due to urbanization, quarrying, groundwater pollution, groundwater overpumping and cave vandalism. Although karst terrains receive no specific protection according to Brazilian environmental law, caves, regardless of rock type, are classified as belonging to the society, and must be studied in detail to have their significance (and related level of protection) determined. Most caves (&gt;90 %) are of either maximum or high significance, which results in protection of not only the cave but also of an associated buffer zone. Given the very conservative definition of cave (a natural void large enough to allow a human being to enter), hundreds of caves will exist in any given outcrop and the amalgamation of buffer zones tends to yield an integrated area that covers most of the karst surface. In the Lagoa Santa Karst, Brazil’s most urbanized and industrialized karst area, cave preservation is presently the most effective approach to protecting karst heritage. However, other karst features not connected to existing caves (e.g., covered karst, karst aquifers with no accessible caves, dolines with no associated caves) receive no specific protection. Although this heterogeneous level of protection may yield non-preserved karst areas, the remaining zones tend to be surrounded by protection belts, imposing severe restrictions on urban and mining development and associated sources of potential damage.Key words: Environmental policy, cave protection, karst preservation, Lagoa Santa Karst.",

    "abstract": "Nastanek hidrotermalnih kraških jam je povezan z variskičnimi hidrotermalnimi procesi. Nastali votli prostori so bili zapolnjeni s kristaliničnim kalcitom. Proces je spremljala močna dolomitizacija. Mlajša faza hidrotermalnega zakrasevanja pa ni bila povezana z zapolnjevanjem žil, ampak z globokim kroženjem kraške vode, najbrž v zvezi z “neovulkansko” dejavnostjo v Češkem masivu. To potrjujeta pelod in razpadli vulkanski pepel v kapnikih, ki so nastali po vodilni speleogenetski fazi. Jame v Koněpruskih devonskih kamninah so domnevno nastale v ujetem vodonosniku v freatičnih in batifreatičnih okoliščinah. Termalne okoliščine so se pojavile, ko se je zaradi močne “neovulkanske” dejavnosti povečala paleogeotermična stopnja. Hidrotermalno zakrasevanje je deloma spremenilo obliko jam. Na podlagi velikih kalcitnih kristalov, ki so se odložili v freatićnih in globokih freatičnih okoliščinah, je mogoče sklepati, da je bila največja temperatura 60-700 C. Piezometrični nivo je bil nad apnenci v silikaklastih zgornjekredne platforme, na kar navajajo številne skoraj navpične freatične cevi (“depresije”), zapolnjene s krednimi in terciarnimi sedimenti, ki so zdrsnili vanje, ko se je pritisk vode zmanjšal. Pokovki podobne silificirane “Koněpruske rozete” so lahko nastale zaradi znižanja gladine termalne vode in mešanja s prenikajočo padavinsko vodo. Zunanji del velikih kalcitnih kristalov, ki se je izločal pri temperaturah okoli 400 C, bi lahko kazal na postopno ohlajanje celotnega sklopa.The origin of hydrothermal karst cavities was connected with the Variscan hydrothermal process. The cavities were formed and filled by crystalline calcite. The process was accompanied by the intensive dolomitisation. Younger phase of hydrothermal karstification was not connected with vein-filling, but with the deep circulation of groundwater, probably associated with neovolcanic activity in the Bohemian Massif. This is supported by pollen grains and decomposed volcanic ash in speleothems which were formed after the major phases of speleogenesis. It is supposed that caves in the Koněprusy Devonian were formed in confined aquifer under phreatic and batyphreatic conditions. Thermal conditions appeared when paleogeothermic gradient was increased due to intensive neovolcanic activity. Hydrothermal karstification partly changed the morphology of caves. The maximum temperatures were stated to 60-70°C from large calcite crystals precipitated under phreatic and deeply phreatic conditions. The piezometric level was situated above limestones in Upper Cretaceous platform siliciclastics as indicated by numerous subvertical phreatic tubes („depressions“) filled with sunkened Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments after the water buyoancy support decreased. Popcorn-like silicified Koněprusy Rosettes can be result of decrease of thermal water level and mixing with infiltrating meteoric waters. Outer zones of large calcite crystals with precipitation temperatures of about 40° C can indicate the gradual cooling of the whole system.",

    "abstract": "Zaradi velike topnosti NaCl se v solnem krasu lahko za stalno odlagajo v podzemlju velike količine sedimentov. Tam so posebne kraške oblike, kakršnih ni v karbonatnem krasu: veliki podzemeljski vršaji, notranje jame. Nasprotno pa se v karbonatnem krasu le majhen del sedimentov, ki jih prenaša alohtoni tok, za stalno odloži v jami, saj bi bila sicer jama kmalu zamašena (zaradi zelo slabe topnosti CaCO3 ). Na ozemlju Češke republike so bila z različnih vidikov preučevana tri kraška ozemlja z zelo dolgim razvojem in bistvenimi razlikami med površinskimi in podzemeljskimi oblikami. Avtorja menita, da je le ena bistvena razlika med Moravskim krasom in kraškimi ozemlji z razpršenim napajanjem (Češki in Chýnovski kras): v gostoti in smeri razpok, po katerih prenika kraška voda. Vse ostale razlike v površinskih in podzemeljskih kraških oblikah so nastale zaradi prvotnih razlik in njihovega vpliva na razvoj jam, posebej na prenos sedimentov in na stopnjaste oblike. Na ozemlju, kjer so le batifreatične in globokofreatične jame, se nikoli ne razvijejo slepe doline in druge navadne površinske kraške oblike zaradi zelo počasnega toka v kraških prevodnikih, kar onemogoča prenašanje sedimentov.In salt karst, very large amounts of sediment load could be permanently trapped underground, due to the high solubility of NaCl. Specific karst forms which have no equivalents in carbonate karst, occur there (huge underground alluvial fans, inlet caves). In a carbonate karst, on the other hand, only small portion of sediment carried by an allochthonous stream could be deposited permanently in the cave, otherwise the cave will become clogged (because of the very low solubility of CaCO3). Three carbonate karst areas with long-lasting development and fundamental differences in endokarst and exokarst forms were studied from many different aspects in the Czech Republic. The authors believe that there is only one primary difference between the Moravian Karst and diffuse recharge karst areas (Czech and Chùnov karsts): the frequency and orientation of fissures penetrable by groundwater. All other differences in exokarst and endokarst forms and hydrology are the results of primary difference and its influence on speleogenesis, especially on sediment transport and gradational features. In areas where only bathyphreatic and deep phreatic caves occur, blind valleys and common exokarst morphology never develop, due to the very low velocity of flow in karst conduits, which precludes transport of sediment load.",

    "abstract": "Mismanagement practices, such as unsustainable waste disposal, created many degraded sites. In karst landscapes, old uncontrolled landfills are often located in dolines (sinkholes). Buried waste material in dolines represents degradation of landform, habitats and a potential danger of groundwater pollution. Buried waste provides heterogeneous ecological conditions on the surface, thus plant communities or individual plant species that developed on the surface of landfills can be used as a bioindicators of waste-filled doline sites and therefore indicators of land degradation. We aimed to discover the potential of vegetation to detect unknown locations of old dump-sites in suffusion dolines in Logaško polje (Dinaric Karst, Slovenia), either by plant communities or by plant species. We aimed to ascertain whether vegetation can indicate the dumping period by estimation of community succession stage. Locations and the age of waste-filled dolines (doline-dumps) were preliminary identified by a historical landscape study. Thus, we used time series of aerial photographs and digital photogrammetry tools for 3D modelling of historical terrain. Ecological evaluation was based on sampling the floristic composition of plots (5x5 m). We analysed ecological conditions by Ellenberg bioindicator values, structure by life history traits and naturalness by hemerobic levels of plants. We studied in detail 30 up to 50-years-old waste-filled dolines that are interspersed by dry and mesic grasslands. Ecological evaluation demonstrated that the main driver of ecological diversity at doline-dumps is the time at which the doline was backfilled and succession started. Annual and eutrophic communities dominate the youngest doline-dumps, middle aged doline-dumps are covered by nitrophilous perennial forbs and, finally, communities developed towards mesic grassland. We conclude that plant communities in combination with diagnostic plant species can be used as a bioindicators of doline-dumps in agricultural landscape of Logaško polje and can therefore indicate the sites of potential groundwater pollution sources but not the type of long-time buried waste.Key words: suffusion dolines, plant communities, waste dumping, Ellenberg indicator values, polje.",

    "abstract": "The condensation-corrosion process occurs when airflow cools at the contact with colder cave walls. Condensed water becomes aggressive for soluble rocks and corrodes the walls. This process is particularly active close to cave entrances in high thermal gradient zones where external air enters caves. Condensation appears to be important where bat colonies are also present. Bat metabolism and guano decomposition release heat, vapour, and acids. Hence, bat colonies contribute to the increase of condensation- corrosion, especially by providing permanent moisture and chemical aggressiveness. Corrosive air convections produce rounded morphologies, such as ceiling channels, cupolas, and corroded older flowstones. This process has been overlooked in previous research, since related morphologies were often confused with those produced by early phreatic flow. Kyrenia Range in Cyprus has a semi-arid climate. All the studied caves developed along open-fractures. They are located both in recrystallized carbonates (limestone and dolostone, such as Smoky and Pigeons Caves), or in gypsum (First Day and Angry Bat Caves). We also studied a maze cave that acted as a spring in gypsum that initially developed under phreatic conditions, followed by an epiphreatic phase that allowed the development of notches (Fig Tree Cave, also named İncirli Show Cave). Due to the semi-arid climate, external air is very dry in summer, thus condensation seems to occur mainly in winter, when cave atmosphere instability allows large air exchanges between caves and surface atmosphere. In summer, evaporation prevails, allowing the development of popcorn lines in carbonate caves and massive gypsum crusts, stalagmites, and sidewalk rims in gypsum caves. However, the presence of a bat colony in a semi-confined chamber in Smoky Cave is probably the origin of the permanent moisture, also during the dry season, leading to a strong development of condensation-corrosion features such as ceiling cupolas, and possibly to the permanent activity of flowstones. In addition, we detected high concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and radon (Rn) in Fig Tree Cave, possibly related to the activity of the neighbouring overthrust. Based on the five studied caves in the Kyrenia Range and surroundings, the open-fracture caves in carbonates and gypsum have not undergone the typical initial phreatic stage, but have formed in a short time during Pleistocene as a result of the fast uplift of the range and were later reshaped by condensation-corrosion morphologies. Some gypsum caves may have formed entirely by this latter process, after initial minor fracture development. Cyprus is an outstanding area for studying the condensation-corrosion in caves, since a phreatic origin can be ruled out for most of the rounded morphologies. Prispevek kondenzacijske korozije pri razvoju jam v polsuhih območjih: predhodni rezultati v jamah Kirenijskega gorovja, CiperKondenzacijska korozija se pojavi ob stiku vlažnega zračnega toka s hladnimi jamskimi stenami. Pri tem na jamsko steno iz zraka kondenzira film vode, ki kemično korodira vodotopno kamnino. Proces je najbolj izrazit v bližini jamskih vhodov, kjer ob visokem temperaturnem gradientu zunanji zrak vstopa v jamo. Kondenzacijo in kondenzacijsko korozijo lahko pomembno povečajo kolonije netopirjev. Metabolizem netopirjev in razpadanje gvana sproščata toploto, vlago in kisline. Kondenzacijska korozija iz konvekcijskih tokov vlažnega zraka ustvarja zaobljene skalne oblike, kot so kupole, stropni kanali in korodirana siga. Kirenijsko gorovje na Cipru ima polsuho podnebje. Večina jam v tej raziskavi so odprte razpoke v prekristaljenem karbonatu (apnenec in dolomit) ali v sadri. Poleg teh obravnavamo tudi blodnjake v sadri, ki so se oblikovali v freatični coni in so v preteklosti delovali kot izviri. V njih najdemo stenske zajede, ki so nastale v epifreatični fazi. Ker je zrak poleti zelo suh, je kondenzacija omejena na zimski čas, ko se intenzivno izmenjuje zrak med jamsko in zunanjo atmosfero. Poleti prevladuje izhlapevanje, kar omogoča razvoj cvetačastih oblik v karbonatnih jamah ter sadrinih skorij, stalagmitov in stranskih obrob v jamah v sadri. Kolonija netopirjev v eni od polzaprtih dvoran v jami Smoky Cave verjetno vzdržuje visoko vlago tudi poleti. Posledica so močno izražene oblike kondenzacijske korozije (kupole) in stalna aktivna rast sige. V eni od jam smo izmerili visoko vsebnost SO2 in radona, ki je verjetno povezana z aktivno narivno tektoniko. Pet obravnavanih jam je tektonskega izvora in so verjetno nastale v kratkem obdobju hitrega dvigovanja v pleistocenu ter bile kasneje preoblikovane s kondenzacijsko korozijo. Nekatere jame v sadri so nastale skoraj izključno s kondenzacijsko korozijo, ki je preoblikovala prvotne majhne razpoke. Ciper je izjemno območje za podobne študije, saj lahko zaradi odsotnosti freatične faze večino zaobljenih jamskih oblik pripišemo kondenzacijski koroziji.Ključne besede: Vzhodno Sredozemlje, kondenzacijska korozija, gvano, Kirenijsko gorovje, jame v odprtih razpokah, hitri tektonski dvig, sadra, jamska mikroklima, pleistocen.",

    "abstract": "The tunnel water gushing has long been a difficult hydrogeological problem, especially in karst areas. It affects the entire process of tunnel construction, operation and maintenance. In view of the complex disaster-causing mechanism and difficult quantitative predictions of water inrush, several theoretical methods are adopted to realize dynamic assessment of water inrush in the progressive process of tunnel construction. According to a survey conducted in the Zoumaling tunnel near Chongqing, China, 62% of its total length, e.g., 1525 m is associated with karst（including a fault fracture zone). On the basis of collecting real-time monitoring data about water inrush in the excavated section of the Zoumaling tunnel, a fuzzy data analysis method has been used to analyze the content of seven common ions in the inflow water, which makes it possible to classify the groundwater types and to establish the hydrogeological model of the tunnel site. In order to forecast the possibility and quantity of water inrush, it is essential to accurately model the groundwater system spatially. The preliminary forecasting result about untapped section reveals a small possibility of a sudden water inflow disaster and 35,000 m3/d water inflow, which is close to the ultimately measured quantity of water. This study provides a theoretical reference for the prediction of water inrush during tunnel construction, and the main characteristic of this study is reflected in the real-time prediction of tunnel water inrush according to actual tunnel inflow of excavated sections. This approach can be applied in similar situations for the prediction of tunnel water inrush in other karst regions.Key words: karst region, tunnel water inrush; dynamic estimate; fuzzy cluster analysis.Pričakovana dinamika vdora vode v predore na podlagi meritev med njihovo gradnjoPojav vdiranja vode v predore je že dolgo časa poznana težava, še posebej na kraških območjih. Pojavlja se med celotno gradnjo predorov, njihovo uporabo in vzdrževanjem. Za proučevanje potencialnega pojava nesreč in težavnega napovedovanja količine vdora vode je bilo preizkušenih več različnih teoretičnih metod. Te omogočajo oceno dinamike vdora vode med celotnim procesom gradnje predorov. Pri predoru Zoumaling v bližini mesta Chongqing (Kitajska) približno 62 % dolžine predora (1525 m) poteka na območju krasa in čez prelomna območja. Na podlagi v realnem času zbranih podatkov o vdorih vode v izkopanih odsekih predora Zoumaling se je naredila analiza mehkih množic. Ta je bila uporabljena za analizo sedmih v vodi najbolj značilnih ionov in je omogočila razvrstitev podzemne vode v različne skupine, s tem pa izdelavo hidrogeološkega modela neposredne okolice predora. Za analizo verjetnosti vdora vode in njene možne količine je izdelava natančnega modela vodonosnika zelo pomembna. Prvi rezultati, ki se nanašajo na en še nedokončan odsek, kažejo na majhno možnost nenadnega vdora vode. Največja možna dnevna količina vdora je ocenjena na 35.000 m3, kar je blizu najvišje izmerjene dnevne količine dotoka. Pričujoča raziskava vzpostavlja teoretično podlago za napoved vdora vode v času gradnje predora, glavna posebnost pa je napoved vdora v realnem času na podlagi izmerjenega dotoka v že izkopanih odsekih predora. Predstavljen postopek in napovedi, ki jih omogoča, se lahko uporabijo v podobnih primerih tudi na drugih kraških območjih.Ključne besede: kraško območje, vdor vode v predore, pričakovana dinamika, analiza mehkih množic.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic impact on CO2 levels was studied in the low-volume chamber connected with the low-profile corridor in Balcarka Cave, the show cave in Moravian Karst, during the period of limited ventilation. Modeling showed that the natural CO2 levels were controlled by the CO2 fluxes (up to ~ 3.14 × 10-2 mol s-1) from adjacent spaces. These fluxes changed with cave airflows and ventilation modes. Two main components of anthropogenic impact were recognized: (1) visitor breathing and (2) visitor movement. The CO2 input derived from individual visitor groups varied from 1.96 × 10-4 to 2.45 × 10-3 mol s-1, which was the significant part of the CO2 fluxes from adjacent spaces. The visitor movement induced the airflows up to 0.2 m3 s-1. They exceeded the natural airflows (up to 3.2 × 10-3 m3 s-1) by factor of more than 60. These airflows caused cave ventilation mode's switching and, significant drop of CO2 fluxes/levels due to changed ventilation. The study therefore indicates that various anthropogenic influences in show cave can balance and neutralize each other, in dependence on cave morphology and seasonal conditions.",

    "abstract": "V Turčiji so razvite različne kraške oblike, škraplje, jame, vrtače, uvale in polja. Zakrasevanje je odvisno tudi od tektonskih premikanj. Dobro razvite kraške oblike, kot velika polja, podzemeljski tokovi in jamski sistemi, so na široko razviti v mezozojskih apnencih v gorovju Taurus. Z dvigom Taurusa konec mezozoika se je na splošno pričelo zakrasevanje. V nekaterih velikih poljih so bila v neogenu jezera, v katerih sta se odlagala apnenec in glina. Sladkovodna jezera, kot Beyºehir in Egirdir, so v tektonsko-kraških depresijah. Sistemi podzemeljskih rek so med jezersko regijo (zahodni Taurus) in sredozemsko obalo. Ti sistemi so se spustili v globlje dele apnenčevega masiva zaradi napredovanja zakrasevanja in dviga Taurusa (zgornji terciar, spodnji kvartar). Jame so nastale kot rezultat teh navpičnih tektonskih premikov, zaradi katerih se je znižala erozijska baza. In tako se je proces zakrasevanja prestavil iz višjih v globlje dele Taurusa.Turkey has several types of karstic land-forms containing lapies (karren), caves, dolines, uvalas and poljes. Karstification is related also to the tectonic movements. Well-developed karstic features such as wide poljes, ground water and cave system are widespread in/on the Mesozoic comprehensive limestone in the Taurus Mountains. Karstification begun to develop towards the end of the Mesozoic by the uplift movements of the Taurus Mountains in general. Some large poljes were occupied by the Neogene lakes in which lime and clay accumulated. The fresh water lakes such as Lake Beyºehir and Egirdir are found in the tectonic-karstic depressions. Underground river systems are found between the Lake Region (western Taurus) and Mediterranean coast. These river systems have been shifted towards the deeper parts of the limestone as the result of the progress of karstification and the vertical uplift of the Taurus Mountains (upper Tertiary, Early Quaternary). Caves formed as the result of vertical tectonic movements. These movements caused the lowering of the base level. So the karstification process have shifted from the upper level to deeper parts of the Taurus.",

Kljub ekološki krhkosti je to ena največjih turističnih privlačnosti, ki jo letno obišče preko 1.5 milijona turistov. Njegovo ohranjanje spodkopavajo nasprotujoče si gospodarske prednosti in degradacija površja ogroža sam obstoj narodnega parka. Ugotavljanje sedanjega rastlinskega pokrova v 35 km2 velikem osrednjem delu Kamnitega gozda in analiza sprememb tega pokrova od leta 1974 dalje v 7 km2 obsegajočem Malem Kamnitem gozdu kažejo na obseg sprememb v pokrajini. Goli kraški stebri obsegajo 52 % preučevanega ozemlja v obsegu 35 km2 in okoli polovica ga je poraslega. V izrabi površja prevladuje poljedelstvo, predvsem v dolinah, toda velik del šilina je ogolelega, okoli 6 % površine pa je pozidane. Na obmoèju 7 km2 Velikega Kamnitega gozda se je pozidana površina povečala z 0.5 ha leta 1974 na 38.68 ha leta 2001. V istem času se je dolžina cest povečala za 95 %, medtem ko so se vodne površine zmanjšale za 3 %. Med 1980 in 2001 se je letni obisk poveèal s 139 000 na 1 500 000 – desetkratni porast.

Ecologically fragile, it is also a major tourist attraction, currently receiving over 1.5million visitors each year. Conservation efforts have been undermined by conflicting economic priorities, and landscape degradation threatens the very foundation of the national park. Assessment of the current land cover in the 35km2 core of the Stone Forest and an analysis of land cover change since 1974 in the 7km2 Major Stone Forest reveal the extent of recent landscape change. Exposed pinnacle karst covers 52% of the 35km2 study area, and about half of this is vegetated. Land use is dominated by agriculture, particularly in the valleys, but much of the shilin is devegetated and about six percent of the area is now built-up. Within the 7km2 Major Stone Forest the built-up area increased from 0.15ha in 1974 to 38.68ha by 2001, and during that same period road length increased by 95%, accompanied by a 3% decrease in surface water area. Between 1980 and 2001, annual visitor numbers increased from 139,000 to 1,500,000 – a ten-fold increase. The need to reconcile economic development and landscape conservation involves both short-term versus long-term benefit and also the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "Our geological heritage is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activity. This is especially true of the Pál-völgyi Cave System beneath Budapest. It is among the 150 longest and at the same time most endangered cave systems in the world. The aims of the study were (i) to set up a monitoring system in the cave, (ii) to track the daily changes in the quality and quantity of drip water, and (iii) to determine the exposure of the cave. Monitoring was conducted at two locations in a shallow area next to a fracture zone (site name: TG) and one lying in a tectonically less disturbed, geologically more homogeneous location 20 m deeper (site YC). The data obtained in respect of 13 variables were assessed using descriptive statistics, principal component- and periodicity analyses. At first glance, it was apparent that the eight water quality parameters differed in quantity between the two sites. Furthermore, using principal component analysis it was shown that in the fractured-shallow setting, anthropogenic activity (external urban pollution, e.g. de-icing, decrease of land cover etc.) is the driving process determining water quality. At the tectonically less fractured site (YC) external influences originating above ground may be added to the natural karst-forming processes. The assessment of drip intensity and electric conductivity again highlighted the differences between the sites in terms of their reaction to precipitation. With regard to diurnal periodicity, although pH and Eh indicated a mature periodic behavior at both sites (covering 56−65 % of the total observed time), at site TG electric conductivity displayed diurnal periodicity over only 21 % of the total time, compared to 56 % at YC. All results pointed towards a conclusion that at site YC daily periodicity and water quality are much more connected to natural processes, while at site TG anthropogenic external influences suppress these.Key words: cave drip water, hydrochemistry, karst, Pál-völgyi Cave System, time series analysis, urban pollution. Analiza prenikle vode v urbani kraški jami pod madžarsko prestolnico (Budimpešta)Naša geološka dediščina je vse bolj ogrožena zaradi človekovih dejavnosti. To še posebej velja za jamski sistem Pál-völgyi pod Budimpešto. Sodi med 150 najdaljših in hkrati najbolj ogroženih jamskih sistemov na svetu. Cilji raziskave so bili (i) vzpostaviti sistem spremljanja izbranih parametrov v jami, (ii) spremljati dnevne spremembe kakovosti in količine prenikle vode, in (iii) določiti izpostavljenost jame onesnaženju. Raziskava je bila izvedena na dveh lokacijah v plitvem območju blizu razpoklinske cone (ime vzorčnega mesta: TG) in na tektonsko manj pretrti in geološko bolj homogeni lokaciji 20 m globlje (ime vzorčnega mesta: YC). Pridobljeni podatki 13 spremenljivk so bili obdelani s pomočjo opisne statistike, analize glavnih komponent in periodičostno analizo. Na prvi pogled je bilo očitno, da se je osem parametrov kakovosti vode kvantitativno razlikovalo med obema mestoma. Poleg tega se je s pomočjo analize glavnih komponent pokazalo, da je mesto v plitvem pretrtem območju pod velikim vplivom antropogenih aktivnosti (urbano onesnaženje, npr. sredstva proti zmrzovanju, zmanjšanje pokrovnih plasti, itd.), ki vplivajo na kakovost vode. Na tektonsko manj preoblikovanem mestu (YC) se zunanji vplivis površja mešajo z naravnimi kraškimi procesi. Ocena intenzivnosti kapljanja in električne prevodnosti je ponovno izpostavila razlike med vzorčnimi mesti v smislu njunega odziva na padavine. V zvezi z dnevno periodičnostjo je vzorčno mesto TG kazalo dnevno periodičnost več kot 21 % celotnega časa, mesto YC 56 %, čeprav sta pH in Eh izkazali zrelo periodično obnašanje (56−65 % celotnega opazovanega časa) na obeh mestih. Vsi rezultati kažejo na sklep, da je na mestu YC dnevna periodičnost in kakovost vode veliko bolj povezana z naravnimi procesi, medtem ko jih na mestu TG antropogeni zunanji vplivi zadušijo.Ključne besede: jamska prenikla voda, hidrokemija, kras, jamski sistem Pál-völgyi, analiza časovne vrste, urbano onesnaževanje.",

Kljub temu je v literaturi zaslediti zelo različne poglede, nekateri vidiki njihove geomorfogeneze pa so bili doslej prezrti. Predvsem gre za za nadalnji razvoj globeli v kraškem površju, potem ko so prepadne stene udornice že uničene, pobočja oblikuje samo še žepasto preperevanje, denudacija pa se je zajedla že globoko pod dno nekdanjega jamskega rova. Take globeli imenuje avtor fantomske udornice. V nadalnjem obravnava pet v Sloveniji najbolj običajnih tipov udornic in jih klasificira s pomočjo terminologije splošne teorije sistemov. Zaključuje, da sam udor stropa ostaja bistven del celotnega procesa, je pa volumsko lahko zelo podrejen. The paper concerns collapse dolines, which appear to be one of the best-defined surface karst phenomena. Despite this appearance, one may find quite different views in the literature, and some the aspects of their morphogenesis have been overlooked completely. Among these aspects the most obvious is the question of the ongoing development of the closed depression. After the perpendicular walls have disappeared, the slopes are reshaped only by pocket weathering, and denudation penetrates deep below the former level of the preexisting cave floor. Dolines at this stage of development have been termed phantom collapse dolines. Five of the most common collapse doline types found in Slovenia are considered in terms of general systems theory, leading to a conclusion that cave roof collapse remains the crucial event in a collapse doline’s development. However, the collapse event itself may be relatively subdued in terms of the volume of free fallen mass involved.",

These are cave-dwelling species, endemic to the Dinarides. The genus distribution range is examined, focusing on published localities. In particular, the presence of Mesostalita in the Julian Prealps (NE Italy) is investigated by researching previous reports from the area. A new record, Foran di Landri cave, is reported, representing the fourth known occurrence of the genus in the area. A brief description and some photographs of the female specimen found in the cave are provided. Following this finding, the genus distribution range must be extended northwards to include the Julian Prealps, on the other side of the Isonzo-Soča river (representing a biogeographical barrier for many cave-dwellers), opposite to the Dinarides. This makes Mesostalita one of the few troglobitic north-western Dinaric genera living on both sides of the river. Further sampling in caves in the area (to find at least a male individual) and molecular analyses are necessary to clarify the proper, specific status of specimens living in the Julian Prealps and their phylogenetic relationships within the genus.",

The outer parts of the blocks are often undercut into overhangs. On their upper parts, a protective crust forms through rock dissolution and rapid recrystallization under the influence of occasional rain and seeping water, shielding the rock from wind erosion and dissolution. This crust, in turn, is dotted by small pits, whose bare surfaces remain exposed to wind erosion, allowing them to expand and grow deeper. In the lower sections, where the rock is fully exposed, wind erosion primarily carves out larger cups and channels. A thin crust may occasionally form over these sections, but tends to flake off quickly. This process suggests rapid karstification and the ongoing disintegration of the stone blocks.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella spp. is a bacteria that can be transmitted between humans and bats through feces, food, and water contamination in the environment, causing foodborne illness. This bacterial infection will be more hazardous if the bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. Bats are wild animals that have the potential to spread resistant germs into the human environment because their habitats are where they live and forage is shrinking, forcing bats to migrate from their natural habitat to the human environment. Bats never receive antibiotics but can contaminated by bacteria was resistance antibiotics because they have close contact with humans, animals, and the environment. They are contaminated with resistant bacteria when they look for food and drink. Our research focuses on identifying the resistance that exists in Salmonella spp. bats in caves because it can endanger public health. The miss net is set at the cave’s mouth between 4 to 10 pm, the miss net is checked periodically. If a bat is caught, it is swabbed with a sterile cotton bud and then examined for Gram staining and biochemistry to identify bacteria. Salmonella spp. isolates were evaluated for antibiotic sensitivity with tetracycline, azithromycin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin. We successfully isolated nine Salmonella spp bacteria. The sensitivity test results showed that Salmonella spp. bacteria from cave bats in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, were resistant to the antibiotics azithromycin 77.7%, amoxicillin 22.2%, and tetracycline 11.1%.",

    "abstract": "Karst areas are highly susceptible to contamination due to rapid recharge and throughflow caused by their heterogeneous structure with unknown networks of conduits embedded in a matrix of low conductivity. Vulnerability methods have been used to ensure adequate protection of drinking water resources. However, most of the studies assessing the vulnerability of karst aquifers consider it as a constant value in time and, therefore, under special hydrological conditions in space, which is an oversimplification of reality. In this work, the behaviour of an Alpine karst system characterised by rapid flow and transfer through vertical shafts has been studied by discrete numerical modelling using MODFLOW 6. Six numerical models have been designed with the aim of representing simple common geometrical configurations found in Alpine karst systems. These models simulate how the flow and transport response at the system outlet is influenced by the aquifer geometry and recharge conditions. The results confirm that the arrival of the tracer at the spring strongly depends on the conduit geometry and the recharge conditions. This demonstrates that karst aquifer vulnerability cannot be defined as a constant value but should be specifically assessed depending on the spatio-temporal conditions.",

The cave, predominantly filled with allogenic sediments and speleothems, contains fossilized remains of the aquatic cave invertebrate Marifugia cavatica and terrestrial small mammals, characteristic of the early Pliocene (MN15–16). Paleontological dating estimates the cave sediments to be approximately 4 Ma old, while U/Th dating of the overlying flowstone indicates deposition at 410 ± 21 ka.

Cave levels, cave tiers, or cave stories are subhorizontal passages in karst systems that develop at different elevations due to base level changes or litho-structural factors. This algorithm processes point cloud data by calculating horizontal distances between survey points based on user-defined slope thresholds and proximity radius parameters. The horizontal extent is grouped into elevation classes to identify potential cave levels. We use Stortuvhola cave located in Northern Norway, a multi-level system, where we demonstrate the plugin's ability to effectively reveal cave levels from both survey station data and complete cave survey datasets. The sensitivity tests we performed highlight the importance of appropriate parameter selection based on survey characteristics. While Cave-PY offers an efficient method for the initial extraction of cave levels, it is important that the results are validated through morphological criteria and cave survey information for correct interpretation.

    "abstract": "A review of past researchon the hydrogeology of the Classical Karst (Kras) region and new information obtained from a two-year study using environmental tracers are presented in this paper. The main problems addressed are 1) the sources of water to the Kras aquifer resurgence zone—including the famous Ti­mavo springs—under changing flow regimes; 2) a quantifica­tion of the storage volumes of the karst massif corresponding to flow regimes defined by hydrographrecessions of the Timavo springs; and 3) changing dynamics between deep phreatic con­duit flow and shallow phreatic and epiphreatic storage within the aquifer resurgence zone as determined throughchanges in chemical and isotopic composition at springs and wells. Partic­ular focus was placed on addressing the long-standing question of the influence of the Soča River on the ground waters of the aquifer resurgence zone. The results indicate that the alluvial aquifer supplied by the sinking of the Soča River on the north­western edge of the massif contributes approximately 75% of the mean annual outflow to the smaller springs of the aquifer resur­gence zone, and as muchas 53% to the mean annual outflow of the Timavo springs. As a whole, the Soča River is estimated to contribute 56% of the average outflow of the Kras aquifer resurgence. The proportions of Soča River water increase under drier conditions, and decrease under wetter conditions. Time series analysis of oxygen stable isotope records indicate that the transit time of Soča River water to the Timavo springs, Sardos spring, and well B-4 is on the order of 1-2 months, depending on hydrological conditions. The total baseflow storage of the Ti­mavo springs is estimated to be 518 million m3, and represents 88.5% of the storage capacity estimated for all flow regimes of the springs. The ratio of baseflow storage volume to the average annual volume discharged at the Timavo springs is 0.54. The Reka River sinking in Slovenia supplies substantial allogenic recharge to the aquifer; however, its influence on the northwest resurgence zone is limited to the Timavo springs, and is only a significant component of the spring discharge under flood con­ditions for relatively brief periods (several days to weeks). Sus­tainability of the trans-boundary aquifer of the Kras will benefit from maintaining highwater quality in the Soča River, as well as focused water tracing experiments within the epiphreatic zone of the aquifer to better delineate the recharge zone and to identify sources of potential contamination to the Brestovica water supply well.",

This is essential for protection of the Huanglong World Natural Heritage travertine land­scape. It was found that the deposition of travertine was due to very strong CO2 degassing from the water, leading to de­crease in pCO2 and specific conductivity (SpC), and increase in pH and SIc downstream from the Spring. However, regular downstream hydrochemical evolution was interrupted by di­lution withsnow-melt water and by renewed CO2 from some downstream springs. The chemistry of Huanglong Spring itself was stable at a diurnal scale thoughit was altered by the great Wenchuan earthquake of May 12 2008. However, in spring-fed pools downstream, pCO2 and SpC were lower, and pH and SIc were higher in daytime than at night, whichindicates that the deposition of travertine was faster during the daylight hours. This was due to the combined effects of higher water tempera­tures and higher aquatic algae photosynthesis. In addition, it was found that the phosphate concentration in the stream in­creased remarkably downstream in the tourist midseason, in­dicating water pollution by tourism activities. The increase of phosphate (an inhibitor of calcite precipitation) may be one of the reasons for the decrease in travertine deposition rates and accelerated propagation of discoloration by diatoms during the past decades, whichneeds to be given more comprehensive study and tackled in future for the protection of these world famous travertine deposits.",

    "abstract": "The morphological knowledge of the territory, bothin its surface and subterranean aspects, is the main premise to all decision-making procedures as well as all planning and management activities. Knowledge takes shape into reliable precise and complete thematic cartography and databases, whichare necessary for anybody dealing withunderground contexts: speleologists, scientists, public administrations, managing authorities etc. Surveys in caves are normally carried out withtraditional techniques and instruments, whichare essential for a first representation but not enoughfor a pragmatic effective topographic approach. Laser scanning technique can be an alternative to the traditional systems. Laser scanning quickly acquires the shape of cavities as \"point clouds\" (x, y, z coordinates and colour values) and produces a highprecision database of the surveyed object. Laser scanning technology is therefore a feasible way to document caves in a precise exhaustive way, limiting risks relating to lack and/or inadequacy of data. The present paper explains the laser scanning survey carried out in San Giovanni mine near Iglesias (Sardinia, Italy), particularly in Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara 2 caves, the data post-processing and three-dimensional modelling of \"point clouds\" (operations performed witha dedicated software), and the use of the obtained digital model. Moreover, the paper describes the advantages of laser scanning for the hypogean survey in comparison to traditional methods and the future potentialities of a broad application of laser scanning instruments in caves.",

Scattered samples were taken from the entrance parts of the cave and from Črna Jama. Thin sections, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDS) were used. Microscopic investigation of thin sections of black coloured material from both locations revealed that the main material is carbonate – calcite, with evenly dispersed prevailingly minute opaque black grains. The XRD analysis on samples from both locations confirmed just a presence of calcite with minor quartz and dolomite, excluding Mn and Fe oxides or apatite-group minerals as reason for black colouring. The SEM/EDS analysis of samples from the entrance parts of Postojna cave system was consistent with XRD analysis, which did not show any Mn oxides. The high content of C measured in the black coatings from the cave entrance parts indicates organic C, which deposited on the cave walls at time of the petrol explosion during WW2. We can attribute black coatings from Črna Jama to one form of organic C as well, but it is certainly different from the one in the entrance parts of Postojna cave system. As in Črna Jama no other evidence indicates for old human inhabitation of the place: torches of first tourists are a more probable origin of charcoal. On both locations black coatings can be at least partly described by microclimate conditions at cave entrances, which caused the deposition of organic material of allogenic origin (for example soot due to the forest fires).",

In this alpine cave five sampling sites were monitored for fauna in percolation water in the period of one year. Temperature, conductivity, discharge, pH, total hardness and concentrations of various ions (calcium, chloride, nitrite, sulphate and phosphate) of water were measured. At the entrance of the cave ice is present all year round and the temperature inside the cave rises to a maximum of 4°C. These circumstances are reflected in the fauna found in percolating water. The first sampling site in the permanent ice was without fauna, as did the sampling site in an area with moonmilk. In the other three sampling sites, individuals of ten invertebrate taxa were found, Copepoda being the most abundant. Their abundance was positively correlated with discharge, pH and temperature of percolation water and additionally in the most abundant drip also with conductivity and total hardness. High proportion of immature copepods in drips shows that epikarst is their primary (i.e. source) habitat. Investigations of the alpine epikarst fauna can help to understand better the ecology of the epikarst fauna and its roles within the large range of different shallow subterranean habitats.",

    "abstract": "The Monte Conca karst system is located in Central-Western Sicily, where Messinian evaporites are widespread. Here, the evaporites lie on lower Messinian-middle Serravallian clayey-marly-sandy deposits and are overlain locally by Pliocene marly limestones. These successions are affected by E-W, and to a lesser degree N-S and NW-SE, high-angle faults that have also produced lateral contacts between the gypsum units and the clayey-marly deposits. The cave passages reachaltogether about 2.4 km in lengthand 130 m in depth, and the system consists of a sink cave, a resurgence and a relict resurgence. At large scale it is characterized by superimposed levels of sub-horizontal galleries connected by vertical shafts, whichare developed in adjustment to the contemporary geomorphological setting. Until 2003, the sink cave was known to have been formed by a stream-sink, an upper horizontal gallery, a sequence of four shafts and a lower gallery. New explorations have discovered 1.5 km of relict passages that are correlatable withthe inactive resurgence level and that occur at intermediate elevations between the two stories of galleries. Sinks of these relict branches are located headward of the actual sink point, but they have been sealed and covered by thick debris and alluvial deposits from the surface slopes. The resurgence consists of two superimposed galleries, the upper one inactive and the lower one active in equilibrium withthe current local base level. The relict resurgence is located about 40 m above the resurgence and is characterized by a sub-horizontal gallery partially filled by copious alluvial deposits. Analysis of the gallery patterns and of the cave landforms suggests that the karst system is a multi-layer system formed under unconfined conditions. Additionally, analysis suggests that its evolution is due to a succession of stillstand and lowering phases of the karst base level, according to a regional uplifting trend, and to surface slope processes, whichhave complicated the structure of the karst system.",

    "abstract": "Blowing Spring Cave in northwestern Arkansas is representative of cave systems in the karst of the Ozark Plateaus, and stable isotopes of water (δ18O and δ2H) and inorganic carbon (δ13C) were used to quantify soil-water, bedrock-matrix water, and precipitation contributions to cave-spring flow during storm events to understand controls on cave water quality. Water samples from recharge-zone soils and the cave were collected from March to May 2012 to implement a multicomponent hydrograph separation approach using δ18O and δ2H of water and dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13C–DIC). During baseflow, median δ2H and δ18O compositions were –41.6‰ and –6.2‰ for soil water and were –37.2‰ and –5.9‰ for cave water, respectively. Median DIC concentrations for soil and cave waters were 1.8 mg/L and 25.0 mg/L, respectively, and median δ13C–DIC compositions were –19.9‰ and –14.3‰, respectively. During a March storm event, 12.2 cm of precipitation fell over 82 h and discharge increased from 0.01 to 0.59 m3/s. The isotopic composition of precipitation varied throughout the storm event because of rainout, a change of 50‰ and 10‰ for δ2H and δ18O was observed, respectively. Although, at the spring, δ2H and δ18O only changed by approximately 3‰ and 1‰, respectively. The isotopic compositions of precipitation and pre-event (i.e., soil and bedrock matrix) water were isotopically similar and the two-component hydrograph separation was inaccurate, either overestimating (&gt;100%) or underestimating (&lt;0%) the precipitation contribution to the spring. During the storm event, spring DIC and δ13C–DIC decreased to a minimum of 8.6 mg/L and –16.2‰, respectively. If the contribution from precipitation was assumed to be zero, soil water was found to contribute between 23 to 72% of the total volume of discharge. Although the assumption of negligible contributions from precipitation is unrealistic, especially in karst systems where rapid flow through conduits occurs, the hydrograph separation using inorganic carbon highlights the importance of considering vadose-zone soil water when analyzing storm chemohydrographs.Keywords: carbon, stable isotopes, cave, hydrograph, Arkansas.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.667",

    "abstract": "There has been little study of the geology and geomorphologyof the caves and karst-like features developed in the Proterozoicgneiss and Cambrian granite of Sri Lanka. This lack of studyis surprising given that caves and rockshelters in these rockscontain significant archaeological and cultural sites. Caves andkarren, both mimicking those developed in carbonate rocks,have formed both in gneiss, which is the dominant rock type ofthe Proterozoic crust of the island and in granite. In addition tooverhangs, boulder caves, soil pipes and tectonic caves, tunnelcaves, arch caves and block breakdown caves of significant sizeare developed in siliceous rocks in Sri Lanka. While metamorphoseddolomites are interfoliated within the gneissic suite,simple removal of carbonate by solution from within the surroundingrock cannot account for all or most of the speleogenesisobserved. While spalling and breakdown are responsiblefor cave enlargement cave initiation is probably due to eitherphreatic solution of silicates and/or phantom rock processes.Speleothems and cave minerals including silicates, phosphates,gypsum, carbonates and niter are found in the caves. Activesilicate speleothems are not restricted to joints and fissures andsuggest that solution of silicates is currently occurring withinthe body of the rock in the vadose zone. While guano is thelikely source of the phosphate, sulfate and nitrate, the sourceof the calcium in the carbonates remains unclear. Caves in theintrusive and metamorphic rocks of Sri Lanka are enigmatic.They are unexpectedly similar in appearance to their carbonatekarst counterparts. Continuing research will allow them tohold a mirror to our understanding of speleogenesis, mineralizationand sedimentation in carbonate karst caves.",

    "abstract": "The first approach to the relationships between societies and physical environments on Velebit Mountain shows narrow correlations between spatial distribution of dolines, soil formation, hydric resources, vegetation and land occupation. In 2002, sediment cores have been obtained from different dolines of Velebit Mountain to evaluate the potential of their sedimentary archives in order to reconstruct the landscape history. On the littoral slopes and on the top parts of the mountain, the dolines were difficult to dig due to the presence of rocks in depth. Nevertheless, the cores have been sampled and soil analyses have been made (physical and chemical analyses: colour, grain size, pH, CaCO3, C, N, P, K, Mg, CEC). No dating materials were found. The first results attest to rather homogeneous pedologic processes in each area studied (Kamenica, Stinica, Baške Oštarije and Bilensko Mirevo), but they also indicate colluvial contributions. These contributions differ from one doline to another according to their location and morphology. Dolines reveal themselves to be not very good traps, as the representative nature of their sedimentary archives could be very local. However, the best profile has been obtained at Bilensko Mirevo, which shows a change in the soil nutrient content from an impoverishment in its middle part toward an increase of the soil nutrients in recent parts. Those environmental changes could not be precisely dated, but could be correlated with the 17th to 20th century phase of strong human impact on the Velebit environment and with the rural depopulation observed since the second half of the 20th century.Keywords: karst, dolines, Mediterranean soils, Velebit Mountain,Dinarides, Croatia.",

    "abstract": "Surface and underground karst features, such as karren, dolines, sinking streams, caves and large freshwater and thermal springs are developed in Triassic Limestone in the southern Kashmir Valley. The rock formation has a high hydraulic conductivity (K), up to 1,000 m d-1 and constitutes one of the most productive aquifers in the region. Springs discharging from this aquifer supply pristine water to more than one million people, but the regional karst system is still poorly understood. The present study is really a first and preliminary study of an important but remote and previously unstudied area, with the goal to provide a first overview and inventory of karst phenomena, as a basis for more detailed (and more \"scientific\") studies in the future. Results suggest that karstification is developed along tectonic joints and bedding planes. Karstification shows distinct variation with altitude and is more developed towards the valley floor. The study also revealed that erosion of the alluvium along streams pushed karstification downwards and caused drying up of formerly phreatic cave passages. Reconstruction of karst evolution on the basis of geomorphological, geological and climatic conditions of the region suggests that karstification has started during Plio-Pleistocene. The present surface and subsurface karstification is directly related to the tectono-sedimentational history of the Himalaya and the climatic conditions that prevailed after the Himalayan Orogeny.Key words: Triassic Limestone, karstification, freshwater supply, Himalaya, Kashmir Valley.Kraška geomorfologija, razvoj jam in hidrogeologija v Kašmirski dolini, Zahodna Himalaja, IndijaPovršinske in podzemne kraške oblike, kot so škraplje, vrtače, reke ponikalnice, jame ter veliki sladkovodni in termalni izviri, so v južni Kašmirski dolini nastale v triasnih apnencih.

In contrast, knowledge of microeukaryote diversity and their ecology in redox-stratified habitats is poor, as species-specific occupation of such geochemical gradients has not been well established. Here we assessed total microbial diversity from rRNA genes retrieved from two morphologically distinct microbial mats formed along an oxygen-sulphide gradient in the outflow channel from the Žveplenica sulphidic karst spring, Slovenia. Microbial mats contained diverse bacteria and archaea associated with chemolithoautotrophic and primary productivity, and overall microeukaryotic diversity was higher under oxygenated conditions. The oxygenated mats were comprised of undescribed and undifferentiated fungi, Annelida, Nematoda, Apicomplexa, and Gastrotricha, some being represented by novel lineages. Under anoxic conditions, diversity was dominated by Ciliophora, Nematoda, and Fungi-Ascomycota, also affiliated with novel lineages. Colonization of the distinct mat types related to ecological tolerance of specific geochemical conditions, and the associations between bacterial and archaeal diversity with distinct microeukaryotes may be related to grazing options and food web structure within the karst system.Key words: karst, spring, sulphide, geochemical gradient, diversity, microeukaryotes.Pestra mikrobna diverziteta vzdolž ekokline kisik-sulfid kraškega izvira odkriva potencial za okritje novih taksonovIzraziti geokemijski gradienti raztopljenega kisika in sulfida so osnova za habitate, kjer v odvisnosti od redoks potenciala, predvsem pa glede na metabolne in ekološke zahteve, specializirane bakterijske in arhejske taksonomske skupine zasedajo občutljive ekološke niše.

In the presented case study, we used a handheld laser scanner for acquiring points with projected coordinate information (X, Y, Z) covering the entire show cave of Koutouki; including its hidden passages and dark corners. The point cloud covers the floor, the walls, and the roof of the cave, as well as the stalactites, stalagmites and the connected columns that constitute the decoration of the cave. The absolute and exact placement of the point cloud within a geographic reference frame gives us the opportunity for three-dimensional measurements and detailed visualization of the subsurface structures. Using open - source software, we managed to make a quantification analysis of the terrain and generated morphological and geometric features of the speleothems. We identified 55 columns by using digital terrain analysis and processed them statistically in order to correlate them to the frame of the cave development. The parameters that derived are the contours, each column height, the speleothem geometry and volume, as well as the volume of the open space cavity. We argue that by the demonstrated methodology, it is possible to identify with high accuracy and detail: the geomorphological features of a cave, an estimate of the speleogenesis, and the ability to monitor the evolution of a karstic system.Key words: cave, laser scanner, 3D representation, speleothems, SLAM.",

Our study aimed to establish the locations within the cave entrances where these stalagmites are present and to provide a preliminary overview of the stalagmite forms. The environment, and especially availability and direction of light, was also studied at several sites. Surface scrapings were examined for the presence of cyanobacteria. The morphology of the unusual stalagmites is variable and includes forms that are elongated and crayback-like and others that show features not previously described in craybacks: flat tops, bulbous protuberances, phototropic rims, irregular grooves and ridges and oriented coralloid growth. Several of these features are not found in abiotic stalagmites and suggest biological control. The findings of light surveys confirm that certain features of the stalagmites are phototropically controlled. Filamentous cyanobacteria with calcified sheaths and coccoid cyanobacteria are present. We propose that this diverse group of stalagmite be named “tufaceous stalagmite” of which craybacks are thought to be a sub-group.",

    "abstract": "EN:The northwestern part of the Ljubljana Basin is filled mostly with fluvioglacial sediments deposited by rivers coming from Alpine mountain groups. The Tržiška Bistrica River, flowing from the Karavanke Mountains, has deposited a large alluvial fan consisting predominantly of carbonate pebbles with subordinate amounts of siliciclastic pebbles. The oldest infill, cemented into a conglomerate terrace named Udin Boršt, overlies an erosional surface on Oligocene mudstone. The thickness of the conglomerate terrace is up to 50 m. The conglomerate terrace is well karstified; the surface is dissected by numerous dolines and covered with a thick soil sequence. There are several caves. The most important are spring caves formed on the contact with the underlying impermeable basement. Samples of quartz pebbles were taken from the walls and ceiling in the 815 m long spring Arneševa Luknja Cave for cosmogenic nuclides burial age dating. The calculated burial age yielded an age of 1.86 ± 0.19 Ma that gives (i) the age of the oldest known infill in the Ljubljana Basin and (ii) indicates the time of change of the sedimentary system in the Basin from erosion to deposition. The age of the Udin Boršt karst and caves is significantly younger. The age dates provide grounds for a first relatively firm estimate of the long-term tectonic uplift of the Udin Boršt terrace to be between 0.06 and 0.04 mm/yr. This tectonic uplift rate may be related to the activity of the regional Sava Fault.SLO:Severozahodni del Ljubljanske kotline pokrivajo večinoma fluvioglacialni sedimenti, ki so jih odložile reke iz alpskih gorskih skupin. Tržiška Bistrica, ki priteka iz Karavank je odložila velik vršaj. V njem prevladujejo karbonatni prodniki z manjšim deležem siliciklastičnih prodnikov. Ta najstarejša zapolnitev, sprijeta v konglomeratno teraso Udin boršt, leži na erozijskem površju oblikovanem v oligocenskih glinovcih. Debelina konglomeratne terase je do 50 m. Konglomeratna terasa je dobro zakrasela, površje pa je razčlenjeno z vrtačami in pokrito z debelo plastjo prsti. V njej je več jam, med katerimi so najpomembnejše izvirne jame, ki so se oblikovale na stiku z neprepustno podlago. V 815 m dolgi Arneševi luknji smo vzeli iz sten in stropa jame vzorec iz kremenovih prodnikov za določitev pokopne starosti prodnega zasipa s kozmičnimi nuklidi. Izračunana starost prekritja sedimentov je 1.86 ± 0.19 Ma. Ta datacija določa (i) starost najstarejše sedimentne zapolnitve v Ljubljanski kotlini in (ii) čas spremembe v sedimentacijskem sistemu kotline iz erozije v sedimentacijo. Starost kraških oblik in jam v Udin borštu je znatno mlajša. Starost sedimenta daje tudi osnovo za relativno trdno določitev tektonskega dviga terase Udin boršta na 0,06 do 0,04 mm/yr. Ta tektonski dvig je verjetno povezan z premiki ob regionalnem savskem prelomu.",

    "abstract": "The Salinas-Los Hoyos karst system is a geological diapiric structure formed by materials of diverse nature (clays, sandstones, evaporites, volcanic rocks, dolostones, etc.) placed between Malaga and Granada provinces (S Spain). The abundance of evaporite rocks (gypsum, anhydrite and halite) and their high solubility contribute to the development of exokarstic features (dolines, uvalas, sinkholes). Grande and Chica lakes are dolines located in the western border of the diapir that are intersected by the piezometric level. Close to the first wetland is the Aguileras spring, which is the main discharge point of the west sector of the system. To assess the wetland-spring relation and the general functioning of the system, the geomorphologic framework has been analyzed and hydrogeological controls have been performed, consisting in limnimetric and discharge logging and in situ measurements of physico-chemical parameters (EC and water temperature). Furthermore, spring, wetland and rain water samples have been taken for subsequent chemical and isotopic analysis. Preliminary results show that wetland water level and spring discharge follow a similar trend, consistently with the inertia of the system. However, their hydrochemical evolution and isotopic values differ, thus wetland groundwater interaction has not been fully determined. Nevertheless, present research suggests that the hydrogeological connection would be more likely during wet periods, when the water table is at higher altitude.Key words: Evaporitic (karst) aquifer, Hydrological and hydrogeological behaviours, Natural responses, South Spain, Wetlands.",

Fine-grained siliciclastic sediments from the main gallery and upper cave level show nearly uniform composition and sedimentary textures. Palaeomagnetic analysis indicates normal magnetic polarisation of all samples, i.e. the age younger than Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at 780 ka. Flowstone/stalagmite covering siliciclastics in the upper cave level contains reverse polarised samples dated by U-series method to about 114–115 ka, which can be identified as the Blake Event. The uniform composition of sediments can indicate the infill of the cave during a single event caused by the blockage of drainage routes due to geological (collapse) or palaeoclimatic (ice) changes, which took part before ca 130 to 150 ka as indicating by the oldest U-series data from the whole Domica–Baradla Cave System.",

    "abstract": "Poseben hidrološki pojav zahodnega dela kraškega masiva Javornikov so presihajoča Pivška jezera. Za celotno območje je značilna tesna povezava podzemnih in površinskih voda. V kraškem vodonosniku se vode pretakajo večinoma podzemno, ob močnejših in dolgotrajnejših padavinah pa se nivo podzemne vode dvigne in voda se na številnih mestih preliva na površje. Tako postanejo aktivni občasni kraški izviri ob reki Pivki, z vodo pa se napolnijo tudi kraške depresije in nastane večje število presihajočih kraških jezer. Nekatera se pojavljajo dokaj pogosto in imajo vodo tudi do pol leta, večinoma pa so bolj redka ali so zalita samo izjemoma v času močnejših poplav. V članku so predstavljene hidrogeološke značilnosti območja, ki se odražajo v režimu pretakanja kraške vode in načinih njenega pojavljanja na površju. A special hydrological feature of the western part of the Javorniki karst massif is the intermittent karst lakes of Pivka. For the whole area a close connection between underground and surface water is characteristic. In the karst aquifer water flows mostly underground, but after more intensive or long-lasting precipitation the water table rises and water emerges on the surface at different locations. Intermittent karst springs along the Pivka river are activated. Also karst depressions are filled with water and several intermittent karst lakes can be formed. Some of them appear very often and contain water for up to six months, but mostly they are very rare and filled up only exceptionally in the time of big floods. In the article the hydrogeological characteristics of the area are presented, which are reflected in the flow regime of karst water and in the forms of its appearance on the surface.",

    "abstract": "Snežna jama je velika vodoravna fosilna epifreatična jama. Leži v grebenu Raduhe, V delu Kamniško Savinjskih Alp v SV Sloveniji. V bližini vhoda je v jami v okrog 3 m visok prerezu razgaljeno zaporedje plasti sig s številnimi prekinitvami rasti in izdatno terigeno komponento v spodnjem delu. V 2,4 m dolgem zveznem profilu smo vzeli zaporedne vzorce , ki smo jih proučili z termalno demagnetizacijsko metodo in metodo spreminjajočega magnetnega polja. Magnetostratigrafske analize so pokazale 7 normalnih in 6 reverznih magnetocon. Magnetne lastnosti se dobro ujemajo z litološko mejo v profilu sige. Spodnji del profila kaže večjo magnetno susceptibilnost in močnejšo remanentno magnetizacijo. Sprememba lastnosti v profilu nakazuje pomembno paleogeografsko spremembo v času nastajanja sige. Starost sige sega izven dosega datacijske metode alfa spektrometrične analize U razpadne vrste; ravnotežje U izotopov pa nakazuje starost večjo od 1,2 Ma. Najbolj verjetna starost sige, ki jo dobimo z korelacijo s primerjavo z geomagnetno časovno skalo je bodisi 3,0 do 5,0 ali 1.8 do 3.6 Ma. Starost jame lahko primerjamo z nekaterimi brezstropimi jamami na krasu v JZ Sloveniji, kjer sedimentacijo v jamah postavljamo v mesinsko obdobje. Snežna jama je bila dvignjena v sedanjo višino z mlajšimi (plio-pleistocenskimi) dvigovanji Alpskega loka.The Snežna jama Cave is located in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, NE Slovenia, in a Raduha Ridge. The cave is a huge, more or less horizontal fossil phreatic/epiphreatic conduit. It is penetrated by vertical shafts – invasion vadose (proglacial) caves. Close to the cave entrance, there is about 3 m high wall composed of speleothems - a complex sequence of flowstone with numerous breaks in deposition, six of them are principal. The lower part of the profile (about 85 cm) contains abundant terrigenous component (terra rossa-derived clay). Stalagmites developed in several periods are completely buried by nearly horizontal younger sequences of flowstone. Continuous speleothem log was recovered from the profile in a total length of about 2.4 m. The rock column was cut to cubes in the laboratory (2x2x2 cm) and studied both by thermal demagnetisation (23 samples, 12 steps - 20 to 620 ¡C) and alternating field method (98 samples, 14 steps - 1 to 100 mT). Magnetic properties identified the lithological boundary. In contrast to the upper part, the lower one shows both higher magnetic susceptibility and higher remanent magnetisation. The turn point can indicate important palaeogeographical change. Magnetostratigraphic log is composed of 7 normal and 6 reverse polarised magnetozones. The age of speleothems detected by the U-series alpha-counting spectrometry falls outside the method range, i.e. over 350 ka. Uranium isotopic equilibria indicate the age over 1.2 Ma. The age of the fill is pre-Quaternary, clearly older than 1.77 Ma. The most probable age from correlation with geomagnetic polarity timescales is about 3.0 to 5.0 or 1.8 to 3.6 Ma. Both possibilities can indicate the growth rate of speleothems of about 1.1 to 1.3 m per 1 Ma. The age of speleogenesis can be compared to some of unroofed caves in the area of the Classical Karst (SW Slovenia) connected with the Messinian period. Snežna jama was uplifted to high altitudes by younger (Plio-Pleistocene) uplift of the Alpine chain.",

    "abstract": "Karst aquifers are abundant, but vulnerable water resources. Therefore, a deeper understanding of possible mechanisms that determine the properties of karst springs is crucial. In this work, we present an example of Unica Spring and Malni Spring, the two main outlets of a large karst system in the Notranjska karst region, Slovenia. Although the two springs share same catchment area, the flow distribution between them shows an interesting behaviour: At low-flow conditions, Malni Spring is the main outlet, while Unica spring receives almost no water. During high water events, discharge of Malni Spring stays limited and Unica Spring becomes the main outlet. We relate these observations to the local geometry of the channels and breakdowns in the remote part of the Planinska Jama (Planina Cave), called Mysterious Lake. There, waters from Rakov Škocjan and Javorniki aquifer merge and further diverge to both springs. At low water conditions, the outflow towards the Unica Spring is restricted by the breakdown, so that most of the inflow is directed towards the Malni Spring. With increasing recharge, the level in Mysterious Lake rises until the water starts to flow over the breakdown along a system of large channels (Rak Branch of Planinska Jama) to the Unica Spring. The breakdown level keeps the hydraulic head and the flow towards Malni Spring limited. To verify this scenario, a hydraulic conduit model was made based on the known and predicted channels, and inflows calculated from the historical data of discharge measurements at related springs and ponors. An inversion procedure was used to obtain a satisfactory fit to the observed discharge data and to constrain the selected model parameters. The model accurately reproduced the observed discharge behaviour under low- andhigh-flow conditions.",

Leta 1928 so potekale podrobne mikroklimatske meritve sočasno v podzemlju in na površju. V letih 1960-1962 so člani ljubljanske univerze opravljali meteorološka opazovanja v jami in v udornici Velika dolina. 1992 so v okviru Inštituta pričeli z rednimi beleženji temperatur. Kasneje so v različne dele postavili 5 avtomatskih termometrov. Analizirani so rezultati dvoletnih opazovanj (maj 1997 - maj 1999) ter predstavljeni v tem prispevku. Čeprav so si letni povprečki precej podobni (10,6 ° in 10,1 °C), kažejo mesečni povprečki velika nihanja (od 1,6 ° do 17,3 °C), medtem ko so bile absolutne temperature v razponu od -1,5 ° do 21,9 °C. Najpomembnejša dejavnika za razporeditev temperature sta razdalja od vhoda in vertikalna lega. Primerjava temperature vode Reke in temperature zraka pri Mačji brvi kaže visoko stopnjo korelacije (R2 = 0,8994). Predhodna opazovanja v tem kratkem času kažejo, da je del Škocjanskih jam, kjer teče Reka, izrazito dinamična jama in da obiskovalci ne morejo preveč vplivati na tamkajšnja meteorološka dogajanja.In 1884 J. Marinitsch started to measure and note down the data of temperature in the Škocjanske jame caves and nearby. The results for the period 1886-1914 are recorded in the “Höhlenbuch”. During the year 1928 detailed microclimatic measurements are performed simultaneously on the surface and underground. In the years 1960-1962 the members of the Ljubljana University have carried on the meteorological observations in the cave and specially in the collapse doline Velika dolina. In 1992 Karst Research Institute started to monitor the temperatures. Later on 5 temperature recorders were placed into different parts of the cave. The results of the two years (May 1997 - May 1999) were analysed and are presented in this paper. Although the annual mean values are rather similar (10.6° and 10.1°C), there is a great amplitude between the monthly mean values (1.6° to 17.3°). The absolute temperatures range between -1.5° and 21.9°C. The most important factors are distance from the entrance, and the vertical position. The comparison between temperatures of the Reka river and the air temperatures bears an important correlation. Previous results of this short period already show that the part of Škocjanske jame, where the Reka river is flowing, is an extremely dynamic cave and the visitors cannot have much impact on it’s meteorology.",

Po eni strani bi morali ohraniti integriteto in kakovost naravnega okolja, po drugi pa omogočiti dostop čim širši javnosti. Čeprav je v tej trditvi morda nekaj dvoumnosti pa ni dvoma, da se osnovna elementa tega vprašanja dopolnjujeta in da enega ni mogoče v celoti rešiti, ne da bi upoštevali tudi drugega. To vodi do ključnega vprašanja, ali je upravljalec sposoben odgovorno izvajati svoja pooblastila. Prispevek podaja pregled in ocene različnih splošnih pristopov k upravljanju, ki so bili oziroma bi lahko bili uporabljeni. To vključuje različne sheme nadzora nad vplivom obiskovalcev, v glavnem iz ZDA; gre za trojni (okoljski/družbeni/ekonomski) trajnostni pristop in tveganja pri upravljalski strategiji. Sklep prispevka je, da mora upravljalec vsakega kraškega področja razviti sprotno se dopolnjujoč načrt upravljanja, ki mora vključevati tako dolgoročne in načelne rešitve, obenem pa se mora ukvarjati tudi s posebnimi izzivi, ki so tipični le v lokalnem okviru. Vsak pristop, o katerem je govora v tem prispevku, lahko pomaga pri pripravi kateregakoli načrta upravljanja.The key management responsibility in World Heritage Areas is a two-fold one of preserving environmental integrity and quality while at the same time providing for broad-scale public access. Although there is some mbiguity in this mandate, there is no question that these two elements of management are complementary, and that one cannot fully assess one without consideration of the other. This leads to the key question of how management is able to meet the responsibility of this mandate. This paper reviews and assesses various conceptual approaches that have been or might be utilised. These include various visitor impact control schemes generally of U.S. origin; the three faceted (environmental /social /economic) sustainability approach and risk management strategies. This paper concludes that each karst area management agency must develop an ongoing assessment plan that both deals with broad-scale issues while also meeting the distinctive challenges which are endemic to their own situation. Any of the approaches discussed may make a contribution to any one such plan.",

    "abstract": "Polotok Salento je kraško območje s precejšnjim tveganjem, povezanim s površinsko in podzemno vodo. Da bi preprečili poplavljanje, so velike količine površinskih voda kanalizirali v vrtače. Zaradi tega je v zadnjih letih na večih mestih prišlo do hitrega pogrezanja in udiranja tal. »lanek obravnava dve področji, kjer je do tega prišlo.The Salento peninsula is a karstic area affected by relevant geological risk mainly due to surface water and groundwater. In particular, sinkholes have been used to convey underground large amount of surface waters (rain water, waste water, etc.) aiming to avoid the flooding of wide land surfaces. However, during the last ten years this input of surface water underground has caused several cases of rapid subsidence. In this paper, the detailed study of two areas which have been recently affected by rapid subsidence is reported.",

    "abstract": "V Sloveniji je na krasu trenutno aktivnih devet odlagališč komunalnih odpadkov, med drugimi tudi Stara vas pri Postojni. Ker je za kraška območja značilna močna razpokanost kamninske osnove in zelo dobra prepustnosti, izcedne vode z odlagališč še posebej ogrožajo podzemno vodo. Sposobnost naravne filtracije je v krasu majhna,obseg možnega negativnega vpliva pa zelo velik. Sedaj veljavna zakonodaja predpisuje obratovalni monitoring, del katerega je tudi merjenje parametrov onesnaženosti podzemnih vod z nevarnimi snovmi, če so v vplivnem območju odlagališča. Temelj za izdelavo načrta monitoringa so ustrezne hidrogeološke raziskave. Za primer Stare vasi smo poleg osnovnih geoloških in hidrogeoloških podatkov uporabili še rezultate sledilnih poskusov, ožje območje odlagališča pa smo podrobno tektonsko-litološko kartirali v merilu 1:5000. Na osnovi ugotovljenih značilnosti pretakanja vode v podzemlju in v skladu s predpisi smo določili 3 točke monitoringa znotraj (izvira Malenščica in Vipava, jama Fužina) in eno izven vplivnega območja odlagališča (Matijeva jama) ter določili način spremljanja kakovosti vode in izdatnosti For the present 9 land fills on karst are still active in Slovenia, among them also the Stara vas land fill near Postojna. As strong fissuration of the rock base and very good permeability istypical for karst areas, the waste waters from the landfills particularly endanger the groundwater.The capacity of natural filtration in karst is very low and the dimension of possible negative impact is very high. The actual legislation regulates the performance of operational monitoring, a part of which is also the measurement of parameters of contamination of groundwater by hazardous substances, if they are in the area of influence of the landfill. Preparation of the monitoring plan is based on adequate hydrogeological researches. Besides basic geological and hydrogeological data also the results of tracer tests were used in the case study of the Stara vas landfill.Additionally, the detailed tectonic-lithological mapping in the scale 1:5000 was performed in the narrow area of the landfill.Based on defined characteristics of underground water flow and in accordance with the regulations 3 monitoring points inside (Malenščica and Vipava springs, Fužina cave) and one point outside the area of influence of the landfill (Matijeva jama cave) were selected. The monitoring plan for the observation of water quality and capacity was suggested.",

The animals lived attached to the scallops in the wall of the passage. The passage was later filled with clay deposits, followed by a layer of flowstone several metres thick. The roof of the passage has been removed by karst denudation and flowstone now reaches to the surface. Fragments of tubes of animals of various sizes have been preserved, attached to the rock wall; those tubes which grew at a right angle to the wall have broken off but have been preserved in the sediment. In terms of their dimension and shape the tubes remind one of the tubes of the more recent cave serpulid Marifugia cavatica Absolon and Hrabe. The positions of the preserved tubes and the dating of the nearby sediments by palaeomagnetic method indicate that the remains of the serpulids are from the Pliocene epoch or older.",

Kraus je ugotovil, da so take jame stopnja v razvoju od normalnih jam do vrtač in sotesk, iz katerih kasneje nastanejo normalne doline. Kot primer navaja Rakov Škocjan in še posebej jamo Lončarevec pri Postojni. V Alpah so pleistocenski ledeniki zniževali površje in odprle so se jame. Ponekod je danes veliko kratkih jam - ostankov nekdanjih sistemov.

Avtor podrobneje obravnava primere iz salzburških Apneniških Alp, področji Hennenkopf in Rotwandl v pogorju Steinernes Meer, Sondkar v pogorju Tennengebirge in Hochtor v Centralnih Alpah (Visoke Ture).The phenomenon of roofless caves was reported early by Boyd Dawkins (1874). Franz Kraus found that roof collapses are the first steps in the development from a normal subterranean cave to dolines and to a gorge and to normal valley. As an example he showed Rakov Škocjan and specially “Lončarevec Cave” near Postojna. Karst in alpine regions is often dominated by glacier erosion. The ice flow of Pleistocene glaciers carved the plateau surfaces. Thus cave systems opened. In some areas there are a lot of short caves as parts of a former cave system. They characterise the “cave-ruin-niveau” (Höhlenruinen-Niveau) on plateaus such as Steinernes Meer, Hagengebirge, Tennengebirge, in an altitude of 2000-2300m. Special reference is given to the Salzburg Calcareous Alps, including Hennenkopf and the Rotwandl region in the massif of Steinernes Meer, the region of Sandkar in the Tennengebirge and of Hochtor in the Central Alps (Hohe Tauern).",

    "abstract": "Some basic characteristics of the alpine karst waters in Slovenia are presented. By the method of hydrological balance it was estimated that their groundwater reserves can supply a spring with an average discharge 115 m3/s. According to the comparison between the extent of the alpine karst and the EIONET-SI data base on springs it was stated, that for approximately 1200 alpine karst springs the total capacity (not the average discharge, but the amount of water that can be captured at low waters) is around 15 m3/s. At present only some 25% of these reserves is exploited for the water supply of around 240.000 inhabitants. Due to high vulnerability and different human impacts the quality of these water resources is endangered. Therefore it is necessary to protect them with adequate measures planned on the basis of accurate hydrogeological data. Present level of protection is unsatisfactory, as the water protection decree was accepted only for one quarter of captured springs. Additionally, the expert basis for such decree was prepared for a little less than one fi fth of captured springs.Predstavljene so osnovne značilnosti alpskih kraških voda v Sloveniji. Z metodo vodne bilance sem ocenila, da njihove zaloge zadoščajo za napajanje izvira s povprečnim pretokom 115 m3 /s. Po primerjavi obsega alpskega krasa s podatki o izvirih iz baze EIONET-SI je bilo ugotovljeno, da je skupna izdatnost (ne povprečni pretok, ampak količina vode, ki jo je možno zajemati ob nizkem vodostaju) približno 1200 alpskih kraških izvirov okrog 15 m3 /s. Za vodooskrbo je trenutno izkoriščenih le okrog 25 % teh zalog, z njimi pa se oskrbuje okrog 240.000 prebivalcev. Zaradi velike ranljivosti kraških vodonosnikov in različnih človekovih vplivov je ogrožena kakovost teh vodnih virov. Nujna je zato njihova ustrezna zaščita, ki pa mora temeljiti na kakovostnih hidrogeoloških podatkih. Trenutna stopnja zaščite je nezadovoljiva, saj ima le približno četrtina zajetih izvirov sprejet odlok o varovanju, še za nekaj manj kot petino pa so že pripravljene ustrezne strokovne podlage.",

    "abstract": "National parks (NPs) are the flagships of protected areas, which primarily serve the protection of nature, but are also important sites for tourism. While karst areas are generally disadvantageous in terms of traditional farming, tourism can provide new livelihoods for those who live there. Therefore, it does matter how the local people relate to the NP and tourism, and the opinion of tourists is also an important factor. In this article, we present the results of a questionnaire survey conducted in the Aggtelek National Park (ANP) and the Slovak Karst National Park (SKNP). Our results show that for locals, the forest is the most important natural resource often visited by them, while for tourists, caves are the first choice. Conflicts between locals and tourists are negligible, and all actors agree to further increase tourism. In both ANP and SKNP, the majority of tourists and locals alike have a rather positive view of the NP. However, there is still a significant group of local residents who have a negative opinion about the NP. One reason for this may be that the locals feel they have only a marginal influence on NP decisions. The ANP plays a more important role in the lives of locals than in SKNP, because ANP has a larger organisational background and more human resources for a smaller population. Although geotourism is still largely missing from the vocabulary of local residents and park management alike, there is a small but significant part of visitors who consider themselves sensu lato geotourists. As for the motivation of tourists, the keyword is “cave”, while the content of the term “karst” is much less known for visitors (especially on the Hungarian side). In Hungary, the tourism to Baradla Cave is largely due to school education. We found that the internet, although one of the most important sources of information for visitors, was not the first port of call, and was not outstanding compared to other factors.",

    "abstract": "Poljes are flat closed karst depressions prone to regular flooding. The floods can be several meters high, last for months and damage significantly human infrastructures. To predict the maximum level reached, the polje water balance needs to be implemented. This technique encounters the difficulty that important part of the inflow and outflow flowing through many poljes is ungauged, as it is challenging to measure accurately the numerous springs and ponors activating temporarily with the rise of water level. This work aims to see whether this problem can be handled and the polje water balance reconstituted. To do so, a typical Dinaric polje is equipped with several water level stations installed over its surface and in the nearby water active caves. Combining a 1*1m digital elevation model of the polje surface with water levels and inflow records of the main two springs allowed assessing the variation of flooded volume and reconstructing the water balance. The highest total inflow values reached during the observed period were of about 140-150 m3/s, with up to a third of it being ungauged. In addition, the effect of a large estavelles group on the polje inflow and outflow could be identified, and helped to characterize the outflow, with values comprised between 65 and 75 m3/s. Finally, intense rainfall over the polje flooded surface showed to be a temporary important source of inflow. The values found by the water balance analysis have been used as input and calibration data in a numerical model reproducing the flood dynamics in the polje and its surrounding aquifer. Results validated both polje water balance and conceptual hydrogeological model. They justify the significance of combining water level measurements with a digital elevation model to monitor the floods. The method can be applied to other poljes flooding in a complex way of superposed input and output signals. Finally, the places to be equipped in priority if the polje has no measurement network or if available funding is limited are discussed.",

Episodes of strong impact occurred only in some particular areas and in specific economical and political situations. After the Second World War dramatic changes in the resources management have taken place, induced by the urban and industrial development. The traditional system of self-sustained economy has completely collapsed and has been replaced by an open economy more dependent on that of the large urban sprawl of the plain. Such development is clearly incompatible with the local environmental dynamics and it is difficult to be modified, because it triggers self-sustaining processes. The problem to individuate new more compatible directions for the development is, for a large part, a cultural problem and it may not be solved without a cultural revolution. Local people must be helped to understand the karst geo-ecosystem, the natural realm, the landscape, the local history, and the cultural heritage. Starting from such knowledge, local people have to develop a strong sense of belonging to their own geographical units and to become and to feel protagonists, responsible of their own development, capable to lead it.",

In well permeable fissure on the karren surface near the landfill the fluorescent dye uranine was injected in order to study the directions and velocities of its flow through the karst aquifer. Monitoring of tracer concentrations in the period of one year and a half enabled us to make some conclusions about the dynamics of groundwater flow in the directions towards the Timava, Brojnica and Sardoč springs. Detailed observations were organised also at the Klariči pumping station, which is the main source of drinking water for the Kras region. Increased concentrations of tracer were measured only during extremely high waters. Different explanations are possible, but we can not exclude the possibility of a weak, not permanent underground water connection with the landfill. Calculation of the amount of recovered tracer confirmed the main flow direction towards the Timava springs (recovery rate 93%) and a secondary direction with lower flow velocity towards the Brojnica and Sardoč springs. Outflow through the Klariči pumping is estimated to only 0.003% of injected uranine.Key words: tracer test, landfill, Sežana, Kras, Slovenia.",

Several of the species that are more strongly modified for subterranean existence occur only in the more southern, unglaciated areas.

    "abstract": "Turloughs are seasonally flooded karst wetlands in Ireland and as priority habitats under the EU Habitats Directive, many have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation. They flood usually in winter, mostly through swallow holes, or estavelles, that open to the underlying limestone, but they may fill at any time of year if rainfall is excessive. Almost all of them occur on well-bedded pure Carboniferous limestone. Since the shallow basins of turloughs are usually covered in vegetation, unlike more permanent water bodies, they are excellent feeding areas for over-wintering wildfowl, such as ducks, geese and swans, hosting numbers of international importance. Turloughs are almost all grazed by domestic livestock in the summer months and they support relatively low-intensity farming due to their marginal nature and inaccessibility for much of the year. The vegetation depends to a large extent on the flooding regime and on soil type, usually comprising small-sedge communities or grass-dominated swards. The type of management varies considerably, not only between, but within turloughs. This gives rise to a diversity of sward composition and structure that increases both plant and invertebrate diversity. Whereas drainage was a large threat to turlough conservation in the past, eutrophication of flood waters is gaining in importance. However, the single greatest threat to turlough biodiversity in the future may be the cessation of farming within their basins. Turloughs are an integral part of the Irish cultural landscape and so it is important to develop a strategy for turlough conservation that involves the land-owners and takes into account local socio-economic factors as well as the conservation of their biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The basic process active in the formation of subaerial features on karst rocks is chemical dissolution of limestone or gypsum by water films flowing on the rock surface. The dissolution rates of limestone and gypsum into thin films of water in laminar flow are given by F = α(ceq-c), where (ceq-c) is the difference of the actual concentration c in the water film and the equilibrium concentration ceq with respect to the corresponding mineral. Whereas for gypsum α is determined by molecular diffusion the situation is more complex for limestone. Experiments are presented, which show that for high undersaturation, c&lt;0.3ceq, the rate law is F = α( 0.3ceq-c) ,and α becomes higher by about a factor of ten than for the rates at c&gt;0.3ceq. These rate laws are used to calculate denudation rates on bare rock surfaces exposed to rainfall with differing intensity. The estimations are in reasonable agreement to field data. Starting from the experiments on the formation of Rillenkarren on gypsum performed by Glew and Ford (1980), we suggest a new relation between their length from the crest to the “Ausgleichsfläche” and the inclination of the rock surface. This is also applied to field data of Rillenkarren on limestone provided by J. Lundberg and A. Gines. In view of the many parameters influencing the formation of Rillenkarren these correlations can be considered as satisfactory.",

Land cover is an important indicator, which enables the analysis of their condition and development monitoring. Advanced satellite images classification represents an accurate and cost-effective alternative to the classical techniques of land cover mapping. The methods used to produce a reliable land cover map are presented in this paper. The complexity of the area requires a combination of various data such as Landsat satellite images, digital elevation model, digital orthophotos as well as existing topographic and thematic maps. The maximum likelihood algorithm was used as the main classifier and the accuracy of results was further improved by fuzzy classification, altitude and inclination filtering and auxiliary data integration.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of troglobites comprises three distinct problems: cave colonization by an epigean ancestor, the evolution of troglomorphies, and intra-cave speciation. The study of cave-dwelling planthoppers has contributed much to our understanding of troglobite evolution and provides useful model systems to test various aspects of the theoretic framework developed in recent years. Most promising in this respect are taxa with several closely related but independently evolved troglobiontic lineages, such as on the Canary Islands, in Queensland/Australia and on the Hawaiian Archipelago. Closely related species often occur in caves with comparable ecological parameters yet differ in their age. Here we use comparative age estimates for Australian and Hawaiian cave cixiids to assess the dynamics of reductive evolutionary trends (evolution of troglomorphy) in these taxa and cave planthoppers in general. We show that the degree of troglomorphy is not correlated with the age of cave lineages. Morphological alteration may not be used to draw conclusions about the phylogenetic age of cave organisms, and hypotheses based on such assumptions should be tested in light of these findings.",

The most extensive contact of this type is in western Slovenia, in the area of Matarsko podolje, where a variety of typical contact karst depression features can be found. In the northwestern part of Matarsko podolje two types of alluvial fans occur. One alluvial fan has an active process of alluvial sedimentation on its surface and is distinct in shape, just like alluvial fans in fluvial geomorphic systems. The other type represents relict alluvial fans on contact karst. They are fan-shaped surface features in carbonate bedrock. Their formation is a result of the gradual removal of alluvial cover and the chemical denudation of carbonate bedrock on areas that were covered by alluvial fans. Geomorphological features and processes on alluvial fans, and the influences of alluvial fans on the development of contact karst have been investigated in detail.",

Due to size, shape, cavern's position and hydrogeological parameters within the karst system it was necessary to design and construct a 58 m bridge over the cavern. In addition, the cavern's vault had to be reinforced and stabilized, as the overburden was very thin. The beam-and –stringer grid with special anchors was used. The cavern's rehabilitation in the \"Vrata\" tunnel was a unique undertaking, and the bridge (without piers) is the cavern's longest bridge in the world.",

Groundwater flow in conduits is simu­lated througha pipe flow model and flow in fissured matrix rock is described by Darcy's law. Water mass exchange between the two domains is modeled by a first-order exchange rate method. In this study, we investigate mathematical well-posed­ness (mathematical term, whichmeans solution existence and uniqueness) of the CCPF model, develop a finite elementary method to numerically approximate the mathematical model and study the convergence of the numerical method. The study results prove the modeling approachis mathematically well posed and numerically converged. To study the accuracy of the CCPF model, a recently developed Stokes-Darcy (SD) model and CCPF model are compared withlaboratory experimental results. It was found that the SD model simulations matchwell withexperimental results, but the CCPF model overestimates the hydraulic head in the matrix, especially around the matrix and conduit interface. The model underestimates solute trans­port in the conduit and does not capture the plume distribution in the matrix. In comparison withthe SD model, the CCPF model requires an additional parameter, the first-order mass exchange rate, and the parameter is normally obtained throughinverse method curve fitting. The SD method may provide an approachto directly estimate the parameter value.",

Cave passages on the eastern side of the syncline contain mostly sand and silt. The light fraction of the sediments consists predominantly of quartz and rock fragments. The sediments contain several percent heavy minerals composed of iron oxides, zircon, rutile, tourmaline and other minerals. Measurement of the visible and near infrared diffuse reflectance spectra shows at least three populations of sediments to be present: an iron-rich, clay-poor group; a clay-rich group; and a gypsiferous sediment. The iron minerals provided a paleomagnetic signal. Sediments from the trunk passage, deposited by recent underground drainage, contained a normal pole direction. Sediments from the dip passages were paleomagnetically reversed, showing the deposition dates from prior to 780,000 years. In one instance reversed polarity deposits overlie normal polarity, implying a minimum age of 990,000 years for the reversed sediments.",

    "abstract": "Cansiglio is a limestone plateau located on the border between the regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, northeastern Italy. The eastern area is characterized by a thick succession of Cretaceous peritidal carbonates, while the central western part is characterized by slope breccia deposits. Even thoughPian Cansiglio is an important karst system, its hydrogeology is poorly known. Three important springs that form the Livenza River are located at its southeastern border and are thought to represent the majority of karst aquifer discharge, but no experimental data are available in the literature. Gruppo Speleologico Ferrarese explored an 800 m deep cave (Abisso Col de la Rizza) on Pian Cansiglio, whichprovided the opportunity to conduct tracer tests. Fluorescent dyes were injected in September 2008 in Abisso Col de la Rizza (uranine) and in Bus della Genziana (tinopal CBS-X). Over a period of three months, local cavers conducted an intense sampling programme, whichincluded collecting water samples, charcoal bags and cotton lints. Automated samplers were used for highfrequency monitoring at two of the springs. Tinopal was not detected, so the connection between Bus della Genziana and the springs was not demonstrated. The connection between Abisso Col de la Rizza and two of the springs was demonstrated by uranine. A mean velocity of 248 m/day results from the tracer concentration peaks; intense rainfall events increased the flow velocities four to five times. Different hypotheses are considered in order to explain the low mass recovery rate (32-40% of the injected mass). The uranine tracer test demonstrated that Pian Cansiglio aquifer contributes to the two Livenza springs; it also opens a question about the third spring, whichprobably originates from the Mount Cavallo area (another limestone massif close to Pian Cansiglio). The rapid response to rainfall recharge suggests a vulnerability of the spring system, further supporting the importance of conducting a detailed hydrogeological study.",

The researchemployed a combination of five main investigative techniques, in conjunction: geomor­phological mapping, spring chemistry and discharge analyses, dye-tracing, microgravity geophysical investigations and bed­rock core drilling. The results enabled the production of a de­tailed conceptual model for the area. Surface and subsurface karst landform mapping revealed a highlevel of karstification. Clustering and alignment of recharge landforms is found to be a significant aspect of the karst. Analyses of spring chemistry and discharge data revealed characteristics of the aquifer sys­tems in operation. It was found that a significant percentage of flow is via enlarged conduits but that the smaller fractures are important for providing base flow. Water tracing experi­ments proved that water moved from highly karstified, el­evated recharge zones to springs at the periphery. Microgravity geophysical investigations, detected and located solutionally enlarged voids in the bedrock and demonstrated the impor­tance of the shallow epikarst system as well as a deeper con­duit network. Bedrock core drilling detailed the nature of the bedrock underneathkarst landforms and showed the successes and failings of the geophysical investigations. Spring catchment boundaries were then delineated using water balance equations and a combination of the information retrieved from the other methods. Using these results in combination large amounts of information were gathered leading to the production of the first conceptual model for the karst of Roscommon, whichcan be adapted and applied to IrishLowlands in general. The use of multiple, complimentary, investigative techniques in conjunc­tion greatly enhanced the accuracy and success of this project. The aim of this paper, therefore is to highlight the benefits of using many analytical techniques together.",

    "abstract": "Epiphreatic caves develop close to the water table at the boundary between vadose and phreatic karst zones. The recognition of their former existence and position in uplifted limestone regions can inform on phases of uplift, base level lowering and rate of vertical deepening of the karst. Hence, epiphreatic caves and the karst processes that form them are of specific interest. Although the large and spectacular caves of Niah have been subject of much research and interest, the existence of small epiphreatic caves at the foot of the karst towers has not previously been documented in this region of NW Borneo. The study documents and reports an epiphreatic cave passage at water table elevation in the Painted Cave karst tower where several large caves are also known. The semi-flooded passage is over 480 m long and traverses the tower from east to west, intersecting other much larger vadose caves. The epiphreatic flow path is characterized by a number of sinking streams and resurgences as well as several sharp bends in the passage indicating joint control. As an initial attempt this study was undertaken to correlate the water chemistry along the cave path to understand the geomorphological controls. A preliminary campaign of water sampling was carried out with samples collected at ten locations along the path of the cave stream and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, DO, Eh, major ions, nutrients and trace metals. The results show that dissolution of host rock and leaching of organic matter are the dominant controlling factors for the geochemistry of surface water along the cave stream passage. During dry conditions the water was under-saturated for carbonate minerals but not aggressive suggesting that most dissolution and erosion occurs during flood conditions. This is supported by the morphology of the passages and features of the rock wall both inside the caves and at the foot of the karst tower.

Prepoznavanje epifreatičnih elementov v bloku dvignjenega masiva nam omogoča razbrati faze dvigovanja masiva oz. spuščanja erozijske baze, zato so epifreatične jame in procesi še posebno zanimivi. Čeprav so o jamah stolpa Niah opravili številne študije, nobena od teh ne obravnava epifreatičnih jam ob vznožju kraškega stolpa. Ta študija obravnava epifreatične rove na ravni vodne gladine v stolpu Painted Cave v severozahodnem Borneu, kjer sicer poznamo več velikih jam. Delno potopljen rov je dolg več kot 480 m in preči stolp od vzhoda proti zahodu ter pri tem seka še več drugih, veliko večjih vadoznih jam. Epifreatični tok je povezan z več ponikalnicami in izviri, zanj so značilne nagle spremembe smeri, ki sledi vodilnim razpokam. Namen študije je povezati kemijo vode vzdolž toka in aktivne geomorfološke dejavnike. Vzorčenje in analize vode na desetih lokacijah so dali podatke o pH, električni prevodnosti, skupni raztopljeni snovi (TDS), raztopljenem kisiku, Eh ter o koncentraciji glavnih ionov, hranil in kovin v sledeh. Rezultati so pokazali, da sta raztapljanje matične kamnine in izpiranje organskih snovi prevladujoča dejavnika geokemije vode v kanalu. V sušnem obdobju je voda rahlo nenasičena na kalcit, a je agresivnost majhna, kar kaže na to, da glavna faza razvoja poteka v poplavnih obdobjih. To potrjujejo tudi morfologija rova in jamske skalne oblike v jami in ob vznožju kraškega stolpa.Ključne besede: kras, jama Niah, epifreatična cona, hidrogeokemija, vodna površina.",

    "abstract": "Distinctive karst hydrology arises from a combination of high carbonate rock solubility and well developed secondary porosity (fissures). Soil CO2 is the most important influence on solubility of carbonate rock (Ford &amp; Williams 2007). Human activity on the karst surface results in pollution that has an important influence on water quality. Degradation of organic pollution (e.g. waste water, leachates from landfill sites) results in inorganic acids too. These acids could have an important additional influence on dissolution of carbonate rocks in the vadose zone. In the framework of more than 20 years of research on precipitation percolation and transfer of contaminants (direct outflow of waste water from a small military facility where about twenty troops were stationed) through the 100-m thick vadose zone of Postojna Cave, contaminated water was observed in drips and trickles in the cave (up to 60 mg Cl-/l, up to 180 mg NO3-/l, up to 2.8 mg PO43-/l, and up to 50 mg SO42-/l). At the same time the sum of calcium and magnesium (Ca+Mg) of trickles was up to two times larger than the Ca+Mg of either the uncontaminated reference trickle or the input waste water. The amount of dissolved limestone carried by waste water to trickles and drips in the cave was directly proportional to the concentration of contaminant anions present. This demonstrates that there is an accelerated widening of fissures below source points of wastewater. Water with contaminants can penetrate faster and deeper into the vadose zone along the increasingly permeable fissures without losing its dissolving power, and thus significant dissolution occurs ever deeper in the vadose zone. This results in ever faster penetration of contaminants through the vadose zone. In the final phase of such development, which takes many decades or longer, relatively rapid transfer of contaminants through the aquifer all the way to karst springs with minimal self-cleansing effects can be expected.",

In situ investigation of two monuments by means of monument mapping has identified several types of deterioration phenomena, such as granular disintegration, flaking, crumbling, efflorescences, crusts, and the presence of microorganisms. Samples were characterized using Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), X-Ray Powder Diffraction Analysis (XRD), porosity accessible to water under vacuum, capillary absorption, Mercury porosimetry (MIP), and Ar-sorption. Although very low values of porosity of the fresh stone as well as slow capillary kinetics were determined, both monuments showed severe deterioration as a consequence of the transport and precipitation of soluble salts within the stone.",

The two differ largely where karst is concerned. The paper deals with the problem of average catchment area size estimation in the situation when meteorological data are limited to precipitation and temperature, but discharge records are available for long period. Proposed methodology was applied to, calibrated, and validated on 15 karst springs in Serbia. Results obtained with the model differ up to 20% from hydrogeological exploration results. One of investigated springs is Grza karst spring, which belongs to the karstic formation of Kučaj and Beljanica (the Carpatho-Balkanide Arch of Eastern Serbia). In this paper, we used the Grza Spring to show model application and necessary improvements to progress from graphoanalytical to analytical model. The average catchment area is linked to the model parameter that reduces potential to real evapotranspiration on monthly bases. The model potential lies in the possibility to determine not only catchment area, but real evapotranspiration and dynamic volume of the porous - karst groundwater storage as well.",

Even so, through the history of Red Lake's research there were many controversies in the conclusions and the theories concerning its genesis, geomorphology and hydrology. The aim of this work is to give an overview of existing findings about Red Lake as well as to present the newest research results gained with the help of emerging technologies based on terrestrial laser scanning and hydro acoustics. The measuring was conducted during September 2013. A new generation of equipment developed to advance the geoscientific research was deployed during the field work. The gathered data enabled a thorough analysis which led to new important findings on Red Lake. Deployment of Remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) equipped with imaging sonar resulted in the first hydro acoustic survey of the lake. Some of the results confirmed the already known and well documented characteristics of Red Lake whereas others disputed the widely accepted assumptions in the scientific community and the general public. The presented research generated, for the first time, a DEM for Red Lake which allowed a good estimate on the lake's volume. For the recorded maximum water level at 311 m a.s.l. the volume of water stored is 8.24 x 106 m3. A temperature profile of the lake was recorded during the field work and it offered an insight on possible water mixing through karst conduits near the surface of the water. The application of TLS and ROV sonar systems considerably improved the understanding of Red Lake's morphology.",

    "abstract": "Inactive swallow hole Buco dei Vinchi developed along a plane dividing selenitic gypsum stratum and an underlying shale interlayer, mostly by antigravitative erosion and by post-antigravitative erosion. It formed through six speleogenetic phases starting from a phreatic phase followed by several antigravitative erosion (= paragenetic) and post-antigravitative erosion phases and vadose phase. During first antigravitative erosion phase, the phreatic protoconduits evolved into small antigravitative conduits with typical cross-section in shape of an inversed U or a bulb. At the end of this phase the small antigravitative conduits converged and merged together in successive stages to form ever-bigger conduits, until – at a certain point – most of them flowed into a single, much wider antigravitative conduit, which later evolved into a composite conduit. Wwe demonstrate that the subhorizontal flat ceilings are not a characteristic feature of the antigravitative passages tout court – as claimed by most authors –, but instead they evolved in caves during periods when the piezometric surface was tangent to the vault of the cave (post-antigravitative erosion phenomenon). Thus these flat ceilings are traces of ‘paleo-piezometric surfaces’; moreover these flat ceilings, being sub-horizontal originally, can provide important information on possible tectonic movements or breakdowns occurred after their formation. The possible ages of the karstic phenomena in the selenitic gypsum near Bologna are discussed. This paper points out that the Buco dei Vinchi and the Cava a Filo swallow holes, presently located in “topographic highs”, were very probably in “topographic lows” at the time of their hydrologic activity, and that this is evidence of a relief inversion started at least 127,000 years ago. Therefore the beginning of the first karstic phenomena in the Bologna karst area is much older than this date. It is explained why the absolute altimetrical lowering of the Monte Croara karst sub-area (with respect to the present sea level) should be of about – 0.39 mm/year.",

    "abstract": "Caves reaching the (epi)phreatic zone may provide the only access to groundwater in the internal parts of karst aquifers. Modern instruments enable unattended high frequency measurements of groundwater parameters in such caves. A network of distributed observation points may give new information on temporal and spatial pattern of groundwater flow. Such network, recording water level, temperature and specific electrical conductivity was established in all major ponors and active water caves of the karst aquifer between Planinsko Polje and springs of the Ljubljanica River, Slovenia. Up to three and a half years long records were analysed in view of available and relevant geological, speleological, meteorological and hydrological information, and basic hydraulic principles of the epiphreatic flow. The result of the interpretation were models of possible conduit networks of the three main flow subsystems draining Planinsko Polje. For each subsystem a hydraulic model comprising the main features of the inferred conduit network and inputs was made. The models were adjusted until their response to the typical flood situations gave a good qualitative fit to the response of the observation network. The results provide new insights into the mechanism of flood propagation through the system and its relation to the known conduit geometry. The hydraulic role of known cave passages is assessed and new flow pathways are proposed. Back-flooding within the aquifer causes an increase of head in the polje, followed by the activation of higher located ponor zones and flow pathways related to them. Hydrographs recorded in two caves located northwest from Planinsko Polje revealed pos sible high transmissivity zone of the Idrija Fault Zone and the mechanism of estavelles located at the polje’s north-western border. The approach taken in this work offers new insights into the relation between the conduit network geometry and flood mechanism.

Sodobni merilniki omogočajo kakovostne zvezne meritve različnih parametrov tudi v takšnih jamah. Merilna mreža z več lokacijami znotraj izbranega vodonosnika lahko ponudi nove podatke o časovni in prostorski dinamiki toka podzemne vode. Takšna merilna mreža, z meritvami višine, temperature in elektroprevodnosti vode, je bila vzpostavljena v vseh pomembnejših ponorih in vodnih jamah na območju med Planinskim poljem in izviri Ljubljanice. Do tri in pol leta dolgi nizi podatkov so bili analizirani z vidika razpoložljivih geoloških, speleoloških, meteoroloških in hidroloških podatkov ter osnovnih hidravličnih načel o epifreatičnem toku vode. Rezultat interpretacij so poenostavljeni modeli z domnevno razporeditvijo podzemnih kanalov v treh glavnih podsistemih, ki odvajajo Planisko polje. Za vsak podsistem je bil napravljen hidravličen model z dotokom in mrežo kanalov, ki najbolje ponazarja resnično stanje. Tekom raziskave so se hidravlični modeli nadgrajevali do takšne mere, da je simulacija vodnega toka zadovoljivo ponazarjala dogajanje, izmerjeno v resničnem okolju. Rezultati so prinesli nove ugotovitve o širjenju in dinamiki poplavljanja skozi sistem ter njihovo povezavo s poznano geometrijo proučevanega vodonosnika. Ocenjena je bila hidravlična vloga poznanih jamskih rovov, na podlagi njih pa interpretirane nove smeri pretakanja vode. Ugotovljeno je bilo tudi zajezitveno poplavljanje znotraj vodonosnika, ki vpliva tudi na vodostaj na polju in nadalje na aktivacijo višje ležečih požiralnikov ter njim sledečih kanalov. V dveh jamah severozahodno od Planinskega polja so višinski hidrogrami nakazali na obstoj bolj prepustnega območja Idrijske prelomne cone ter delovanje estavel na severozahodnem obrobju polja.

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli, one of the primary intestinal commensal bacteria in humans and endothermic animals, is commonly considered an indicator of faecal pollution. E. coli strains were isolated from karst rivers under different hydrological conditions, from footpaths in tourist caves and from bat guano. Isolates were tested for phenotypic resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trimethoprim. The highest percentage of antimicrobial resistant E. coli was found in karst waters, followed by those from surface swabs and from bat guano. Several isolates from rivers and swabs exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotype. Environmental conditions impact the populations of E. coli; a positive correlation between dissolved oxygen and E. coli counts, and a negative correlation between conductivity and E. coli concentrations have been observed for karst rivers. Malenščica (Slovenia), a drinking water resource with an extensive catchment area, contained a relative high percentage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains. None of the isolates from bat guano was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Future monitoring of bats should consider a regular follow-up of indicative microbial disease indicators in fresh guano. Regular cleansing of tourist footpaths in caves and disinfection barriers at the cave entrances reduce the concentration and transmission of E. coli significantly. A future, more detailed, study on characterization of additional E. coli isolates is needed to reveal their pathogeneicity, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and gene transfer frequencies to other members of the karst microbiome.",

Several smaller (10-20 m long) solutional caves have been discovered and surveyed on the slopes of wadis. They exhibit relatively simple assemblage of dominantly dead-end passages. Geometry, rock relief, geology and sediments of these caves were studied and initial hypothesis on their formation suggested. The largest discovered cave is a tectonic feature developed due to the gravitational sliding of part of a mountain. Surface rock relief resulted from different karst processes was also studied in river beds and side walls of wadis and on the mountain plateaus. Two hydrogeologically different karst springs, Khatt and MeBreda, were analysed for basic physical, chemical and microbiological parameters.",

    "abstract": "More accurate interpretations are required in order to understand the processes of hydrological movement and hydrochemical variation of water flow in epikarst. A drip VP1 from the Velika Pasica Cave (Central Slovenia) was studied during a period which occurred at the end of a long wet, cold winter. The sources of the percolation water in the cave were both from rain water and snowmelt water. The discharge was continuously monitored during study period in one hour intervals. Each hour a water sample from the drip was taken for measurements of pH, electric conductivity and major ions concentrations. Because of the specific climatic condition in the shallow cave, the dilution effect is the dominant mechanism in the hydrochemical processes, determining drip water properties. The effect of CO2 corrosion and prior calcite precipitation (PCP) was weakened with that condition; Mg2+ varied slightly more significantly than Ca2+, which was reflected by the high correlation between Mg2+, Ca2+ and micro-variation of Mg/Ca ratio. The variation of pH followed closely to the changes of other parameters, which is rarely noted in other works.",

    "abstract": "The Dong Giao karst aquifer is a major source of drinking water for domestic and agriculture use in Tam Diep city. Understanding of hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality of the karst aquifer are useful information for sustainable use and protection of groundwater in the area. A total of 30 water samples from the main karst springs and domestic wells were collected to identify the physical property, chemical composition of karst water and water-rock interaction. Physico-chemical parameters (pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity and alkalinity) and major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42−, NO3−, Cl−) were measured in situ and analyzed in the lab. Water samples from drinking water source Spring 18 and other important karst springs were taken to detect Escherichia coli (E.coli). A tracer test was also carried out for providing contamination information. Results show that the hydrochemical types of Tam Diep groundwater were of calcium magnesium bicarbonate (Ca-Mg-HCO3) and calcium bicarbonate (Ca-HCO3). The carbonate dissolution line and Ca/Mg ratios clearly indicated that the weathering of carbonate rocks (limestone and dolomite) is the dominant process controlling the chemistry of groundwater of the test site. Chemical quality of groundwater ranks from good to excellent for drinking and irrigation, and total hardness values are relatively high. In contrast, all microbial samples contain high number of E.coli and thus by microbial standards, spring water quality is unsafe for drinking. This bacterial contamination mainly results from untreated domestic wastewaters, city sewage, and human activities in the Tam Diep area.Key words: karst hydrogeochemistry, karst water quality, drinking water protection, Tam Diep, Vietnam. Hidrogeokemična karakterizacija in kakovost podzemne vode kraškega vodonosnika Dong Giao v Tam Diep, Ninh Binh, VietnamKraški vodonosnik Dong Giao je poglavitni vir pitne vode za gospodinjstva in kmetijstvo v mestu Tam Diep. Razumevanje hidrokemičnih lastnosti in kakovosti vode kraškega vodonosnika so koristne informacije za trajnostno rabo in varovanje podzemne vode na tem območju. Skupno je bilo vzetih 30 vzorcev vode iz večjih kraških izvirov in vodnjakov za prepoznavanje fizičnih lastnosti in kemične sestave kraške vode ter interakcije vode in kamnine. Fizikalno-kemični parametri (pH, temperatura vode, električna prevodnost in alkalnost) in glavni ioni (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42−, NO3−, Cl−) so biliu merjeni in situ in analizirani v laboratoriju. Vzorci vode iz vira pitne vode Izvir 18 in drugih pomembnih kraških izvirov so bili preizkušeni na vsebnost Escherichia coli (E. coli). Izveden je bil tudi sledilni poskus, da bi pridobili informacije o onesnaženju. Rezultati kažejo, da spadajo podzemne vode vodonosnika Tam Diep v kalcijev-magnezijev-bikarbonatni (Ca-Mg-HCO3) hidrokemični tip in kalcijev-bikarbonatni (Ca-HCO3) hidrokemični tip. Meja raztapljanja karbonatov in razmerje Ca/Mg sta jasno pokazali, da je preperevanje karbonatnih kamnin (apnenca in dolomita) prevladujoči proces, ki pogojuje kemične lastnosti podzemne vode na testnem območju. Kemijska kakovost podzemne vode se uvršča med dobro in odlično za pitje in namakanje. Celokupna trdota vode je razmeroma visoka. Nasprotno, vsi mikrobiološki vzorci vsebujejo veliko število E. coli, torej z vidika mikrobioloških standardov kakovost izvirske vode ne ustreza vrednostim za pitno vodo.

Nivoji sedimentnih uravnav so primerljivi z višinami zapolnitev poplavne ilovice v bližnjih jamskih rovih. Proces sedimentacije in uravnavanja dnov udornic v nivoje je posledica poplav, ki so segale nad dna udornic in so povzročile sedimentacijo ilovnatega materiala in uravnavanje v njihovem dnu. Zato lahko na podlagi nadmorskih višin sedimenta v dneh udornic predvidevamo dinamiko sedimentacije v kraškem podzemlju, hkrati pa lahko na podlagi razvoja jamskega sistema ugotavljamo razvoj udornic.Several hundred collapse dolines are recorded on the Slovenian karst surface. Their fl oors are covered with boulders, scree or a soil layer. In ponor karst areas, where water transports signifi cant amount of allochtonous material, many collapse doline fl oors are made level by deposits of loamy sediment. This discussion relates to a detailed study of 15 collapse dolines near the Postojna cave system. Loamy sediment appears within several neighboring collapse dolines and covers their fl oors at approximately the same altitude. The sediment level preserved in the collapse dolines is commonly at the same elevation as fl ood loam deposits within nearby caves. It transpires that the fl attening of the collapse doline fl oors is a result of fl ooding inside the karst that extended above the original fl oors of the collapse dolines. It is possible to predict some of the sedimentation dynamics inside the karst on the basis of the elevations of the loamy sediments within the collapse dolines. On the other hand, it is also possible to fi nd out about collapse doline development by studying the processes inside cave systems.",

There is a strong assumption that two of the natural bridges are the only remaining parts of roof of a former cave. Due to the process of surface denudation and to the disruption of stability, the cave roof almost completely collapsed, with the exception of these two sections. Several short caves and rock shelters exist in the gorge, and the longest cave (305 m) is situated next to the biggest of the three natural bridges.",

    "abstract": "Karst systems play a crucial role in drinking water supply and biodiversity. Therefore, their comprehensive characterization of their recharge mechanisms is essential for safeguard water resource quality and sustainable management. This study utilizes the open-access thematic cartography of Ecuador to analyze the lithological, geomorphological, and hydrographic boundaries of groundwater karst systems. Then, employing the APLIS method, the diffusive recharge for each system is calculated. As a result, five hydrogeological karst systems and twelve small isolated karst bodies were delineated within the Amazon Region of Ecuador, collectively occupying a total area of 11112 km2. The effective infiltration of precipitation within these systems was found to vary between 11.11% and 77.11%, with a predominant low infiltration range (20%-40%) covering 48% of the karst area. One of the multiple parameters used in water balance calculations is defined by this research, serving as the initial step in creating conceptual models for evaluating karst aquifer systems in Ecuador from a hydrological perspective. The findings not only offer insights into the vulnerability and characteristics of these systems but also establish the foundation for informed decision-making in sustainable groundwater resource management and protection efforts.",

    "abstract": "Saudi Arabia has over 80,000 km2 of lava fields, locally known as harrats. However, only a few studies of lava caves in Saudi Arabia have been published internationally. This article summarizes the published and unpublished findings of all known expeditions to lava caves in the kingdom. Prior to 2001, reports of such caves were mostly limited to sightings of collapse holes by vulcanologists surveying the lava fields. Few caves were entered and no cave maps were produced. In 2001 and 2002, expeditions were organized to Harrat Kishb, located northeast of Makkah (Mecca). Three lava caves measuring 22 m, 150 m and 320 m in length were surveyed and the collapse features of a fourth cave—possibly over 3 km long—were studied. Two throwing sticks, a plant-fiber rope and the remains of stone walls were found in some of these caves. In 2003, lava tubes measuring 530 m and 208 m were surveyed in Harrat Ithnayn and Harrat Khaybar, respectively. Animal bones and coprolites were found in both caves. In 2003 and 2004, studies were carried out in Hibashi Cave, located in Harrat Nawasif/Al Buqum, 245 km southeast of Makkah. The cave was surveyed (length: 689.5 m) and found to contain two layers of burnt bat guano overlying a bed of redeposited loess up to 1.5 meters deep and up to 5800 years old. At least 19 different minerals were found, three being extremely rare organic compounds related to the guano combustion. Bones, horns, coprolites, ruins of a wall and a human skull ca. 425 years old were also found. There is evidence of many more lava caves in Saudi Arabia, particularly in Harrat Khaybar. Formal archeological and biological studies have not yet been carried out in Saudi lava caves but may produce interesting results.",

    "abstract": "Slovene karst sources are of great national importance for drinking water supply. Since karst aquifer systems are very susceptible to contamination, these sources require appropriate and careful managing. Unfortunately, in the acts of Slovene legislation, the special characteristics of water flow within karst regions are not very seriously taken into consideration in determining the criteria for karst water sources protection. In contrast, in some other countries, the concept of groundwater vulnerability mapping has been successfully used for protection zoning and land use planning in karst. Regarding the differences between particular karst aquifer systems, data availability and economic resources, different methods of karst water vulnerability assessment and mapping have already been developed. Already these methods have been many times tested and implemented in different test sites worldwide. However, experience in application using different methodologies for vulnerability mapping of karst aquifers is very modest in Slovenia. The present paper deals with potential methodological problems that might arise while applying the most commonly used methods for karst water vulnerability assessment to Slovene karst regions.",

    "abstract": "The development of karst is not a linear process but instead takes place at irregular rates that typically include episodes of stagnation and even retrograde processes in which the evolution toward maturity is reversed. The magnitude and nature of these irregularities differs with the length of time considered. Contemporary measurements in caves show fluctuations in dissolution rate with changes in season, discharge, and soil conditions. Dissolution is sometimes interrupted by intervals of mineral deposition. Observed dissolution rates can be extrapolated to obtain estimates of long-term growth of a solution feature. But this approach is flawed, because as the time scale increases, the rates are disrupted by climate changes, and by variations that are inherent within the evolutionary history of the karst feature (e.g., increased CO2 loss from caves as entrances develop). At time scales of 105-106 years, karst evolution can be interrupted or accelerated by widespread fluctuations in base level and surface river patterns. An example is the relation between karst and the development of the Ohio River valley in east-central U.S.A. At a scale of 106-108 years, tectonic and stratigraphic events cause long-term changes in the mechanism and style of karst development. For example, much of the karst in the Rocky Mountains of North America has experienced two phases of pre-burial Carboniferous karst, mineral accretion during deep burial from Permian to Cretaceous, extensive cave development during Paleocene-Eocene uplift, and stagnation and partial mineral deposition caused by late Tertiary aggradation. At such large time scales, it is difficult to determine rates of karst development precisely, if at all. Instead it is appropriate to divide the evolutionary history into discrete episodes that correlate with regional tectonic and stratigraphic events.",

    "abstract": "In this study the iron ore deposit of the historic Warda mine (District of Ajloun, Northern Jordan) and its speleological im­portance is discussed. The number of known dissolutional caves in Jordan is very low, in spite of the fact, that large sections of the country are underlain by Cretaceous limestone. The only large cave yet discovered is Al-Daher Cave, a hypogene maze cave (Kempe et al. 2006). The Warda Iron Deposit was mined during the time of the crusades by one of Saladin’s officers to build and stock the castle of Ajloun. The survey shows that the mine consists of two larger rooms, together about 1000 m2 in area. Much of the mine’s floor is now covered with recent flood sediments (680 m2), up to over 2 m deep. The mine cuts natural cavities, fissures with speleothems and a collapse hall in lime­stone, that may or may not have been created by a collapsed mine ceiling. Calculating the mine volume conservatively, a to­tal of about 1100 t of elemental iron may have been extracted. Mineralogical investigation (XRD) shows, that the iron ore is goethitic/limonitic with noticeable hematite contents. Geo­chemical (XRF) analysis shows that the goethite is very pure; impurities of main elements sum up to 1% only. Among the trace-elements W (248 ppm), As (168 ppm) and Co (124 ppm) show the highest concentrations, with all others &lt; 37 (Ba) ppm. Former prospecting results show that the deposit has a spatial extent of 300 x 200 m with a maximal thickness of about 10 m. Textural, mineralogical and geochemical criteria suggest that the ore body could be of speleogene origin, i.e. deposited in a hypogene, deep phreathic setting, possibly before regional up­lift or even prior to the maximal burial depth. A possibly simi­lar ore-body is for example described from the gigantic Lower Cretaceous and sand-filled cave of Wülfrath (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) (Drozdzewski et al. 1998).",

It is circular mountain morphostructure with assymetrical transversal profile. Devel­oped in Mesozoic subhorizontal layers of limestone and dolo­mite over 3500 thick, fissured by numerous reverse and normal faults. Prenj is folded-thrusted mountain massif (2103 m a.s.l.) uplifted during neotectonic phase of Dinarides development, structurally represented by three blocks. A high degree of cor­relation between lithology, fault structures and relief has been determinated. The main fault structures caused by rotation of Prenj blocks which were reflected on different orientations of stretching of the mountain ridges and composite valleys of Neretva, Konjièka Bijela, Mostarska Bijela, Glogo¹nica and Id-bar.

In regards to morphogenesis during the Quaternary, the massif is character­ized by development: derasional, glacial, periglacial, karstic, fluviokarstic, fluviodenudational and fluvial erosional and ac­cumulational processes and landforms. Finally, geomorpho­logical regionalization of Prenj was made on the basis of the criteria of similarity of morpho-evolutionary, structural-litho­logical and orographical characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous karstification and lithification of aeolian calcarenite in the southwest coastal part of Western Australia produced syngenetic karstic geomorphological features, such as solution pipes, maze caves, collapsed dolines and pinnacles. The formation of these geomorphological features was greatly influenced by the poor cementation and matrix porosity of the calcarenite. Pinnacles, calcarenite pillars up to 5 metres tall with one or more peaks and various types of sediment layers, are most numerous and densest in an area called the Pinnacles in Nambung National Park, Western Australia. $eir detailed characteristics and origin are still partially unknown and controversial. Theories suggest that the pinnacles are the final product of one or more of corrosive expansion and coalescence of solution pipes, cemented sediment surrounding the roots, cemented fill of solution pipes, products of focused cementation or remainders of tree-trunks. This article presents descriptions of pinnacles in Nambung National Park based on my fieldwork and suggests a polygenetic origin for the pinnacles, with roots playing a major role. The genesis of pinnacles is far more complex than the theories presented so far.",

    "abstract": "This work aims at presenting the geographical characterization of the Cordisburgo karst region, in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, by applying the consolidated concepts of the classical karst adapted to the reality of the intertropical karst. The characterization of the karst in the region, led to an exploratory mapping of the main karst features using the methodology proposed by the Commission of Karst Phenomena of the French National Geography Committee, adapted by Kohler. The choice of this methodology was made on grounds that the existence of many Dinaric and Intertropical Karst maps facilitates comparative analysis. As a result of this study, a map summarized the distribution of the karst features for the first time in this region, providing relevant information for the geoenvironmental compartmentation of the Cordisburgo area and important subsides for the sustainable management of that region. Due to its geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biogeographical characteristics, karst in this region is an expressive example of the Brazilian intertropical karst whose superficial and subterraneous evolution must be understood as a complex phenomenon. There is little research on the Lagoa do Jacare Formation. Thus, it is premature to state that the karst in Cordisburgo presents a low karstification rate in its entire carbonatic pack. Studies on the magnitude and the direction of underground water are still insufficient, however.",

    "abstract": "Landscape adaptation on the Northern Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, is particularly difficult, as soils are thin and the terrain is devoid of any surface water other than the occasional sinkhole (cenote) that connects directly to the groundwater system. Despite this, ancient Maya cities, including Xuenkal, emerged and thrived, likely because of their proximity to natural sinkholes. In the case of Xuenkal, these sinkholes, known locally as rejolladas, have bases above the local water table and, as such, do not provide direct access to the underlying water, but they provide closer access. Recognizing that the presence of rejolladas was likely important to the ancient Maya the purpose of this study is to characterize the rejolladas in terms of their subsurface characteristics, specifically bedrock configuration and soil. Ground penetrating radar analysis, as well as the results of a test pit excavation, confirm the presence of deep soils in the rejollada bases. It seems that the smaller deeper rejolladas have the thickest soils and sediment. The ancient city of Xuenkal is constructed amidst a particularly dense cluster of rejolladas which may have contributed to its location. Rejolladas, containing significantly thicker soils than the surrounding karst surface, and the ability to sustain dense healthy vegetation would have been particularly desirable for the Maya to capitalize on.",

Somewhat surprisingly, study of the composition and distribution of organic matter in karst aquifers is rare. The most comprehensive study or organic matter flux to date is a two year continuous monitoring of detritus and animal flux in epikarst drip waters and an epikarst-fed cave stream in the Dorvan karst, France. Analysis of those data reveals high temporal variation in detritus and animal flux in both habitats, but little evidence of seasonality in flux. Water flux explained 30-69% of the variation in animal flux in both habitats and detritus flux in the epikarst seepage water. Detritus flux in the cave stream was better explained by peak monthly discharge. Lack of coherence between organic matter flux in epikarst seepage and the epikarst stream suggests organic matter transport is governed by differing factors in the two habitats. Overall, much of the particulate organic matter flux in the epikarst occurs as living animals suggesting a dominant role of ecological processes in organic matter transport.Keywords: Carbon, energy, epikarst, flux, seasonality, stream.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.665",

The relatively thick stratification and evenly composed rock clearly display the development of stone forests from subsoil karren. This is evident from the shape of individual parts of the stone forest and the shape and rock relief of pillars that comprise the forest. It is the most typical example of development of karren from subsoil to rain and vegetation exposed stone forest. With it we can compare stone forests shaped on different rock and geomorphological and hydrological conditions. Type of rock is clearly reflected in the intensity of corrosion and erosion and with it in the formation and morphological appearance of individual stone pillars and larger blocks of rock. The rock relief on the pillars in stone forests reveals the interwoven traces of the original shaping of the rock below soil and sediment, of the lowering of the level of soil and sediment, and of the younger but distinct transformation of pillars by rainwater, which naturally dominates on the tops. The exceptional character and picturesqueness of this karst phenomenon is the reason for the successful developmentof the stone forest as an international tourist attraction that was deservedly placed on the UNESCO world heritage list.",

This deep limestone gorge is crossed by a stream that is fed by a large basin located in Slovenia. Val Rosandra is the only example of a karst river valley withsurface hydrography in the Classical Karst Plateau. The torrent that crosses it digs a deep gully into the rock, richin rapids, swirl holes, small waterfalls, enclosed meanders and basins; here, the first seepage phenomena occur, and part of the water feeds the underground aquifer.Val Rosandra is characterised by a complex structural situation. The NE slope culminates in the structure of Mt. Stena, a limestone tectonic wedge between two faults, firmly rooted in the karst platform. Bothits external morphology and its caves are influenced by the structure, i.e. by the attitude of bedding planes, fault planes and master joints. Mt. Stena, in particular, hosts a comprehensive net of articulated and diversely shaped caves, basically organised on several levels. This network stretches over a total of 9,000 metres, bearing testimony to ancient geological and hydrogeological origins.The deepest areas of the system reacha suspended aquifer that is probably sustained by an overthrust and placed about 100 meters above the underground aquifer of the Rosandra torrent.A series of feasibility studies on the Trieste-Divača high-speed railway link concentrated on the potential interaction between the project and karst features. In line withthe project requirements, risk of voids intersection and water contamination were analyzed as Mt. Stena’s suspended aquifer partially feeds the Rosandra torrent, whichflows in a protected natural area. We therefore suggest that further investigations ought to be performed to integrate the existing knowledge on karst and on the hydrogeological aspects of the massif.",

    "abstract": "Chemical and bacterial gradients under different hydrologi­cal conditions were studied in a well-developed underground karst system. Water samples were collected from the main un­derground drainage conduit of the Pivka River from October 2013 until June 2016. The system responds quickly to external pulses (precipitation events), and is also impacted by human interventions, as is demonstrated mainly by fluctuations of sul­phates, chlorides, and occasionally elevated concentrations of organic and faecal pollutants. Chemical and bacterial param­eters showed a monotonous trend of decreasing concentrations from the ponor towards the interior of the karst massif during stable hydrological conditions, and a significant change dur­ing high water conditions. High flow events tend to equilibrate chemical and bacterial parameters in the underground river. Concentrations of chlorides, TOC (total organic carbon) and nitrates were the most indicative parameters describing the for­mation of the gradient. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water indicated that the main karst conduit collects isotopi­cally different waters from the aquifer. The river water collected after nine kilometres of underground flow was always isotopically lighter than the waters collected from the upstream sites. Multiparameter analysis proved to be a useful tool for providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the underground water, which influence both the underground environment and the ecology of the biome.Key words: karst, hydrology, water chemistry, nutrients, stable isotopes, PCA, bacteria. Multiparametrska analiza okoljskih gradientov, povezanih s hidrološkimi razmerami v binarnem kraškem sistemu (podzemni tok reke Pivke, Slovenija)V dobro razvitem podzemnem kraškem sistemu smo pri različnih hidroloških pogojih preučevali kemijske in bakterijske gradiente.

Sistem se hitro odziva na zunanje impulze (padavinski dogodki) in je tudi podvržen človekovim posegom, kar dokazujejo predvsem nihanja v koncentraciji sulfatov in kloridov ter občasno povišane koncentracije organskih in fekalnih onesnaževal. Spremljanje kemijskih in bakterijskih parametrov v stabilnih hidroloških razmerah je pokazalo monotoni trend zniževanja koncentracij od ponora proti notranjosti kraškega masiva. Razmere se izrazito spremenijo v času visokih vod, ko pride v podzemnem vodotoku do izenačenja tako kemijskih kot bakterijskih parametrov. Kloridi, TOC (skupni organski ogljik) in nitrati so bili najbolj indikativni parametri za opis nastanka gradienta.

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical measure of soil organic matter (SOM) content. SOM plays a vital role in ecosystem services, soil fertility, soil water retention capacity, and carbon cycling. SOC can be partitioned into various carbon fractions, which exhibit diverse stability and chemical compositions that are influenced variably by lithology as well as biological and cli­matic processes. A better understanding of SOC and the influ­ence of different bedrock types on carbon fractions could facili­tate the evaluation of the fate and stability of SOC. The present study is focused on the concentrations and characteristics of different SOC fractions (e.g., Labile organic carbon, LOC; Re­calcitrant organic carbon, ROC; Calcium-bound organic car­bon, Ca-SOC; Iron/aluminium-bound organic carbon, Fe/Al-SOC) in forest soils associated with different bedrock lithology under similar climate conditions in the centre of the ‘Classical Karst’, and evaluates influence of the geological environment on SOC. SOC and SOC fraction concentrations decreased with an increase in depth in all profiles, indicating stabilized soil profiles. SOC values (9.7–45.5 g∙kg-1) were consistent with the findings of other studies on soils in the region. ROC and Fe/Al-SOC (51.5–65.8 % and 68.0–73.3 %, respectively) were the ma­jor SOC fractions, while Ca-SOC accounted for a considerably lower proportion (6.4–7.4 %) of the SOC contents. Key factors influencing SOC contents were calcite (expressed as calcium oxide) and clay contents, which represent mineral complexes stabilizing SOC. Overall Fe2O3 and Al2O3 concentration did not explain differences in SOC nor its fractions, potentially due to the importance of chemical/mineral forms of Fe- and Al-related minerals (reactivity). Soils on carbonate rocks, which are richer in clay and CaO, had 6.35 g∙kg-1 (28 percentage points) higher concentrations of SOC average when compared with soils on siliciclastic rock, due to higher concentrations of stabilized SOC fractions. The results demonstrate that bedrock lithology and pedogenesis are key factors influencing SOM stabilization.Key words: karst soil, soil organic carbon, labile organic carbon, recalcitrant organic carbon, calcium-bound organic carbon, iron/aluminium-bound organic carbon.Kvantifikacija in vrednotenje organskega ogljika in njegovih frakcij v tleh: primer s Klasičnega Krasa, JZ SlovenijaZ meritvami organskega ogljika v prsteh (SOC) izražamo vsebnost organskih snovi v prsteh (SOM). SOM igra ključno vlogo pri ekosistemskih storitvah, rodovitnosti, zmogljivosti zadrževanja vode in kroženju ogljika. SOC lahko razdelimo na različne ogljikove frakcije, ki kažejo različno stabilnost in kemično sestavo, na katero različno vplivajo litološka zgradba, biološki in podnebni procesi. Boljše razumevanje SOC in vpliv različnih vrst matične podlage na ogljikove frakcije bi lahko olajšala oceno stabilnosti SOC. Ta študija preučuje koncentracije in dinamiko različnih frakcij SOC (npr. labilni organski ogljik, LOC; rekalcitrantni organski ogljik, ROC; organski ogljik, vezan na kalcij; organski ogljik, vezan na železo/aluminij, Fe/Al-SOC) v gozdnih prsteh in povezanost z različno litološko zgradbo v podobnih podnebnih razmerah. Prostorsko se študija osredotoča na območje klasičnega krasa. Koncentracija SOC in njegove frakcije so se z naraščajočo globino v vseh profilih zmanjšale, kar kaže na relativno uravnotežene profile prsti. Vrednosti SOC (9,7–45,5 g∙kg-1) so skladne z ugotovitvami drugih raziskav prsti v regiji. ROC in Fe/Al-SOC (51,5–65,8 % oziroma 68,0–73,3 %) sta bili glavni komponenti SOC, medtem ko je za Ca-SOC značilen bistveno nižji delež (6,4–7,4 %). Ključna dejavnika, ki vplivata na vsebnost SOC, sta vsebnost kalcita (izražen kot kalcijev oksid) in gline; tadva s SOC tvorita mineralne komplekse, ki stabilizirajo SOC. Vrednosti Fe2O3 in Al2O3 ne pojasnjujejo razlik SOC niti njegovih frakcij, kar je lahko posledica različnega vpliva kemičnih/mineralnih oblik železovih oz. aluminijevih spojin na reaktivnost. Prsti na karbonatnih kamninah, ki so bogatejše z delci velikosti glin in CaO, so imele zaradi višjih koncentracij stabiliziranih SOC frakcij za 6,35 g∙kg-1 (28 odstotnih točk) višje povprečne vrednosti SOC v primerjavi prstmi na siliciklastičnih (flišnih) kamninah. Rezultati kažejo, da sta osnovna dejavnika, ki vplivata na stabilizacijo SOM, litološka zgradba in pedogeneza.Ključne besede: kraške prsti, organski ogljik v tleh, labilni organski ogljik, rekalcitrantni organski ogljik, organski ogljik, vezan na kalcij, organski ogljik, vezan na železo/aluminij.",

In the cold zone of the cave, with temperatures below 0 °C control («freeze») the transformation of carbonate and sulphate materials. The main processes of mineral formation in cold zone are connected with cryogenic mineralization from sulphate and carbonate waters. Slide-rocks in the transition zone of the cave, where temperatures range from 0 °C to 3 °C, are distinguished by the presence of authigenic carbonate breccias and a variety of gypsum forms. In the warm zone of the cave, slide-rock undergoes complete dissolution of gypsum and partial dissolution of carbonate debris.

    "abstract": "V članku poročamo o morfoloških raziskavah na puhlični planoti Tési in z bazaltom prekritim kraškim območjem v okolici gore Kab na južnem delu gorovja Bakony. Skoraj 600 m visoka gora Kab, prekrita z bazaltom, izstopa iz hribovitega predela južnega dela gorovja Bakony. Površina gore, ki meri kakih 35-40 km², je prekrita z različno debelim bazaltom. Na bazaltnem površju so razvite psevdokraške oblike (depresije), ki so posledica zakrasevanja apnenca pod bazaltom. Z združevanjem glede na morfologijo in hitrost razvoja ter študijem korelacije genetskih značilnosti nastalih združb, smo izluščili nove kraške procese, kjer smo lahko depresije različnih oblik intepretirali kot različne stopnje iste razvojne poti. Mezozojske kamnine planote Tési le redko pogledajo na površje izpod pokrova puhlice. Blizu vrhov so nastajale udorne in ponorne vrtače z zelo omejenim območjem napajanja. Raziskave procesov, oblik in pojavnosti pokritega krasa gore Bakony so pokazale, da je nastanek recentnih jaškov povezan s skritimi litološkimi mejami. Pomembno vlogo pri razvoju površinskih oblik pokritega krasa imajo tudi paleokraški kanali, ki so se reaktivirali še pred nastankom puhlice. We have conducted our morphological researches on the loess-covered Tési plateau and on the basalt covered karst area around Mt. Kab in the southern part of the Bakony Mts. The nearly 600 m high basalt covered Mt. Kab emerges high from the undulating mountains and hilly areas of the Southern Bakony Mts. Its surface, an area about 35-40 km² is covered by basaltic rocks of different thickness. Pseudokarstic landforms (depressions) developed on the basalt surface due to the karstic corrosion of the buried limestone layers. Grouping the objects of different morphology and evolution rate, and studying in corellation the genetic marks of the significantgroups,a special karst process can be drawn, in which the depressions of various form can be understood as different stations of the same evolutionary series. The Mesosoic rocks building up the 60 km² Tési plateau emerge to the surface rarely above the loess cover. There is agricultural activity on most part of the plateau. Typical covered karstic landforms developed on the 3-5 m thick loess cover. Subsidence dolines or alluvial streamsink dolines with a small catchment area were formed on the summits. We studied the processes, forms and occurrence of recent covered karst of Mt. Bakony, and these studies shows that on the covered karst surface of the Tési-plateau the recent pit formation along with baticapture connected to hidden and real rock boundary, as well as the opening and activation of paleokarstic passages developed before loess formation also play a role in the evolution of the covered karst surface forms of the Tési-plateau.",

Vodomere so večkrat mesečno odčitavali opazovalci (običajno uslužbenci Tatranskega narodnega parka). 1998 je Nacionalni odbor za znanstvene raziskave odobril triletni projekt z naslovom “Ugotavljanje zadrževalnih sposobnosti in hitrost denudacije na krasu poljskih Tater na podlagi opazovanj vokliških izvirov”.

At the same time, they are the main source of information on the hydrography of the investigated karst area. Continuous monitoring of groundwaters and surface waters in the Tatra Mountains in Poland takes place for a long time. In the mid-70-ties, the team of Prof. D. Małecka organized an observation network, with water marks along the main Tatra streams right to their outlets from the massif, and with observation points of the largest springs and vaucluse springs. Readings from water marks were collected several times each month by the observers (usually Tatra National Park employees). In 1998 the National Committee for Scientific Research approved a three-year research project entitled: ˝Determination of retention abilities and the dynamics of denudation in the karst areas of the Polish Tatra Mountains basing on stationary investigations of vaucluse springs˝. In accordance with this project, between November and December 1998 automatic limnimeters were installed in selected vaucluse (five) springs.",

    "abstract": "The Lunan Stone Forest is the Worldʼs premier pinnacle karst landscape, and was established as a national park in 1982. The existing boundaries are essentially arbitrary, based on notional scenic value, and take into consideration neither the physical landscape nor the existing pattern of urban development. Moreover, the location of the boundaries is not clear to the local community, rendering them largely ineffective. Developing an online Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) potentially provides a way to establish protective boundaries that are meaningful from the perspective of karst science, yet also readily identifiable by the local community within the context of the existing urban fabric. The 7km2 “core area” of the Stone Forest Park is used to illustrate the use of the SDSS. Lunanski kaniti gozd je najlepši primer »kamnitega gozda« (shilin) na svetu in je bil 1982 razglašen za narodni park. Sedanje meje parka so bile dogovorjene na osnovi zaznavne pokrajinske vrednote in ne upoštevajo niti fizičnih lastnosti pokrajine niti obstoječega vzorca razvoja mesta. Še več, lokalnim skupnostim meje niso jasne in so zato še manj učinkovite. Z razvojem Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) na spletu je dano orodje, s pomočjo katerega bi bilo mogoče določiti meje varovanega območja, ki bi bile zadovoljujoče z vidika krasoslovja in sprejete s strani lokalnih skupnosti v skladu s sedanjim urbanim razvojem. Na 7 km2 osrednjega dela Kamnitega gozda je prikazana možnost uporabe SDSS.",

    "abstract": "There are few cases of open caves that have been reliably dated to ages greater than 65 Ma. This does not mean that such caves are extremely rare, rather it is difficult to reliably establish that a cave, or palaeokarst related to a cave, is this old. Relative dating methods such as: - regional stratigraphic, lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, relative climatic, relative isotopic, morphostratigraphic, and regional geomorphic are very useful. They suffer however from significant difficulties, and their results lack the impact of a crisp numerical date. While many of the methods used to date younger caves will not work over the required age range, some isotopic methods and palaeomagnetic methods have been applied with varying degrees of success. While finding something to date and having it dated is difficult enough, producing the date is rarely the end of the story. The difficult issue is not the date or relative correlation itself, but what the date or correlation means. Demonstrating that caves are ancient seems to rapidly become beset with the old adage that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof”. The presence of a well-dated or correlated sediment in a cave does not necessarily mean that the cave is that old or older. Perhaps the dated material was stored somewhere in the surrounding environment and deposited much more recently in the cave. A lava flow in a cave must be demonstrated conclusively to be a flow, not a dyke or a pile of weathered boulders washed into the cave. It must be conclusively shown that dated minerals were precipitated in the cave and not transported from elsewhere. There seems little doubt that in the future more ancient caves, or ancient sections of caves, will be identified and that as a result our perception of the age of caves in general will change. R.A.L. Osborne: Datiranje starih jam in z njimi povezanega paleokrasa Je le nekaj primerov odprtih jam, ki bi imele zanesljivo določeno starost nad 65 milijonov let. To ne pomeni, da so take jame izredno redke, ampak da je težko zanesljivo ugotoviti, da so oziroma paleokras, povezan z njimi, res tako stare. Relativne metode datiranja, kot so regionalno stratigrafsaka, litostratigrafska, biostratigrafska, relativno klimatološka, relativno izotopska, morfostratigrafska in regionalno geomorfološka, so zelo uporabne. Imajo pa pomembne pomanjkljivosti, saj njihovi izsledki ne temelje na jasnih številčnih podatkih. Medtem, ko marsikatera od metod, ki so uporabne za datiranje mlajših jam, ni uporabna za omenjeno starost, pa je bilo uporabljenih več izotopskih in paleomagnetnih metod z različnim uspehom. Težko je najti snov za datiranje in jo datirati, a sama starost še ni konec zgodbe. Težava ni z datiranjem ali s korelacijo, ampak v tem, kaj starost oziroma korelacija pomenita. Dokazovanje, da so jame stare, je hitro odpravljeno s pregovorom »Izredni izsledki zahtevajo izredne dokaze«. Dobro datirani ali korelirani sedimenti v jami še ne pomenijo, da je jama toliko stara ali starejša. Morda je bilo datirano gradivo odloženo nekje v okolici in šele mnogo kasneje preneseno v jamo. Lavin tok v jami mora biti neizpodbitno določen kot lavin tok, ne pa da je dyke ali balvani, prenešeni v jamo. Neizpodbitno mora biti dokazano, da so bili datirani minerali izločeni v jami in ne preneseni od nekod drugod. Nedvomno bo v bodoče spoznanih več starih jam ali njihovih delov in zaradi tega se bo tudi naše pojmovanje o starosti jam v celoti spremenilo.",

    "abstract": "Vloga epikrasa pri nastanku podtalnih škrapelj in kraških depresij, je različna. Prevotljene škraplje in podtalne škraplje tipa »kluftkarren« so prekrite s kraško prstjo in kažejo na delovanje vode. Nastale so v epikraški coni ob razpokah s pomočjo difuzne korozije v kapilarnem vodonosniku v zgornjem delu vadozne cone. Zaobljeni vrhnji deli in luknje v škrapljah so nastale zaradi enakomerne in stalne korozije s pomočjo talne vlage v zgornjem delu epikraške cone. Kraške depresije pa so razvite v karbonantih plasteh in tudi na stiku zakraselih in nezakraselih, a eroziji podvrženih kamnin. V tem primeru nastane veliko drobirja, iz katerega nastane prst, ki zapolni te reliefne oblike. Uvale in polja so navadno razvita na mestu nekdanjih suhih dolin ali tektonskih udorin s pomočjo razširjanja razpok v subkutani coni in zaradi njenega spuščanja. Sočasno ta cona postaja postopoma neprepustna in s tem se krepi robna korozija. Te oblike navadno nastajajo nad piezometrično gladino. Kraška polja – presihajoča jezera pa so nastala, kjer so depresije občasno dosegle gladino talne vode v epikrasu. The role of epikarst in the morphogenesis of the subcutaneous karren and the karstic hollow forms is different. Cavernous karren and subcutaneous kluftkarren, are covered with terra rossa and show the activity of water. They are developed in the epikarstic zone due to the diffused corrosion on the joints through a capillary aquifer, situated in the high vadose zone. The rounded tops and the cavities of those subcutaneous karren are formed due to the continuous and uniform corrosion, acting by soil moisture in the high part of the epikarstic zone. Karstic hollowforms are developed in carbonate layers only, and also on the contact of karstifi ed and non-karstifi ed but easily erodable rocks. In this case, a lot of material is produced for the formation of soils that fi ll these landforms. Uvalas and poljes usually develop in sites of old valleys or tectonic depressions through the process of widening of the joints in the subcutaneous zone and the lowering of the latter zone. Simultaneously there occurs the gradual impermeability of the zone and the reinforcement of the lateral corrosion. These forms are mostly formed above the piezometric level. The poljes - periodical lakes are created due to the development when they temporary reach epikarstic water table.",

In lower concentrations the uranine was detected in the Podpeška jama and Kompoljska jama Caves, as well as in the Šica near Mala Račna spring and both springs of the Krka river. At high waters the flow from the landfill towards the Globočec spring was proved also, but this important source of water supply is primary recharged from other parts of the karst aquifer. The appearance of tracer is forwarded by favourable hydrological conditions and increased concentrations of uranine were measured at all springs after more intensive precipitation events even one year after the injection.

    "abstract": "Glacial karst (GK) is combination of phenomenon and processes as a result of which specific surface forms and cavities inside ice are formed. Hummocky relief with abundance of lakes, channels and reservoirs inside ice and on ice-rock contact are typical for GK. GK development occurs under acting of physical process of ice melting instead of limestone dissolution in classical karst. However processes directivities and arising forms in both cases are similar at system level. As karst processes in ice origin very fast it is give possibility to use them as physical models for limestone karst. Vice-versa, we can understand GK better if we use results of limestone karst investigations. However in both cases only general regularity can be used because some specific features are typical for each kind of karst. GK shows in development of such forms in ice: internal drainage systems (moulins, shafts, cascades, vadose galleries and phreatic channels, siphons, griphons) and under ice (vadose and phreatic channels), dry and water fill dolines on clean ice and on ice covered by moraine (debris-covered glaciers), glacier caves. Stages of GK development completely correspond to stages of limestone karst development. But because of glaciers motion it is possible to observe all stages of GK development on the surface of the same glacier from decrepit (at glacier tongue) up to early (in upper part of ablation zone). GK has large significance in glaciers evolution. GK is widely spread in all temperate and polythermal glaciers of the world. The accelerated glaciers degradation in present time gives a task of mandatory analysis of GK because of many glaciers can disappear very soon.",

    "abstract": "A cave is a natural void in the rock. Therefore, a cave in itself cannot be dated, and one has to resort to datable sediments to get ideas about the age of the void itself. The problem then is that it is never very certain that the obtained age really is coincident with the true age of the cave. Here, we present the use of a method which couples sedimentary and morphologic information to get a relative chronology of events. Datings within this relative chronology can be used for assessing ages of forms, processes, and sediments, and the obtained dates also fix some milestones within the chronology, which then can be used to retrace, among other things, paleoclimatic variations. For many cave systems, the dating limits of the most widely used U/Th method on speleothems are too low (350 to max. 700 ka) to get ages that inform us about the age of the cave. The recent use of cosmogenic nuclides on quartz-containing sediment permits to push the datable range back to 5 Ma. While the theoretical background is explained elsewhere (Granger, this volume), we concentrate on the Siebenhengste example (Switzerland)",

As major tourist attractions, both these areas have progressively structured their economies around tourism, although they have implemented very different development and karst landscape protection policies. In very simplistic terms, management of the Ardèche Gorge can be described as very laxest, whereas development in the Škocjan Caves is much more strictly controlled. When examined from this preservation/development perspective, the differences in the ways the two sites are managed can be traced through a diachronic approach to the history of their tourism development. In fine, this comparative approach illustrates how two processes between tourism and preservation policies structure territories development on karst areas.",

Comparisons among these data and with the geochemistry of carbonate and gypsum equilibrium reactions reveal that DOC concentration is inversely related to discharge, multiple reaction pathways provide DIC with isotopic enrichment that may be directly related to mineral saturation, and oxidation of reduced sulfur is possible for dissolution. DOC is derived from C3 vegetation with an average δ13CDOC of ‒27‰. DIC in groundwater is derived from both pedogenic CO2 and HCO3- from dissolved carbonate. At input sites to the karst aquifers DIC concentrations are expectedly low, less than 1 mmol/L, in waters that are undersaturated with respect to calcite. At the output of these karst aquifers DIC concentrations reach 3 mmol/L in waters that are at or above calcite saturation. Values of δ13CDIC range between ‒6.3 and ‒12.4‰ with CO2 degassing and calcite precipitation at some sites obfuscating a simple relationship between δ13CDIC, discharge, and mineral saturation. In addition, concentrations of DIC in sulfur seeps within the watershed range between 2–7 mmol/L with δ13CDIC values in some samples skewed more toward the anticipated value of carbonate bedrock than would be expected from reactions with carbonic acid alone. This suggests that the oxidation of reduced sulfur from shallow oilfield brines liberates bedrock DIC through reactions with sulfuric acid.Keywords: dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, sulfur redox, ion geochemistry, saturation index.Keywords: dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, sulfur redox, ion geochemistry, saturation index.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.668",

Monotone and sequential trends have been evaluated and interpreted based on a 45-year data measurement period between 1960 and 2004. The springs have a typical karstic regime with short-term periods of high discharge and long-term periods of mean and low discharge values. The ratio of low, mean and high discharges is about 1:10:100. The majority of the springs’ groundwater comes from precipitation in the recharge area. Supplementation of two different statistical analyses for sequential trend detection was applied to annual decile discharge values (1960–2004) due to the subjectivity of results interpretation. The first method involved the use of rescaled adjusted partial sums (RAPS) and the second non-parametric sequential Mann-Kendall trend detection. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if and to what extent the length and trend line direction of sub-periods differ between different annual decile values of Vipava springs and to what extent decile values are related to annual precipitation. Sequential trend analysis confirmed similarity in hydrological conditions between some neighbouring discharge decile values but not in others. This analysis also showed that the length of sub-periods and their linear trend direction differed with respect to low, mean and high annual decile discharge values.",

The ultra- specialised hygropetricolous beetles belonging to the genera Cansiliella and Hadesia are biogeographically and phylogenetically unrelated leptodirines. As the species of the former genus are known to be associated with the moonmilk deposits our study aimed to obtain data on their foraging behaviour, as well as to compare the feeding strategies of both genera. In situ monitoring of C. servadeii from the cave Grotta della Foos (Italy) and H. asamo from Bravenik Cave (Bosnia and Herzegovina), was complemented by video recordings to ensure accurate results. Mouthparts and tarsi of both species were examined using scanning electron microscopy and compared with H. weiratheri from Montenegro to evaluate potential morphological adaptations to the hygropetricolous ecological niches. The three species had significantly different mouthpart morphologies, likely due to differences in semi-aquatic feeding strategies and overall ecology. A series of new observations on site movement and feeding behaviour are presented, compared and discussed.Key words: Coleoptera, ecology, behaviour, moonmilk, cave hygropetric.

    "abstract": "Outgassing of CO2 from thin water layers of a solution of CaCO3 in an H2O -CO2 system plays a crucial role in the precipitation of calcite. Understanding the process of outgassing of CO2 during precipitation of calcite to the surface of stalagmites is important for the interpretation of isotope signals in the calcite deposited to the speleothem. There is, however, some confusion in the literature about the physics and chemistry of this process. Indistinct terms like forced, enhanced, rapid, intense, slow, increased, equilibrium and progressive outgassing are used widely in the literature to explain the impact on isotope composition of the calcite deposited. It is shown that in all the variety of conditions occurring in nature only two distinct processes of outgassing exist. 1. Diffusion controlled outgassing: In the first step, whenever a thin water layer of calcareous solution is present, either on the cave wall or on the surface of a stalagmite, molecular CO2 escapes within several seconds by physical diffusion and after about 40 seconds pH and DIC in the solution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the CO2 in the cave atmosphere. 2.) Controlled by precipitation: In the second step this supersaturated solution precipitates calcite, whereby for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is generated and escapes from the solution by molecular diffusion. This precipitation controlled outgassing is active during precipitation only. All variations of outgassing mentioned in the literature can be explained by one of these two types of outgassing. Furthermore it is shown that the first step of outgassing driven by diffusion has no influence on the isotope composition of the HCO3 - reservoir in the solution and consequently on that of calcite precipitated from it. The isotope composition of HCO3 for 13C as well as for 18O solely is determined by the second step of precipitation controlled outgassing. An experiment is presented proving that the amount of CO2 escaping from the solution during precipitation of calcite at any time is equal to the amount of calcite precipitated. The results are used for a critical application to the Δ47 clumped isotope thermometer that explains why in most stalagmites the calcite is not a good candidate to obtain correct temperatures at the time of its deposition.Key words: isotope, clumped isotope, speleothem, calcite, paleo- thermometer.Fizika in kemija razplinjanja CO2 pri odlaganju sige, s posebnim ozirom na signale izotopa 18O in izotopskega skupka 13C18O v raztopljenem organskem ogljiku in kalcituRazplinjanje CO2 iz tanke plasti raztopine sistema CaCO3 in H2O–CO2 je pomembno za izločanje kalcita in interpretacijo izotopskih signalov v odloženem kalcitu. V literaturi je precejšnja zmeda pri obravnavanju fizike in kemije procesa razplinjanja, saj raziskovalci uporabljajo različne izraze, kot so prisiljeno, poudarjeno, počasno, povečano in progresivno razplinjanje. V članku pokažem, da sta pri vseh različnih razmerah v naravi bistvena le dva procesa razplinjanja. 1) Difuzijsko razplinjanje: v prvem koraku molekularni CO2 v nekaj sekundah z difuzijo preide iz tanke plati vode, ki polzi ali po jamski steni ali po površini sige. Po približno 40 sekundah pH in raztopljeni organski ogljik v raztopini dosežeta ravnovesje z atmosferskim CO2. 2) Razplinjanje pri izločanju: v drugem koraku prenasičena raztopina izloča kalcit, pri čemer se za vsako odloženo molekulo CaCO3 iz raztopine sprosti molekula CO2, ki potem z difuzijo uide v jamsko atmosfero. S tema procesoma lahko pojasnimo vse druge načine razplinjanja, ki jih omenja literatura. Nato pokažem, da CO2, ki se razplini v prvem koraku, ne vpliva na izotopsko sestavo zaloge HCO3- v raztopini in zato tudi v izločenem kalcitu. Izotopska sestava HCO3- je tako za 13C in za 18O povsem določena z razplinjanjem med izločanjem kalcita. Ujemanje količine razplinjenega CO2 in izločenega kalcita pokažem tudi s poskusom. Rezultati omogočajo kritično obravnavo uporabe termometra na osnovi izotopskega skupka Δ47 in pojasnjujejo, zakaj kalcit ni primeren za določanje temperature v času izločanja.Ključne besede: izotop, izotopski skupek, siga, kalcit, paleo temperatura.",

To je šesti nivo (od sedmih) tega kompleksnega kraškega sistema, katerega najnižji del je aktiven in teče skozenj potok Arroyo Santo Tomàs. Zaradi velike pestrosti kraških oblik, tako na površju kot v jami in zaradi pomembnih arheoloških odkritij, je jamo Gran Caverna de Santo Tomàs v zadnjih 10 letih obiskalo pomembno število turistov in znanstvenikov, kljub težavam zaradi oddaljenosti od glavnih turističnih poti po otoku. Več elementov potrjuje, da je upravljanje z jamo lep primer majhnega vpliva turizma na jamo. Med temi je omejeno število obiskovalcev v skupini, uporaba zgolj lesa za lestve in mostičke za dostop do jamskega vhoda ter uporaba akumulatorskih električnih svetilk (ne da bi bil v jami nameščen stalni sistem osvetljevanja). Zato ima Gran Caverna de Santo Tomàs velike možnosti da postane eno najpomembnejših mest na Karibih, kjer bi lahko na eni strani razvijali ekološki in trajnostni turizem, na drugi pa bi, zaradi svoje velikosti in dolžine, vabila mednarodne in kubanske jamarje ter znanstvenike k stalnim speleološkim in krasoslovnim raziskavam. At Gran Caverna de Santo Tomàs, one of the longest karst system of Cuba, a part of the cave is exploited since 1994 as show cave. It corresponds to the sixth level (out of the total of seven) of the complex karst system, which lowest part is still active today, being the present course of Arroyo Santo Tomàs. Even with the difficulties related to great distance from the main tourist routes of the island, Gran Caverna de Santo Tomàs was visited in the last 10 years by a significant number of tourists and scientists, due to its remarkable variety of karst landscape, at the surface as well as within the cave, and the important archaeological discoveries therein carried out. Management of the show cave is a good example of low-impact effect of tourism in a karst cave, as many features point out. Among these, the limited number of visitors allowed for each group, the choice in using only wooden ladders and passages to reach the cave entrance, and the adoption of rechargeable electrical light (without realizing any fixed light system in the cave). Gran Caverna de Santo Tomàs, therefore, has a high potentiality for becoming one of the best location in the Caribbean to develop an ecological sustainable tourism and, at the same time, due to its size and length, to allow international and Cuban cavers and scientiststo continue carrying out speleological and karst research.",

Glavni cilj pridružitve Slovenije k projektu COST 625 je bil, da bi z izmenjavo izkušenj in metodologije ugotovili aktivnost ali neaktivnost določenih prelomov v zahodni Sloveniji. V okviru projekta smo se odločili za večletni monitoring, zato smo v zahodni Sloveniji namestili štiri ekstenziometre TM 71. V prvi polovici letu 2004 smo v Postojnski jami na dinarski prelom, ki je od Predjamskega preloma oddaljen okrog 1 km severno, postavili dva inštrumenta. Tretji inštrument je postavljen na Raškem prelomu na JV pobočju Vremščice in četrti v dolini Učje na Idrijski prelom. Peti inštrument TM 71 bo postavljen na Kneškem prelomu, ki se nahaja južno od Ravenskega preloma. Prvi rezultati v Postojnski jami kažejo na manjše horizontalne premike velikosti do 0,05 mm v enem letu. For Western Slovenia moderate historical to recent seismicity is characteristic. The principal aim for Slovenia to join the COST 625 project was to exchange the experiences and methodology and in this way to determine the activity or non-activity of selected faults in Western Slovenia. Within the project frame we decided for several years of monitoring, and in this sense four TM 71 extensometers were installed in Western Slovenia. In the firsthalf of the 2004 two TM 71 instruments were installed in Postojnska Jama on the Dinaric oriented fault that is situated about 1 km North from Predjama fault. The third instrument was installed on Raša fault on the SE slope of Vremščica and the fourth instrument in Učja valley on Idrija fault. The fifth instrument TM71 will be set upon Kneža fault that is situated south from Ravne fault. The firs tresults from Postojnska Jama are showing the small horizontal movements for 0.05 mm in one year.",

    "abstract": "When calcite is precipitated from a water film on top of a stalagmite to its surface, the carbonate in the solution and consequently also the carbonate in the calcite deposited becomes enriched in the heavy isotopes 18O and 13C (Hansen et al. 2016; Dreybrodt &amp; Scholz 2011; Romanov et al. 2008). This isotope signal is added to the isotope imprint resulting from climate variability. Therefore a physical model of the evolution of the isotope composition of carbonate in a water film, either flowing down the surface of the stalagmite at high drip rates or stagnant, when the drip rate is low, is necessary to discriminate the climate signal from the signal resulting from physical processes in the cave.Currently two models are proposed. In the first one (Scholz et al. 2009) one assumes that the isotope evolution can be described by a Rayleigh distillation process (Mook 2000) where during the entire process of precipitation the fractionation factor for carbon or oxygen, respectively remains constant. In another model one assumes that precipitation is a uni-directional non-equilibrium process, where the constants in the rate equations are slightly different for the light and the heavy isotope (Dreybrodt 2008; Dreybrodt &amp; Scholz 2011). Results from these models have been compared for various scenarios by Scholz et al. (2009), Dreybrodt and Scholz (2011), Dreybrodt and Deininger (2014) and Dreybrodt and Romanov (2016). Differences of opinion clearly exist in the research community regarding which of these models best represents reality. In this letter I discuss the meaning of the Rayleigh equation for precipitation of calcite under equilibrium conditions and for precipitation of calcite governed by uni-directional rate equations.",

    "abstract": "Frequency analysis is usually used in hydrology for the possibility and scale of discharge extremes, especially low flows or flood features of concrete gauge. The paper presents a frequency analysis carried out on a 51 year period (1961-2011) series of maximum annual discharge, on Kazani karst spring gauge station. The time series were non-homogenous according to Cumulative deviations test (Q = 1.531) and Standard normal homogeneity test ( = 10.543). After adjusting of annual maximum discharges (AMD) before the year of change (1995), with using AnClim software, the frequency analysis was made using four probability distributions. Obtained results show possibility of karst spring flood occurrence for different return periods. After their calculation the best fitting distribution was chosen using graphical and statistical testing between empirical and theoretical data distribution. According to the spring significance for nature and humanity, it was crucial to choose a right probability distribution for annual maximum discharges of Kazani karst spring. Therefore, a comparison using graphical and statistical testing (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, χ2 and Anderson-Darling test) was made. The best fit according to three tests was the Gumbel distribution with AMD of 4.54 m3/s for return period of 10 years, 6.06 m3/s for return period of 100 years and 7.56 m3/s for return period of 1000 years, respectively.Key words: karst spring, annual maximum discharge, hydrology, homogeneity, frequency analysis.Ocena maksimalnih letnih pretokov s frekvenčno analizo s štirimi verjetnostnimi porazdelitvami v primeru nehomogenih časovnih serij (kraški izvir Kazani v Republiki Makedoniji)Običajno uporabljamo v hidrologiji frekvenčno analizo za oceno verjetnosti in velikosti ekstremnih pretokov, še posebej nizkih tokov ali poplavnih značilnosti na določenih merilnih mestih. V članku je predstavljena frekvenčna analiza, ki je bila izvedena na seriji maksimalnih letnih pretokov izmerjenih na merilni postaji na kraškem izviru Kazani v obdobju 51 let (1961-2011). Glede na rezultate testa kumulativnih odklonov (Q = 1,531) in testa SNHT ( = 10,543) je časovna serija nehomogena. Po prilagoditvi letnih maksimalnih pretokov pred letom spremembe (1995) z uporabo programske opreme AnClim je bila izvedena frekvenčna analiza z uporabo štirih verjetnostnih porazdelitev. Dobljeni rezultati kažejo na verjetnost pojava poplav na kraškem izviru za različne povratne dobe. Po izračunu so bile z uporabo grafičnih in statističnih primerjav med empirično in teoretično razporeditvijo podatkov določene porazdelitve z najboljšim ujemanjem. Ker je izvir naravna vrednota in pomemben vir za družbo, je zelo pomembno izbrati ustrezno verjetnostno porazdelitev za maksimalne letne pretoke kraškega izvira Kazani. Zato je bila izvedena primerjava z uporabo grafičnih in statističnih testov (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, χ2 in Anderson-Darling). Najboljše ujemanje glede na te tri teste je bilo doseženo pri Gumbelovi porazdelitvi z maksimalnim letnim pretokom 4,54 m3/s za povratno dobo 10 let, 6,06 m3/s za povratno dobo 100 let in 7,56 m3/s za povratno dobo 1000 let.Ključne besede: kraški izvir, maksimalni letni pretok, hidrologija, homogenost, frekvenčna analiza.",

Pri gradbenih delih so se razkrile tudi podtalne škraplje ter jame. Izjemnih oblik so tiste, ki so nastale v dnu podolij in ki jih podtalne vode pogosto poplavijo. Imajo povsem svojevrsten, kot vemo tokrat prvič opisani skalni relief. Stare jame, skozi katere so se nekoč pretakali vodni tokovi, pričajo o znižanju gladine podzemeljske vode, ki površje dosega le v najnižjih podoljih ter o verjetnem tektonsko pogojenem členjenju kraškega površja. Dobršen del jam je zapolnjen z drobnozrnato naplavino in pod njo tudi preoblikovan. Oblikovanje špranjastih jam, ki so večinoma ob navpičnih razpokah, pa bi lahko opredelili kot podtalno. Razkrivajo se nam značilnosti plitkega in z naplavinami pokritega krasa, kjer je podzemeljska voda blizu površja. Te značilnosti bi bilo potrebno kar v največji meri upoštevati pri nadaljnjih poseganjih v kras, saj so nam na prvi pogled skrite, vsakršno poseganje v kras pa nam jih razkrije. Mnogi kraški pojavi predvsem jame, podtalne škraplje ali kamniti gozdovi so vredni, da jih zaščitimo in ohranimo. The most conspicuous karst formations uncovered at the bottom of morphologic depressions or uvalas along the motorway route include swallow holes and estavelles. Also uncovered during the construction were underground karrens and caves of exquisite shapes, situated at valley bottoms and often flooded by groundwater. They have a specific rock relief that, to the best of our knowledge, is now described for the first time. Old caves through which streams were once flowing testify to the lowering of the level of groundwater, which reaches the surface only in the lowest-lying valleys, and to probable tectonic dissection of the karst surface. A good part of the caves are filled with fine-grained sediment and have been transformed underneath it. The shaping of fissure caves, located predominantly along vertical fissures, can be defined as having occurred subterraneously. They exhibit features of a shallow, sediment-covered karst where groundwater is close to the surface. These features are not visible at first sight, but they become apparent at any encroachment on karst and should therefore be taken fully into account in any such activity in the future. Many karst formations, above all caves, underground karrens or stone forests, are worthy of protection and preservation",

    "abstract": "Namen članka je pokazati, da ne obstoji samo prostorska domena, kjer podzemske kraške oblike sistematično prehajajo v nekaj drugega in izginjajo, ampak tudi, da lahko na osnovi tega znanja kraške votline trdneje vpnemo v logični okvir geospeleološkega prostora/časa. Prava kraška jama je vsaka podzemska kraška oblika, ki je nastala kot posledica odnašanja mase v raztopini, ob pogoju, da je trajekrotorija vodnega toka, ki jo je izoblikoval, tekla skozi (jamo), ne glede na njene izmere. Speleogenetski prostor definiramo v tem kontekstu kot tisti del Zemljine skorje, v katerem lahko nastajajo kraške jame. Tedaj je zakrasela kamninska masa aktiviran speleogenetski prostor. Zaradi denudacije in zniževanja gladine podtalnice se zdi, da posamezna jama po speleogentskem prostoru potuje navzgor, dokler ne doseže površja. Kraška denudacija deluje navpično in prizadeva matično kamnino znotraj cele vrhnje plasti, isto pa seveda velja za vse oblike znotraj kamnine. Zato lahko uvedemo pojem speleotanske cone. Znotraj nje je napadena vsa kamnina, na vsaki možni površini in končna posledica je njeno popolno izničenje. Slično razgradnjo bodo v stiku z agresivno vodo doživele vse strukture v kamnini, ne glede na izvor. Glede na značilno oblikovanje/razgrajevanje kraških votlin lahko znotraj spelogenetskega prostora definiramo tri speleoformativne/de-formativne cone.The point of this paper is to demonstrate that not only the spatial domain where underground karst phenomena are being systematically transformed exist but also that this knowledge makes the role of caves within the geospeleological space/time more consistent. A true cave is any underground karst feature resulting from mass removal, regardless of its dimensions provided that the trajectory of the formative water passes through the cave and that the mass is removed in liquid phase (solution). Speleogenetic space is defined as that portion of the Earth’s crust within which karst caverns may be formed. Thus, a karstified rock mass is defined as activated speleogenetic space. Due to the effects of denudation and watertable lowering, as the time passes a single cave seems to move upwards through speleogentic space, until it reaches the surface. The denudational logic of the karst surface is vertical, and the rock suffers disintegration throughout the thickness of its outermost layers. The same argument applies also to in-rock features. Consequently, the idea of the speleothanatic zone is introduced. Within it all of the rock is attacked, on any possible surface, and the final result is its complete annihilation. It may be expected that all structures, of any origin, that expose the rock surface to contact with aggressive water, will evolve via some “speleothanatic” progression. It is demonstrated that three vertical zones of specific formative/de-formative processes exist within speleogenetic space.",

    "abstract": "The lengths of the Slovenian caves follow the power-law distribution through several orders of magnitude, which implies that the caves can be considered as natural fractal objects. Fractal dimensions obtained from distribution of all caves are about 1.07, and vary within different tectonic and hydrogeological units. Some deviations from the ideal best fit line in log-log plots (i.e. lower and upper cut-off limits) can be explained by underestimation, as many very short caves are not registered. The study of tectonic and hydrogeological setting indicates that the greatest dimensions occur in the rocks with karstic-fracture and fracture porosity and the lowest in low-permeability rocks. Proximity to major tectonic structures shows a detectable effect on the cave length distribution, and the influence is greatest for the caves closer to the faults and thrust fronts. Dimensions are lower than those of fracture networks and faults, which can be most probably explained by flow channeling along the fracture networks, which causes the decrease of fractal dimension. The physical causes of power law scaling and variations in fractal dimensions (power law exponents) are still poorly understood, but the behaviour of fracture networks is believed to be caused by a scale-independent fractal fragmentation of the blocks, and during the process of forming the caves inherit some fractal geometrical properties of the networks.",

The sinkholes array in the valley shows that their formation and location is influenced by active faults. As a result of active faults mechanism, a number of young and old dolines have been formed on north and south of the study area. Ac­cording to Aerial Photographs, Satellite images and geological logs corelation three major active faults were distingushed in the study area specially under Lar dam structure. Two of the faults are elongated to the north and the one extends to the south, seven sinkholes were formed on faults. Based on the available evidences, it is assumed that the formation and array of dolines in the study area has been formed and controlled by active faults. Conversely , it is deduced that faults activity may be determinated by sinkholes formation and array. This results may be applied for the similar cases of world's karstic belt.",

    "abstract": "With the intention of reconstructing Late Pleistocene – Holocene sea-level changes along the Eastern Adriatic coast, a series of speleothems were collected from several submerged caves and pits, in order to constrain periods of their deposition and ceased growth related to sea-level fluctuations. For that purpose, stalagmites provide more reliable records than stalactites, due to their successive layers deposited perpendicularly to the growth direction. Therefore, stalagmites have been collected preferably. But, two of 17 speleothems displayed unexpected interior morphology – speleothem L-1 collected at the depth of 1.5 m in Medvjeđa spilja Cave on Lošinj Island, and speleothem M-25 from Pit near Iški Mrtovnjak Islet collected at the depth of 25 m. Both of the samples were taken from the cave floor, in the growth position of the stalagmite. But the insight into the perpendicular cut with evident central tube revealed their true (stalactitic) origin and additional confirmations were obtained by longitudinal cut and U-Th and 14C dating. Just as the causes of their breakdowns were probably different, so were their falls; speleothem M 25 (together with several other speleothems around it) stuck in the marine sediment in its primary position, while L-1 turned upside-down and even continued crystallizing during the lower sea level. These events are possible in the continental caves, as well. Evidently, it is much easier to recognize and avoid these problems in air-filled caves than in the submarine ones where the speleothems are almost always covered with marine overgrowth, which disguises their outer morphology. Additionally, the bases of the stalagmites are also sometimes covered with marine sediment, which makes correct estimation rather difficult.",

    "abstract": "Dissolution of calcium carbonate in the saltwater-freshwater mixing zone of coastal carbonate aquifers up to now has been treated by coupling geochemical equilibrium codes to a reactive-transport model. The result is a complex nonlinear coupled set of differential transport-advection equations, which need high computational efforts. However, if dissolution rates of calcite are sufficiently fast, such that one can assume the solution to be in equilibrium with respect to calcite a highly simplified modelling approach can be used. To calculate initial changes of porosity in the rock matrix one only needs to solve the advection-transport equation for salinity s in the freshwater lens and its transition zone below the island. Current codes on density driven flow such as SEAWAT can be used. To obtain the dissolution capacity of the mixed saltwater-freshwater solutions the calcium equilibrium concentration ceq(s) is obtained as a function of salinity by PHREEQC-2. Initial porosity changes can then be calculated by a simple analytical expression of the gradient of the spatial distribution s(x, y) of salinity, the distribution of flow fluxes q(x,y) and the second derivative of the calcium equilibrium concentration ceq(s) with respect to salinity s. This modelling approach is employed to porosity evolution in homogeneous and heterogeneous carbonate islands and coastal aquifers. The geometrical patterns of porosity changes and the reasons of their origin will be discussed in detail. The results reveal initial changes of porosity in the order of several 10-6 per year. This places the time scale of cavern evolution to orders from several tens of thousands to a hundred thousand years.",

They registered summer periods lasting several months when all the rainfall, even more abundant, is stored in a vadose zone. After a longer dry period the first discharge reactions of trickles to rainfall strongly differ while there is no substantial difference in a wet period. The water outflow in decreasing parts of water pulses essentially differs among various trickles and we recognised the types of trickles feeding karst aquifers even during low water level or low discahrges of karst springs.",

Stability requirements along the visitor’s path in the cave called for permanent checks of pos­sible rock movements in the massif, while mining operations in the neighbouring marble quarry represented major threat to cave stability. Precise levelling network for vertical movements in the cave and its vicinity was established about 20 years ago. Outside the cave in the Kle¶nica River valley levelling traverses were crossing tectonic faults. Periodical measurements have been repeated since 1984. In the cave two fault zones of major risk have been checked also with TM-71 crack gauges and re­cords have been taken with a month frequency. These two were the tectonic crack zones of the Water Corridor and the main fault structure of the cave found in the Cascade Alley. Fourteen years ago after finding that quarry blasts induced increased movements in the cave, quarry operations were stopped. Re­cently, gradual subsidence of some levelling bench-marks was observed, as well as some periods of increased micro-displace­ments on the tectonic crack zones. Such observations are dis­cussed.",

    "abstract": "The complex discharge hydrographfor Big Spring, Missouri, can be described as the sum of two terms governed by Darcy’s Law. The dominant, long-term component is proportional to the regional hydraulic gradient, and constitutes about 80% of the average flow of 12.6 m3/s. Superimposed on this is a tran­sient component witha time-constant of about 1.5 days that represents the Darcian response to sharp, rainfall-driven pulses on the head of the shallow groundwater system. This tran­sient component delivers about 20% of the average total flow, but over short intervals can exceed the long-term component. However, the long-term component is so large that the ratio of record highflows to the average flow is only about 4x for Big Spring, and 1.5 to 4.5x for most other large Ozark springs; for comparison, this ratio is 10 to 3000x for most surface streams in Missouri. The strong correlation between the discharge of the large springs and the head in the Ozark aquifer permits the extension of the Darcian rainfall-runoff model to predict groundwater levels in wells.",

    "abstract": "Karst spring hydrograph separation method based on quick iterative solution of several simple exponential and linear equations, was developed for linking small datasets of sam­ples to various hydrologic situations. The method is based on a presumption, that a spring’s discharge depends on the level of aquifer saturation by groundwater, and that the same dis­charge reflects the same groundwater saturation (piezometric level) in the aquifer. Every spring can be described by unique sets of constant starting discharges, Q0 values, recession coef­ficients α (laminar flow components in exponential equations), and β (turbulent flow components in linear equations). Eachsubregime can be detected by recession curve analyses of the complete spring’s discharge time series. In this hydrographseparation, every measured discharge value, Qt, is then deter­mined by a representative time, t; i.e., theoretical elapsed time t from the total maximum discharge value Qmax. The aim of the iteration process is to obtain this representative time t for eachdischarge. The individual flow components are calculated us­ing the same t value. These variances in subregime discharges in a certain moment can be linked to the components analysed in the same moment, in order to obtain the end members of the theoretical mixture. This technique was developed and ap­plied on the discharge time series of the four karstic springs in the Brezovské Karpaty Mts. (Slovakia), built mainly by karsti­fied Middle and Upper Triassic dolomites and limestones. Groundwater of individual springs were characterised by δ18O (SMOW) and groundwater temperature values and end mem­bers of two laminar and one turbulent subregimes were calcu­lated. Results were based on sparsely populated datasets and manual discharge records, but represent a perspective method for future development and interpretations on limited dataset results.",

These numerous residual relief forms are so perfectly symmetrical that, in order to explain their existence, natural explanations are systematically sidelined by legends, myths and many so-called “scientific” explanations. The object of many television broadcasts related to travel, these karst hills are a particularly original example of mogotes tropical karst; their almost “perfect” aspect had intrigued those who have studied their formation and have given birth to many hypotheses. The genesis of the “Chocolate Hills” is due to the emergence of the Pliocene limestone coralline platform, then to its karstification in a particularly homogeneous tropical climate conditions: rainfall, temperature, wind, pedologic and vegetable covers. In other aspects, their good overall porosity explains their mass impregnation by the runoffs as well as the appearance of important aquifers, exploited for the development of irrigated rice fields. Karst models are present, notably the caves and underground networks of which very few have been explored. Finally this original context (insularity, virgin tropical forest undisturbed for a long time) permitted the sustainability of a particularly original endemic fauna including the famous Bohol tarsier. In June 1998 the “Chocolate Hills” were declared the National Geologic Monument and this national park definitely merits a visit.",

This study was undertaken for the characterization and conceptualization of the hydrogeological behavior of a unique example of the dissected relict karst aquifer, which is known as the Harmanköy-Beyyayla Karst System (HBKS) in Central Turkey. In order to obtain the conceptualization of the HBKS, properties of recharge, flow, storage, and discharge was analyzed. The contribution of allogenic-point recharge to the Beyyayla and Döşkaya aquifers occurs from the Beyyayla and Tozman sinkhole with approximately 85% of total recharge. The rest of the recharge takes place as autogenic-diffuse/point type from the limestone rock-mass. The recharge on the Nardın aquifer originates from direct precipitation onto the limestone area mainly as autogenic-diffuse and, to lesser extent, as autogenic-point. Groundwater flow occurs as conduit flow at the Beyyayla and Döşkaya aquifers and as dispersed flow at the Nardın aquifer. The evaluation of all parameters shows that the HBKS can be divided into three distinct sub-catchments, namely, the Beyyayla, Döşkaya, and Nardın, while it has two different hydrogeological system so Beyyayla and Döşkaya have similar characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Karst aquifer phreatic zones are energy limited habitats supported by organic matter (OM) flow across physical and geochemical boundaries. Photosynthetic OM enters the Edwards Aquifer of Central Texas via streams sinking along its northeastern border. The southeastern boundary is marked by a rapid transition between oxygenated freshwaters and anoxic saline waters where OM is likely produced by chemolithoautotrophic microbes. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in OM composition at these boundaries was investigated using isotopic and geochemical analyses. δ13C values for stream fine particulate OM (FPOM) (−33.34‰ to −11.47‰) decreased during regional drought between fall 2010 and spring 2012 (p&lt;0.001), and were positively related to FPOM C:N ratios (r2=0.47, p&lt;0.001), possibly due to an increasing contribution of periphyton. Along the freshwater-saline water interface (FWSWI), δ13CFPOMvalues (−7.23‰ to −58.18‰) correlated to δ13C values for dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13CDIC) (−0.55‰ to −7.91‰) (r2=0.33, p=0.005) and were depleted relative to δ13CDIC values by 28.44‰, similar to fractionation values attributed to chemolithoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways using DIC as the substrate. δ13CFPOMvalues also became enriched through time (p&lt;0.001), and δ13CDIC values (r2=0.43, p&lt;0.001) and δ13CFPOM values (r2=0.35, p=0.004) at FWSWI sites increased with distance along the southwest-northeast flowpath of the aquifer. Spatial variability in FWSWI δ13CDIC values is likely due to variable sources of acidity driving carbonate dissolution, and the temporal relationship is explained by changes to recharge and aquifer level that affected transport of chemolithoautotrophic OM across the FWSWI.Keywords: Carbon stable isotopes, spatial and temporal variability, chemolithoautotrophic production, allochthonous input, karst.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.666",

    "abstract": "During heavy rainfalls between September 17 and 19, 2010 large part of Slovenia has suffered extensive floods that last for nearly two weeks. For the river Iška record discharge of 59.3 m3/s was measured on September 19 on the gauging station in Iška vas located at the southern rim of Ljubljansko barje. In the first hour of September 21, 2010 two weak earthquakes (ML=0.6 and ML=0.2) occurred within one minute near Iška vas. They were felt by some inhabitants who reported also a rumbling noise (brontides). During the flood recession period, the water of river Iška started to sink into the gravely stream bed or rocky left banks and the gauging profile completely dried on September 23, day and a half after the first earthquake. Water reappeared again on September 25. In the period September 21 − October 4 additional seven weak earthquakes occurred in the same area. All earthquakes from this series occurred at or near the surface and deviate in hypocentral depth from the seismicity pattern characteristic for the southern rim of Ljubljansko barje, which was analysed for comparison. The epicentres of the first two earthquakes are in good agreement with the location of the dried river bed. It is therefore probable that both phenomena are related. Analyses of seismograms have shown that it is not likely that the observed events are collapse earthquakes, but they are tectonic events. Although earthquakes were relatively weak, it seems that they could be accompanied by small near-surface tectonic movements, because they occurred at the position of a known fault. These movements are probably connected to the opening of pre-existing fissures in the karstified valley bottom, although the primary reason for sinking of the river is that high waters removed the clogged river bed that enables intensive sinking into the river bottom during the flood.",

    "abstract": "The high mountain karren rock relief reveals the manner of the formation of the mountain karst surface in the northwestern part of Yunnan at altitudes between 4,000 and 4,600 m. Two dominant factors, snow and rain, decisively influence the formation of the majority of rock forms; in places, particularly on the Shika Snow Mountain, two additional factors are subsoil corrosion and water trickling from overgrown surfaces. Biocorrosion is important for the fine dissection of the rock. Sub-snow rock forms dominate in places where the rock has been covered by snow for a longer period. These are primarily the gently sloping sunless parts of the karren, the lower parts or lower walls of karren, and fissures. Gently sloping sunless parts of the karren are often dissected in various ways so there are sub-snow forms on their lower parts and rock forms carved by rainwater on the higher parts, peaks, and ridges. Rain rock forms dominate on sunny surfaces and parts of the rock that are steep, located higher above the floor, and covered by only a thin layer of snow. The relief and individual rock forms are also influenced by the fissuring and the recrystallization of rock characteristic of the Shika Snow Mountain. The rock masses on the Yulong Snow Mountain are larger and its rock forms have more regular shapes. On the Shika Snow Mountain, rock recrystallization has an important influence on the rock forms, causing fine diversities and often jagged edges of rock forms. By this feature of rock forms and the frequent and originally subsoil rock formation on the Shika Snow Mountain we can distinguish the two described areas of mountain karren. In both mountain areas, the basic characteristics are the same and unique. The rock relief of the mountain karren described in this paper is predominantly dictated by the wider climate and microclimate conditions, the form of precipitation, the alternation of snow and rain, the distribution of precipitation, and the solar exposure of the karren.",

These LTDs located on the floor in the central region of this trough display spectral signature of gypsum and are characterised by the widespread presence of shallow depression morphologies. We performed a morphologic and morphometric analysis of the surfaces of these LTDs through an integrated study of images available through the Reconnaissance Mars Orbiter High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment with the aim to describe, for the first time, these landforms, and to discuss their possible origins and lithological and paleo-climatic significance. Analysis, on the basis of the characteristics of the investigated landforms and the similarities of features on Earth and Mars, and after discarding other possible origins, revealed that the examined Martian landforms have karst origin. The landform features appear to reflect water-related processes, probably due to ice melting formed during periods of ice-snow-rich deposition from the atmosphere as the result of changes in the obliquity of Mars, which could have driven the processes of dissolution or collapse on the evaporite rock. Thus, the observed karst landforms suggest a climate change and the presence of liquid water due to ice melting during the Late Amazonian age.Key words: karst, gypsum, shallow depressions, climate change, Noctis Labyrinthus, Mars.",

Karstification periods occurred during the end of the Pliocene, in major part of the Pleistocene, and in the Holocene. The first period of karstification can be observed in the lower Daito dolomitized limestone (5 Ma and 4 Ma); the karstification seems to have occurred as a result of sea level change caused by the cooler conditions of the paleoclimatic environment. Geological studies were performed to study reef carbonates in detail. Among them, biointrasparite limestone of framestone and bafflestone types with transitions to grainstone and dolomitized biointrasparry limestone of framestone and bafflestone types dominate. Calcimetric analyses established that in certain locations the distribution of limestone and dolomite differs from the distribution previously described.

    "abstract": "The Julian Alps are composed almost exclusively of Triassic to Lower Jurassic carbonates, which results in a karstified high-al­pine landscape. In such settings, large water accumulations are not expected and precipitated water drains vertically, gathers in deep, large-scale aquifers, and outflows in large karstic springs located in deeply incised valleys. Some small lakes, however, exist in high alpine areas. Most commonly, they formed above impermeable glacial sediments and are generally characterized by stagnant waters. Jezero v Ledvicah lake, which is one of the seven lakes in the Triglav Lakes Valley, is an exception, because it shows high subaqueous water inflow and outflow and occurs among highly karstified and permeable carbonates. Combining previous research with our new, detailed geological mapping of the lake surroundings and sedimentary research on the Lower Jurassic strata, we propose a hydrogeological model with the aim of explaining the extraordinary behaviour of the lake. We propose that Jezero v Ledvicah lake: A) is part of the “gutter-shaped” aquifer with perched groundwater that is situated below the floor of the Triglav Lakes Valley; B) barriers of the aquifer are structural (faults and thrust) and stratigraphic (clay interlayers in Lower Jurassic limestone); C) the lake formed in a structural, hydrogeological and morphological depression within this aquifer; D) the groundwater of the aquifer is re­charged not solely from the surface directly above the aquifer but additionally by subterraneous inflow from the overlying Slatna Nappe aquifer; and E) groundwater outflows from the aquifer at the southern end of the Triglav Lakes Valley, where the Lower Jurassic limestone pinches out.Key words: high-alpine lake, karstic aquifer, Julian Alps, Triglav Lakes Valley, Jurassic limestone, Southern Alps.Nastanek Jezera v Ledvicah – globel v žlebu podobnem kraškem vodonosniku (Julijske Alpe, SZ Slovenija)Julijske Alpe skoraj v celoti sestavljajo triasni in jurski karbonati, kar se odraža v morfologiji kraške visokogorske pokrajine. V tovrstnih razmerah ni pričakovati večjih površinskih pojavov vode, saj padavinska voda pronica vertikalno in se akumulira v obsežnih globokih vodonosnikih, iz teh pa izteka v izdatnih kraških izvirih, ki so v globoko vrezanih dolinah. Kljub temu v alpskem visokogorju obstaja nekaj manjših jezer. Večina jih je nastala nad neprepustnimi ledeniškimi sedimenti in jih lahko opredelimo kot stoječe vode. Jezero v Ledvicah, ki je eno izmed sedmih jezer v dolini Triglavskih jezer, je izjema, saj ima močno podzemno napajanje in iztok (je pretočno) ter se pojavlja med močno zakraselimi in prepustnimi karbonati. Na podlagi predhodnih raziskav, izdelave nove geološke karte okolice jezera in sedimentoloških raziskav spodnjejurskih plasti predlagamo strukturno-geološki in hidrogeološki model, da bi razložili nastanek in lokacijo jezera. Naše ugotovitve kažejo, da je A) Jezero v Ledvicah del žlebu podobnega vodonosnika z visečo podzemno vodo, ki se pojavlja v jurskih plasteh pod dnom doline Triglavskih jezer, B) da so hidrogeološke bariere vodonosnika strukturne (prelomi in nariv) in stratigrafske (plasti gline v spodnjejurskem apnencu), C) da je jezero nastalo v strukturni, hidrogeološki in morfološki depresiji znotraj vodonosnika, D) da se podzemna voda ne napaja izključno iz padavin, ki padejo neposredno na površino vodonosnika, ampak dodatno s podzemnim napajanjem iz višje ležečega vodonosnika Slatenske tektonske krpe in E) da podzemna voda izteka iz vodonosnika na južnem delu doline Triglavskih jezer, kjer se plastnati spodnjejurski apnenci (in s tem vodonosnik) izklinjajo.Ključne besede: visokogorsko jezero, kraški vodonosnik, Julijske Alpe, dolina Triglavskih jezer, jurski apnenec, Južne Alpe.",

    "abstract": "Ceiling channels belong to specific geomorphological forms occurring only in caves. Their origin has been commonly connected with the paragenesis. According to review articles, the terms of ceiling channel and paragenesis were defined by Philippe Renault (1958) for the first time. Nevertheless, Zdeněk Roth in his study of morphology and geomorphological evolution of the Domica Cave (southern Slovakia) published in 1937 (in Czech with long French summary) not only described ceiling channels, but he presented also their definition. Roth and other authors used the term later in describing features of several caves in Slovakia and Hungary. Based on original Roth observations, Josef Kunský defined the term generally in his textbook (1950 in Czech, 1956 in Polish and 1958 in French). The description of paragenetic ceiling channels by Renault (1958) can be considered as the first one only in Western European karstology literature.",

    "abstract": "An area of 417 km2 in southeastern Brazil was mapped in detail regarding karst features in quartzite. Landforms typically assigned to carbonate karst terrains are largely absent, except for discrete occurrences of towers and collapse dolines. Caves are the most conspicuous landform, although occurring at a lower density than in most Brazilian carbonate areas. A total of 11 caves were mapped and studied in detail. Caves tend to develop at shallow depths parallel to the slope surface, controlled by lithological facies and the hydraulic gradient. Petrographical analyses suggest that mica (sericite) lenses within the quartzite and both sericite and iron around quartz grains may favour grain disaggregation and later erosional removal in a shallow phreatic environment. Quartzite caves represent a common feature in southeastern Brazil but tend to be isolated features rather than an integrated and areally extensive hydrological system typical of many carbonate settings.",

Detailed structural geological mapping of fissure orientation of selected caves and of Shilin stone forest was accomplished and presented by rose diagrams. Regional geological structures were compared with statistical evaluation of structural geological elements obtained from field mapping. There is a good correlation between surface and underground fissure orientation and cave passages orientation with regionally important fault zones, with Xiaojiang Fault (N-S direction) and Red River Fault (NW-SE direction). The most frequent cave passages orientation, in a nearly N-S direction, is connected with nearly E-W compression and nearly N-S extension from late Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene. The second tectonic stage from late-Pleistocene to the present, with the tectonic stress field mainly of NNW-SSE compression and NEE-SWW extension is in accordance with the most frequent fissure orientations in Shilin stone forest in the direction N20-30°W (11.4%).",

    "abstract": "Cave-dwelling animals can be classified based on their occurrence in and relationship to the subterranean environment. However, subsurface distribution data and studies addressing the initial causes for animals to enter underground habitats are sparse. By retrieving occurrence data from two voluntary biospeleological land registers in Central Germany, the degree of cave penetration in terrestrial gastropods was investigated, thus to infer potential evolutionary drivers. In total, 66 identified gastropod species entered the subterranean environment with 23 of the species also recorded from the dark zone. Gastropods possessed variable degrees of cave penetration and no obligate cave forms were observed. A decline of occurrence records from the entrance to the dark zone was the most prominent pattern. Nevertheless, several species were collected from all three light zones (i.e. entrance, transition and dark). A variety of potential reasons can be inferred to explain their subsurface appearance: exploitation of alternative food sources, aphotic above-ground movement, mating sites, temporal, seasonal and long-term refugia, and chance. Moreover, the results imply a frequent migration of species between the interconnected light zones and the surface. Consequently, terrestrial gastropods should be considered when investigating the origin and importation of allochthonous resources in caves.",

In addition, the carbon loss and CO2 exchange flux at the water-gas interface were also estimated. The results showed that the pH value and DO in the stream varied regularly on a daily basis with the temperature of stream water, suggesting that the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and algae is the controlling factor for the diel variations of the pH and DO. During the monitoring period, while the DIC (mainly in HCO3−) input (at spring) was relatively stable at about 4.46 mmol L−1, the concentrations of HCO3− and Ca2+ at downstream showed a diel cycle of daytime decrease and nighttime increase, with an amplitude of 22.4 %. We also found out that the CO2 degassing mainly occurred in the upper reach of the surface stream right after groundwater is exposed to the surface. The total CO2 exchange flux of the entire monitoring stream section was calculated to be 29.83 kg d−1, accounting for 17.8 % of the DIC loss, which means that approximately 4/5 of the loss was converted into organic carbon or calcite precipitation. Compared with the total carbon input at spring, this carbon loss only accounts for 6.5 % of the total carbon amount (1.4 % of which was converted into organic carbon and 1.1 % of which was degassed to the atmosphere), indicating that the DIC of karst groundwater in low order surface stream of Guancun is stable in general, with 1 % being lost to the atmosphere. This suggests that on a daily timescale, carbon loss in the form of CO2 of low order karst streams with lower gradient is much less pronounced.Key words: inorganic carbon cycle, spring-fed stream, aquatic vegetation photosynthesis, CO2 degassing, inorganic carbon flux, karst.",

Če kraška voda ni onesnažena zaradi slanih dom, je v tem delu Irana njena električna prevodnost pod 500 µS cm-1. Področje raziskav je južno krilo antiklinale Shahneshin-Milk, 200 km vzhodno od Shiraza, ki sodi v narivno cono Zagrosa. Kraška formacija Tarbur (zgornji Campanij-Maastrichtij) izdanja v južnem krilu antiklinale Shahneshin-Milk, pod katero je neprepustna radiolaritna formacija. Solna doma Darab izdanja znotraj zakrasele formacije Tarbur. Iz formacije Tarbur priteka več izvirov. Kvaliteta vode vseh izvirov je v mejah neonesnažene kraške vode razen treh, ki so v bližini solne dome. Električna prevodnost teh treh izvirov je med 1200 in 2000 µS cm-1. Del aluvija okoli solne dome je slano močvirje, ki ga obrobljata dva kanala. Električna prevodnost močvirske vode pod nivojem talne vode je okoli 1400 µS cm-1, v večjih globinah pa se zmanjša na 400 µS cm-1. Odtok s solne dome Darab in prenikanje vode nizke kakovosti iz kanala sta najbrž glavna vzroka za nastanek slanega močvirja. Pomemben delež onesnažene kraške vode iz Tarburja ne teče proti močvirju, saj, prvič, večina kraške vode iz Tarburja priteka na dan skozi izvire, in drugič, na globlje plasti aluvijalnega vodonosnika onesnažena voda ne vpliva.Karstified carbonate formations are among the most important water resources in the south-central regions of Iran. If the karst water is not contaminated by salt domes, the electrical conductivity of water in the karst aquifer is less than 500 µS cm-1 in the south-center of Iran. The study area is located in the southern flank of Shahneshin-Milk anticline, 200 km east of Shiraz. This region is situated in the Zagros Thrust Zone. The Tarbur karstic formation (Late Campanian-Maastrichtian) is outcropped on the southern flank of the Shahneshin-Milk anticline which is underlain by the impermeable Radiolarite formation. The Darab salt dome outcrops inside the karstified Tarbur Formation. Several springs emerge from the Tarbur Formation. The quality of all springs is in the range of unpolluted karst water except for three springs which are located near the Darab salt dome. The electrical conductivity of these springs range from 1200 to 2000 µS cm-1. Part of the alluvium near the Darab salt dome is salt-marsh which is bounded by two channels. The electrical conductivity in the salt-marsh below the water table is about 1400 µS cm-1, and it reduces to 400 µS cm-1 at the lower depths. Run-off from the Darab salt dome and seepage from the channel with low quality water are probably the main reasons of salt-marsh development. A considerable amount of polluted Tarbur karst water does not flow towards the marshland because, firstly, most of the Tarbur karst water discharges from the springs, and secondly, the alluvium aquifer is not affected by polluted water at lower depths.",

He dedicated a lot of time to the research of the underground world by describing subterranean rivers and lakes as water resources. He also made ground plans of some caves, marked their entrances and described different shapes of speleothems. He first described different ways of climbing in caves and methods for cave research. Altogether he visited over 300 caves. Xu Xiake first described different types of the tropical karst and focused on the characteristics and reasons of the tower hills origin. He introduced the term fenglin (peak forest), which is still used in the scientific literature.

Ker je nevarnost izlitja vedno navzoča, je prav, da upravniki vodnih virov predvidijo scenarije onesnaženja še preden se to v resnici zgodi. Različne scenarije vnosa polutantov v kras lahko predvidimo z uporabo že znanih podatkov in meritev v vodonosniku. Napoved širjenja polutantov je najbolj zanesljiva, če temelji na rezultatih številnih sledenj med različnimi vhodnimi in izhodnimi točkami. Na ta način lahko primerne tranportne parametre določimo z analizo krivulj koncentracij. S kombiniranjem različnih krivulj in uporabo ustrezne aproksimacijske metode, lahko razultate združimo v eno samo krivuljo koncentracij, ki jo uporabimo za predvidenje širjenja polutantov. Širjenje polutantov lahko napovemo tudi z uporabo osnovnih tranportnih parametrov, ki veljajo za kraške prevodnike in ustreznih transportnih enačb. Rezultat so krivulje koncentracij, ki jih tudi uporabimo za napoved posledic možnega vnosa polutantov v kras. Obe metodi smo preizkusili na namišljenem vnosu polutantov v kraški kanal in pri obeh dobili sprejemljive rezultate. Metoda, ki temelji na uporabi transportnih enačb, se je izkazala za boljšo pri oceni potovalnega časa in koncentracije, ki smo ji izpostavljeni. Poleg tega je pri tej metodi delež povrnjenega sledila večji.Contaminant releases in karstic terranes can cause rapid and devastating affects on drinking-water supplies. Because future contaminant releases are likely it is necessary that local water managers develop release scenarios so as to be prepared prior to an actual contaminant release occurring. Release scenarios may be forecasted using appropriate historical data or they may be predicted using selected measured parameters. Forecasting contaminant releases to drinking-water supplies in karstic terranes is best accomplished by conducting numerous tracer tests from each potential source location to each exposure point so that acceptable solute-transport parameters for each solution conduit may be estimated from analyses of the breakthrough curves. Compositing the numerous breakthrough curves and fitting a quintic spline allows development of a single representative breakthrough curve that may then be used to forecast the effects of a release. Predicting contaminant releases is accomplished by combining basic measured field parameters for selected solution conduits in functional relationships for application in solute-transport models. The resulting breakthrough curve and solute-transport parameters can be used to predict the effects of a release. The forecasting and prediction methodologies were tested using a hypothetical release into a solution conduit developed in a karstic aquifer. Both methods were shown to produce reasonably acceptable results. The prediction methodology produced better time-of-travel results and better mass recovery and exposure concentration results than did the forecasting methodology.",

Naravni površinski ali podzemeljski relief sta bila deloma ali v celoti uničena; nastal je nov tip reliefa; geološko okolje je bilo spremenjeno; nastale so spremembe v količini odtoka in v smeri površinskega in podzemeljskega odtekanja kraške vode; nastali so gravitacijski tipi močvirij; kraške jame, lokalni tektonski jarki, prihajalo je do podorov in zemeljskih plazov in ozemlje je bilo podvrženo grezanju in uničenju; spremenjeno je bilo ekološko ravnotežje urbaniziranih pokrajin. V pričujočem delu je govora o različnih paleoseizmičnih pojavih na krasu v Bolgariji in v Maroku. Na podlagi preučevanja tektonskih premikov so dana priporočila za varstvo teh ozemelj.During the recent years there has been a growing interest in recording and investigating the effects of paleoseismic events in surface and underground karst in almost all countries. Karst represents a reliable reference marker for understanding the potential seismicity in regions with instrumentally established low to moderate seismicity. The karst terrains in Bulgaria and Morocco occupy considerable areas. The disturbances in surface and underground karst had usually been provoked by catastrophic one-act events or by repeatedly activated movements by earthquakes. The catastrophic seismic events had disturbed the naturally interrelated karst ecosystems and were the reason for rejuvenation, reactivation or attenuation of karst processes. The natural surface and underground relief had been partially or entirely destroyed; a new type of relief had been formed; the geological environment had been disturbed; changes occurred in the flowrate and direction of surface and underground karst water; wetlands of the gravitation type had been formed; natural caves, local grabens, rock-falls and landslides collapsed partially or entirely and terrains were subjected to subsidence and destruction; the ecological balance in urbanized territories had been disturbed. The present work considers the different types of paleoseismic phenomena in the karst terrains in Bulgaria and Morocco. Recommendations are given for the protection of these areas.",

An expert bases for their protection are vulnerability maps. Different methods for the construction of these maps were developed, and to assess the vulnerability of the recharge area of the Korentan spring near Postojna the EPIK method was used. In this method, which was many times successfully tested on karst, the degree of vulnerabilty is defined on the basis of four parameters: developement of the epikarst, effectiveness of the protective cover, infiltration conditions, and development of the karst network. For the assessment of individual parameters different research methods were used, such as detailed structural-lithological and geomorphological mapping, and combined analysis of hydraulic and physico-chemical responses of the spring to recharge events. Final result is the vulnerability map, which defines the areas of very high, high and moderate vulnerability within the recharge area of the Korentan spring and can be used to set up the protection zones.",

It presents inseparable unit consisting of Pantan spring, river course with surrounding swamp area and sea coast. Particularity of the area is swamp which is unique example in this part of the eastern Adriatic coast mostly characterized by dry karst areas. Main characteristic of the spring is periodical salinity during the year with the highest salinity during summer months. Spring presents potential drinking water source under consumption that salinization problem is solved. Unfortunately due to bed watershed management water quality of Pantan spring and environment of Pantan area is highly devastated. Today Pantan area presents an example of not preserving balance between natural resources on karst and human interventions in watershed area. All future measures should be directed on rehabilitation and further protection of this valuable karst environment. Paper gives overview of the state of the spring as well as proposed measures of sustainable management directed to the preservation of this distinct karst ecosystem. As the basis for analyzing the inter-related factors that impact on the environment, DPSIR framework is used. This framework provide rational and clear guideline for analyzing the influence of pressures derived from human activities on natural environment, and the way they are changing state of the environment. Results of the analyses showed that DPSIR framework is adequate tool to shape and implement sustainable development strategy for the Pantan area. It is evident that in this process is extremely important to take into the consideration vulnerability of the karst.",

One of its peculiarities is the widespread thick deposits of diagenetic minerals deposited over the cave walls before the beginning of the evolution of the giant gypsum crystals. These deposits consist of complex, often scarcely crystalline iron-manganese-lead oxides-hydroxides, but carbonates, sulphates and silicates are also present. Other minerals, mainly sulphates, started developing just after this area of the mine was dewatered some 20 years ago. Presently 17 different minerals have been observed, 5 of which (orientite, starkeyite, szmolnokite, szmikite and woodruffite) are completely new for the cavern environment. The study of these minerals, together with the presence of a completely new type of gypsum crystals, allowed to improve the knowledge on the speleogenetic evolution of this cave, which seems to be by far more complex than that of the other cavity of the -290 level.Its complexity is reflected by the activity of a larger number of different speleogenetic mechanisms. Among them are worth of mention the thermal corrosion/dissolution, the anhydrite-gypsum disequilibrium, the acid aggression, and the capillary migration and evaporation.",

The Molnár János Cave, an active thermokarstic cave, belonging to the Buda Hills karst system, lies beneatha highly populated district of Budapest. Its large passages are al­most completely filled by lukewarm water. Only the upper part of its largest known chamber rises above the water level, whichoffers an excellent site to examine recent cave generation pro­cesses. However, hitherto, no dry subsurface gateway existed towards this chamber; it was only accessible underwater. In this paper, we present the results of various geophysical investi­gations including GPR, magnetic and seismic methods, carried out in a close cooperation between geophysicists and speleolo­gists. The aim of the measurements was to determine the pre­cise position of the hall relative to a nearby drift. Based upon the successful seismic survey and first break analysis, a precise and efficient boring could be designed to realise the connec­tion. Finally, a passage between the two cavities has been estab­lished and, thus, the chamber of the cave is now accessible to the whole scientific community.",

It has been known since the mid-19thcentury due to numerous cave bear finds. The cave is filled by complicated sequences of cave fluvial and lacustrine sediments, whichare recently partly eroded. We studied two paleontological exca­vations and profiles in the Medvedji rov to contribute to the solution of dating of bone-bearing lithological horizons. The Križna jama I profile consists of alternation of speleothem lay­ers (flowstone sheets withsmall stalagmites, sometimes within situ cemented Ursus gr. spelaeus bones) and fine-grained silici­clastics often withbones of cave bear. It can be correlated withthe upper part of the Križna jama II profile, but witha slightly less preserved stratigraphic record. Radiocarbon and U-series dates clearly indicate two different ages of cave bear thanato­cenoses in the Križna jama I profile: those above flowstone crusts were dated to ca. 47–45 ka by radiocarbon dating; those included in speleothem layers and clay interbeds are older than 94 ka (U-series date). The details of internal lithology, low thicknesses of layers and the state of bone preservation exclude expected sandwiching of younger layers into eroded/washed spaces among flowstones. Numerical dating excludes re-depo­sition of bear bones from older assemblage to sediments above flowstones. According to the paleomagnetic parameters (pre­vailing normal polarization), the deposition took place within the Brunhes Chron (&lt; 780 ka). There were discovered in total four short-lived reverse excursions of the magnetic field. Ac­cording to U-series data, the upper one (profile I) might be correlated withthe Blake excursion. The lower ones are older than ca 190 ka and can be correlated withsome of the Jamaica-Pringle Falls, Namaku, Calabrian Ridge, Portuguese margin or Calabrian Ridge 1 excursions. Sediments in studied profiles were deposited during the Last Glacial (Weichselian), Eemian interglacial, Saalian glacial and Holsteinian interglacial.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has been conducted investigating the relationship between karst processes, carbonate deposition and the global carbon cycle. However, little work has been done looking into the relationship between glaciations, subsequent sea level changes, and aerially exposed land masses in relation to karstic processes and the global carbon budget. During glaciations sea-level exposed the world’s carbonate platforms. With the sub-aerial exposure of the platforms, karst processes can occur, and the dissolution of carbonate material can commence, resulting in the drawdown of CO2 from the atmosphere as HCO3−. Furthermore, the material on the platform surfaces is primarily aragonite which is more readily soluble than calcite allowing karst processes to occur more quickly. During glaciations arctic carbonates and some of the temperate carbonates are blanketed in ice, effectively removing those areas from karst processes. Given the higher solubility of aragonite, and the extent of carbonate platforms exposed during glaciations, this dissolution balances the CO2 no longer taken up by karst processes at higher latitudes that were covered during the last glacial maximum The balance is within 0.001 GtC / yr, using soil pCO2 (0.005 GtC/yr assuming atmospheric pCO2) which is a difference of &lt;1% of the total amount of atmospheric CO2 removed in a year by karst processes. Denudation was calculated using the maximum potential dissolution formulas of Gombert (2002). On a year to year basis the net amount of atmospheric carbon removed through karstic processes is equivalent between the last glacial maximum and the present day, however, the earth has spent more time in a glacial configuration during the Quaternary, which suggests that there is a net drawdown of atmospheric carbon during glaciations from karst processes, which may serve as a feedback to prolong glacial episodes. This research has significance for understanding the global carbon budget during the Quaternary.Keywords: Karst, Global Carbon Budget, Quaternary, Last Glacial Maximum, Carbonate Dissolution.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.661",

    "abstract": "In order to optimize consumption, maintenance and control of underground water, an estimation of the groundwater recharge is highly important. Therefore, this research investigates the aquifers in North Khorasan province using APLIS (Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station) based on a GIS. For this purpose, several significant hydrogeological parameters affecting groundwater recharge including altitude, slope, lithology, soil type and infiltration are considered. Therefore, corresponding layers for these parameters were provided and prioritized. In the end and after integrating the data, the recharge rate was measured qualitatively and different regions were mapped accordingly. The results indicate that the annual average values on a 30-year timescale in karst formations of the North Khorasan vary between 103 mm and 362 mm, with the mean value of 192 mm. Minimum, maximum and mean recharge rates of aquifer in the study area are 42 %, 73 % and 54 %, respectively. Also, aquifer recharge potential in 83 % of the karst formations is moderate while it is high for the remaining. Low recharge regions correlate to lower karst limestone and dolostone areas in the lower altitudes while high recharge regions represent upper karst limestone and dolostone areas, especially in the high altitudes.Key words: Groundwater resource management, Recharge, APLIS, GIS, karst, North Khorasan. Ocenjevanje napajanja podzemne vode v kraških vodonosnikih v severnem Horasanu, v Iranu, z uporabo metode APLIS Za optimizacijo porabe, vzdrževanja in nadzora nivoja podzemne vode je ocena napajanja vodonosnika zelo pomembna. Zato raziskava z uporabo metode APLIS, ki temelji na GIS, raziskuje vodonosnike v provinci Severni Horasan v Iranu. Pri tem smo upoštevali več pomembnih hidrogeoloških parametrov, ki vplivajo na napajanje vodonosnika, vključno z nadmorsko višino, naklonom, litologijo, tipom tal in infiltracijo. Za vsakega od parametrov smo pripravili informacije v ustreznih oblikah. Po obdelavi in integraciji podatkov smo izračunali hitrost polnjenja vodonosnika. Različne regije smo ustrezno ovrednotili. Rezultati kažejo, da se v kraških formacijah Severnega Horasana letne povprečne vrednosti v 30-letnem časovnem obdobju gibljejo med 103 mm in 362 mm, s povprečno vrednostjo 192 mm. Najmanjše, najvišje in povprečne stopnje polnjenja vodonosnika v študijskem območju so 42-, 73- in 54-odstotne. Tudi potencial polnjenja vodonosnika je v 83-odstotnih kraških formacij ocenjen kot zmeren, za preostale predele je ocenjen kot visok. Območja z nizkim potencialom polnjenja so povezana z nižje ležečimi zakraselimi apnenci in dolomiti, višje ležeča območja predstavljajo apnenci in dolomiti z višjim potencialom polnjenja.

    "abstract": "Landforms resulting from the interaction between paleo-glaciers and karst are studied by using the Sierra de los Grajos (Cantabrian Mountains) as a model. This area contains glacial landforms that have not interested geomorphologists due to their low altitude (Peña Castillo is about 1857 m a.s.l.), the absence of glacial cirques and the scarcity of large moraines. However, the prevalence of groundwater flow and chemical dissolution has favoured the preservation of glacial landforms. Lateral and frontal moraines show three main glacial stages and other minor glacier stabilization phases, with the paleo-ELA oscillating between 1650 and 1760 m. Moraines are combined with depressions and sinks resulting from subglacial karstic drainage. This convergence of forms and processes is an exception in the Cantabrian Mountains, where postglacial erosion has usually eroded the frontal moraines and the proglacial sediments. In the case of the Sierra de los Grajos, despite the underground drainage and preservation of many glacial deposits on karstic landforms, an outwash-plain was formed. These proglacial sediments and others from non-karstified areas filled the depressions of the preglacial terrain located at their edges. The main glaciokarstic landforms have been mapped and a sedimentological analysis of the outwash plain was made in order to reconstruct the glacial dynamics of this area.Key words: glaciokarst landforms, glacial geomorphology, karst geomorphology, geomorphological mapping, Cantabrian Mountains.

Zaradi nizke nadmorske višine (Peña Castillo je le 1857 m nad morjem) ter odsotnosti velikih moren in krnic to območje geomorfologov do sedaj ni posebej zanimalo. Prav kraški procesi in z njimi povezano podzemno odtekanje so tu omogočili ohranitev ledeniških oblik. Bočne in čelne morene kažejo na tri glavne faze poledenitev in več manjših faz stabilizacije ledenikov z ravnovesno mejo (ELA) med 1650 in 1760 m.n.m. Morene so pogosto vezane na kraške globeli. Glaciokraške pojave najdemo le na tem območju Kantabrijskega gorovja, kjer je sicer poledeniška erozija odstranila čelne morene in proglacialne sedimente. Kljub podzemnemu odtoku in ohranitvi številnih ledeniških sedimentov na kraškem reliefu se je na Sierra de los Grajos oblikoval predledeniški vršaj (sander).

    "abstract": "We employ a numerical model describing the evolution of secondary porosity in a single fracture embedded in soluble rock (limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite) to study the evolution of isolated fractures in different rock types. Our main focus is three-fold: The identification of shallow versus deep flow paths and their evolution for different rock types; the effect of precipitation of the dissolved material in the fracture; and finally the complication of fracture enlargement in fractures composed of several different soluble materials. Our results show that the evolution of fractures composed of limestone and gypsum is comparable, but the evolution time scale is drastically different. For anhydrite, owing to its difference from calcite in the kinetical rate law describing the removal of soluble rock, the evolution is even faster. Precipitation of the dissolved rock due to changes in the hydrochemical conditions can clog fractures fairly fast, thus changing the pattern of preferential pathways in the soluble aquifer, especially with depth. Finally, limestone fractures coated with gypsum, as occasionally observed in caves, will result in a substantial increase in fracture enlargement with time, thus giving these fractures a hydraulic advantage over pure limestone fractures in their competition for capturing flow.

    "abstract": "Rock relief is an important trace of the formation and development of karst phenomena on various carbonate rock. The existing current state is usually in a rich and diverse stage of homogeneous or heterogeneous development. The various forms of rock relief represent different ways and conditions a karst phenomenon formed and the developmental levels under the same conditions and with the same factors. Research into the connections between different developmental models is therefore necessary. Over time, not only rock relief but also rock forms begin to merge with one another. We are looking at the initial period of the development of a thick rock strata due to rain. On gently sloping rock strata, which tend to disintegrate at the edges, especially when they are inclined downwards, characteristic rock relief forms on the flat surfaces of larger planes, initially due to rainwater and sheets of creeping water and later through three-dimensional dissection and primarily the direct action of rainwater.Škraplje huma Kamenjak (Dalmatinski kras, Hrvaška); od začetnega obdobja členjenja ravnih površin z dežjem do skalnih konicSkalni relief je pomembna sled načina oblikovanja in razvoja kraških pojavov na različnih karbonatnih kamninah. Je pa zatečeno, trenutno stanje v največkrat bogatem in pestrem oblikovnem enovrstnem ali večvrstnem razvoju. Različna oblika skalnega reliefa torej predstavlja različne načine in razmere oblikovanja kraškega pojava in razvojne stopnje znotraj istih razmer in z istimi dejavniki. Zatorej je neobhodno proučevanje znotraj povezav v različne razvojne modele. Ne samo skalni relief, temveč tudi skalne oblike same se skozi čas prelivajo ena v drugo. Pred nami je začetno obdobje razvoja debelih skladov kamnine z dežjem. Na položnih skladih kamnine, ki na robovih, zlasti nagnjenih navzdol razpadajo, na njihovih ravnih površinah večjih ploskev pa se sprva z deževnico in s ploskovno polzečo vodo in nato s trirazsežnim razčlenjevanjem in predvsem neposrednim delovanjem deževnice oblikuje značilen skalni relief. Iz skalnih oblik, ki ga tvorijo, je moč natančno razbrati najbolj značilna obdobja razvoja škrapelj z odločilnimi dejavniki njihovega oblikovanja.",

    "abstract": "The development and the geological activity of the Meggyespuszta paleodoline in Hungary were reconsidered in the light of new findings and review of complex stratigraphic and morphological results. Methods included geomorphological modeling, field geological re-surveys of the data from the existing boreholes and study of the sediments of a newly drilled borehole. Three main phases of the topography evolution were determined: (1) a presumably Early-Middle Neogene primer karstification period, (2) a Late Neogene-Early Quaternary partial charging with typical terrestrial red clay and dolomite silt sediments, (3) and the covering of the paleodoline with loess and loess-based soil cover during the Quaternary. While the south erosion valley was formed likely during Pliocene-Early Pleistocene period, the young, Holocene gullies were found only in the North and East part of the paleodoline. The rearrangement of rainwater course directions could be the consequence of the thinning of the loess sediment from North to South due to the wetter climatic conditions of the Holocene. Based on the oxidized filling sediments, the lack of peat or other lacustrine deposits and the low water content of the sediments above the bedrock, it was concluded that Meggyespuszta paleodoline is one of the largest still active sinkhole in the Transdanubian Range. Neogensko-kvartalni razvoj kraškega površja planote Veszprém na osnovi raziskav paleovrtače Meggyespuszta, MadžarskaNa osnovi novih stratigrafskih in morfoloških raziskav orišemo geološki razvoj in funkcijo paleovrtače Meggyespuszta. Metode vključujejo geomorfološko modeliranje ter geološko kartiranje in obdelavo podatkov vrtin. Razvoj topografije vrtače delimo v tri faze: 1) začetno obdobje zakrasevanja v zgodnjem in srednjem neogenu, 2) pozno neogensko in zgodnje kvartarno polnjenje z rdečo glino in dolomitnim meljem, 3) pokrivanje paleovrtače s puhlico in z njo povezano prstjo v kvartarju. Erozijske doline so se oblikovale v pliocenu in zgodnjem pleistocenu, holocenski erozijski jarki pa le v severnem in vzhodnem delu vrtače. Prerazporeditev smeri odtekanja deževnice je verjetno posledica tanjšanja puhlice v smeri sever-jug zaradi vlažnejšega holocenskega podnebja. Glede na prisotnost oksidiranih sedimentov, odsotnost šote in drugih jezerskih sedimentov ter majhno vsebnost vode v sedimentih nad matično kamnino, sklepamo, da je Meggyespuszta ena največjih aktivnih vrtač v Transdonavskem hribovju.",

Avtor na primeru kraškega izvira Bistrica izpostavi problematiko varovanja kraške podtalnice ter predstavi glavne pomanjkljivosti ter slabosti sedanje zakonodaje in uveljavljene prakse na področju varovanja kraških vodonosnikov v Sloveniji. Kljub relativno ugodnim razmeram za varovanje (redka poseljenost, manj intenzivno kmetijstvo,…) v primerjavi s kraškimi območji drugod po svetu je veliko pomembnih kraških izvirov slabo zavarovanih. Vodovarstveni režimi so največkrat slabo definirani, nadzor nad izvajanjem zaščitnih ukrepov pa neučinkovit.Karst springs are important drinking water sources both in Slovenia and elsewhere in the world. Due to their specific structure, karst aquifers are in most cases highly vulnerable to pollution. Through the example of the Bistrica karst spring, the author highlights the problems of karst groundwater protection and presents the main shortcomings and weaknesses of the relevant legislation in force and of established practices in the field of the protection of karst aquifers in Slovenia. Despite relatively favourable conditions for water protection (scarce population, less intensive agricultural activities etc.) as compared with karst areas elsewhere in the world, many important karst springs in Slovenia are improperly protected. Water protection regimes are often established inappropriately and control over the implementation of protective measures is inefficient.",

Analizirani sedimenti pripadajo kisikovi izotopski stopnji 1, 3 in 5 (OIS 1, OIS 3, OIS 5). Poudarek analize je na padavinah, ki smo jih razložili na podlagi količine avtigenih strukturnih agregatov v sedimentih. Ugotovitve smo podprli s kvantitativno analizo reliefno korodiranih klastov, ki pomenijo korozijo jamskega svoda, in izjedkanih kosti, ki pomenijo korozijo v jamskih tleh. Raziskali smo tudi odnos med klimo in jamskim medvedom ter neandertalcem in klimo, in sicer na podlagi množičnih fosilnih ostankov ter najdb artefaktov. Vse analize smo naredili na podlagi trodimenzionalnega vzorčenja, tj. v horizontalni in vertikalni smeri. Vzorčili smo 65 profilov na površini 65 m2. Vsak profil je imel 35 arbitrarnih stratigrafskih enot (režnjev) s podatki o agregatih, izjedkanih kosteh, fosilnih ostankih in artefaktih. Pri razlagi sedimentnih karakteristik, ki nakazujejo klimatske parametre, smo dosledno upoštevali holocenske standarde za najdišče. Ugotovili smo, da je bila klima v OIS 3 hladnejša in bolj vlažna kot v OIS 1 in OIS 5. Na klimatsko spremembo v OIS 3 so se z večjim obiskom jame odzvali ljudje in živali, vendar ne hkrati. Sprememba klime se je na mikrolokaciji jame domnevno pokazala predvsem v podaljšanem trajanju snežne odeje. The article presents a new sedimentary-climatic model for explaining autochthonous clastic sediment in the Upper Pleistocene site, Divje babe I, Slovenia. The sediment analysed here was deposited during Oxygen Isotope Stages 1, 3 and 5 (OIS, OIS 3, OIS 5). The stress is on precipitation, which we explained on the basis of the quantity of authigenic structural aggregates in the sediment. We supported the results with quantitative analysis of clasts with etched surface, which represent corrosion of the cave ceiling, and etched bones, which represent corrosion on the cave ground. We also analysed the relation between climate and cave bears, and Neanderthals and climate, on the basis of mass fossil remains and finds of artefacts. All analyses were made on the basis of three-dimensional sampling, i.e., in horizontal and vertical directions. We sampled 65 profiles over an area of 65 m2. Each profile had 35 arbitrary stratigraphic units (splits) with data on aggregates, etched bones, fossil remains and artefacts. In explaining the sediment characteristics that point to climatic parameters, we consistently took into account the Holocene standards for the site. We found that the climate in OIS 3 was colder and damper than in OIS 1 and OIS 5. People and animals responded to the climatic changes in OIS 3 with more visits to the cave, but not at the same time. The climatic change was presumably reflected in the microlocation of the cave mainly by the longer duration of snow cover.",

Two larger areas with densities of 30 and 34 dolines/km2 are determined. Their distribution along the river canyons could indicate the existence of a palaeodrainage network. The strongest link between the doline density and topography is with inclination and vertical relief dissection, whereas the number of dolines decreases with an increase of slope inclination and relative relief. Such distribution confirms the suitability of karstic plateaus without active drainage for doline formation.",

In Carniola, karst is prevailing and therefore there is a lengthy description of karst geology and geomorphology included. His classification of mountains specially mentions Montes secundarii formed by grey limestone. Of surface features dolines, glacio-karstic dolines on high plateaus (with temperature and vegetation inversion), and karst poljes are mentioned. Hacquet presumed the evolution from flooded polje (seasonal lake) to a dry one. To explain the weathering and dissolution of limestone Hacquet took into account the differences between the rock, the exposition and its element content. That is the reason why Gams regarded him as a precursor of a climatic geomorphology and the \"father\" of corrosion theory. Hacquet has also found the difference between limestone and dolomite. His description of dolomite as Lapis suillus preceded the one of D. Dolomieu for 13 years. Hacquet's statements were not based on observation only, but on the experiment too. When looking upon Hacquet's explanations and results we must not forget that Hacquet's time was still time of parapathetic logic, of four elements and of the principle of burning - the flogiston.",

About 640 words associated with the exokarst and the endokarst were mentioned, emphasizing: fear, dark, shadowy, skull, hidden places, fantastic and beauty, which helped identifying relations between the cultural and psychological aspects of the group, mainly general views about the obscure and mysterious aspects of this landscape and its prominence over natural beauties. Analyzed data showed that the development of new research on mind representations of caves is very important, mainly for environmental education programs promoting adequate concepts about caves and extending activities of educational ecotourism in Brazilian caves.",

Subterranean beetles represent an excellent object of study for historical biogeography because they are the group with the best representation in the subterranean domain. In addition, species have reduced mobility, display different degrees of adaptations to life in caves and many specialists work on this group. Three processes have shaped the present distribution of the tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera Cholevinae) in the world: dispersal, vicariance, and extinction. Therefore, three successive stages can be established in the space-time evolution of Leptodirini: (1) dispersal from a center of origin in the present area(s); (2) dispersal, extinction and vicariance among the present area(s); and (3) colonization and speciation in the subterranean domain. The Romanian Leptodirini, especially those from Western Carpathians is examined with respect to these processes. Their pattern of distribution in different massifs and at different altitudes is discussed, with possible explanations from a historical biogeographic point of view.",

    "abstract": "In the article the geomorphology of the Mali dol dry valley is presented. It is one of at least two dry valleys that cross about 45 km long and up to 15 km wide Kras plateau. Mali dol is a 10 kilometers long, 50 to 75 meters deep dry valley. It meanders on the leveled surface across the Kras plateau in direction NE-SW, perpendicularly to all structures. Because of the sediment and thicker soil cover deep and large solution dolines inside the basic valley-like shape were formed. These dolines are larger and deeper than the dolines formed on the nearby surface of the plateau. Local tectonically crushed zones, limestones with cherts and thick sediment cover allow some overland flow into the valley. In such places some smaller but deep and steep erosion gullies were formed. From the morphology, the position of the dry valley and the sediments we can infer the polygenetic origin of the valley. It was formed during the planation of Kras in the height of the piezometric level.",

The result is given on the basis of comparison of forms of both presumed contact surfaces represented by a great number of points determined in space. This cloud of points has been captured by 3D terrestrial laser scanning. On the basis of assessment of geological and morphological characteristics of the Crni kal rock block and the Kraški rob wall 12 characteristic pairs of corresponding (matching) points were collected, one pair consisting of two points, each from its own wall. By use of a method called 12-parameter affine transformation, transformation parameters of one cloud transformation into the other one were calculated. Since for such a transformation 4 pairs of points are enough, and there were even 12 pairs of points used in order to provide better results, the socalled least square method (LSM) was used. By the so obtained transformation vector the reference point cloud of the Crni kal rock block was transformed, for a size of the vector move back, into a cloud of transformed points which should match the reference point cloud of the Kraški rob wall. The comparison of a reference point cloud of Kraški rob and a cloud of transformed points showed that the rock block of Crni kal slid in a S-SW direction for 4.7 m in form of a block failure. Static analysis of matching point clouds proved that as much as 95 % of points fell within a distance less than 0.74 m which confirmed the hypothesis that the rock block on which the castle of Crni kal was situated represented once a part of the Kraški rob wall. Prior to the 11th century at least, it split away from it and moved parallel to the wall in form of a block failure.",

In the Humboldt Museum, Berlin, historic skulls of the three “spelaeus species” (cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena) are displayed. We were allowed to investigate them and further material in the Museum’s archive in an attempt to locate the holotype skull. Here we report about our findings giving pertinent measurements of this historic material and depicting it for the first time. Studying the old labels we were able to establish the provenience of much of the material that includes in fact specimens from the original Rosenmüller collection.

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the flow and storage mechanisms of a karst aquifer located at the central Taurus Mountains, Turkey. As the biggest discharge point of the aquifer system, the flow characteristics are investigated at Pinarbaşi spring by using recession and time-series analyses. Continuous water level measurements are taken from the spring and are converted to flow rate by using a rating curve. The spring flows for 7 months (December 2014 – July 2015) and dries up for the rest of the year. Six individual recession periods are investigated and analyzed in the discharge time series. The recession coefficients (between 0.029 day-1 and 0.695 day-1) show that the flow within the aquifer system is mainly controlled by large open conduit and partly fracture porosity. The peak discharge is measured as 7.08 m3/s, and the maximum storage within the aquifer is calculated as 3.15 million m3. The continuous discharge data of the spring were evaluated combined with daily rainfall, temperature, electrical conductivity, and amount of suspended sediment in the water. Also a dye-tracing test was also applied to obtain the recharge-discharge relationship and porosity type of the aquifer system. Statistical tests on discharge hydrograph and tracer test showed that the memory of the karst aquifer was found to be about 3 days in the DJF period and about 15 days in the MAM period. The average elevation of the recharge area of the spring was determined to be 1,490 m by using stable isotope data of snow samples and was validated by dye tracer test made via the swallow hole in the recharge area. The total discharge for the year 2015 is estimated at 16.2 million m3 that approximately 25% of the total discharge is caused by snowmelt.",

    "abstract": "Tourism activities in caves can result in changes in the microclimates of caves. The natural microclimate in closed caves is constant due to the balance between cave air and cave walls, while in open caves exchanges with outside air influence the microclimate. Visits to caves, especially in closed smaller caves, can thus endanger the natural balance if the microclimate does not return to natural conditions quickly enough.Continuous monitoring of the temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide in Škocjan Caves enables the assessment of the impact of visits. For this purpose, we used data measured in the relatively closed Silent Cave, at the locations named Calvary (Kalvarija), Tent (Šotor), and Passage (Prehod) in 2016, and in the wide open Murmuring Cave, at the locations named Bridge (Most) and Rimstone Pools (Ponvice), in 2013. The outdoor air temperature, as measured at the Škocjan meteorological station on the surface plateau, was considered in both cases. Along the tourist part of Škocjan Caves, the most closed part of the cave in Silent Cave is the location at Calvary, when the entrance doors through an artificially dug tunnel are closed. During the visits, the microclimate is subjected to draughts through open doors and to anthropogenic emissions. The data suggest that the influence of draughts predominates over direct anthropogenic emissions. In winter or on cold days air flows upwards and through the tunnel out of the cave, whereas in summer or on warm days it flows downwards. In such cases, the CO2 concentration decreases markedly due to the downwards chimney effect as the concentration in the outside air is much lower than in the cave. The data show that the temperature overnight and towards morning always returns to its natural value even in this&#x0D; rather small location in the cave. The changes in CO2 concentration persist for a longer period, until the time of the first visit the next morning, when it is again perturbed by a new visit. The data on time courses support the theoretically estimated characteristic of the exponential decline of disturbances backward towards natural conditions, depending on the size of a cave and on the efficiency of exchanges with its walls. For tem­perature, this characteristic time tT is about three to six hours at the Calvary site. The return of CO2 to natural conditions tCO2 is longer and its estimate less reliable than the one for temperature. In the wide-open and large Murmuring Cave, the impact of visits is negligible throughout the year. In this part of the cave we can observe the influence of external daily and annual changes, the amplitudes of which get smaller, and their phase lags bigger, deeper in the cave.",

Simultaneously, the meteorological parameters in Postojna were measured and the effective infiltration was assessed. The data obtained in the period of one hydrological year, 2003–2004, was compared in order to study the influence of the vadose flow on the characteristics of groundwater flow in a karst system and on the functioning of a karst spring. The highest discharges of the Korentan spring are the result of the inflow of water through a hierarchy of fissures of various permeabilities within the vadose zone, but the contribution of stored water from low-permeability zones is especially important. One of our most significant findings is that in the conditions of high saturation of the vadose zone, the network of small fissures is hydraulically connected, which enables an integral reaction of the system to the pressure pulse induced by infiltrated precipitation. On the other hand, a detailed comparison of effective infiltration and discharge indicates that in dry periods with a lower saturation of the vadose zone, the infiltrated precipitation is mainly stored in the system and only the most permeable fissures enable a rapid transfer of the recharge impulses toward the spring. Data on measured discharge and conductivity were additionally compared in order to study the complex conditions of the actual mass flow of water through the system.Key words: karst aquifer, vadose zone, Postojna Cave, Korentan spring, Slovenia",

A targeted phytoplankton assay for Chlorella DNA was developed to estimate the abundance of the predominant species of green algae in surface waters of Mammoth Cave National Park (MACA) in Kentucky, USA. The phytoplankton community in the Green River in MACA has been shown to consist of 95% Chlorella sp. (Wullschlegger et al., 2003). Chlorella 18S rRNA gene sequences were amplified and quantified using Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) with primers specific for the family Chlorellaceae in the class Trebouxiophyceae, order Chlorellales. Concentrations of Chlorella DNA in river water samples were measured by comparison to a standard curve generated by DNA extracted from a live laboratory culture of C. vulgaris. DNA isolated from other sources including bacteria, amoebae, fungi, decapods, insects, cave sediment, and a different green alga, Chlamydomonas, produced no PCR products and thus did not interfere with the detection and quantification of Chlorella DNA. The assay proved quantitative over more than four orders of magnitude with a method detection limit (MDL) of approximately 2.3 x104 cells/L. Presence or absence of Chlorella DNA could be demonstrated at concentrations ten to 100 times lower than the calculated MDL. Chlorella was detected in lampenflora samples from three tourist trails, and Chlorella was absent from sediment samples off tourist trails that were known to contain high concentrations of bacterial DNA. Demonstration of the utility of the technique was illustrated by a case study in Mammoth Cave National Park to determine Chlorella concentrations at various sampling sites of karst surface streams where invasive zebra mussels are a threat to native species.",

As the interpretation of the palaeoenvironmental signal archived in speleothems relies on identifying and understanding processes between atmosphere and cave precipitates, especially hydrological behaviour, cave monitoring is crucial. Despite relatively simple sampling and monitoring protocols, series of problems and complications has arisen, caused by different natural and technical reasons. Extreme weather events such as enormous precipitation, prolonged drought or snow drifts, each in their own way can cause sample loss, while technical issues associated with equipment failures can lead to data loss. Even biological threats occurred, both man-induced and of natural origin. Although the later cannot be eliminated, as well as extreme weather, experience gained substantially helps to minimize negative effects. On the other hand, most of the technical issues are resolvable, and suggested solutions have been regularly implemented.",

Two years of cave monitoring investigate temperature, weight of water vapour and airflow distributions outside and inside the cavity to determine the global behaviour of the karst cave. In addition, daily measurements of temperature and airflow demonstrate clearly the stratification of the air and inversions of the airflow during day-time. The cave air is intensively exchanged with external air during the years, with two main modes: (i) airflow enters from the ceiling during summer period and (ii) airflow enters from the floor during winter. At the entrance, an Sshaped velocity profile was observed and far from the entrance, convection loops were observed. During the other period of the year, the airflows may switch from top to bottom or conversely. The thermodynamic conditions of switching are discussed in this paper. This study provided for the first time evidence of daily airflow inversion. Study of cave climates is required in the comprehension of cave flora and fauna, thermodynamic conditions for karst processes underground, hydrogeological features of speleothems, human impact when caves are visited.Key words: cave, microclimate, karst, airflow, temperature, variability.

    "abstract": "The Salman Farsi Dam was constructed on the Ghareh-Aghaj river in the catchment of the Asmari limestone aquifer, Changal Anticline, Zagros region, Iran. In order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, combination of geoelectrical (i.e., bulk resistivity of the aquifer) and hydrophysical (i.e., electrical conductivity of groundwater) data are used as an alternative approach. Porosity of the aquifer is estimated based on the modified form of Archie’s empirical law assuming well-cemented carbonate rocks. Formation resistivity factor and critical pore size of the Asmari limestone aquifer are used for estimating the hydraulic conductivity on the small scale based on the Thompson Equation. The results suggest an average porosity and hydraulic conductivity of 14.4 % and 0.016 m/day, respectively. The estimated value for hydraulic conductivity is smaller than values previously determined for the aquifer, based on tracer, pumping and Lugeon tests. Comparison of the hydraulic conductivity obtained by different methods revealed scale effect of hydraulic conductivity measurements in the Asmari limestone aquifer. As a result, application of the geoelectrical and hydrophysical data can provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to estimate hydraulic conductivity in karst aquifers on the small scale.Keywords: hydraulic conductivity, Karst, Scale effect, Vertical electrical sounding, Iran.Uporaba geoelektričnih podatkov za oceno hidravlične prevodnosti in učinka merila v kraškem vodonosnikaJez Salman Farsi je postavljen na reku Ghareh-Aghaj v območju kraškega vodonosnika Asmari, ki pripada antiklinali Changal v gorovju Zagros, Iran.

Ocena poroznosti je temeljila na prilagojeni obliki Archiejevega empiričnega zakona, pri čemer smo predpostavili dobro cementirane karbonate. Iz upornosti formacije in kritične velikosti por smo s Thompsonovo enačbo izračunali hidravlično prevodnost v majhnem merilu.

Vrednosti hidravlične prevodnosti so precej manjše of prej dobljenih vrednosti iz sledilnih, črpalnih in Lugeonovih poskusov, kar kaže na pomemben učinek merila v obravnavanem vodonosniku. Raziskava med drugim kaže na primernost geoelektričnih in hidrofizikalnih podatkov za stroškovno ugodno oceno hidravlične prevodnosti v majhnem merilu.Ključne besede: Hidravlična prevodnost, kras, učinek merila, vertikalno električno sondiranje, Iran.",

Tektonsko okno pri Knežaku je dokaz starejših narivnih deformacij. Pokrajina je prerezana s številnimi mlajšimi prelomi, od katerih so najpomembnejši Raški, Predjamski in Selški prelom. Pokrajina Zgornje Pivke je tektonsko precej aktivna, kar kažejo potresi v zadnjih letih. Kot najbolj potencialni aktivni prelom se kaže Raški prelom oziroma kakšen od spremljajočih prelomov severno od Raškega preloma, npr. Šembijski prelom in morda tudi Selški prelom. Kraška presihajoča jezera Zgornje Pivke so razvita v zgornjekrednih apnencih in so od nariva Snežnika oddaljena 0,5-4 km proti SV. Večina jezer je oblikovana ob Selškem prelomu.The important regional thrust called Snežnik thrust, that divides the Snežnik thrust sheet from the parautochthon of the Komen thrust sheet, runs through the Pivka basin. A tectonic window near Knežak is proof of older thrusting deformations. The landscape is cut by numerous younger faults among which the most important are Raša, Predjama and Selce faults. The area of Upper Pivka is tectonically quite active, which is shown by earthquakes in recent years. It looks as if the most active is the Raša fault or one of its northern parallel faults, for example Šembije fault or maybe Selce fault. Karst intermittent lakes of Upper Pivka are developed in Upper Cretaceous limestones. The lakes are situated 0.5-4.0 km NE from the Snežnik thrust. Most of the lakes are situated along the Selce fault.",

Da bi kar najbolj omejili neposreden antropogeni vpliv, smo vzorčili v težko dostopnih razpokah in breznih. Vzorce smo pedološko analizirali in jim izmerili vsebnost težkih kovin. Rezultati so pokazali nizko vsebnost svinca, bakra in cinka, ki je nižja kot v večini hrvaških jam, medtem ko je vsebnost kadmija višja kot v drugih jamah. Vsebnost težkih kovin v jamah je nižja kot v humusnem horizontu.Samples of silt were taken from six speleological objects in the Risnjak National Park in Gorski kotar area (NW Croatia). The samples were taken from almost inaccessible rock fissures and shafts in order to find the most natural sediment outside the reach of anthropogenic pollution. The samples were examined in the Laboratory of the Forest Research Institute, where standard pedological analyses were performed, and the content of several heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd) was determined. The results indicate relatively low values of the content of lead, copper and zinc, while the values of cadmium in the sediment were increased above the limit level of 2 mgkg-1 in the majority of speleological objects. The content of other heavy metals (Pb, Cu and Zn) in mgkg-1 was lower than previously determined in samples taken from other speleological objects on the Croatian territory. Also, the content of heavy metals was lower in relation to surface soil samples taken from the humus horizon and mineral part of the soil under the parent rock of limestone, when sampling the soils of the Risnjak National Park.",

Zanimanje za bolgarski kras se je povečalo v zadnjih letih zaradi reševanja vsakdanjih vprašanj. Za ta kras je značilna velika raznolikost zaradi prepletanja različnih dejavnikov (geoloških, tektonskih, geomorfoloških, hidroloških in hidrogeoloških, klimatskih, itd.) in skladno z geodinamičnim razvojem tega dela Evrope. Pričujoče delo predstavlja novo delitev krasa v Bolgariji. Avtorica loči sledeče tipe: ravninski kras (Donavska nižina), morski kras, v ravninskega spremenjeni morski kras in ravninsko-morski kras (Črnomorska podvodna in kopna ravnina); planotasti kras (Predbalkan) in gorski kras. Posebej obravnava kraška močvirja in kraške pojave, ki so jih povzročili potresi v geološki preteklosti.

The karst water resources are estimated to be 2.3 billion m3 or 11.6 % of the total water resources of the country. The interest in karst in Bulgaria has become higher during the last years because there are a number of practical problems that have to be solved. Karst in Bulgaria is characterized by great diversity due to the complex combination of factors (geological, tectonic, geomorphologic, hydrological and hydrogeological, climatic, etc.) and to the geodynamic development of this part of Europe. This work presents a new zoning of karst in Bulgaria. The following types have been distinguished: plain karst (the Danubian Plain); marine and transformed marine karst into plain and plain-marine karst (Black Sea subaqual and subareal plain); plateau-like karst (the Fore Balkan) and mountainous karst. The karst wetlands and karst phenomena provoked by paleoearthquakes are separately outlined and sample models for the different karst types, genesis, dynamics, lithostructural control, relations, etc. are presented.",

Tako so dejanske doze, ki jih prejmejo jamski vodiči, v povprečju za faktor 8 poleti in za faktor 2,7 pozimi višje od vrednosti, ki jih dobimo po dosedanji metodologiji ICRP-65.Short-term summer and winter monitoring was carried out at the lowest point in Postojna cave, on air concentrations on radon (CRn) and radon decay products (CRnDP), the equilibrium factor (F) and unattached fraction of radon decay products (f un ), barometric pressure (P), relative air humidity in the cave (RH) and air temperature outside (T out ) and in the cave (T in ), with the emphasis on f un . Dose conversion factors (DCF) for mouth and nasal breathing were calculated from the f un values (ranging from 0.10 to 0.68) and effective doses for the employees in the cave were obtained.

    "abstract": "Medplastno raztapljanje sadre in anhidrita v štirih stratigrafskih enotah starosti od karbona do jure na področju Black Hills, South Dakota in Wyoming, je povzročilo mnogo udorov, ki so se prvotno razvili v zgornjih netopnih kamninah. Udori so prizadeli več naseljenih območij. Podzemeljsko medplastno raztapljanje anhidrita Minnelusa formacije je povzročilo regionalno podorno brečo, velike prekinitve plastnatosti, mnogo vrtač ter brečaste kope, izmed katerih se nekatere razprostirajo 300 m v zgoraj ležeče plasti. Recentni udori so povzročili strme vrtače globje od 20 m, udore v vodnjakih in izvirih, ki so posledica prekinitve sedimentov in onesnaženja ter sveže morfološke stopnje, ki obkrožajo plitve depresije. Veliko plasti sadre je deformiranih zaradi ekspanzije, kar je posledica njene hidracije iz anhidrita. Mnogo sadrinih žilic najdemo vzdolž naključnih razpok v matičnih plasteh sadre. Ob izvirih se pojavlja več vrtač. Ker čelno raztapljanje anhidrita v podzemlju Minnelusa formacije napreduje vzdolž vpada in radialno izven centra dviganja področja Black Hills, bodo ti izviri presahnili, pojavili pa se bodo novi skladni z geomorfološkim razvojem področja Black Hills. Stare brečaste kope, ki so ohranjene v prečnih profilih sten soteske, kaæejo na nekdanji položaj čelnega raztapljanja. Mirror Lake, ki se razprostira proti SZ vzdolž smeri vpada, je lokalna primerjava napredujočega čela raztapljanja.Intrastratal dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite in four stratigraphic units of Pennsylvanian to Jurassic age in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming has resulted in many collapse features that have developed primarily in the non-soluble overlying rocks. Subsidence has affected several areas that are undergoing urban development. Subsurface intrastratal dissolution of anhydrite in the Minnelusa Formation has produced a regional collapse breccia, extensive disruption of bedding, many dolines, and breccia pipes and pinnacles, some of which extend upwards more than 300 m into overlying strata. Recent collapse is evidenced by steepwalled dolines more than 20 m deep, collapse in water wells and natural springs resulting in sediment disruption and contamination, and fresh circular scarps surrounding shallow depressions. Many beds of gypsum are contorted because of expansion due to its hydration from anhydrite, and many gypsum veinlets extend downward along random fractures from parent gypsum beds. Several dolines are sites of resurgent springs. As the anhydrite dissolution front in the subsurface Minnelusa moves downdip and radially away from the center of the Black Hills uplift, these resurgent springs will dry up and new ones will form as the geomorphology of the Black Hills evolves. Old dolines and breccia pipes, preserved in cross section on canyon walls, attest to the former position of the dissolution front. Mirror Lake, which is expanding northwestward in a downdip direction, is a local analog of a migrating dissolution front.",

The carbonate rocks belong to the Eocene, Oligocene- Miocene, Miocene, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Most of the carbonate rocks are developed in the basins of Mazindaran and Zagros. The carbonate rocks in the Zone of Zagros, due to the prevailing tectonic activities, have undergone more processes of karstification. About 56 % of all the springs originated from this zone. In Lorestan the Zagros zone consists of a series of parallel anticlines in which, due to the tectonic movements, the rocks have undergone folding and fracturing. The folding and fracturing have created rich ground water reservoirs. The carbonate rocks of Lorestan show all types of karst features such as karren, dolines and caves. The most developed karstic features are seen in the Bangeston group. Most of the springs are discharged either along the lineaments or at the intersection of the lineaments. The chemical analyses of the samples show that they are of bicarbonate type. The drinking water of the city of Khorramabad (capital of Lorestan) is supplied from the karstic springs. In this paper, the karst hydrology of two important regions of Lorestan are considered.",

Petrographically, the pebbles can be divided into three groups: rather fresh basalts, markedly or totally altered basalt (including the iron nuggets) and a dark sandstone. The iron nuggets originate through a progressing alteration (oxidation and hydration) of the basaltic pebbles. The geochemical study shows that the original fresh basaltic pebbles are of alkali type and belong to the Na-series.

Beside the use of Rječina spring for water supply, the development of the Rijeka hydroelectric power plant (HEPP) also changed hydrological and hydrogeological regime of the whole catchment. In order to analyse the anthropogenic influences in the system, hydrological analysis of the Rječina river and spring discharge was done, as well as the analysis of the available data of groundwater measurements. The analysis showed that, due to the increase of water caption and decrease of precipitation, the average annual spring discharge decreased for approximately 25% in the 1980-2016 period. Detailed analysis of groundwater measurements indicated aquifer behaviour and the need for additional measurements and catchment delineation.Key words: hydrology, hydrogeology, karst, Rječina Spring, Rječina River, Dinaric karst.Analiza vodnih virov kraškega izvira in reke Rječina (Dinarski kras)Članek obravnava zapletene hidrološke/hidrogeološke razmere v zaledju kraškega izvira in reke Riečine v severozahodnem delu globokega in dobro razvitega hrvaškega Dinarskega krasa. Izvir Rječina je eden največjih kraških izvirov na Hrvaškem, zajet je za oskrbo s pitno vodo za mesto Reka in njeno okolico. Poleg rabe izvira Rječine za oskrbo z vodo je razlog za spremenjen hidrološki in hidrogeološki režim celotnega zaledja tudi gradnja hidroelektrarne Reka (HEPP). Za analizo antropogenih vplivov na sistem smo zato naredili hidrološko analizo pretokov reke in izvira Rječina pa tudi analizo razpoložljivih podatkov merjenja podzemne vode. Analiza je pokazala, da se je zaradi povečanja zajemanja vode in zmanjšanja količine padavin povprečen letni pretok izvira v obdobju 1980–2016 zmanjšal za približno 25 %. Podrobna analiza meritev podzemne vode je nakazala značilnosti delovanja vodonosnika ter pokazala potrebo po dodatnih meritvah in določitvi zaledja izvira.Ključne besede: hidrologija, hidrogeologija, kras, izvir Rječina, reka Rječina, Dinarski kras.",

    "abstract": "Main hydrological features and recharge analysis of the Caposele Spring catchment, southern ItalyThe Caposele spring supplies with water the Puglia region (southern Italy) since the beginning of the twentieth century by a wide and long (about 400 km) gravity-aqueduct system. Systematic spring discharge measurements exist since 1920. The annual mean discharge of spring is about 4 m3/sec, the spring catchment of the of Mt. Cervialto karst massif is estimated on more than 100 km2. The spring regime is characterised by absence of abrupt peaks in the hydrographs; the flood period occurs in spring-summer time, and the minimum during the autumn-winter time. Thus, the regime is almost opposite that of rainfall which allows a convenient management of the source. The historical data have shown that spring discharge depends also on the hydrological conditions of the previous year because the ‘‘memory effect” of aquifer. The recharge processes have been evaluated using a daily scale recharge model, calibrated on long term annual scale. The results allow to estimate the inertial behaviour of the aquifer, by the difference of recharged and discharged water volume during a hydrological year: after a wet year, an amount of water volume is retained into the aquifer and constitutes the surplus volume stored; after a dry year, the aquifer discharges a water volume higher than the recharged volume (a deficit in storage).Key words: karst aquifer, recharge model, spring discharge, storage, southern Italy.Glavne hidrološke značilnosti in analiza napajanja zaledja izvira Caposele, južna ItalijaIzvir Caposele je od začetka 20. stoletja glavni vodni vir Apulije (južna Italija). Voda je od izvira do mest gravitacijsko speljana po približno 400 km dolgem akvaduktu. Sistematične meritve pretoka potekajo od leta 1920, povprečni pretok izvira je 4 m3/s, območje napajanja je kraški masiv gore Cervialto s površino preko 100 km2. Značilnosti izvira so odsotnost izrazitih vrhov v pretočnem hidrogramu, visok pretok v pomladansko-poletnem času in nizek pretok v jesensko-zimskem obdobju. Režim pretoka izvira je skoraj obraten od padavin, kar omogoča preprosto upravljanje vodnega vira. Zgodovinski podatki kažejo, da je pretok odvisen od hidroloških razmer v predhodnem letu, kar je posledica velikega »spominskega učinka« vodonosnika. Napajanje sistema smo ocenili na podlagi dnevnega modela napajanja, umerjenega na dolgoročno letno obdobje. Z razliko med napajanjem in odtokom v hidrološkem letu, smo ocenili inercijsko obnašanja vodonosnika. Izkaže se, da se v letu z veliko padavinami presežek napajanja skladišči v vodonosniku, v suhem letu pa je volumen odtoka večji od volumna odtoka.Ključne besede: kraški vodonosnik, model napajanja, pretok izvira, skladiščenje, južna Italija.",

    "abstract": "Soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, and salt can be dissolved by water flowing through voids in the rocks. The removal of the dissolved material from fissures and bedding partings by physical and/or chemical dissolution enlarges the permeability of the soluble rocks within geologically short periods of time, ranging from 100,000 years down to decades. This geologically short evolution time of voids in soluble rocks poses a substantial risk of mechanical instability of the enlarged voids, and possible surface deformation, when enlarged voids start to collapse. We describe karst and cave features in the rock sequence exposed along the southern part of the Harz Mountains and the Kyffhäuser Hills in Germany, where limestone/dolomite and anhydrite/gypsum are exposed along a kilometer-wide strip following the foothills of the Harz Mountains. The rocks have been deposited during the Permian Zechstein period, buried, and exposed later through tectonic uplift. The exposed part of this soluble sequence is dominated by karst features. But there are also substantial cave voids deeper in the rock, with no obvious entrance to the surface, which have been discovered by chance through mining activities. Often, the sub-surface void evolution is closely linked to surface deformation, creating collapse sinkholes and subsidence. In the city of Bad Frankenhausen at the foothills of the Kyffhäuser Hills, the evolution of sub surface voids is responsible for the tilting of the church tower of the Oberkirche. We explore the evolution of such a karst system composed of limestone and anhydrite by numerical means, describing flow and transport in a rock mass composed of soluble and insoluble rock sequences, with limestone and anhydrite responsible for the evolution of secondary porosity.Key words: soluble rocks, karst, mine-cave evolution, collapse sinkholes, numerical modelling. Modeliranje speleogeneze v topnih kamninah: primer zechsteinskih kamnin v južnem delu gorovja Harz in v hribovju KyffhäuserVoda, ki teče skozi pore in razpoke v topnih kamninah, kot so apnenec, dolomit, sadra, anhidrit in sol, raztaplja stene prevodnih poti. Učinkovito odnašanje raztopljene snovi lahko močno poveča hidravlično prevodnost vodonosnika v geološko kratkem času, ki je v izjemnih primerih dolg vsega nekaj desetletij. Hiter razvoj prevotljenosti lahko povzroči mehansko nestabilnost nastalih votlin in posledično ugrezanje površja. Tak primer najdemo v kilometer širokem pasu apnenca, dolomita, sadre in anhidrita, ki se razteza vzdolž južnega dela pogorja Harz in hribovja Kyffhäuser. Sedimenti, ki so se odložili v permskem Zechsteinskem morju, so bili kasneje globoko pokopani in ponovno tektonsko izdani na površje. Izdanki teh kamnin so izrazito kraško preoblikovani, prevotljenost pa je velika tudi v globlje pokopanih kamninah, ki nimajo očitne povezave s površjem in so bile odkrite pri rudarskih delih. Velikokrat se razvoj votlin pod površjem izrazi tudi na površju, kjer nastajajo udornice in grezi. V mestu Bad Frankenhausen ob vznožju hribovja Kyffhauser se je zaradi razvoja votlin pod površjem nagnil cerkveni zvonik.

    "abstract": "Kinetic fractionation of 18O and clumped isotopes 13C18O in calcite precipitated to speleothems in cave environments renders the paleo-climatic interpretation of these proxies difficult. Therefore a better understanding of the processes generating the isotope imprint is needed. A heuristic approach is taken to interpret recent data of the fractionations in a cave analogue experiment of calcite precipitation (Hansen et al. 2019) that shows a dependence on experimental precipitation rates, F. An expression, , is derived that is based on uni-directional irreversible precipitation and is valid for large F when the forward rate of precipitation dominates the backward rate of dissolution. In that derivation it is assumed that the kinetic constants of precipitation rates are different for the different isotopologues and that this is also true for their equilibrium concentrations ceq with respect to calcite. The constant, ε, is expressed by the kinetic fractionation where α denote the rate constants of precipitation for the rare and abundant isotopologues. The second constant, λ, is determined by the differing equilibrium concentrations of HCO3- isotopologues with respect to calcite and the pCO2 in the surrounding atmosphere. Fitting this expression to the experimental data one obtains the parameters ε and λ for different temperatures. Regarding these results the temporal evolution of 18δCaCO3 (t) and Δ47(t) is discussed for the experimental conditions and for cave environments. This has implications to the application of 1000lnα18 CaCO3-H2O as a paleo-thermometer. It shows the reason why so many differing calibrations have been reported. These results analogously can be applied also to clumped isotopes 13C18O and the calibration of the Δ47-thermometer with regard to speleothem calcite. In summary, a better understanding of the problems arising in the search for generally valid calibrations of 18O and Δ47 paleothermometers is presented.Key words: Calcium carbonate, 13C and 18O isotopes, clumped isotopes, kinetic fractionation between HCO3- and calcite, Δ47 paleothermometer.Kinetična frakcionacija izotopov 18O, 13C in izotopskega skupka 18O13C v sigah in zanesljivost paleotermometrov 18O in Δ47Kinetična frakcionacija 18O in skupka 13C18O v kalcitu, ki se kot siga odlaga v jamskih okoljih, dela težave pri interpretaciji paleoklime na osnovi teh proksijev. Zato potrebujemo boljše razumevanje procesov, od katerih je odvisen izotopski zapis v sigah. V tem delu s hevrističnim pristopom interpretiramo nedavno pridobljene podatke frakcionacij . Podatki, pridobljeni ob izločanju kalcita v pogojih, podobnih jamskim, kažejo, da na frakcionacijo bistveno vpliva hitrost izločanja kalcita (Hansen et al. 2019). V pogojih, ko je izločanje bistveno hitrejše od raztapljanja, velja zveza . Pri izpeljavi te enačbe upoštevamo, da so kinetične konstante izločanja in ravnotežna konstanta kalcita različne za različne izotopologe. Konstanto ε lahko izrazimo s kinetično frakcionacijo , kjer je α konstanta izločanja za redke oziroma večinske izotopologe. Drugo konstanto λ dobimo iz razlik ravnotežnih koncentracij izotopologov HCO3- glede na kalcit in na atmosferski pCO2 . S prilagajanjem izraza eksperimentalnim podatkom dobimo ε in λ pri različnih temperaturah. To omogoča obravnavo časovne odvisnosti 18δCaCO3 (t) in Δ47(t) pri eksperimentalnih pogojih in v jamskem okolju. Rezultati so pomembni za razumevanje uporabnosti paleotermometra 1000lnα18CaCO3-H2O in hkrati pokažejo na vzrok različnih kalibracij, kot jih zasledimo v literaturi. Rezultate lahko uporabimo tudi za izotopske skupke 13C18O in kalibracijo Δ47- za kalcitno sigo.

    "abstract": "Cave ecosystems count to be extreme environments due to their stable temperature, darkness, high humidity rates, and limited organic materials. In this context, these ecosystems represent invaluable laboratories for microbiological studies. Although there are common features between the microorganism groups obtained from the culture-based microbiological studies conducted in the caves and the groups highlighted through molecular methods, the microorganism groups determined through this last method are richer. The detected microorganisms are variable depending on the characteristics of each cave. The aim of this study is to determine the microbial diversity in samples taken from 5 different regions (including regions visited by tourists) of Dupnisa Cave and to reveal the differences between these regions. This is the first microbiological study running in cave sediments of Dupnisa Cave System situated in the north-western of Turkey. In this study, using the Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing approach for analyses of Dupnisa Cave samples, 14 phyla and 298 genera as well as 2 phyla and 20 genera can be attributed to bacterial and archaea OTUs, respectively. Moreover, the bacterial community is dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria distributed with 1 % and above. Archaeal community is represented by Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla. Proteobacteria is the most dominant bacterial phylum and Thaumarchaeota dominates the archaeal phyla. The highest number of types of bacteria according to Chao 1 richness estimation index were found at point AF (cave entrance / sediment), and that of types of archaea were found at point F2 (touristic area 2 / cave sediment). F2 was determined as the sampling point with the highest diversity of archaeal and bacterial genera according to Shannon-Wiener diversity index.",

    "abstract": "Three karst areas located in the western sector of the Umbria Region (Central Italy) are here described: one northof Perugia, and the others to the south, close to Todi. All the end members of karst processes, from solution caves to Quaternary travertine deposits, are present in this region, associated withCO2 and H2S emissions. The geological and hydrogeological aspects of the main karst systems are analyzed and their underground morphologies and patterns taken into account. Caves have different sizes and vary from a single conduit to complex systems, where the passages show features related to a possible hypogenic speleogenesis. In the area northof Perugia there are small horizontal and vertical solution caves developed in poorly karstified marly limestone, along fracture systems, where phreatic morphologies are prevalent. The endogenic CO2 emissions seem to drive the underground karst evolution. Pozzi della Piana, located west of the town of Todi, is a fossil branchform network cave system developed in a Quaternary travertine and extending for more than 2500 m. The cave passages are arranged on at least two levels, withphreatic morphologies, cupola ceilings, and blind pits. Microcrystalline spalled gypsum blocks are associated withcusp features and wall pockets. The cave-forming process is believed to be linked to travertine deposition by supersaturated carbonate hydrothermal water richin H2S. In the Parrano area, the underground karst system consists of solution caves extending for many hundreds of meters at different elevations in bothsides of a small gorge. The cave patterns vary from single conduits to ramiform passages withanastomotic galleries and pits that intercept the water table witha temperature of 26°C, p CO2 of 10-1 atm, and H2S concentrations of 10 mg/l. Spongework, corrosion pockets, and cupola ceilings are common morphologies, withgypsum replacing limestone wall deposits. Cave formation by hypogenic speleo genesis is also well known in the Apennine karst system of M. Cucco and Frasassi, where bothfossil and active processes are observable. The same processes are responsible for the genesis of these karst systems in different geological and hydrogeological contexts.",

Arborescent aragonite constitutes the skeleton of the crust, whereas dolomite is cementing, coating and replacing the aragonite. The dolomite displays two distinctive fabrics: coarse rounded to spheroidal crystals, frequently showing fibrous-radial and concentric patterns, and microcrystalline aggregates. Dissolution of the dolostone host rock has provided Mg, which is the main control on the precipitation of aragonite, dolomite and hydromagnesite. Dolomite precipitation could be promoted by increased Mg/Ca ratios due to the prior precipitation of calcite and aragonite and by forced degassing due to ventilation caused by the existence of shafts cutting the main cave passage and a former entrance to the cave. However, in many caves such conditions do not lead to the formation of dolomite and so we discuss other mechanisms which might promote dolomite precipitation, like the possible contribution of microbes, or the transformation of precursor phases such as amorphous Ca-Mg carbonates, or hydromagnesite.",

The data set used eleven water quality parameters (oxygen saturation, chemical oxygen demand, nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, total phosphorus, ammonium, pH, conductivity, iron, manganese), as well as daily data of six climatic parameters from the period 2008-2010. A cluster analysis is performed in order to determine the climate impact on the water quality parameters. Furthermore, factor analysis with special transformation, as a novelty in the study, is implemented to find out the weight of the climate parameters as explanatory variables and hence their rank of importance in forming the given water quality parameter as an influencing variable. The study introduces a methodology for analysing the climate impact on the water quality parameters. In order to reduce the number of the water quality parameters, a so called two-stage factor analysis was performed, which is a novel procedure. Application of the two-stage factor analysis involves both benefits and disadvantages. Its benefit is that it substantially reduces the number of resultant variables. In this way, information loss of the retained factors is around 20%. As a result, we received that both positive and negative extreme values of water quality parameters can be associated with weak or breaking-up warm fronts passing through over the region. On the contrary, the role of anticyclones or anticyclone ridge weather situations is supposed to be irrelevant. Unstable and extreme weather conditions act in the direction of breaking up the balance that would support the good water quality. This process does not benefit the water use nor the sensitive karst hydrogeological system.",

    "abstract": "Karst aquifers and conduits form by dissolution of carbonate minerals and the slow release of inorganic carbon to the surface environment. As conduits evolve in size, morphology, and position within the aquifer, their function and capacity change relative to the storage and transport of inorganic and organic carbon as sediment. Conduits serve mostly as transport mechanisms in relation to sediments. Quantified data are sparse, but for conduits to function effectively there must be at least equilibrium in the amount of sediment entering and exiting the aquifer. If sediment discharge exceeds input, little sediment will remain underground. When natural declines in base level cease removing sediments and only deposit calcite speleothems, these materials are stored until the rock mass is denuded. While sediment storage is mostly transient in hydrologically active conduits, relative differences occur. Aquifers with conduits developed at multiple levels or as floodwater mazes store proportionately greater volumes of sediment. Hypogenic systems should store greater volumes of sediment than epigenic aquifers because they mostly discharge a dissolved load as opposed to both dissolved and suspended clastic loads. However, some hypogenic aquifers are diffusely recharged and receive and store little sediment from the surface. The global volume of sediment and organic carbon stored in karst aquifers is estimated in this study to be on the order of 2x104 km3and 2x102 km3, respectively. The amount of organic carbon stored in paleokarst is not estimated, but available data indicate it is substantially greater than that stored in modern karst aquifers. Development of such data may suggest that paleokarst petroleum reservoirs might serve as efficient carbon sinks for global carbon sequestration. Hydrocarbon-depleted paleokarst reservoirs should provide substantially more storage per injection well than sequestration in non-paleokarstic rocks.Keywords: Sediment, carbon, paleokarst, conduit morphology, karst hydrology, sequestration.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.662",

    "abstract": "As conduit water carries pollutants introduced from a point recharge downgradient, a contaminant-free seepage from the surrounding limestone is added into the conduit water and actively dilutes the pollutants. In this study, the transport with advection and this active dilution but no dispersion, is solved using the method of characteristics. The complete solution considering initial condition, boundary condition, and production is presented. Scale analysis reveals that the model is applicable when injection of pollutants at sinkholes persists long enough but unsuitable for analysis of dye tracing experiments. An approach combining the model with dye tracing experiment is used to quickly estimate the geometry and flow of a major conduit from Ames Sink to Wakulla Spring, Northwest Florida.",

Their origin proceeds from the geomorphological processes in the gypsum karst: land subsidence or collapses in relation with the active dissolution of the gypsum and other evaporites, particularly in depth, at the groundwater level. Most are small lakes, often ephemeral ponds in the alpine gypsum karsts, or flooded sinkholes in alluvial plains, in keeping with the fluctuations of the water-table. However, in the Mediterranean lands and Central Europa, some lacustrine basins are more important expanse; they arise from a complex evolution, and put various environmental problems. So are particularly studied the case of the lake of Besse in Provence, and in comparison the problems of the lakes of Pergusa (Sicily) and Banyoles (Catalonia).",

They have been known for more than hundred years from spe­leobiological, paleontological, geomorphological and touristic points of view. In 2007 the establishment of a water treatment plant on Bloke plateau raised important question: can partly cleaned water from the water treatment plant contaminate both caves and decrease their value? To answer this question a tracer test was carried out at the Bloke plateau. It showed gen­eral underground water flow from Farovščica ponor at Bloke plateau toward the Šteberščica spring at Cerknica polje. Mi­nority of recovered tracer appeared at Žerovniščica and Izvir v Podložu springs. The tracer was not detected at Studenec v Ložu and Zlatovec springs. Between ponor and springs three karst caves were observed. The highest concentration of tracer was detected in the cave Mrzla jama pri Bločicah and a much smaller concentration in the Križna jama and Križna jama 2. This shows that at middle water level the underground Farovščica stream does not flow directly through Križna jama and Križna jama 2 but near or below them. Since the tracer ap­peared in both caves only after the precipitation, underground water course can be significantly different at high water level. Tracing test also showed some characteristics of underground water flow through dolomite and characteristics of a composed aquifer with alogenic-autogenic recharge.",

Because calcare­ous deposits date back to the Cambrian and are now located in tabular region as well as in tectonic areas, Frenchkarst is famous for its diversity. Large karst landscapes are well known, suchas Les Grands Causses, the Gorges du Tarn and the Gorges du Verdon. Resurgences suchas the Vaucluse Fountain and the spring of the Lez are very famous too. Karstic units can show very large dimensions: 400 km for the six hydrological net­works of the Pierre Saint-Martin, 104 km for the Arbas Moun­tain. Maximum depths can reachhighrecords, at Pierre Saint Martin, Berger Cave, Jean Bernard Cave and recently Mirolda Cave was acknowledged to reach1733-meter depth. Studies proceeded during the last century have revealed an im­portant cave fauna. Considering the heritage value of Frenchkarst, the key point is not only the presence of more than 160 decorated caves from Palaeolithic period but also the number of caves showing concretions. Moreover, a rare phenomenon has to be underlined: in Ariege, the Intermittent Fontestorbes Spring is the most regularly and completely studied resurgence in the world. This amount of exceptional features for these caves commands to organise studies and programmes to estab­lishconditions of a good conservation of this heritage for the next generations.",

    "abstract": "Meteoric and glacial meltwater charged groundwater, mixed with dissolved salts from Devonian sources at depth, discharged as saline springs along topographic lows of the Athabasca River Valley, which downcuts into the Cretaceous Athabasca oil sands deposit in northeast Alberta, western Canada. These Quaternary saline seeps have TDS measurements, isotope signatures and other chemical characteristics indicative of the groundwater flows coming in contact with Prairie Evaporite (M. Devonian) salt beds, 200 m below the surface. Migrations up-section of groundwater with dissolved chloride and sulphate salts occurred along salt dissolution collapse breccia zones that cross-cut Upper Devonian limestone strata. Seeps discharged along the karstic Devonian limestone paleotopography, the unconformity surface flooring the Lower Cretaceous McMurray Formation. Saline to brine springs along the Athabasca River Valley have TDS measurements that can exceed 100,000 mg/L. Quaternary salt removal was insignificant compared to the voluminous removal of the 80-130 m thick salt section for 1000s km2 during the Early Cretaceous configuration of the Devonian paleotopography, which partially controlled depositional patterns of the overlying McMurray Formation, principal host rock of the Athabasca oil sands. Little is known of the storage or disposition of voluminous brines that would have resulted from this regional-scale removal of the salt beds below the Athabasca deposit during the Cordilleran configuration of the foreland Alberta Basin. Holocene dissolution trends and discharges at the surface as saline springs are proposed as a modern analogue for voluminous Early Cretaceous brine seeps to the surface along salt dissolution collapse breccia zones, concurrent with deposition of the McMurray Formation. This model links several characteristics of the McMurray Formation as responses to Aptian brine seeps to the surface. These include: (1) the emplacement of a drainage-line silcrete along the margins of the Assiniboia PaleoValley, now partially exhumed by the Athabasca River Valley, (2) distribution of brackish-water burrowing organisms, and (3) diagenesis of calcite-cemented sand intervals.",

It was taken into consideration how diversity changes according to the distance from the Equator in case of small, medium and large features of various zonal karsts and how it varies based on the distance from altitude in case of the karren features (small features) of high mountain karsts. It can be established that the diversity of karst features decreases according to the distance from the Equator (independent of the size of the features), while in high mountains the diversity of karren features first increases with altitude and then it decreases. The decrease of the diversity of medium and large features moving away from the Equator can be explained by the decrease of dissolution in­tensity. The diversity change of karren features shows a rela­tion with the diversity of the inclination of the bearing slope. Since on tropical karsts and in the medium elevated areas of high mountains (1600-2100 m) where bare slopes with large expansion and various slope inclination occur, the diversity of karren is great. On tropical karsts, slopes with diverse inclina­tion were created by karstification and in high mountains by glacial erosion.",

    "abstract": "Phototropic microorganisms in thermal mats had not attracted enough attention in Serbia in the past. The research presented in this paper is the first to address biofilms at selected occurrences of mineral water in Serbia (Bogatić, Metković and Belotić in the Mačva District as well as Radaljska Banja, Lukovska Banja and Vranjska Banja) (in Serbian, banja denotes a spa town). The study period is from 2014 to 2016. The temperatures of the studied occurrences are in the 30–93.9 °C range and the chemical composition corresponds to the HCO3 − – Na++K+ and SO4 2−, HCO3 − – Na++K+ types of mineral water. One of the objectives was to examine the condition of wellheads (incrustation, biofouling and corrosion), focusing on the presence of phototrophic microorganisms whose metabolites may lead to changes in mineral water quality, yield and chemistry. Analysis by light and scanning electron microscopy provides insight into the diversity of phototrophic microorganisms that populate biofilms near the points of emergence and on wellhead. The research reveals the presence of representatives of three groups of phototrophic microorganisms: Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. Cyanobacteria were the most numerous, dominated by the order Oscillatoriales with ten recorded genera, of which Leptolynbgya and Phormidium feature the largest numbers of species. The order Chroococcales are the second most numerous, with seven recorded genera, of which Gloeocapsa and Synechocystisare the most noteworthy. The largest numbers of representative taxa were noted at Radaljska Banja and Vranjska Banja, where mineral waters originate from Encrustalithostratigraphic units of igneous origin, followed by mineral water occurrences in karst aquifers (Bogatić and Belotić) and an intergranular aquifer (Metković). The smallest number of identified phototrophic microorganisms is noted at Lukovska Banja, where the origin is associated with a fractured aquifer formed in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, with occasional diabase interbeds. Although many representative taxa are found on only one of the studied localities, such as Synechococcus bigranulatus and Pseudanabaena thermalis, those of the genera Leptolyngbya, Phormidium and Cosmarium laeve, as well as genera of the phylum Bacillariophyta, occur at several sampling sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the relationship between documented cyanobacterial and algal taxa and environmental parameters.

Mineralne vode v Srbiji in razvoj fototrofnih mikrobnih združb na mestih izvirov in na ustjih vrtin Fototrofni mikroorganizmi v oblogah termalnih izvirov v Srbiji v preteklosti niso bili deležni posebne pozornosti. V članku predstavljena raziskava je prva, ki obravnava biofilme na izbranih mestih izvirov mineralnih vod v Srbiji (Bogatić, Metković in Belotić v Mačvi ter Radaljska Banja, Lukovska Banja in Vranjska Banja) (v srbskem jeziku je banja izraz za toplice). Preučevanje je potekalo med letoma 2014 in 2016. Temperature obravnavanih voda se gibljejo med 30 in 93,9 °C, glede na kemijsko sestavo pa jih uvrščamo v HCO3 − – Na++ K+ in SO4 2−, HCO3 − – Na++K+ tipe mineralne vode. Eden od ciljev raziskave je bil proučevati razmere na ustjih vrtin (inkrustacija, obrast in korozija) in se še posebej posvetiti navzočnosti fototrofnih mikroorganizmov, katerih metaboliti lahko spremenijo kakovost, izdatnost in kemizem mineralnih vod. Z analizo slik s svetlobnim in vrstičnim elektronskim mikroskopom lahko podrobneje spoznamo raznolikost fototrofnih organizmov, ki sestavljajo biofilme na mestih izvirov in na ustjih vrtin. Raziskava je pokazala obstoj predstavnikov treh skupin fototrofnih mikroorganizmov: cianobakterij ter predstavnikov debel Chlorophyta in Bacillariophyta. Cianobakterije so bile najbolj številčne, prevladovali so osebki reda Oscillatoriales z desetimi ugotovljenimi rodovi, od katerih je bilo največje število vrst iz rodov Leptolynbgya in Phormidium. Red Chroococcales je bil s sedmimi zabeleženimi rodovi drugi najbolj številčen, prevladovala sta Gloeocapsa in Synechocystis. Največreprezentativnih taksonov je bilo v Radaljski Banji in Vranjski Banji, kjer mineralne vode izvirajo iz litostratigrafskih enot vulkanskega izvora, sledijo mineralne vode iz kraškega (Bogatić in Belotić) in medzrnskega vodonosnika (Metković). Najmanjfototrofnih organizmov je bilo v vzorcu iz Lukovske Banje, kjer vode izvirajo iz razpoklinskih vodonosnikov v sedimentnih in metamorfnih kamninah z vmesnimi lečami diabaza. Čeprav soštevilne reprezentativne taksone našli le na eni od proučevanih lokacij, kot na primer Synechococcus bigranulatus in Pseudanabaena thermalis, se tisti iz rodu Leptolyngbya, Phormidium in Cosmarium laeve in predstavniki več rodov, ki pripadajo deblu Bacillariophyta, pojavljajo na več vzorčnih mestih. Za ugotavljanje odvisnosti med taksoni cianobakterij in alg ter okoljskimi parametri so uporabili analizo glavnih komponent.Ključne besede: Srbija, mineralne vode, fototrofni mikroorganizmi, biofilm.",

Air temperature monitoring was also included to quantify the dominant factors affecting the RST. Measurements were taken during the period covering January, 2010 to March, 2012. HOBO air temperature sensors with data loggers were placed in front of the cave entrance, in the entrance corridor and on selected sites in the cave interior. An infrared (IR) thermometer was used to measure the surface temperature of the solid rock. The RST in the cave interior during each season was also recorded by IR camera. The average temperature of the rock surface over the two year period was 6.95 °C. The longterm average of the RST was always 0.01 to 0.79 °C lower than the air temperature. The dynamics of the RST are most obvious at the entrance corridor to the cave, with temperature variability up to 17.34 °C. The dynamism of both the RST and air temperature decrease as the distance from the entrance increases. The lowest RST variability (1.19 °C) was detected at a distance of 271–280 meters from the entrance. The differences in the maximum RST in the monitored profile were relative small, ranging from 7.30 to 8.70 °C. Minimum temperatures in the cold season showed a significant difference among themselves. Changes in rock surface and air temperatures are dominantly influenced by air exchange with the external environment, although the RST may be locally influenced on a short-term basis by other factors, such as attendance and biota. Temperature heterogeneous zones over space in Kateřinská Cave with no air flow were located by thermal imaging. It is therefore an area where unknown spaces or exterior access can be expected.",

Analyzing Ca and Mg with complexometric titration method of rock samples showed very pure total carbonate and exceeds 96.5 %. Rock composition anables development of clear development of rock features, the smallest, as well. The specific rock relief of the mogote bears witness to the gradual denudation of the rock and the transformation of subsoil rock forms into forms carved by rainwater and water creeping down the walls. The article brings new knowledge about special but typical shaping of the rock under dense tropical vegetation, this time under vegetation covering the mogote. On denuded surfaces that emerged from the soil, for this circumstances characteristic rock features develop under the weathered debris that accumulates under dense vegetation.

    "abstract": "The Vendicari coastal lake system (SE Sicily) presents several geomorphic characteristics, which suggest it was originated as a part of a 6 km long karst polje during the Late Pleistocene sea level lowstand. Exhumed cryptokarst karren and terraced concentric surfaces point to this working hypothesis. The generation of this depression could have been favoured by the low to moderate neotectonic activity in the zone, which consisted in slight uplifting and subsequent fracturing. Open joints in the Vendicari Pleistocene carbonates show a radial outline with the prevalence of NNW-SSE discontinuities. Once formed, polje evolution would have consisted in a progressive compartmentalisation and splitting into several polje bottoms, some of which form a part of the present Vendicari lake system and are surrounded by stepped corrosion surfaces. The postglacial sea level rise had drowned most part of the original polje, which can be still recognized in the inner continental shelf. Sea level stabilization after the Holocene eustatic maximum favoured the development of a beach barrier, which generated additional coastal lakes of lagoonal type.",

    "abstract": "Napisi lahko pripomorejo k razjasnitvi nezadostno dokumentirane zgodovine odkrivanja glavnih rovov Postojnske jame. Ta čas je bil povezan s tremi osebami: Josipom Jeršinovičem plemenitim Löwengreif, Alojzom Schaffenrathom in grofom Francem Hohenwartom. Temelječ na sodobnih zapisih Schaffenratha (1834), Hohenwarta (1830, 1832a,b) in Schmidla (1854), avtorji razpravljajo o okoliščinah in času njihovih raziskovanj glavne jame ter menijo, da ta ni bila odkrita do prihoda nadvojvode Ferdinanda avgusta 1819. Eden najstarejših napisov iz tega časa je na kapniškem stebru v Pisanem rovu, 90 m od tam, kjer se odcepi od glavnega rova. Tu je Schaffenrath 1825 zapisal imeni Löwengreifa, Gospodaritscha in svoje. Ta steber je morda edino mesto v Postojnski jami, kjer so vsa tri imena skupaj. Če upoštevamo razmeroma pozne raziskave glavnega rova, je letnica 1825 morda leto odkritja tega dela jame. To potrjuje tudi dejstvo, da tega dela jame ni na prvem objavljenem zemljevidu (Bronn, 1826, temelječ na zemljevidu Foÿker/Schaffenrath iz okoli 1821). 1832 je bil odprt notranji del Pisanega rova in imenovan v čast nadvojvode Janeza. Na steber so dodali še več napisov, več pa jih je tudi dalje po rovu. Iz 1836 je podpis J(ozef) Hauer, to je paleontolog in oče Franca plemenitega Hauerja. Tudi Anton Perko, mlajši brat Ivana Andreja, je zapustil svoje ime. I.A. Perko je podpisan 1892 v Rovu brez imena, v letu preden so on, njegov brat in drugi v Trstu ustanovili študentsko jamarsko društvo “Hades”. Raziskovanje in dokumentiranje zgodovinskih napisov lahko pomaga pri rekonstrukciji in razlagi zgodovine raziskav in odkrivanj te najpomembnejše turistične jame.Inscriptions may help to clarify the incompletely documented early history of the discovery of the main passages in Postojnska jama. This period is associated with three people: Josef (Josip) Jeršinovič Ritter von Löwengreif, Alois Schaffenrath, and Franz Graf von Hohenwart. Based on the contemporary writings of Schaffenrath (1834), Hohenwart (1830, 1832a,b) and Schmidl (1854) the authors discuss the circumstances and timing of the exploration of the main cave, suggesting that the main passage was not discovered until after the visit of Erzherzog Ferdinand in August 1819. One of the earliest inscriptions from that period is found on a column in Pisani rov, 90 m from its branch from the main passage. Here Schaffenrath left in 1825 the names of Löwengreif, of Gospodaritsch, and of himself. This column may be the only site in Postojnska jama featuring all three names in one place. In view of the rather late exploration of the main passage, the date 1825 may be the discovery date of this section of the cave since it does not appear on the earliest map published (Bronn, 1826, based on a map of Foÿker/Schaffenrath ca. 1821). In 1832 the back part of Pisani rov was opened and named in honour of Erzherzog Johann. Several more inscriptions were placed on the column. Further down the passage a few more inscriptions exist. One was dated 1836 by J(ozef) Hauer, a paleontologist and the father of Franz Ritter von Hauer. Also Anton Perko, the younger brother of Ivan Andrej Perko left his name. I.A. Perko signed as well, but in the Rov brez imena, in the year 1892, a year before he, his brother and others founded the student caversʼ club “Hades” in Trieste. Search and documentation of historic inscriptions may therefore aid in reconstructing the exploration and visitation history of this most important show cave.",

Monthly samplings of one permanent and two temporary springs, and one sampling of a spring brook benthos, yielded 23 Copepoda and Ostracoda species. More species (12) were found in the permanent than in the temporary springs (8 and 7), Elaphoidella phreatica (Sars, 1862) being the most frequent in all of them. No correlation was observed between precipitation and drift densities or the numbers of species in the permanent spring. In the temporary springs there were correlations between precipitation and the Shannon diversity index, equitability and changes in community composition. Conductivity of the water was the only physical parameter in the springs that correlated with precipitation. Species accumulation curves reached the asymptotes in all the springs but not for benthos.

V mesečnih vzorčenjih enega stalnega in dveh občasnih izvirov ter enkratnim vzorčenjem bentosa potoka Lipnik smo zbrali 23 vrst ceponožcev in dvoklopnikov. Rezultati raziskave so razkrili, da je bilo več vrst zbranih iz stalnega (12) kot iz občasnih izvirov (8 in 7). V vseh je številčno prevladovala vrsta Elaphoidella phreatica (Sars, 1862). V nobenem izviru ni bilo povezave med padavinami in gostoto plavja ter številom vrst. Povezava pa se je pojavila v občasnih izvirih med padavinami in Shannonovim indeksom in ravnovesjem ter spremembo v sestavi združbe. Edina fizikalna lastnost vode v izvirih, ki je bila v povezavi s padavinami, je bila prevodnost. Krivulje vrstne akumulacije so dosegle asimptoto pri vseh izvirih, v bentosu potoka pa ne.",

The wider area around the springs belongs to two tectonic units. The first is the Pelagonian horst-anticlinorium and is composed of carbonate rocks. The second is the Western Macedonian zone, and it is composed of non-carbonate rocks. The Slatinski Izvor spring is located on the Pelagonian horst anticlinorium, and the Solenica spring is situated on a fault which separates the two tectonic units. The measurements of the temperature, conductivity and the hydrochemical analysis indicate that both springs have different hydrochemical properties. The major cations in the Slatinski Izvor spring were Ca2+ and Mg2+, and anions were HCO3- and SO42-, the water had temporary hardness and it belongs to calcium hydrogencarbonate water type. The Slatinski Izvor spring had typical shallow and fresh water. The major cations in the Solenica spring were Na+ and Ca2+, and anions were Cl- and HCO3-. The water belongs to NaCl water type which is typical of deep ancient ground water.

    "abstract": "Menderes Massive is a NE–SW-trending metamorphic terrain in western Anatolia. The massive is composed of regionally metamorphosed rocks of mica-schist and marble. The Bozdag Mountain is the main horst system in Kucuk Menderes river basin. It is composed of several N-S oriented small horsts and grabens and contains important karst features, such as poljes and sinkholes. Ayvacik and Subatan Poljes are typical closed depressions draining into Ayvacik and Subatan sinkholes (ponors). Both are developed along the N-S directed fault system. The main objective of this study is to determine the karstification and hydrogeochemical features of water circulating in marble terrain and controlled by deep sinkholes in the Bozdag Mountain. Detailed speleological studies demonstrated that the degree of karstification of marble rock depends on the regional tectonic structure, the mineralogy of marble and the water recharge rate into the sinkholes. Tritium isotope and tracer tests indicate very fast flow and connection between Subatan surface water and a spring in lower elevations with high Ca and Mg ion concentration at the south of the study area. Hidrogeologija in hidrokemija marmornega vodonosnika s ponornim točkovnim napajanjem (Masiv Meredes, zahodna Turčija)Masiv Menderes je območje metamorfnih kamnin v zahodni Anatoliji, Turčija. Razteza se v smeri SV–JZ in je sestavljeno predvsem iz regionalno metamorfiziranih sljudnih skrilavcev in marmorjev. Goro Bozdag sestavlja sistem manjših grud in tektonskih jarkov, orientiranih v smeri sever-jug. Masiv je delno zakrasel, s tipičnimi kraškimi oblikami, med katere spadata tudi polji Ayvacik in Subatan, ki se drenirata skozi istoimenske ponore. Obe polji sta razviti v prelomni coni orientirani v smeri sever-jug. Glavni namen opisane raziskave je določiti stopnjo zakraselosti območja in hidrokemične lastnosti vode, ki teče skozi marmornati masiv. Podrobne speleološke raziskave so pokazale, da je zakraselost močno pogojena z regionalno geološko strukturo, mineraloško sestavo marmorja in velikostjo dotokov v ponore. Izotopske analize tritija in sledenje podzemnih voda kažejo na hiter tok in povezavo med poljem Subatan in visoko mineraliziranimi izviri na jugu obravnavanega območja.",

Ker pa imamo na krasu opravka s posebnimi geomorfološkimi izrazi, se nekateri strukturno geološki elementi, ki so na poseben način povezani z določenimi kraškimi oblikami, uporabljajo kot posebni termini, ki so različni od terminov v uporabi na nekraških terenih. Na slovenskem krasu lahko ločimo dva najpomembnejša strukturna elementa, ki sta pomembna za razvoj jamskih rovov, in sicer lezike in tektonske strukture. Med lezikami so za razvoj inicialnih rovov posebno ugodne tektonsko deformirane lezike. V najdaljših slovenskih jamah, kot so Postojnska, Predjama in Škocjanske jame so za razvoj rovov v inicialnih, kot tudi v starejših in mlajših obdobjih zelo ugodni medplastni zmiki, deformacije narivanja in gubanja ter tektonsko pretrte cone (razpoklinske, porušene in zdrobljene).Structural geological studies on karst areas operate with the same structural geological terms as on other geological regions. But because of special geomorphologic terms characterized for karst areas, some structural geological elements, which are in a special way connected with particular karst forms, are used as a special terms, different from those used on non-karstic areas. For Slovene karst we need to divide two most important structural elements that are important for development of cave passages, bedding planes and tectonic structures. And between bedding planes the ones that are tectonically disrupted are very favorable for development of initial cave passages. In the longest Slovene karst caves as Postojnska jama caves, Predjama and Škocjanske jame caves interbedded movements, thrusting and folding deformations, and tectonically broken zones (fissured, broken and crushed zones) are very favorable for initial, and also for older and younger stages of passage development.",

    "abstract": "Predhodno sta bili preučevani razporeditev in raznovrstnost talne favne v vrsti degradiranih ekosistemov v narodnem parku Shilin. Ti ekosistemi vključujejo pet tipov rastlinskega pokrova: 1. naravno grmišče, 2. umetno nasajen cipresov gozd, 3. naravni travnik, 4. drugotni travnik, 5. golo rdečo prst. Na vsakem izmed njih je bila talna favna nabrana s kvadrata velikosti 1 krat 1 m. Živali so bile nabrane ročno ali pa izločene s pomočjo segrevanja. V talni favni so prevladovale acarina, collembola, nematoda, coleoptera in opistopora. Toda razmeroma pogoste so bile tudi skupine enchytraeidae, araneida, lepidoptera in diptera. Indeks raznovrstnosti H je manjši od 1,5 in se močno znižuje vzporedno z degradacijo rastlinstva. V kraških prsteh so med najpogostejšimi parholaspidae. Biomasa trhypochthoniidae in ologamasidae je najbolj zgoščena v naravnem grmišču in kaže veliko občutljivost teh skupin na degradacijo rastlinstva. Razmerje biomase acarina v primerjavi s collembola je v razponu 0.7 do 1.5, kar je veliko odstopanje od podatkov za naravne prsti podobnih geografskih širin, znanih iz literature. Majhna biomasa talne favne in manjša raznovrstnost kažeta, da se habitati v preučevanih prsteh slabšajo in se torej slabša tudi zdravje celega ekosistema. Izsledki tudi kažejo na ranljivost talne favne v prsteh z vidika sonaravnega razvoja parka Shilin.A preliminary study of the distribution and diversity of soil fauna in a sequence of ecosystem degradation in the Shilin National Park, Yunnan, China has been made. The degraded ecologic system includes 5 types of vegetation cover: (1) natural bush; (2) human planted cypress forest; (3)natural grass; (4)secondary grass and (5) bared red earth. A quadrate of 1m×1m in each eco-tessera was sampled for soil fauna collection. The animals were obtained either by picking up or by heat-removing. The soil fauna were dominated by Acarina, Collembola, Nematode, Coleoptera,and Opistopora in these soils. However, Erchytraeidae, Araneida, Lepidoptera and Diptera were also common groups. The diversity index H turned to be less than 1.5, drastically decreasing with the vegetation degradation trend. In the karst soils, Parholaspidae was one of the most populous among the mites. The biomass of Trhypochthoniidae and Ologamasidae was very concentrated in the natural bush ecosystem, showing high sensitivity of mites to vegetation degradation. The biomass ratio of Acarina to Collembola in the studied soils ranged from 0.70 to 1.50, which was in great discrepancy to the results reported of the natural soils at similar latitude. The small soil fauna biomass and less diversity indicated that the studied soil was in a state of deterioration of soil fauna habitats and, in turn, the soil ecosystem health. The results also evidenced that the soil fauna in the karst soil was definitely vulnerable as regarded to the sustainable development of the Shilin Park.",

    "abstract": "Downstream of the Plitvice Lakes National Park, water that pass through the water system of the lakes begins its flow as the Korana River. A few hundred meters downstream of the source zone, during the summer dry periods, there are losses of water in the riverbed resulting in its total drying. The sinking zone in that area is built of high permeable carbonate rocks and with the appearance of less permeable dolomite rocks, about 17 km downstream, the Korana River becomes a permanent river. This paper focuses on the explanation of hydrogeological relations in the zone where losses of water occur in the riverbed, relationship to the neighbouring Una River catchment, as well as possibilities of relocating the source of water supply from the Kozjak Lake (Plitvice Lakes) to the new site in the sinking zone of the Korana River. For this purpose hydrogeological researches were performed, with drilling of several piezometric boreholes and two tracing tests to determine the direction of groundwater flow during the dry season. The results show that during the dry periods in the sinking zone of the Korana River the groundwater level with active aquifer is about 25 m below the riverbed. This opens up the possibility of additional research to solve the problem of water-supply and relocation of water-supply capture in this area. Two tracing tests showed a connection with the Klokot spring (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the neighbouring Una River catchment, which points to the transboundary character of this aquifer. At the source of the Klokot minimum discharge is around 3 m3/s and the maximum more than 75 m3/s. The capturing of about 60 l/s for water-supply in the Korana River sinking zone will not have impact on the amount of discharge at the Klokot spring.Key words: Dinaric karst, Korana River sinking zone, Plitvice Lakes, tracing test, transboundary aquifer, groundwater capturing.Hidrogeologija ponornega območja reke Korane dolvodno od Plitviških jezer, HrvaškaDolvodno od Nacionalnega parka Plitviška jezera vode, ki tečejo skozi sistem jezer, oblikujejo reko Korano. Nekaj sto metrov pod to izvirno cono v času poletnih sušnih obdobij voda v strugi ponika in s časom povsem presahne. Ponorno cono gradijo zelo dobro prepustne karbonatne kamnine in šele po prehodu na manj prepustne dolomite približno 17 km nižje po strugi Korana postane stalna reka. V članku so obravnavane hidrogeološke razmere v coni ponikanja vode v strugi in odnosi s sosednjim porečjem reke Une, pa tudi možnosti prestavitve vira oskrbe s pitno vodo iz jezera Kozjak (Plitviška jezera) na novo lokacijo v ponorni coni reke Korane. V ta namen so bile izvedene hidrogeološke raziskave, izvrtanih je bilo več piezometrskih vrtin in izvedena sta bila dva sledilna poskusa za določitev smeri podzemnega toka v času nizkih vod. Rezultati so pokazali, da je v sušnih obdobjih v ponorni coni reke Korane nivo podzemne vode z aktivnim vodonosnikom približno 25 m pod strugo. To odpira možnost dodatnih raziskav za rešitev problema oskrbe z vodo in prestavitve zajetja vode na tem območju. Oba sledilna poskusa sta dokazala povezavo z izvirom Klokot (Bosna in Hercegovina) v sosednjem porečju reke Une, kar kaže na čezmejni značaj vodonosnika. Minimalni pretok izvira Klokot je približno 3 m3/s, maksimalni pa več kot 75 m3/s. Zajetje za oskrbo z vodo v ponorni coni reke Korane z izdatnostjo približno 60 l/s ne bo imelo vpliva na pretok izvira Klokot.Ključne besede: Dinarski kras, ponorna cona reke Korane, Plitviška jezera, sledilni poskus, čezmejni vodonosnik, zajetje podzemne vode.",

The results show that: (1) the significant temporal variations for major element concentrations and δ13CDIC of groundwater in different months were observed, especially, of which the groundwater showed significant high concentrations of DIC, Ca2+, Mg2+, NO3−, SO42− and δ13CDIC in rainy season and fertilizing period in the QURS; (2) the contributions of carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid to total concentrations of (Ca2++Mg2+) and HCO3− of groundwater in different months averaged 68.5 % and 81.0 %, respectively.

    "abstract": "Formacija Sarvak je najbolj zakrasela formacija v skupini Bagestan, SZ od mesta Pol-e Dokhtar. Njeno južno krilo je zakraselo in najpomembnejše za talno vodo. Za oskrbo s pitno vodo mesta Pol-e Dokhtar, so bili izvrtani trije vodnjaki. Opravljen je bil črpalni (72 ur). Analize kisika-18 in devterija kažejo na meteorni izvor vode. Voda iz vodnjaka W1 ima minimalno, iz W3 pa maksimalno koncentracijo tricija, kar kaže na različen rezidenčni čas, kemične analize pa, da gre za vode tipa Ca&gt;Mg&gt;Na in HCO3 &gt;SO4 &gt;Cl. Med samim vrtanjem so imeli vzorci vode relativno veliko količino NO3 (27 mg/l), ki se je, zaradi zavarovanja področja pred kmetijsko dejavnostjo, znižala. Mesto Pol-e Dokhtar, ki je imelo resne težave z oskrbo s pitno vodo že izpred časov islamske republike, teh zdaj nima več, zahvaljujoč predstavljeni raziskavi.The Sarvak formation is the most karstified formation of the Bageston group, NW from town Pol-e Dokhtar. Its southern limb is karstified and the most important for the ground water. Three wells were drilled for supplying the drinking water to Pol-e Dokhtar. The pumping test (72 hours) was carried out. Analyses of oxygen-18 and deuterium indicated that the water is of meteoric origin. Water from the well1 has the minimal and from the well3 maximal concentrations of tritium which indicate different residence time. Chemical analyses show that the water is of Ca&gt;Mg&gt;Na and HCO3&gt;SO4&gt;Cl type. During the drilling water samples had relatively high NO3 (27 mg/l), which was reduced due to the protection of the area from agricultural activities. Due to this study, the town of Pol-e Dokhtar, which was facing serious problem of drinking water since before the Islamic Republic of Iran, has been solved.",

    "abstract": "V času med eocenom in pliocenom so bile s temena krednega apnenčevega antiklinorija v osrednjem in zahodnem delu planote Kras in s kozinsko-podgrajske antiklinale erodirane flišne plasti, zaradi česar se je ob splošnem zniževanju okoliške ravnine ob pogojih zajezenega krasa razširjal in zniževal ravnik na razkritih apnencih. Največji del planote Krasa predstavlja najstarejši del kraškega ravnika. Na Krasu so se v pliocenu in kvartarju pasovi ravnika hitreje zniževali v smeri proti SZ, vmesno zastajajoče ali dvigujoče se površje pa je s tem dobilo obliko vzpetin na severozahodnem robu planote. Zaradi hitrejšega grezanja vipavske sinklinale so vodni tokovi prenehali teči preko planote Krasa še preden je bil fliš, ki jim je preprečeval pot proti jugu, odstranjen zaradi grezanja severnega dela Tržaškega zaliva. Zaradi tega na Krasu ni slepih dolin ali polj. Pač pa je veliko vrtač, površje je kamnito, zaradi česar je iz Krasa nastal splošni pojem kras. Obe značilnosti sta tipični za submediteranske dinarske kraške ravnike, gosto naseljene in obdelane ter zaradi tega brez gozdovBetween Eocene and Pliocene, erosion of flysch strata on the top of Cretaceous limestone anticlinorium in the central and western part of the Kras plateau and the Kozina-Podgrad anticline uncovered and widened – and simultanously lowered - the karst plain in the conditions of dammed karst. The largest portion of Kras plateau is covered with karst plain, its oldest part. In Pliocene, the karst plain was fractured and subsided towards the NW regardless of older folded structure; during this process, several zones of elevations were formed through slower subsiding or uplifting. Due to faster lowering of the Vipava syncline, water streams stopped running over the Kras plateau before the flysch, damming the waters from the Kras plateau to the south was removed due to the subsiding in the northern Gulf of Trieste. Thus, no fossil blind valleys or poljes are found on the Kras plateau. However, there is considerable density of dolines and the surface is stony, giving the karst its original name. Both phenomena are typical of deforrested, densely populated and cultivated Submediterranean Dinaric karst plains.",

Ugotovila sem, da je njihov izvor v mehkih belih conah preperele karbonatne kamnine s sten jamskih rovov. Preperele cone apnenca in dolomita nastajajo na jamskih stenah, kadar nanje deluje selektivna korozija. Nepopolno raztapljanje pripravi karbonatno kamnino na mehansko erozijo in transport njenih trdnih delcev. Kjer je preperela karbonatna kamnina v stiku z vodo, tekočo ali kapljajočo, ta lahko trga njene, s selektivnim raztapljanjem izpostavljene delce. Voda jih odnaša naprej po rovih, ko transportna moč vode pade, se delci usedajo v obliki drobnozrnatega karbonatnega sedimenta velikostnega reda gline, melja in drobnega peska.In many samples of cave clastic sediments the high amount of carbonate clasts is significant. It was found out that their origin is usually in soft white zones of weathered carbonate rock on cave walls. Weathered zones of limestone or dolomite form on the cave walls when the selective corrosive is going on. Incomplete dissolution prepares the carbonate rock for the mechanical erosion and transport of its particles. Where the weathered carbonate rock is in contact with water, both flowing and dripping, it may tear off the particles resulting from selective corrosion. Water carries them along cave passages and when its transporting power decreases, particles accumulate in the form of a fine-grained autochthonous carbonate deposit, in size of clay, silt or fine sand.",

    "abstract": "Za vsak program monitoringa v jamah je nujno potreben predhodni popis vseh bistvenih lastnosti nekega procesa. Monitoring ni sam sebi namen, pač pa je del integriranega procesa, osnovanega na bistvenih lastnostih upravljalskega procesa. Nujno je, da vemo, kaj v jami je res pomembno, da poznamo pogoje, v katerih lahko to pomembnost ohranimo in, da so tako ohranjeni pogoji celota vseh pomembnih dejavnikov. Na primer, če ne poznamo mehanizma odlaganja blatnih sedimentov, potem monitoring stanja kapnikov ne bo preprečil ponovnega odlaganja blata, ki smo ga sicer odstranili s pranjem pod visokim pritiskom. Podobno nima nobenega smisla merjenje temperature, če je prah glavna gro‘nja pomembnim elementom. Edini način, po katerem spoznamo, da je monitoring uspešen je ta, da merimo značilnosti in celovitost pomembnih elementov. Sicer lahko zberemo veliko pomembnih podatkov, najpomembnejše oblike pa nam medtem propadejo. Zato se mora monitoring nanašati na nujne okoliščine, pri katerih še lahko ohranimo bistvene značilnosti ter na sprotno stanje in celovitost pomembnih značilnosti.An inventory survey followed by a significance assessment process, are essential precursors to any cave monitoring program. Monitoring must not be seen as an end in itself, but as part of an integrated, significance- based management process. It is essential to know what is significant, the conditions necessary to maintain its significance and that the condition and integrity of significant elements are being maintained. For instance, if the significance of a mud deposit is not known, monitoring the condition of speleothems will not stop the mud deposit from being destroyed by high-pressure water cleaning. Similarly, there is little point in monitoring temperature if dust is the main threat to the significant elements. The only way to know that monitoring of environmental conditions is effective is to monitor the ongoing condition and integrity of the significant elements themselves. Without this, lots of interesting data could be collected while the most important features of the cave are lost. Monitoring should therefore address the conditions necessary for the maintenance of significance and the ongoing condition and integrity of significant elements.",

Obe jezeri sta poplavljeni le del leta, tako da travnate površine v poletnem času praviloma omogočajo vsakoletni pridelek sena. Palško jezero in obrežje Petelinjskega jezera sta primerna za pašo. V gospodarskem pogledu sta jezeri bili in sta še vedno vezani na vzrejo živine. Kmetovanje na tem področju v današnjem času ne prinaša dobička, zato se bo v prihodnosti krajina ohranila taka kot je le, če bo država namenila kmetijski dejavnosti dovolj denarne pomoči. Na jezero je bila do srede dvajsetega stoletja vezana še ena gospodarska dejavnost, in sicer ledarstvo. Dodatni dopolnilni dejavnosti, ki sta pogojeni z jezerom, sta lov in nabiralništvo. Petelinjci in Palčani so bili v preteklosti prisiljeni svoji jezeri deliti z avstroogrsko, italijansko in jugoslovansko vojsko, ki so za seboj pustile še danes vidne sledi. Jezeri s svojo nenavadno in nadvse slikovito naravo domačinom predstavljata kraj miru in sprostitve. People of Petelinje and Palčje have adapted to the ever-changing nature of the intermittent karstic lakes through the centuries. Both lakes are filled with water only a part of the year, so that the grassy areas usually provide a yearly harvest of hay. Palško jezero and the shores of Petelinjsko jezero are suitable for pasturing. Economically the lakes were and still are connected with raising livestock. Agriculture is now no longer profitable, so the only way to preserve the land is by the state devoting enough money for agriculture. The lake was connected to another economic activity until the middle of the 20th century, ice making. Additional supplementary activities dependent on the lake are hunting and gathering. Petelinje and Palčje villagers had to share their lakes with the Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Yugoslav armies in the past; they left traces that can still be seen today. The lakes, with their unusual and highly picturesque nature, represent a place of peace and relaxation to the locals.",

    "abstract": "Folk tales and tradition evidence that people in Udin Boršt were aware of caves from old. In the 19th century a special type of outlaws occurred in Gorenjska. One of the centres was in Udin Boršt where brigands hid in caves. Under the French occupation the villagers hid in the caves, while during the 2nd World War they were partisans. Water is another factor playing an important role at studying Udin Boršt. Most of the villages were water supplied from Udin Boršt, partly out of caves. As elsewhere in conglomerates in Udin Boršt also there are traces of rock cutting for millstones. The first printed news about the caves in Udin Boršt are found in Valvasor’s Die Ehre des Herzothums Crain. The book History of the Ljubljana Bishop’s Diocese cites seven caves. The modern caving research started in 1946. In 1954 the members of the Natural Science Circle of the 1st Grammar School, Kranj started to visit caves in Udin Boršt. About that time a co-worker of the Karst Research Institute from Postojna started to research these caves. The caves in Udin Boršt were revisited in the seventieth of the past century in connection with the project “Speleological Map of Slovenia”. The connection between the people and the land can be seen from the topographical names too. The last part of the paper deals with these names, including the explanation of the name Udin Boršt. Da so ljudje jame v Udin borštu že dolgo poznali, se odraža v ljudskem blagu in izročilu. V 19. stol. je nastalo rokovnjaštvo. Eno od središč je bilo v Udin borštu, kjer so se rokovnjači skrivali po jamah. Pred Francozi so se skrivali po jamah tudi vaščani, med II. svetovno vojno pa partizani. Drugi dejavnik, ki je igral veliko vlogo pri spoznavanju jam v Udin borštu, je voda. Večina vasi je dobivala vodo iz Udin boršta, deloma iz jam. Kot drugod v konglomeratu, so tudi v Udin borštu sledi lomljenja kamine za mlinske kamne. Prva tiskana vest o jamah v Udin borštu je v Valvasorjevem delu »Slava vojvodine Kranjske«. V Zgodovini fara Ljubljanske škofije je omenjenih sedem jam. Sodobno jamarsko raziskovanje se je pričelo leta 1946. 1954 so pričeli obiskovati jame v Udin borštu člani Prirodoslovnega krožka I. gimnazije iz Kranja. V istem času se je raziskovanja teh jam lotil sodelavec Inštituta za raziskovanje krasa SAZU iz Postojne. Jame v Udin borštu so bile ponovno obiskane sredi sedemdesetih let prejšnjega stoletja, v okviru velikega projekta »Speleološka karta Slovenije«. Povezanost človeka z zemljo se vidi tudi iz krajevnih in ledinskih imen. Zadnji del prispevka se ukvarja s temi imeni, vključno z razlago imena Udin boršt.",

J. Sigrist-Herder of Switzerland was one of those who visited the cave and he compiled an album containing contemporary publications and also 25 photographs by Francesco Benque of Trieste, 15 of which are published here for the first time. They show the 1891 festivities as well as scenes at the cave entrances and in the dolines. The visit is described here from newspaper articles by Sigrist-Herder supplemented by publications of the DÖAV. A comparison is made with a similar visit in 1885 when less of the cave had been explored. In 1891 the visitors were taken to Müllerjeva dvorana but a few people went along the walls as far as Dvorana planinskega društva, only discovered in 1887.Po občnem zboru 1891 je Nemško-avstrijsko planinsko društvo (Deutsche und Österreichische Alpenverein - DÖAV) pripravilo obisk svoje Obalne sekcije (Section Küstenland) v Trstu, ki je takrat živahno raziskovalo Škocjanske jame. J. Sigrist-Herder iz Švice, ki je bil eden izmed obiskovalcev, je sestavil album fotorafij iz tedanjih publikacij, vključno 25 posnetkov Francesca Benque iz Trsta. 15 izmed teh slik je tu prvič objavljenih. Prikazujejo praznovanje leta 1891 in prizore iz jamskega vhoda ter iz dolin. Prispevek se opira na Sigrist-Herderjeve časopisne članke in na tiske DÖAV. Avtor primerja te dogodke s podobnim obiskom iz 1885, ko je bil raziskan šele manjši del jam. 1891 so obiskovalce peljali do Müllerjeve dvorane, nekaj pa jih je šlo dalje po stenah do Dvorane planinskega društva, odkrite šele 1887.",

    "abstract": "Prenekatere jame v karbonatnih sekvencah (in morda tudi drugod) izkazujejo opazno prostorsko organizacijo, pri čemer je poudarjeno kopičenje rovov v prostoru (drugega nad drugim). Mnoge starejše razlage tega zgoščevanja vključujejo “recentno” dogajanje in medsebojne vplive. Nove ideje, ki temeljijo na proučevanju “denudiranih” ali ”brezstropih” jam, pripisujejo velik pomen pojavom in odnosom, ki so sicer znani že dolgo, a so jih raziskovalci puščali ob strani kot “neznačilne”, “nepomembne” ali celo “nemogoče”, ob enem pa jih interpretirajo na novo. Tako je potrebno nekatere uveljavljene razlage trodimenzionalnega kopičenja rovov popolnoma prevetriti. Opazovanja ne podpirajo privzetka, da vsaka stratigrafska (lezika) ali tektonska (razpoka) nezveznost že sama po sebi odpira vodi pot in in je zato samodejno žarišče nastajanja kraških kanalov. V svojem prvotnem, “pred-jamskem” stanju - ko so posamezne votline v kamnini zgolj možne - karbonatne gmote niso nujno hidrološko aktivne, niti niso geološko homogene. Nova opazovanja in prevrednotenje starejšega znanja nakazujejo, da se “začetje” bodočih rovov odvije samo na majhni podmnožici vseh lezik, ki so priviligirane že v začetku in že od kraja odrejajo smernice bodočemu razvoju kanalov. Spoznanje te temeljne vloge kaže možno pot k razumevanju organizacije jamskih sistemov in kliče po podaljšanju spelogenetske časovne lestvice prav v čas diageneze.Many caves within carbonate (and perhaps other) rock sequences display marked spatial organization, particularly a tendency to group within vertical clusters. Most past explanations of clustering involve “recent” effects and interactions. New ideas, based on study of “denuded” or “unroofed” caves, acknowledge but reinterpret features and relationships that were observed long ago and commonly dismissed as “atypical”, “irrelevant” or “impossible”. Some traditional explanations of vertical clustering must now be re-assessed. Assumptions that any stratigraphical (bedding plane) or joint/fault fissure in carbonate rock provides (or provided) a de facto route for fluid transfer, and hence a focus for void development, are not confirmed by observation. Primitive pre-cave, but potentially cavernous, carbonate masses are not inevitably active hydrologically; nor are they geologically homogeneous. New evidence, and re-evaluation of earlier observations, implies that dissolutional void “inception” is related to a minor subset of all stratigraphical partings, which dominate initially, imprinting incipient guidance for later cave development. Recognition of this fundamental role provides a possible key to understanding the organization of cave systems and necessitates acceptance of an expansion of speleogenetic timescales back to the time of diagenesis.",

Raziskave prsti so bile usmerjene predvsem v določanje pH in merjenje vsebnosti kalcija. To je pomembno za nadaljnje raziskave o vsebnosti težkih kovin v prsti. Vegetacijske raziskave so obsegale vodno bilanco, reakcijo prsti in njihovo kategorizacijo z vidika varstva narave. Posredni človekov vpliv na to kraško ozemlje se kaže v splošnem zniževanju pH. To pa je manjše v vrtačah, ker imajo te prsti razmeroma visoko vsebnost kalcija. Pravilnost zaščite tega kraškega območja opravičujejo rastlinske združbe z visokim deležem zaščitenih vrst med spremljajočimi vrstami. Raziskave potrjujejo, da je nujno ohraniti sedanje stanje, za kar pa je potrebna ustrezna zaščita.Earlier studies on the karst in Western Mecsek have already shown that this area is worth protection due to its quite well preserved natural state. In consequence, declaring the karstic territory with its wider environment as a protected area is being considered in the Danube-Drava Natural Park. In order to prove the almost untouched natural state of an area good starting point is to examine its soil and flora. Soil studies focus on determining the pH, detecting any tendency of a shift towards lower pH values and on examining the carbonate content. In the future measurements to check the heavy metal content that are especially suitable for showing the levels of anthropogenic contamination will be added to these studies. Investigations on the flora based on the examination of water balance, soil reaction and determination of the rank according to the categories of nature conservation value offer a support to the claim of being protected. The results show that indirect anthropogenic effects can be detected by the pH shift towards lower values, but the same tendency of turning acidic is less characteristic in dolines which are the most sensitive points of karstic fields. However, the relatively high carbonate content favours the resistance against felling pH values. Examining the vegetation, and paying special attention to the ranking into nature conservation categories, a significantly high ratio of association - forming and accompanying species and the presence of protected species in relatively high numbers can be seen that proves the nature conserving feature of the territory. On the basis of the investigations carried out the maintenance of the present state of the territory is a desirable objective and in order to realize it the protection of the area is absolutely justified.",

    "abstract": "In the Slovenian part of the Gulf of Trieste/Trst, submarine springs occur as funnel-shaped depressions in the Holocene sandy-silt marine sediment that forms the seafloor. These springs exhibit both elevated temperatures (up to 29.6 °C) and sulphur content. Based on their location, they are divided into three groups: the Izola group (three springs), the Bele skale group (two springs), and the Ronek group (seven springs). Previous investigations linked these springs to the Izola anticline, characterized by its limestone core and flysch limbs, but no detailed explanation was provided. We propose that: A) sulphur groundwater springs from the limestone (karstic aquifer) at the stratigraphic boundary with the flysch and B) springs occur in the nearshore area, where the sedimentary cover of Quaternary deposits is thin enough to be penetrated by spring waters and washed out. According to existing data, the anticline axis is NW-SE directed, and the Izola group lies approximately on the seaward extension of the axis. Therefore, this interpretation fits perfectly for the Izola group, while the Ronek and Bele skale groups are off-axis extensions and require reinterpretation. In order to resolve the micro-locations of the Ronek and Bele skale groups, we conducted a sedimentological logging of the flysch deposits and detailed geological mapping. The investigations revealed that: A) limestone outcrops occur only in the town of Izola, B) two prominent calciturbidite megabeds that occur in the flysch enable very detailed geological mapping, and C) the axis of the Izola anticline is oriented in the WNW-ESE direction, and this moderate anti-clockwise rotation of the anticline axis explains the micro locations of all springs. The Ronek and Bele skale groups are located on the southern side, and the Izola group is on the northern side of the limestone core of the Izola anticline.",

    "abstract": "Protecting groundwater in karst aquifers is extremely impor­tant. Vulnerability maps can greatly help proper decision mak­ing based on physical environmental attributes that influence how easily a contaminant applied to the land surface can reach groundwater due to anthropogenic activities, and the proper­ties of the contaminants. Methods for determining vulnerabil­ity based on the COST Action 620 Approach, when applied in the study area, may lead to contradictory results. The main purpose of this study is to provide an overview of academic research on intrinsic karst aquifer vulnerability methodologies applied in South American and Caribbean countries. Secondly, it describes studies related to karst aquifers that, in some cases, lack specific information on intrinsic vulnerability. The objec­tive is to encourage and to help develop specific methods for determining karst vulnerability in these regions. To achieve these purposes, a systematic literature review was conducted including studies conducted at institutions such as universities, national water institutes, and by geological services. Several methods have been used in the region such as COP, DRAS­TIC, RISK, EPIK, PI, PaPRIka, and the Slovene Approach. And some attempts have been made to develop a specific methodol­ogy that best suits the specificities of the region’s karst aqui­fers. South America and the Caribbean have almost 5 % of the world´s carbonate rocks. Some countries have large extensions of their territory covered by karst rocks, such as Peru, 15.4 %; Cuba, 67 %; and Mexico 25.29 %. Estimates indicate that more than 10 million people use water from karst systems in Mexico. In Cuba, 33 % of all available water volume originates from groundwater, and 91.51 % from karst aquifers. In Mexico, 13 studies have been conducted on the importance of karst aqui­fers, which mostly address the Yucatan Peninsula, followed by Brazil (9 studies), Cuba (5), Colombia (1) and Peru (1). Infor­mation about the theme is scarce in most of the other countries in the region. Some studies have incongruent results given the regional characteristics of tropical karst.",

    "abstract": "The epikarsts of five covered karst areas in the Bakony region are compared. The comparison is based on the specific resistances of the bedrock resistance averages measured by vertical electrical sounding (VES). The average largest specific resistance differences (per area) and the mean values (per profile) were calculated to investigate the characteristics of the epikarst. The mean values of specific resistance were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine whether the specific resistances of the areas showed significant differences. The studied karst areas can be categorised as high or low specific resistance areas, and the ANOVA method could be applied to three areas based on the available data. It can be concluded that the mean values of their specific resistances are significantly different. The mean values and standard deviation of the specific resistances of the different areas were analysed. It is described that the karst receives less water in the case of areas with lower specific resistance, while it receives more water in the case of areas with higher specific resistance. Areas with a high specific resistance are less karstified, while areas with a low specific resistance are more karstified. Low specific resistances and small mean values indicate a higher degree of cavity formation in the epikarst, while the decrease in mean values and standard deviation indicates increasing uniformity of the degree of cavity formation in the epikarst. The different degree of cavity formation is explained by the different karstification rates and the exposure of different time of certain areas.",

    "abstract": "The formation of karst caves in Caledonide metamorphic limestones in a repeatedly-glaciated 40000km2 region in cen­tral Scandinavia was initiated by tectonic inception, a process in which open fracture routes, primarily created by deglacial seismicity, provided the opportunity for subsequent dissolution and enlargement into cave passages in both deglacial and inter­glacial environments. The tectonic inception model built on re­ports of a ‘partially detached’ thin upper crustal layer in similar settings in Scotland and this paper shows that the present maxi­mum subsurface cave distance (i.e. the distance of a passage to the nearest land surface) is commonly less than one-eighth of the depth of the local glaciated valley. This suggests that frac­ture generation was related to the scale of isostatic uplift and was partly determined by the magnitude of seismicity caused by the differential pressure change and differential uplift that occurred along valley walls as the ice margin of each of the ma­jor Pleistocene icesheets receded from west to east. The maxi­mum one-eighth relationship is also commonly maintained in other Caledonide marble terranes in Scandinavia, Scotland and New England (USA), suggesting that many of the caves in these areas were formed by similar processes.",

    "abstract": "A large karst doline at section Hrastje – Lešnica in the Dolenjska region (SE Slovenia) was uncovered during the construction of Slovene highway No. A2. Its fill consists of brownish-yellow clay to silt with plant remains and ferrugineous coatings after root casts and gastropods (paleosol horizon) in the bottom, and overlying thick lacustrine laminated grey clayey sediments which were partly rubified. Brownish-yellow clay to silt contains quartz, chlorite, muscovite and feldspars transported as external clastic material from evolved karst and non-carbonate landscapes from surroundings into the site. The material is well weathered only in the area of the paleosol horizon. The strongly impoverished malacocoenosis indicates any Quaternary warm phase characterized by light semi-open forest with patches of open ground habitats. Only the last paleomagnetic sample in the bottom of sediment sequence shows reverse polarity of magnetic field and represents the geomagnetic excursion, i.e., the Blake excursion at ca 120–112 ka (MIS 5e), rather than Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at 0.78 Ma (MIS 19). Thick lacustrine laminated grey clayey sediments above are also dominated by quartz, muscovite, chlorite and feldspar. That overlying sediment was almost unweathered (content of feldspars, muscovite and chlorite); it was only slightly rubified on its surface, in middle part of the section and at the contact with the underlying karstified limestone slope of the depression. The grey sediment has a different mineralogical composition than underlying soils (e.g., lack of quartz, chlorite) and non-carbonate residue of the host limestone. Therefore, the grey sediments could not serve as a parent (source) material for terra rossa formation in the broader area (i.e., polygenetic red soils developed in paleoclimate related to current Mediterranean climatic conditions). Laminated grey sediment was deposited in a rather cold climate. Relatively poor palynospectra may indicate transport of pollen grains out of the depocentre with flowing water and/or the rapid deposition. The latter is supported by insufficiently centered paleosecular variations. Plant assemblages indicate that the dominant cover of the surrounding landscape was temperate climatic zone riparian forest with some quite humid environment as wetlands and ponds on periodically flooded plain. The regional correlation, based especially on an abundance of Fagus, indicates the deposition at the beginning of the last glacial cycle (Würmian) in its warmer substage – MIS 5c (ca 105–95 ka). All paleomagnetic samples from this part of the sediment section show normal magnetization and negligible clockwise rotation of 1.8° ± 4.7°.Key words: karst sediments, mineralogy, gastropods, palynology, paleomagnetism, paleoenvironment, Dolenjska region, Slovenia.Pozno pleistocenski jezerski sedimenti in njihova povezava z rdečimi tlemi na severovzhodnem robu Dinarskega krasa Na Dolenjskem krasu je bila med graditvijo trase A2 slovenskega avtocestnega križa na odseku Hrastje–Lešnica razgaljena večja vrtača. V spodnjem delu je bila povsem zapolnjena z rjavkastorumenim sedimentom glinene do meljaste frakcije, v zgornjem delu pa z debelim zaporedjem laminiranega sivega glinenega sedimenta, ki je bil ponekod rahlo rubificiran. Rjavkasto rumeni glineni do meljasti sediment na dnu vrtače, v katerem so posamezni rastlinski ostanki, s koreninami povezane ferigene skorje in gastropodi (paleotalni horizont), vsebuje kremen, klorit, muskovit in plagioklaze. Ti so bili preneseni v vrtačo kot klastični material z bližnjih območij razvijajočega se kraškega in nekarbonatnega (fluvialnega) površja. Dobro preperel material je le v območju paleotalnega horizonta. Močno osiromašena malakocenoza nakazuje eno od toplih faz kvartarja, ko so prevladovali svetli gozdovi z redkimi drevesi in jasami odprtih talnih habitatov. Samo zadnji od paleomagnetnih vzorcev na dnu raziskanega sedimentnega zaporedja kaže reverzno polarnost magnetnega polja. Menimo, da ta reverzna polarnost kaže na t. i. Blakeovo geomagnetno ekskurzijo pred cca 120.000 in 112.000 leti (MIS 5e) in ne meje Brunhes/Matuyama pred 780.000 leti (MIS 19). Tudi v debelem zaporedju sivih laminiranih glinastih jezerskih sedimentov prevladujejo med minerali kremen, muskovit, klorit in glinenci. Glede na ohranjenost glinenih mineralov, muskovita in klorita sklepamo, da so ti sedimenti skoraj neprepereli; rahlo so rubificirani le na površju, v osrednjem delu profila in na stiku z zakraselo podlago vrtače. Mineraloška sestava sivih sedimentov je drugačna kot v spodaj ležečem talnem horizontu, kjer je manj kremena in klorita, razlikuje pa se tudi od nekarbonatnega preperinskega ostanka apnenčaste prikamnine. Kot tak torej siv sediment ni izvorni material na sosednjih območjih pogoste terre rosse (poligenetska rdeča tla, razvita v pleoklimatskih razmerah, podobnih današnjemu mediteranskemu podnebju). Laminirani sedimenti so se odložili v razmeroma hladnem obdobju. Dokaj siromašen palinospekter lahko kaže po eni strani, da so bila pelodna zrna odstranjena iz depocentra s tekočo vodo, po drugi pa na visoko hitrost sedimentacije. V prid temu procesu pritrjujejo tudi premalo centrirane paleosekularne variacije. Rastlinske združbe nakazujejo, da je bila bližnja okolica v glavnem porasla z obrežnimi gozdovi zmernega podnebnega pasu, kjer so se v humidnih obdobjih poplavljenih ravnic občasno pojavljala tudi mokrišča in manjše ojezeritve. Regionalne korelacije, ki temeljijo predvsem na veliki količini pelodov bukve (Fagus) kažejo, da so se sivi glinasti sedimenti odlagali v toplejšem obdobju na začetku zadnjega poledenitvenega cikla (Würm) med t. i. MIS 5c pred okoli 105.000 do 95.000 leti. Vsi paleomagnetni vzorci tega dela sedimentnega profila kažejo normalno magnetizacijo in zanemarljivo rotacijo 1,8° ± 4,7° v smeri urinega kazalca.Ključne besede: kraški sedimenti, mineralogija, polži, palinologija, paleomagnetizem, paleookolje, Dolenjska, Slovenija.",

    "abstract": "Integrated geophysical methods were used to investigate the geological conditions of karst collapses in Aotou, Conghua District, Guangzhou City. Based on audio frequency magnetotelluric (AMT) soundings, high-density electric signals and microtremors, a series of features, including the soil structure and thickness, faults, and hidden karst, were detected from shallow to deep subsurface regions in three-dimensional (3-D) space. These were then compared with geologic and drilling data. The measurements of micro-vibrations and high-density electric signals revealed that the strata in the collapsed area consists of clay and medium-grain sand, which is approximately 8–15 m thick and arranged as a multiple-element structure. The AMT soundings uncovered a hidden structure in the subsurface, which lies at the core of a syncline and adjacent to a contact zone between soluble limestone and non-soluble granite. Combined with the geologic data, the survey using the high-density electric method also showed that the study area hosts the Shidengzi Formation from the Datang Stage of the lower Carboniferous, which contain carbonaceous micrite and dolomitic limestone, locally intercalated with thin quartz siltstone, with well-developed karst. Collectively, the soil structure, hidden structure in the subsurface, and karst development provide the primary conditions for collapses. The main triggering factors for the karst collapses are seasonal variations in groundwater levels and excessive groundwater withdrawals. These results can provide guidance for the selection and application of geophysical methods for the examination of this issue in other areas with similar geology.",

    "abstract": "There are few milestones in speleobiology, and Proteus anguinus, commonly named the olm, proteus or “human fish”, is undoubtedly part of its (hi)story. The animal was first mentioned in 1689 by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor (Janez Vajkard Valvasor) in his The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola (Slava Vojvodine Kranjske). The scientific name Proteus anguinus was given by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The animal gained the interest of the scientific community later in the 19th century, culminating in 1859 in Charles Darwin's famous monograph On the Origin of Species as an example of evolutionary reduction of body structures through disuse. The study of this remarkable animal intensified in the 20th century. Its longevity, its general peculiarity and the mystery governing the underground world of the Dinaric karst triggered more systematic research. Much interesting data was obtained from study of proteus in captivity in various laboratories worldwide, including Slovenia, France, England, Belgium, Hungary, Germany and Italy. In the 21st century, the year 2019 represents another important milestone in the research of proteus. The draft genome of Proteus anguinus was first publicly presented on 25 November 2019 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The event coincided with 330 years since proteus was introduced to the scientific community by Valvasor, 160 years since its popularization by Darwin, and the 100th anniversary of Ljubljana University. This is undoubtedly an achievement with many superlatives, starting from excellent collaboration among different international laboratories and the very short period – one year – used to finish the sequencing of the huge proteus genome, which is 15-times larger in size than the human genome. On this occasion, we spoke with the two most important players in the story, prof. Nina Gunde-Cimerman and prof. Rok Kostanjšek, from the University of Ljubljana, Biotechnical Faculty. Prof. Nina Gunde-Cimerman directs research of extremophiles adapted to extreme conditions, in particular fungi, at the Biotechnical Faculty. Prof. Rok Kostanjšek leads a research team that continues the investigation of proteus begun by his predecessors, prof. Lili Istenič and prof. Boris Bulog.",

In the lower half of the slope at Vrtača in the northwestern part of Bela Krajina, 1.3 km northeast of the center of Semič and 15 to 25 meters above the surroundings, a 250-meter long and about 150-meter wide lateral ridge rises at an inclination of 8°. The formation of the medium-sized relief between the elevated lateral ridge and the lower elongated side depressions is most probably to a large extent the consequence of differences in the rock fissuring and the varying intensity of hundreds of thousands of years lasting corrosion related to it. Traces of subsoil formation are the prevailing feature found on hundreds of rock ribs (i.e., subsoil rock formations that are not cone-shaped like teeth but rather elongated with their longer axes largely parallel to the dip of the surface) dissecting the surface area of one of the vineyard plots on the rocky lateral ridge. This indicates they were relatively recently exposed, as a consequence of human activity when soil was removed from an abandoned plot.",

Here we report about two caves along Wwadi Sirhan Graben of Jordan that appear to have formed by stoping upward of collapsed deep-seated hypogene cavities along breccia pipes. The first one, Uwaiyed Cave, is a small breakdown-dominated chamber in basalt of the Naslet Al-Dhirwa volcano; the second, Beer Al-Malabeh, is a large, bell-shaped sinkhole that has geologically recently opened up to the surface. Wwe discuss the possible processes that led to their formation. The review of the existing stratigraphy as obtained by oil well drilling suggests that no salt layers occur below the caves. Gypsum layers seem to be limited to 4 m in thickness, probably not enough to form the observed features. The remaining process is dissolution caused by ascending gas (H2S or CH4) -rich waters from the underlying oil and oil-shale fields. Wwhen such solutions reach the water table, bacterial oxidation may create enough dissolutional power to form localized and large cavities. Their collapse could lead to the observed collapse structures and would explain the paucity of other cave structures throughout southeastern Jordan.Keywords: Jordan, hypogene caves, sinkholes, oil fields, methane.",

The geophysical profiles confirm that the dolines of the valley bottom did not develop from sinkholes, but they are solution dolines. Morphological characteristics of the valleys of the Plateau suggest that these valleys are not the continuation of the valley of the recent covered karst. The former catchment area of these valleys might have been on the Plateau and north of Kecső valley. Their bottoms tilted into southern direction.

Upwardly discharging groundwater enters the cave from the Upper Floridan aquifer, specifically the Eocene-aged Ocala Limestone. We undertook a combined field, laboratory, and modeling study in which we sought to determine the amount of calcite dissolution attributable to the generation of protons by microbially mediated sulfide oxidation. The chemical compositions of groundwater within the limestone formation collected through a newly designed sampling device and of water in the cave conduit were used in geochemical modeling. We used the reaction-path model PHREEQCI to quantify the amount of calcite dissolution expected under various plausible scenarios for mixing of formation water with conduit water and extent of bacterial sulfide oxidation. Laboratory experiments were conducted using flow-through columns packed with crushed limestone from the study site. Replicate columns were eluted with artificial groundwater containing dissolved HS- in the absence of microbial growth. Without biologically mediated sulfide oxidation, no measurable calcite dissolution occurred in laboratory experiments and no additional amount of speleogenesis is expected as formation water mixes with conduit water in the field. In contrast, significant calcite dissolution is driven by the protons released in the biological transformation of the aqueous sulfur species. Although a range of results were calculated, a plausible amount of 158 mg Ca2+ released to conduit water per liter of groundwater crossing the formation-conduit boundary and mixing with an equal volume of conduit water was predicted. Our modeling results indicate that significant cave development can be driven by microbially mediated sulfide oxidation under these hydrogeochemical conditions.žKeywords: calcite dissolution, microbial sulfide oxidation, geochemical model.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.663",

    "abstract": "The Dinarides are the largest continuous karst region in Europe. With regard to a geotectonic view, they are divided into the Outer, Central and Inner Dinarides occupying the territories of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. Numerous occurrences of thermomineral water have been recorded in the Inner Dinarides area. The majority of them are genetically related to carbonate sediments of Mesozoic age. This paper deals with occurrences of thermomineral waters of the Inner Dinarides karst, their quantitative and qualitative characteristics, basic genetic types, the age of karst thermomineral waters of the Inner Dinarides, the available quantities of hydrogeothermalmineral energy, balneological potential and the possibility of rational multi-purpose utilisation. Hydrochemical and isotope methods have been used for the analysis of basic genetic types and age of karst thermomineral waters, while a geothermometer method has been used for the calculation of primary temperatures in water-bearing horizons(geothermal reservoirs) themselves. The carried out research has pointed out that karst thermomineral waters formed in carbonate sediments of Mesozoic age are characterized by temperatures ranging from 15.5oC (Knežina Ilidža) to 75oC (Bogatić), being most frequently of a HCO3-Ca, Mg type with neutral to poor alkaline reaction and mineralization below 1 g/l. Karst thermomineral waters of the Inner Dinarides are most frequently related to geothermal systems formed in carbonate sediments covered by rocks of poor water permeability. In case of some thermomineral water occurrences, the mixing of the karst thermomineral waters with those formed in sedimentary basins occurs due to their hydraulic relation, thus it is not possible to determine only one geothermal system in which they are formed. The overall geothermal potential of the thermomineral waters of the Inner Dinarides karst is about 160 MW. In addition to the geothermal aspect, these waters have been widely utilised in balneology, wellness programmes, as well as for the needs of bottling. The level of research activity and with that the way of the utilisation of these waters are various. With regard to the number of occurrences known so far and their potential, it can be claimed with certainty, that the utilisation of thermomineral water occurring in the karst of the Inner Dinarides will increase significantly in future. An example of the multi-purpose utilisation of the Pribojska Banja Spa thermomineral waters illustrates a possible way of doing it.",

    "abstract": "Carbonate dissolution and precipitation are important geological processes whose rates often require quantification. In natural settings, these processes may be taking place at a slow rate, and thus, it may not be easily visible which of these processes is occurring. Alternatively, if the effects of precipitation/dissolution are visible, it may not be clear if they are still underway or an artefact of past conditions. Moreover, these two opposing processes may flip states depending on the environmental conditions, such as, on a seasonal basis. Here, we present the technical details and preliminary results of a method using carbonate tablets and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate which process (carbonate dissolution or precipitation) is occurring, using as an example, a cave environment. Our method involves making tablets by encasing blocks of carbonate rock into resin and polishing these to form a completely flat and smooth “zero surface”. These tablets are observed under SEM in exactly the same points both before and after exposure to the field environment, using a system of marking lines at specific locations on the resin. Our results show significant differences in the before and after images of the tablet surface after just six weeks in the cave. Furthermore, the use of the insoluble resin zero surface permits a comparison of the starting height with the new dissolved/precipitated surface that can be used to quantitatively estimate the rate of dissolution/precipitation happening at a field location in a relatively short time-frame (weeks/months). This method could be used in numerous natural and industrial settings to identify these processes that can be caused purely geochemically, but also through microbialmediation and physical weathering.",

    "abstract": "As karst aquifers are often characterised by non-linear behaviour, ascertaining the turning points in their hydraulic regime may provide essential information on the functioning of the aquifer. These characteristics also apply to the Silurian-Ordovician aquifer system, composed of diverse carbonate rocks, in Estonia. The aquifer system is an important source of drinking water in northern Estonia. It also comprises the Nabala- Rakvere aquifer, a locally important groundwater resource that underlies the Tuhala karst area famous for an intermittently overflowing karst spring known as the Witch's Well. The water rich in humic substances of the Tuhala River recharges the Tuhala karst system, which is drained by two spring groups. In order to develop measures for the sustainable management of the aquifer in the future, the aim of this study was to enhance understanding of the hydraulic behaviour and hydrodynamic properties of the Tuhala karst system. From October 2014 to December 2016 an extensive field campaign was carried out comprising the observation of 22 surface- and groundwater monitoring points for water level and physico-chemical parameters and the performance of four quantitative tracer tests. The data obtained were evaluated in accordance with the input– output water level relation curves and a conceptual model of the system was set up. The results show that a strong hydraulic link exists, primarily through well-developed conduits between the recharge and discharge area of the karst system. Depending on the hydrological conditions, groundwater flow direc tions vary and maximum linear flow velocities range between ~225 and 800 m/h. A threshold-controlled throughput capacity and interaction with the adjacent aquifer cause imbalances between the input and output discharges of the karst system. Tracer tests coupled with surface and groundwater level relation curve analysis allowed the specification of flow threshold conditions for the Witch's Well spring group and the overflow threshold for the Witch's Well, among other key hydrological events. The hydraulic regime of the karst system was divided into three stages, each with differing threshold controls and hydrodynamic characteristics.Key words: karst system, shallow carbonate aquifer, monitoring, tracer test, water level relation curve, threshold, overflow. Določanje mejnih vrednosti tristopenjskega hidravljičnega obnašanja pokritega plitvega karbonatnega vodonosnika (Tuhalski kras, severna Estonija)Kraški vodonosniki se pogosto obnašajo nelinearno, zato lahko z ugotavljanjem mejnih vrednosti v hidravličnem režimu zagotovimo bistvene informacije o delovanju vodonosnika. To velja tudi za silurijsko-ordovicijski vodonosni sistem v Estoniji, ki ga sestavljajo različne karbonatne kamnine in je pomemben vir pitne vode na severu države. Vključuje tudi vodonosnik Nabala- Rakvere, ki je lokalno pomemben vodni vir. Na tem območju se nahaja Tuhalski kras, ki je znan po občasno bruhajočem kraškem izviru Witch's Well (Čarovničin vodnjak). Tuhalski vodonosnik napaja reka Tuhala, bogata z huminskimi snovmi, prazni pa se skozi dve skupini izvirov. Da bi v prihodnje razvili ukrepe za trajnostno upravljanje vodonosnika, je bil namen te raziskave izboljšati razumevanje hidravličnega obnašanja in hidrodinamičnih lastnosti kraškega sistema. Od oktobra 2014 do decembra 2016 smo opravili obsežno terensko delo, ki je obsegalo spremljanje vodostajev in fizikalno-kemijskih parametrov v 23 površinskih in podzemnih točkah ter izvedbo štirih kvantitativnih sledilnih poskusov. Pridobljene podatke smo ovrednotili na podlagi krivulje odvisnosti vhodnih in izhodnih vodnih nivojev. Vzpostavili smo konceptualni model sistema. Rezultati kažejo na obstoj močne hidravlične povezave predvsem z dobro razvitimi kanali med območji napajanja in praznjenja kraškega sistema. Odvisno od hidroloških razmer se spreminjajo smeri in hitrosti toka podzemne vode, ki znašajo od ~225 do 800 m/h. Kapaciteta prepustnosti, ki jo uravnavajo določene mejne vrednosti, in posledične in terakcije s sosednjimi vodonosniki povzročajo neravnovesja med vhodnimi in izhodnimi pretočnimi vrednostmi kraškega sistema. Združevanje rezultatov sledilnih poskusov z analizo krivulje odvisnosti površinskih in podzemnih vodostajev nam je omogočilo, da smo določili mejne pretočne vrednosti izvira Witch's Well in druge ključne hidrološke dogodke. Hidravlični režim kraškega sistema smo razdelili na tri faze, od katerih ima vsaka določene mejne vrednosti in hidrodinamične lastnosti.

Early explorers and visitors left names, dates and symbols. Here we present the inscriptions by the mathematician Josef Anton Nagel (1717-1794). Nagel and the painter and engineer Alois Schaffenrath (1794-1836) are the only ones that we can trace in both of the caves. Nagel visited the caves in July 1748 on order of Emperor Franz I. The inscription in Jama near Predjama is (for cave inscriptions) rather long and written in Latin, giving name, profession, cause and date of the visit, while the inscription in Postojnska Jama is rather short, giving only name and date of visit. Unfortunately the inscription in Jama near Predjama is already partly obliterated by an incautious visitor.",

Recorded within it are numerous other typical phenomena. Shafts, ponors and estavelle (all three are traditionally called jamas) played an important role in traditional life of people from Popovo polje. In the article, “jamas” are assessed based on whether they were a source of life and on the side of life or against it, i.e. were lethal for the lives of people of Popovo polje region. Included in the first category are shafts which were oasis of drinking water in summer time, shafts which were made suitable for fishing the endemic fish Popovo Minnows (Delminichthys ghetaldii) and shafts on top of which over 40 flour mills were built. On the other side, shafts of death are natural shafts which were used as mass graves in the World War II. Most literature deals precisely with these. Shafts were subject of comprehensive research of Popovo polje for the needs of Trebišnjica Hydro-system Project, and extremely important and interesting bio-speleological endeavors, but those aspects remained outside the perception of general public of Popovo polje.",

    "abstract": "The symbiosis between man and caves usually causes a mixture of fascination and respect. When looking back at the history of Antique civilizations, there are references to this relationship made in almost all cases. Caves were men’s first home, their first meeting places, shelters, and ritualistic places. Nowadays, even with the fear of darkness and closed areas that is so usual, that old-time connection still exists. In the contemporary world, some places still hold a special sacred meaning to many social groups. Thus, the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, to the shrine of Fatima in Portugal, to the Ganges River in India or to the cave church of Bom Jesus da Lapa in the interior of Bahia State, Brazil, are closely related when it comes to spiritual complicity. These sites play a key role as a collective reference of human sacrifice in an increasingly automated, technical and individualistic world much more than as strengthers of the religious faith. In Brazil there are many important religious sites. This paper mentions important sites specifically from the northeastern region. The examples are the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus da Lapa, the Cave of Patamuté, the Brejoes Cave, and the Milagrosa Cave. All these examples show clear manifestations of popular traditions and year after year illustrate the important roles that caves play in regional Brazilian societies. This paper is not intended to diminish the physical studies of karst areas but it wants to emphasize the importance of the human variable, especially in developing countries, for the relationship between karst and caves in the popular tradition, transmitted by means of oral stories and folk beliefs goes beyond the scientific advances.",

    "abstract": "The Grotta dell’Arena (476 V/VR), located in the Lessinian Mountain, at the elevation of 1512 m a.s.l., is a very important underground karst system. Although it is only 74 m long, several of the geological, geomorphological and environmental features of the High Lessinian underground karst are present in this cave. The Grotta dell’Arena shares some common geological and faunistic characters with other important and well known karst systems. This cave has also one of the highest number of troglobitic species in all Venetian Prealps and some of them possibly originated in the pre-Quaternary. From the geological point of view the cave is the expression of a contact karst, where different limestone types come in contact both stratigraphically and along tectonic structures. The Grotta dell’Arena is located at the stratigraphic contact between the “Calcari del Gruppo di San Vigilio” and the “Rosso Ammonitico” and it is very close to a fault plane putting in vertical contact the two above formations with the “Biancone”, a kind of limestone closely stratified and densely fractured, very sensible to frost weathering. It is interesting to note the presence of a good number of species of Tertiary, or more generally pre-Quaternary, originate in the Grotta dell’Arena. This presence is possibly related to the geology of caves. In this paper the different kinds of underground karst systems in the Grottta dell’Arena and Lessinian Mountain, are analyzed and the relation with the cave fauna distribution are taken in consideration.",

    "abstract": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) named “Roteg” was used to detect known and unknown passages of Divaška Jama and Trhlovca caves in SW Slovenia. “Roteg’s” main characteristics are an extraordinary high power output (20 MW) and high voltage on antennas (up to 20 kV), which allows penetration more than ten times deeper than common GPRs. During the measurement we used 3-m long antennas (50 MHz) with a central frequency of 50 MHz and we clearly detected the reflections from the depth of 200 m after data processing. During field survey 22 profiles were completed with a total length of 4487.97 m. Pretnerjeva and Žibernova Dvorana chambers in Divaška Jama were well visible on radarograms. New big cavities, which were detected below profiles P18, P21 and P22, are almost all at the same level of 350 – 400 m a.s.l. There is another group of cavities at a level of 420 – 450 m a.s.l., which corresponds to Trhlovca. Both cave groups are separated by the gap which extends in the vertical direction, and probably presents a tectonic zone, which is as well visible on the radarograms. By the use of “Roteg” at the karst surface we were able to detect known caves, new - unknown caves and tectonic zones up to 200 m below the surface.Key words: ground penetrating radar, caves, karst, Divaška Jama, Trhlovca, Slovenia.Določitev rovov Divaške jame v JZ smeri za Trhlovco z uporabo zelo močnega nizkofrekvenčnega georadarjaNizkofrekvenčni georadar (GPR), imenovan »Roteg«, smo uporabili pri zaznavi znanih in neznanih rovov Divaške jame in Trhlovce v JZ Sloveniji. »Rotegove« glavne značilnosti so izjemna moč (20 MW) in visoka napetost do 20 kV na antenah, kar omogoča penetracijo, ki je več kot desetkrat globlja, kot jo dosežejo običajni georadarji.

The sequence was radiocarbon dated and covers an age of approximately 4060 years. The results of geochemical data, statistical studies, along with the investigation, analysis and explanation of historical sources indicate the presence of warm and dry climate conditions between ca 2100 BC and 800 CE. These were contemporaneous with the occurrence of periods of drought and famine during the Achaemenid and Sassanid empires, and might have been was one of the causes of their ‘collapse. The existence of humid climate conditions between 800 and 1450 AD was contemporaneous with the period of Medieval Climate Anomaly and the historically documented prosperity of farms and agriculture during the Seljuk dynasties, the Samanids, and the rise of rainfall and river floods during the period of the Abbasid caliphate. The presence of cold and humid climate conditions between ca 1600 and 1750 AD was consistent with the so-called Little Ice Age and the Maunder Minimum. After this period, the climate of this area changed to warm and dry which was contemporaneous with the occurrence of famine and subsequent droughts of the late Safavid and Qajar dynasties in Iran.Key words: palaeoclimate, geochemistry, Little Ice Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly, Kolatarika Cave, Iran.Poznoholocenske podnebne spremembe v zahodnem Iranu: analize netopirskega gvana in zgodovinskih dokumentovV članku predstavimo analize 86 centimetrov debelega zaporedja plasti netopirskega gvana v jami Kolatarika v provinci Kurdistan, Zahodni Iran.

    "abstract": "The Plitvice Lakes National Park is in the northwestern part of the Dinaric Karst in central Croatia. An important role of the soil in the karst is to purify the waters before they reach the phreatic zone. The soil is also a zone of accumulation, transformation, retardation and dilution of a potential pollutant. Knowing soil mineralogical composition is an important factor in understanding fate and transport of contaminants throughout lakes system. Samples of soil, peat and stream sediment were collected in the Prošće lake catchment and partly in the assumed zone of influence, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of samples was performed to determine dominant mineral species in samples. XRD analysis showed predominance of lowquartz, which was found in all samples, most often as dominant phase. Dolomite was found in half of the samples, almost always as a significant phase while calcite was dominant phase in one of the samples. In most of the samples, members of the feldspars and chlorites groups, as well as muscovite, were present as minor phases. The absorption bands in the range of 2800-3000 cm-1 due to the organic matter are visible in spectra of all samples. These minerals can enter lakes system by surface waters, primarily streams and overland flow during snow thawing and rain, and also in cases of shore erosion. Terrigenic input in lakes is small but cannot be neglected due to the longlasting preservation efforts of the Prošće Lake recharge area, and the Plitvice Lakes National Park in general, terrigenous intake still does not pose a threat to water quality and tufa production. Considering the analyzed samples and characteristics of detected soil constituents, soils and sediments in the Prošće Lake catchment have the ability to retain and purify water on its way to the lakes. On the other hand, in case of the possible contamination in the recharge area of the lakes system, the pollutants can enter the system adsorbed on the soil particles. Learning more about the soils surrounding lakes gives valuable insight into their possible influence on lakes water chemistry and adds one piece of the puzzle into understanding this kind of a natural phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Highly karstified carbonate platforms such as Florida are characterized by rapid infiltration rates, highly permeable bedrock and the direct connection to the below aquifer through the high density of sinkholes. This combination of physical features makes the groundwater and aquifers highly vulnerable to contamination from synthetic chemicals commonly referred to as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The use of septic tanks, otherwise referred to as onsite water treatment systems (OWTS), promotes the introduction of CECs into the environment. In order to study the impacts of CECs from OWTS on a karst landscape, water, sediment, and vegetation samples were collected in a sinkhole lake surrounded by residential housing using this waste disposal method. The main question of this research project is what is the fate of CECs from OWTSs effluent within the catchment of a sinkhole lake? Liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry was used to analyze the samples for the presence of CECs. It was found that the relative quantity of CECs in the individual constituents is dependent upon 1) the hydrophobicity and polarity of the individual compound, 2) the specific sampling site, 3) the topography gradient, and 4) for vegetation, the connectedness of the sample type to the sediment. Hydrogeological studies have found that the sinkholes of the area are all connected to the below aquifer. Consequently, these CECs pose a risk of the contamination of the groundwater. This study is a temporal snapshot, that being the dry season of Florida which is most likely the time of lowest CEC contamination. It is imperative that sampling extend into the wet season when flushing of CECs from the OWTS may increase their concentrations in both the lake but also the aquifers especially since residents use well water as their source of potable water. While this study is based in Florida, we strongly suspect that our findings and recommendations are applicable more generally as OWTS are used throughout the many karst regions of the world.",

Based on mineralogical study the cave sediments are composed of dolomite, quartz, muscovite, amphibole, chlorite, calcite, Kfeldspar and plagioclase. Heavy mineral assemblage is formed by garnet, zircon, apatite, monazite, tourmaline, staurolite, rutile, titanite, epidote, sillimanite, allanite, andalusite and barite. Opaque minerals are represented by ilmenite, pyrite, magnetite, Cr-spinel, Fe-oxyhydroxides and chalcopyrite. Detailed research of chemical composition of the heavy minerals points to their source rocks formed by granitoids, amphibolites and amphibolite gneisses representing the crystalline basement and probably by Triassic cover sediments of the Lúžna Formation. Presence of the allochthonous minerals in the cave from metamorphic complex recently occurred on the opposite southern slope of the Nízke Tatry Mts. indicates a past larger catchment area of the allogenic karst of Mošnica Valley on the pre-Quaternary less dissected terrain. A change of watershed boundary leading through the central range of the Nízke Tatry Mts. was probably connected with the tilting of this mountain range towards the north, in the compression regime during the Late Tertiary.",

    "abstract": "Since 2003, an extensive hydrogeological investigation has been carried out on Monte Baldo, in order to make a census of springs occurring along the west side of the mountain and to evaluate the quality of their water. The investigation included morphological and hydrogeological observations concerning the Tanella cave and interdisciplinary investigations performed on the deposits found in the cave. This paper shows the first data concerning the hydrogeology of the cave, as well as data on stratigraphy, pollen and micro-charcoals obtained from the analyses of a well preserved sequence located at ca. 80 m from the entrance (sequence A). The aim of the study was to reconstruct the environment of the area around the cave along the time span testified by the sequence. The sequence is 60 cm thick and was built up by fluvioglacial sediments followed by lacustrine sediments. Five samples taken along the sequence plus three recent control samples (mosses), collected in places assumed as origins of the pollen input, were studied for pollen and micro-charcoals. Pollen preservation was good and concentration varied from 101 to 103 p/g. Pollen spectra from the cave showed the evolution from a landscape of alpine grassland above the timberline, likely of glacial age, to a more forested Holocene landscape similar in flora to the current one testified by the control samples. Pollen probably arrived in the cave by air, water and animals and from plants growing near the cave. It appears to have been continuously underwater after its deposition due to its very good state of preservation. Micro-charcoals suggested that fires were sometimes lit near the cave.",

    "abstract": "Imenski rov (Rov starih podpisov), the Old Cave (Stara jama), was the only part of Postojnska jama known for several centuries until 1818 when Luka Čeč discovered the access to the inner parts of the cave. Here we documented ca. 400 inscriptions. About 100 more were also recorded in the historic part of Predjama Cave. From these signatures we correlated 19 with independently historically known persons, less than 5% of the total. The correlation is firm for 15 names, but only tentative for Bellegarde, Kotze, Mihanović and Karl von Zur. The oldest one is that of Johann Melchior Ott(o) of 1642, a painter in the service of Johann Anton zu Eggenberg (1610–1649) the owner of the Castle of Adelsberg at the time, whose coat of arms Ott drew as well. The next oldest is the name Josef Anton Nagel 1748 who also left Latin inscriptions in Predjama cave and in Sloup Cavern, Moravia. All other inscriptions of historic persons are younger than 1800 including those of Franz Graf von Hohenwart, Joseph Petsch Ritter von Löwengreif and Alois Schaffenrath (each with several inscriptions). Noteworthy are also the signatures of Josef Franz Eggenhöfner (1801 or 1809, and 1820; developer of Grotta di Padriciano), Johann Natterer (biologist, 1815, who stayed 19 years in Brazil and laid the basis of the zoological department of the Natural History Museum in Vienna), Karl Beyrich (1819, botanist who died during an expedition in Arkansas, 1834), Giuseppe de Volpi (1820, from Trieste who published first evidence of the cave bear presence in Postojnska jama), Johann Fercher, mine supervisor, and his team of miners from Idrija who signed during their survey of the cave in 1833, Johann Ritter von Hauer (1836 in Pisani rov, Vienna, Imperial Councelor of War and Palaeontologist), Ivan Andrej Perko (the later director of the cave) and several cave guides. Members of the nobility or state employees include Bellegard, Adrienne Brandis Desenffans and her brother Karl Graf Desenffans, Carl von Kotze, and Mihanović.",

    "abstract": "Caves are natural sediments traps that enclose several types of allochtonous and authoctonous deposits. Study of sediments in caves help to reconstitute the hydrological functioning of caves. In Lebanon, Kessarat and Jeita horizontal caves comprise sediments traps related to collapse and/or to passages enlargements with new passages formed during the alluviation process. A speleogenic study combined with the grain-size analysis of the sedimentary sequence in the Junction Chamber (Kassarat cave) and in the Entrance Gallery (Jeita lower cave) helped to identify several stages of sediment deposition and to define types of paleoflow adjustments during and after the ceiling collapse. In this paper, we discuss the control of cave conduits on several processes: i) the flow dynamic adjustments; ii) the spatial and temporal distribution of deposits in the cave systems and, iii) the magnitude of the environmental signal recorded in sedimentary sequences. The study highlights the importance to consider the geomorphological context of sediments traps when interpreting the evolution of subsurface flows and when relating sediment inputs in caves to external environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Middle Triassic fractured and karstified limestone and dolomite form a karst aquifer in the Sana River Valley near the town of Prijedor. As a result of intensive tectonic movements, carbonate rocks are mostly below the Sana River level, covered by younger Pliocene and alluvial deposits. The main source of groundwater recharge is infiltration from the Sana River through its alluvium over most of the aquifer. The main objective of the research reported in this paper was to evaluate the hydraulic relationships of the alluvial, Pliocene and karst aquifers in order to better understand the water supply potential of the karst aquifer. Although the use of hydrodynamic modeling is not very common with karst aquifers, the developed model provided significant and useful information on the groundwater budget and recharge type. The influence of fault zones and spatial anisotropy of the karst aquifer were simulated on the hydrodynamic model by varying permeability on the x- and y-axes of the Cartesian coordinate system with respect to the fault, the main pathway of groundwater circulation. Representative hydraulic conductivities were Kx = 2.3·10-3 m/s and Ky = 5.0·10-3 m/s in the faults of NW to SE direction, and Kx = 2.5·10-3 m/s and Ky 1.2·10-3 m/s in the faults of SW to NE trend. Model research showed that the karst aquifer can be used in the long term at maximal tested capacities and that current groundwater exploitation is not compromised in dry periods when the water budget depends entirely on recharge from the Sana River.",

Two-dimensional optical measurement of the tilt of a rock mass and continuous fully digital on-line evaluation of results makes possible the detection of a small tilt of the surroundings with a resolution of tens of nanoradians or the deformation of the surroundings in the horizontal plane with resolution of hundreds of nanometres. The paper describes the measurement device and the first results of the measurements in Magdalena Jama, which is part of the Postojna Cave System (Slovenia). The correlation of deformation between distant stations shows the existence of stress variations that are not only of local origin (high floods, local seismicity, and aseismic deformations). The stress field has a wider, and not only regional, character with effects that can be observed very far from the origin.",

    "abstract": "The Grotta Gigante houses a geodetic station since 1959,  which has the goal to observe deformation of the cave. The instrumentation consists of two ultra-broad-band pendulum type tiltmeters, and two medium-to-longperiod tiltmeters, next to thermometer and pressure gauge. The exceptionally long and continuous time-series of the tiltmeters allows us to demonstrate the existence of several astonishing phenomena that cause the cave to change continuously in shape, also if only to a small amount and which can be recorded with sophisticated instruments, as the ones installed. The movements due to the different causes sum up to produce the complete observed signal, and our goal is to separate and identify the different phenomena. To illustrate the work we do in identifying the different agents, the analogy holds to a musician listening to a symphony-concert and identifying the melody of the first violin, flute, triangle, the violoncello and the double bass, and then identifying the corresponding musicians and instruments on stage. As the music has high and low tones, the deformation of the cave is composed of slow and fast movements, continuous movements, or abrupt, sudden events, that repeat very rarely. Here we  show the observation sequence of tilt for the time interval 1966-2012, and discuss the deformation due to the following causes: temperature, underground water-level, sea level of the Adriatic sea, position of sun and moon and vibration of the Earth due some of the greatest mega-earthquakes ever recorded. To illustrate the analogues to music we use to explain the association of different frequency ranges to different causes of deformation signal to the general public of the cave. The results show an excellent example of scientifically sound and important instrumentation installed in a show-cave visited regularly by the public.",

The archaeological site area is well known as one of the most important archaeological sites in SE Europe since it hosts numerous archaeological findings dating back to the Early Bronze Age. Detailed stratigraphic analysis of three archaeological sections was performed in order to define the depositional conditions of the cave entrance facies sediments. Mineral magnetic properties were performed to enhance the paleoenvironmental interpretations and to detect sediment origins. Magnetic susceptibility (klf) obtained in high and low frequency as well as remanence parameters, such as saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and S-ratio, were measured in samples collected2from the archaeological sections. Results indicate a significant variability in the magnetic signal stored in the sedimentary record of Kataraktes cave system distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic sequences. The combination of the stratigraphic and magnetic results along with the archaeological data reveals that flood events of Krousovitis River and sediment accumulation from slackwater in the rockshelter area occurred around 3000 yr BC and were possibly the key factor for the abandonment of the prehistoric settlement.",

The hydrochemical characteristics of these springs were measured in 1977, 2004-2009, and 2011. The data show that the hydrochemistry type of springs in different areas, and for different years, is Ca-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3-SO4, whereas the concentrations of SO4 and NO3 are very sensitive to changes in human activities. All the springs with the highest SO4 and NO3 concentrations in the study area showed minimum concentrations in 1977 and an upward trend in concentrations from 2004 to 2008, followed by a period of lower concentrations. Springs with low SO4 and NO3 concentrations were distributed solely at the top of Jinfo Mountain in the National Nature Reserve. The hydrochemical variations observed in springs on Jinfo Mountain demonstrate that the implementation of environmental policy measures and industrial restructuring have successfully contributed to environmental protection of the springs.",

    "abstract": "The Tongass National Forest of Southeast Alaska, USA, provides a unique environment for monitoring the impact of the cave system on water quality and biological productivity. The accretionary terrane setting of the area has developed into a complex and heterogeneous geologic landscape which includes numerous blocks of limestone with intense karstification. During the Wisconsian glaciation, there were areas of compacted glacial sediments and silts deposited over the bedrock. Muskeg peatlands developed over these poorly drained areas. The dominant plants of the muskeg ecosystem are Sphagnum mosses, whose decomposition leads to highly acidic waters with pH as low as 2.4. These waters drain off the muskegs into the cave systems, eventually running to the ocean. In accordance with the Tongass Land Management Plan, one of the research priorities of the National Forest is to determine the contributions of karst groundwater systems to productivity of aquatic communities. On Northern Prince of Wales Island, the Conk Canyon Cave insurgence and the Mop Spring resurgence were continuously monitored to understand the buffering capacity of the cave system. Over the length of the system, the pH increases from an average 3.89 to 7.22. The insurgence water temperature, during the summer months, ranged from between 10oC to 17oC. After residence in the cave system, the resurgence water had been buffered to 6oC to 9oC. Over the continuum from insurgence to resurgence, the specific conductance had increased by an order of magnitude with the resurgence waters having a higher ionic strength. The cave environment acts as a buffer on the incoming acidic muskeg water to yield resurgence water chemistry of a buffered karst system. These buffered waters contribute to the productivity in aquatic environments downstream. The waters from this system drain into Whale Pass, an important location for the salmon industry. The cool, even temperatures, as well as buffered flow rates delivered by the karst systems are associated with higher productivity of juvenile coho salmon.",

The reconstruction of this habitat includes both a larger passage with bat colonies supplying wet bat guano sediments, on which the earthworms feed, and narrow channels, which drain water from this passage into the sampling drip. Fresh guano is deposited in autumn shortly before the earthworms become inactive. Then, it is exploited by moulds and additionally depleted by water washing out the nutrients before the earthworms reactivate in spring. Thus, this is a rather poor food resource for the earthworms. Despite this, and apart from their short size and delayed maturation, no other disturbance or damage was found caused by malnutrition, which was confirmed in individuals submitted to starvation in captivity. We suggest that Dd. r. tenuis, which shows neither disturbance from nor adaptation to living in a subterranean environment, can subsist there because of its euryoecious character. Nevertheless, in temperate climates, this is rather a harsh habitat for this earthworm.",

    "abstract": "Karst caves are suitable places for seismological measurements because they are situated under the surface and often have lower seismic noise than locations on the surface. The idea to establish the first underground seismological station in Slovenia has led us to make preliminary seismic noise measurements in Črna Jama (part of the Postojna Cave System) in 2007. In search for further suitable stable places within the cave, we next performed seismic noise measurements, followed by a temporary accelerometer installation, near the highest point of the Velika Gora chamber in the first half of 2010. Since 7 May 2010, the seismic station is located inside the 9 m long artificial tunnel that was built for geophysical measurement purposes in Tartarus passage in 1931. From 27 January to 12 February 2010, the seismological station Velika Gora in Postojna Cave System (VGPJ) recorded 79 earthquakes with epicenters near Postojna. Records were especially important to determine the seismological characteristics of the MLV=3.7 Postojna earthquake (15 January 2010) aftershocks. The station in the Tartarus tunnel (TTPJ) operated from 7 May 2010 till 21 December 2010 and recorded more than hundred earthquakes of the sequence near Ilirska Bistrica that started on 15 September 2010, with two MLV=3.5 earthquakes and lasted till the end of the year 2010. The aim of this study is the installation of a permanent seismic station inside the Postojna Cave System and future real-time integration of the related seismological data within the Slovenian and Italian seismological networks.",

This area is characterised by authentic structures, which represent a valuable cultural heritage and an important element of the national identity. The island of Krk is particularly inspiring in this respect, due to an intricate cultural landscape typology that has developed there under the infl uence of natural features on the one hand, and the centuries-long agricultural activity on the other. This paper is the result of research in its structural vocabulary in order better to understand and value these unique landscapes. The complex typological articulation was generated mainly by natural karst phenomena (karst valleys and fi elds, small dolinas, dry valleys), as well as various stone walls, terraces, and similar features, formed through the process of land cultivation. A considerable diversity of landscape units and patterns has been identifi ed through particular structures which often turned out to be assets themselves, and which at the same time help to understand and interpret the outstanding value of the islandʼs landscape.",

    "abstract": "Popovo polje is a longitudinal karst basin at the level of 250 metres above sea level, surrounded by higher hills, not far from the Adriatic Sea. Water power can be used for powering certain water devices, such as mills, mill-stamps, saw-mills, irrigation etc. All these devices except sawmills can be found in this region. The typical architecture on Popovo polje is closely connected with stone: dwellings, economic buildings, especially salaš (drying and storing device for corn), irrigation devices on the Trebišnjica river but the most attractive are mills, especially ponor mills. A ponor mill is a unique system in the world, using the oscillating level of water. A classical millwheel with a vertical axle – almost a turbine – is set into a vertical cylinder, which uses water power, independent of its level. The architectural frame is made of stone but the rotating elements are wooden, in particular the rotating waterwheel with scoops. Mills located on karst ponors with special behaviour are called ‘estavelle’ mills, with the wheel rotating in both directions. The problem with these jewels of the cultural and technical heritage is that they are abandoned and forgotten. The most important aspects of saving them are uncovering them, recalling them to memory and preventing them from disappearing, restoring them to working order and presenting them to the public. The conclusions are very clear: not even owners are aware of these important objects. We professionals must restore this heritage to life, to the public, by raising the awareness of the local people of the work and culture, with beneficial economic effects.Key words: karst, ponor (swallow hole), watermill, waterwheel, turbine.Borut Juvanec: Popovo polje, drugačen pogledPopovo polje je tipična vzdolžna kraška kotlina na višini 250 metrov nad morjem, nedaleč od Jadranskega morja, obkrožena z višjim hribovjem. Moč vode lahko uporabimo kot energijo za pogon nekaterih vodnih strojev: mlinov, stop, valjalnic, žag, namakalnih sistemov, itn. Na tem območju najdemo vse naštete, razen žag, kar je na kraškem terenu povsem logično. Arhitekturne značilnosti so vezane na kamen. Objekti so predvsem bivalne hiše, gospodarski objekti, posebej salaš kot sušilna naprava za koruzo, namakalni sistemi na reki Trebišnjica, predvsem pa so to 'ponor mlinice', mlini na ponorih. Ponor mlinica je edinstvena v svetovnem merilu, uporablja nihajočo višino vode. Je mlin z vertikalno osjo vodnega kolesa – skoraj turbine. Sam mlin je nameščen v vertikalnem okroglem obodu. Konstrukcija mlina je seveda kamnita, razen notranje konstrukcije z lesenim kolesom, ki ima enake lesene žličke. Nekateri mlini, ki stojijo na estavelah (ponorih, ki požirajo, a tudi bruhajo vodo), imajo konstrukcijo, prirejeno za delovanje v obeh smereh. Največji problemi teh mlinov je, da padajo v pozabo in da fizično propadajo. Najpomembnejša naloge so zato iztrganje pozabi in izginotju, rekonstrukcija v stanje delovanja in predstavitev spomenikov ljudske kulture javnosti. Sklep je zato povsem jasen: ta kulturna dediščina je danes pozabljena in je niti njeni lastniki ne poznajo več. Zato moramo predvsem strokovnjaki to pomembno kulturno dobrino vrniti v življenje, da bo dvigala zavest lokalnega prebivalstva, na področju kulture, a z ekonomskimi učinki.Ključne besede: kras, ponor (požiralnik, bruhalnik), vodni mlin, mlinsko kolo, turbina.",

    "abstract": "In taphonomy, the study of carnivore modification of fossil bones and the analysis of their dispersion represent the best approach to assessing the extent of bone modification and displacement for a given bone assemblage. Here we analyze the excavated bone deposit from Urşilor Cave, a well-documented and fossil-rich Upper Pleistocene cave bear site from the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. More than 1400 limb bones or bone remains were analyzed (NISPleft and right = 1424) and 69 measurable puncture marks were identified, measured and morphologically analyzed. Moreover, for assessing the degree of bone scattering, almost 540 cave bear limb bones and mandibles were refitted and the Index of Skeletal Disjunction (ISD) was calculated for the entire bone assemblage. More than 30 % of the analyzed cave bear limb bones were affected by carnivores: the ulnae were the most affected (39.3 %) while the humeri and femora were less modified (24.7 % and 25.5 %, respectively). The range of variation in size of the puncture marks, the morphological features of various tooth marks and the faunal composition of the studied bone assemblage indicate that at least two carnivore taxa are responsible for the bone modifications. The results obtained for the ISD index indicate higher displacement for femora when compared to other bones (e.g. tibiae, mandibles, humeri). Our analyses of bone modifications caused by carnivores indicate a low level of the scattering of intensely modified (by in situ consumption) bones, and notable carnivore impact on the configuration of the bone assemblage.Key words: Ursus spelaeus, taphonomy, ISD, tooth marks, Urşilor Cave, Romanian Carpathians.Vpliv zveri na kosti jamskih medvedov iz jame UrŞilor (SZ Romunija) in analiza njihove razkropljenostiProučevanje sledov zveri na fosilnih kosteh in razkropljenosti kosti v prostoru je najboljše tafonomsko orodje za pridobivanje podatkov o obsegu takšnih pojavov znotraj posameznega paleontološkega zbira. V raziskavi obravnavamo kosti jamskega medveda iz jame Urşilor, dobro raziskanega mlajšepleistocenskega najdišča v Romunskih Karpatih. Analizirali smo več kot 1424 dolgih cevastih kosti okončin ali njihovih odlomkov in pri tem prepoznali, izmerili in morfološko analizirali 69 odtiskov zob. Poleg tega smo izračunali indeks razkropljenosti okostja (Index of Skeletal Disjunction, ISD) za celotni paleontološki zbir, zaradi česar smo sestavili skoraj 540 dolgih cevastih kosti okončin in spodnjih čeljustnic jamskega medveda. Sledove zveri smo prepoznali na več kot 30 % kosti okončin, najpogosteje na komolčnicah (39.3 %), nekoliko redkeje pa na nadlahtnicah in stegnenicah (24.7 % oz. 25.5 %). Variabilnost v velikosti odtiskov zob, njihovih morfoloških značilnostih in favnistični sestavi proučevanega paleontološkega zbira pričajo o tem, da sta ugotovljene spremembe medvedjih kosti povzročili vsaj dve različni zveri. Vrednosti indeksa razkropljenosti okostja kažejo na izrazitejšo razkropljenost stegnenic v primerjavi z drugimi kostmi (npr. golenicami, nadlahtnicami, spodnjimi čeljustnicami). Naša analiza kaže na skromno razkropljenost intenzivno obgrizenih kosti (zaradi hranjenja v sami jami) in znaten vpliv zveri na konfiguracijo paleontološkega zbira.Ključne besede: Ursus spelaeus, tafonomija, ISD, ugrizi, jama Urşilor, Romunski Karpati.",

    "abstract": "Udorni dolini ter ponori v Škocjanskih jamah so bili omenjani že v antiki in označeni na zemljevidih iz 16. stoletja, opisal jih je Valvasor (1689), obiskovali pa so jih tudi popotniki v 18. stoletju. Vzpodbudo je pomenila tudi pot, ki so jo 1823 speljali v Veliko dolino. Knjiga obiskovalcev, ki so jo uvedli 1819 je izgubljena, toda nekaj informacij o obiskih je mogoče dobiti iz drugih virov, vključno iz popotnih dnevnikov in Schmidlovih knjig okoli leta 1853. V Evopskih turističnih vodnikih je opaziti porast priljubljenosti jam. 1884 je Primorska sekcija Nemško-avstrijskega planinskega društva vzela jame v zakup in uredila vodeni turistični obisk. Isti vodniki so pomagali članom društva pri dolgotrajnih in težavnih raziskavah jam, vzporedno z njimi pa so stalno podaljševali turistično pot. V 1890-tih letih so v obisk vključili Dvorano planinskega društva in 1903 celo Martelovo dvorano. V prispevku so opisane tudi vstopnina in plačila za vodnike in razsvetljavo.After mention in Classical times and on 16th century maps, the dolines and sinks of Škocjanske jame were described by Valvasor (1689) and visited by travellers in the 18th century. Tourists were encouraged from 1823 when a path down Velika dolina was made. The visitors’ book started in 1819 is lost but information on some visits is available from other sources including travellers’ reports and Schmidl’s books of around 1853. European guide books mark the increasing popularity of the caves. In 1884 the Section Küstenland of the Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein leased the caves and arranged guided tours for visitors. These same guides assisted Club members in lengthy and difficult explorations, and the tourist route was constantly extended. In the 1890s it included the Alpenvereins Dom, and in 1903 even the Martel Dom. The system of charging visitors for entry, for guides and for lights is described.",

    "abstract": "Sredi 19. stol. sta bila jamarstvo in speleologija na Kranjskem že dobro razvita. Od 1878 se je za naš kras pričel zanimati F. Kraus. 1879 je ustanovil “Verein für Höhlenkunde”, leto kasneje pa “Karst Comité”. Kmalu zatem je želel ustanoviti tudi podružnico tega društva v Postojni. V Planini je bilo že 50 bodočih članov. Poleti 1889 sta domačina z Velikega Otoka pri Postojni odkrila vhod v Otoško jamo, del postojnskega jamskega sistema. Nastal je spor za lastništvo Postojnske jame in kako naj bi delili dohodek. Takoj za tem je bilo ustanovljeno društvo Anthron - odziv na odkritje Otoške jame. Anthron je bilo ekskluzivno društvo z omejenim številom članom, ki so morali živeti v Postojni - večina jih je bila članov postojnske Jamske komisije. »lani Anthrona so odkrili pomembne del Postojnskega jamskega sistema, raziskovali jame v okolici in pomagali takratnim najvidnejšim speleologom Krausu, Martelu, Perku in Puticku. Ko je bilo v Ljubljani ustanovljeno Društvo za raziskavanje podzemskih jam in je Perko objavil namen ustanoviti speleološki inštitut v Postojni, je bilo društvo Anthron ukinjeno. Tako je mogoče dokumentirano podpreti trditev, da se je organizirana speleološka dejavnost v Sloveniji pričela 1889.In the middle of the 19th century caving and speleological activities were well developed in Kranjska (Carniola) already. F. Kraus took an interest in our karst by 1878. In 1879 he founded ˝Verein für Höhlenkunde˝ and a year later ˝Karst Comité˝. Soon afterwards he wanted to set up a branch of ˝Verein˝ at Postojna. In Planina he had 50 future members already. In summer of 1889 some villagers of Veliki Otok near Postojna discovered the entrance to so-called Otoška jama, making a part of Postojnska jama system. The dispute about the ownership and how to share the income of Postojnska jama aroused. And soon afterwards in Postojna the club Anthron was founded - a reaction to this discovery. Anthron was an exclusive club with limited number of members who must live in Postojna - and majority were members of Postojnska jama Cave (Managing) Commission. The Anthron members discovered an important part of Postojnska jama system, explored caves nearby and helped the best known speleologists of that time such as Kraus, Martel, Perko and Putick. When Speleological club was set up in Ljubljana and Perko announced the foundation of Speleological Institute at Postojna, the club Anthron was dismissed. Thus the documents prove that continuous organised speleological activity started in Slovenia in 1889.",

Dolomitna voda Cerkniščice odteka predvsem v Rak v Rakovem Škocjanu, Kotliči pa kažejo na povezavo s Svinjsko jamo in Malo Karlovico. Rak na ponoru predstavlja ob zelo nizkih vodostajih pretežno vodo Kotličev s Ca/Mg okoli 3,5 in z najnižjo vrednostjo 2,2 ob najnižjih vodostajih, ko v Svinjsko jamo ponika le Cerkniščica, kar se kasneje odrazi tudi v Malenščici. Ob visokih vodostajih v ponor odteka mešanica Raka in Kotličev s Ca/Mg okoli 4. Dotok voda iz doline Pivke označuje višje razmerje Ca/Mg in večje vrednosti pokazateljev onesnaženja, medtem ko označujejo infi ltracijsko vodo iz slabo prepustnega dela Javornikov vrednosti Ca/Mg okoli 5. Zaradi zapletenosti sistema ostaja še vrsta odprtih vprašanj, ki bi jih lahko pojasnile le dodatne raziskave. Basic physico-chemical properties of waters within the area of Malenščica are given, and so are the connections that they indicate. Dolomitic water of the Cerkniščica mostly fl ows into the Rak in Rakov Škocjan valley, while Kotliči springs show the connection with Svinjska jama (cave) and Mala Karlovica. When water levels are low the Rak river at its swallowhole mostly comprises waters from Kotliči, with Ca/Mg about 3, 5 and the lowest value 2,2 when the water levels are the lowest, when only the Cerkniščica sinks into Svinjska jama; this later reflects also in the water of the Malenščica. When water levels are high, the mixture of Rak and Kotliči fl ows into the swallowhole, and Ca/Mg is about 4. The infl ux of waters from Pivka Valley is designated by higher ratio of Ca/Mg and higher values of pollution indicators, when the infi ltration water from poorly conductive part of Javorniki is designated by Ca/Mg values about 5. Due to the complexity of the system there are still some unanswered questions left which can only be answered by carrying out additional researches.",

K poznavanju krasa Zahodnih Alp so pripomogle sistematične analize na podlagi geomorfologije. Pri tem veliko koristi »imunost krasa«, ki ohranja stare prevodne strukture in njihovo zvezo s sedimenti. Kapniki kažejo na očitno povezavo z vegetacijo, v njih pa se lahko odražajo tudi geomorfološke krize. Klastični sedimenti odkrivajo mehansko erozijo. Na podlagi geomorfološkega pristopa je mogoče ugotoviti nastanek krasa in jam, kar vključuje razvojne stadije ter značilnosti okolja in procesov. Raziskovalci ponovno tehtajo prevladujočo vlogo, ki so jo včasih pripisovali ledenikom. Kras se pojavi takoj, ko nastane gradient in ko je z vodonosnika odstranjen neprepustni pokrov. Take okoliščine so bile že v zgornjem Miocenu in včasih celo prej. Na kras pleistocenske starosti je mogoče najti le v notranjih Alpah, kjer je bil ta pokrov odstranjen kasneje. Navpični sistemi, sestavljeni iz vrste brezen, so stari in postajajo vedno bolj kompleksni. primeri s terena zavračajo Fordovo klasifi kacijo, ki jim pripisuje nastanek v globoki freatični coni.

Karst genesis in Western Alps is brought up by systemic analysis, according to a geomorphologic approach. It uses the “karst immunity” that conserves old drainage structures and their associated sediments. Karst landscapes can be sorted into horizontal and vertical forms. Speleothems are clearly connected to the presence of vegetation but they also record geomorphic crisis. Clastic sediments reveal mechanical erosion. This approach concludes with karst genesis and speleogenesis reconstruction, which blend together evolution stages, environment characterization and processes. Researchers reconsider the preponderant part previously attributed to glaciers. Karst appears immediately when a gradient exists and when the aquifer is stripped of its impervious cover. Such conditions occurred from the Upper Miocene and sometimes before. Karsts of the Pleistocene age are only met in the Inner Alps where cover stripping occurred later. Vertical systems composed of shaft series are old and become more complex. Field evidence refutes FORDʼs classifi cation, which assigns a deep phreatic origin. A brief account of the present state of knowledge, according to region and researcherʼs scientifi c themes, allows establishing the last decadeʼs advances. It also shows a disparity between the North and the South Western Alps, where Vercors appears to be one of the best studied massifs in the Alps.",

    "abstract": "The study of both endokarstic systems Bosnek (Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria) and Wintimdouine (High Atlas Mountain, Morocco) is presented in this work. Both regions are standard for the study of geodynamic processes in Bulgaria and Morocco, and they could be used as geodynamic polygons in the Mediterranean region. The karst is developed in Triassic and Jurassic limestones. The karst processes in both endokarstic systems occur under the conditions of active Quaternary and recent tectonics. A typical structural karst is formed. The present work shows also the results of the comprehensive studies performed in the field of geology, tectonics, geomorpholody, hydrology, climatology, etc., of the karst. It is accented on the genesis and the evolution of the greatest cave systems in Bulgaria (Duhlata cave – more than 17 km) and Morocco (Wintimdouine cave – more than 19 km long). Both cave systems are situated in zones with high seismicity, with open surface and sud-surfase paleoseismic disruptions. The karst study and monitoring of its processes has great practical value in Bulgaria and Morocco because they are related to one of the largest urbanized territories ( Pernik and Sofia for Bulgaria, and Agadir for Morocco) and they are protected natural objectives as well. V prispevku so predstavljene raziskave jamskih sistemov Bosnek (Vitoša, Bolgarija) in Wintimdouine (Visoki Atlas, Maroko). To sta standardni območji za preučevanje geodinamičnih procesov v Bolgariji in Maroku in bi lahko služili kot geodinamični poligon za celotno Sredozemlje. Tamkajšnji kras je razvit v triasnih in jurskih apnencih. V obeh jamskih sistemih potekajo kraški procesi pod vplivom aktivne kvartarne in recentne tektonike. Izoblikovan je značilni strukturni kras. V članku so predstavljeni tudi izsledki podrobnih preučevanj krasa na področju geologije, tektonike, geomorfologije, hidrologije, klimatologije, itd. Osredotočen je na največja jamska sistema v Bolgariji (preko 17 km dolga jama Duhlata) in Maroku (preko 19 km dolga jama Wintimdouine). Oba sistema sta v območju močne seizmičnosti z odprtimi površinskimi in podpovršinskimi paleoseizmičnimi razpokami. Preučevanje in redno opazovanje krasa in kraških procesov je za Bolgarijo in Maroko velikega praktičnega pomena, saj so vezana tako na največja urabnizirana ozemlja (Pernik in Sofija v Bolgariji, Agadir v Maroku), kot so to tudi zavarovani naravni pojavi.",

Plasti apnenca generalno vpadajo proti NW, najizrazitejše prelomne strukture so v dinarski in prečnodinarski smeri. S fliša na kontakt z apnencem pritekajo trije večji in en manjši potok, ki ponikajo v apnenec. V jamski sistem se povezujejo Ocizeljska jama, Blažev spodmol, Maletova jama s slapom, Jama z naravnim mostom, Jurjeva jama v Lokah in Jama S-4/Socerb od katerih vhodi v štiri jame delujejo kot občasen ponor. Skrajna vhoda sta drug od drugega oddaljena 500 m. Voda se v sistemu istočasno pretaka na različnih nivojih in drenira proti Boljuncu. Za razvoj jamskega sistema, generalne smeri jamskih rovov in pretakanje vode v sistemu, je najpomembnejši sistem vzporednih tektonskih ploskev z vpadom 220/50-80. The cave system of Beka-Ocizla is developed in the area of contact between Palaeocene limestone and Eocene flysch at 350 m a.s.l. in south-western Slovenia. The beds of limestone could generally be traced in the direction towards NW; the most distinct tectonic structures are in the Dinaric direction and transversely to the Dinaric direction. Three bigger streams and one smaller flow from the flysch on the contact with limestone, which sink into the limestone. The following caves are connected to the cave system: Ocizeljska jama, Blažev spodmol, Maletova jama s slapom, Jama z naravnim mostom, Jurjeva jama v Lokah and Jama S-4 / Socerb; the entrances of four of those caves function as occasional ponors. The least close entrances are 500 m away from each other. The water in the system simultaneously flows on various levels and drains in the direction of Boljunec. The system of parallel fault planes with dip 220/50-80 is the most important for the development of the cave system, the general direction of the caveʼs passages and the flow of water in the system.",

    "abstract": "Na planoti Banjšice (SZ Slovenija) je najdaljša izvirna jama Smoganica, dolga 492 m. Jama (na nadmorski višini 505 m) leži na jugozahodnem pobočju Čukle (770 m) vzhodno od reke Soče (153 m nad morjem). Smoganica se je razvila v apnenčevi breči, ki je tu debela 10 m in je del zgornjekrednih flišnih plasti. V okolici jame so zeleni laporji kot vključki v breči ali pa je breča vključena v plasti zelenega laporja. Klasti v debelozrnati breči, v kateri je tudi jama, merijo od nekaj cm do več dm v premeru. Klasti večinoma izvirajo iz mlajših rudistnih apnencev, spodnje in zgornje krede ter jurskih mikritnih in oolitnih apnencev. Jama Smoganica leži okrog 2 km južno od Idrijskega preloma in okrog 200 m severno od Kobariškega preloma. V jami zasledimo dve glavni razpoklinski smeri: N30-45°E in N120-135°E. Smoganica se je oblikovala kot sistem manjših rovov, ki so se razvili znotraj breče v vseh smereh. Jama je nastala v freatičnih razmerah. Kasneje je bila v celoti zapolnjena s sedimenti, nad katerimi so nastale nadsedimentne skalne oblike. Sedimenti so bili nato iz jame odnešeni. Današnji vodni tok oblikuje dno jamskih rovov. Višje vode oblikujejo fasete in draslje, nižje pa talne žlebove. Jamo lahko opredelimo kot poligenetsko, saj je njene dele že povsem preoblikovala voda, ki prenika s površja in polzi po jamskih stenah. On the Banjšice plateau (NW Slovenia) the longest spring cave is 492 m long Smoganica. The cave (505 m above sea level) is situated on the SW slope of Čukla (770 m) E from the Soča river (153 m above the sea level). Smoganica is developed in limestone breccia, which is 10 m thick and belongs to the Upper Cretaceous flyschrocks. On the territory around the cave, the green marls are included in breccias or breccias are included into the green marls. Clasts in coarse-grained breccia, in which the cave is located, vary from some cm to several dm in diameter. Clasts are mostly deriving from younger rudist limestones, Lower and Upper Cretaceous and Jurassic micritic and oolitic limestones. Smoganica is situated about 2 km south from Idrija fault and about 200 m north from Kobarid fault. There are two principal fissure orientations in the cave, N30-45ºE and N120-135ºE. Smoganica was formed from the system of smaller passages that have been developed inside the breccia in 3D. The cave was formed in phreatic conditions, later it was completely filled with cave sediments.In the next stagethe above-sediment rock forms were developed. Cave sediments were later removed from the cave. Today the active water stream is cutting rock forms in the bottom of the cave passages. Higher water quantities are forming scallops and potholes and lower quantities floorchannels. Smoganica can be described as polygenetic cave because the percolating water is reshaping the passages.",

    "abstract": "Dolgoletno vprašanje udobnejšega in hkrati lažjega obiska Postojnske jame je bilo rešeno leta 1872, ko so po jami položili prve tire. Pot po jami ni imela ne velikih vzponov, niti ne velikih padcev, zato so se odločili da bo vozove po jami “človeška moč gonila”. Po letu 1900 je zanimanje za obisk Postojnske jame skokovito narastlo. Uprava Postojnske jame se je trudila izboljšati in “lajšati promet” v jami, poleg tega pa je, upoštevajoč želje in potrebe obiskovalcev, skrbela za vedno večje udobje slednjih. Kljub vsemu, pa mala ročna železnica ni več ustrezala potrebam tedanjih obiskovalcev. Prve poizkusne vožnje z lokomotivo so opravili med aprilom in junijem 1924. Aprila 1957 so pri Postojnski jami stare dotrajane lokomotive zamenjali z dvema novima, akumulatorskima.The problem of making visits to Postojnska jama more comfortable and easier was solved in 1872 when the first railway was put in the cave. The path through the cave did not have many ascents or descents; therefore it was decided that the carriages in the cave could be ˝driven by manpower˝. After 1900 interest in visiting Postojnska jama increased. The Board of Postojnska jama constantly improved and ˝facilitated the cave traffic˝ and took care of the utmost comfort of the visitors. For all that, the small, manually operated railway was becoming less and less appropriate. The first test-drives with a locomotive were performed between April and June 1924. In April 1957 two new locomotives with batteries replaced the old, worn-out ones.",

Spodnji, recentni in subrecentni freatični horizonti v jamskem “dnu” so verjetno del kanalov podzemeljske reke Like, ki ponika na severovzhodni strani Velebita in teče skozenj v podmorske izvire v Jadranskem morju. Ostali rovi so predvsem brezna in meandri z vadoznimi oblikami. Analize izotopa 14C dokazujejo, da so najstarejše sige v obojih, v starih in v subrecentnih freatičnih rovih, medtem ko so mlajše sige v vadoznih meandrihDuring three speleological expeditions the Slovačka jama cave has been explored to the depth of 1268m. In the cave there are several channels with phreatic forms. The highest relict phreatic channel is probably due to sinkholes formed on the karst uvala Veliki Lubenovac at the time of uvala formation. Lower, recent and subrecent, phreatic horizons at the cave bottom are probably a part of the underground route of the Lika river which sinks on the north-eastern side of Velebit mountain and flows through the mountain to the submarine springs in the Adriatic sea. Other channels are mostly shafts and channels with meandering vadose forms. 14C isotope analysis of speleothems shows that the oldest are situated in both ancient and subrecent phreatic channels, while younger ones are found in the vadose meandering channel.",

Due to prevalence of carbonate rocks in the drainage area of most of the rivers on Eastern Adriatic coast, those rivers carry only approximately 20 % of particulates as suspended matter and the rest is dissolved. Consequently, many of typical karst features such as karrens, dolines, poljes, caves, pits and river valleys and canyons as well, presently under the sea, can still be recognized. Beside these simply drowned features, some new ones were formed by the sea level rise. Those are submarine springs, so called vruljas, brackish coastal springs and marine lakes. The most significant evidences of former subaerial conditions are speleothems in submerged caves and calc tufa deposits of drowned paleo rivers. Both of them could be used for determination of the former low sea level stands.",

Phong Nha-Ke Bang national park is protected also as a UNESCO world heritage site. Due to weak economic situation in this region as a result of lack of natural resources, karst tourism represents an important opportunity for raising the quality of live in the province. A proposal to adapt non-touristic Heaven’s Cave for tourism was presented to Karst Research Institute ZRC SAZU in 2006. Because the caves are sensitive ecosystems and all activities in them should be carefully implemented, our task was to make basic survey and map the cave, to perform a speleological and touristic research, to propose possible interventions for adapting the cave for tourism and to prepare a strategy for tourism development in this area. The latter should also show us if some interest is present among tourists for new show cave in this region. From this point of view this study does not represent systematic long-term approach for adapting a cave for tourism but rather a short study of a cave with potential to be show cave in remote area of Central Vietnam. Approach used in this study should be used in similar environments as a first step to estimate if weakly known cave is environmentally and economically suitable for development for touristic purposes.Keywords: Heaven’s Cave, Thien Duong Cave, Phong Nha-Ke Bang, Vietnam, show cave.",

The spring zone is used for water supply (about 250 l/s) of an important tourist area of Crikvenica and Novi Vinodolski. After unsuccessful attempts of physical separation of freshwater system from the sea influence, by construction of grout curtain, hydrogeological studies have focused on the possibility of groundwater capturing in the hinterland of discharge zone, outside of the zone of periodical salinity. The final research results with the exploitation well in the spring hinterland can serve as a model for research and exploitation of drinking water in natural conditions of unstable freshwater-saltwater interface in similar natural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Using archival hard copy records on 22,922 wells and hy­drogeological boreholes, maintained since 1950's on the ter­ritory of Slovak Republic, a spatial database was developed. If possible, each borehole was linked to a certain aquifer or aquifer lithological type, according to its screened inter­val. Wells with ambiguous position of open casing were ex­cluded from further processing to obtain distinct relation of pumping rate to lithology. Using stored records of hydraulic tests, eachpumping rate was processed to obtain uniformly calculated “standard” specific capacity. These values were subsequently used to re-interpret hydraulic parameters. Based on standardized specific capacity data, estimates of transmissivity (T; in m2∙s-1) and hydraulic conductivity (K; in m∙s-1) for eachwell were calculated and linked to corre­sponding aquifer type. From these, hydraulic properties of limestones (238 boreholes), dolomites (463 boreholes) and granitoid rocks (96 boreholes) are compared. As anticipat­ed, geometrical mean of transmissivity was low for grani­toids (6.51∙10-5 m2∙s-1) and in one order of magnitude higher for limestones (6.16∙10-4 m2∙s-1), due to its enhancement by karstification. The highest observed value of mean transmis­sivity, two times higher than that found for limestones, was obtained for dolomitic aquifers (1.04∙10-3 m2∙s-1). Dolomitic aquifers also show the highest median values of hydraulic conductivity (3.21∙10-5 m∙s-1), in one order of magnitude higher than granitoids (2.10∙10-6 m∙s-1) and three times higher than limestones (9.45∙10-6 m∙s-1). In comparison with limestones, dolomites seem to be slightly more homogene­ous in aquifer properties; also several lithological types there show similarities in both T and K. Some limestone lithofacies (Steinalm and Raming), seem to have lower transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity comparing to other limestones types (Dachstein, Gutenstein, Wetterstein). The data on hy­draulic properties of all these hard rocks show lognormal statistical distribution and high heterogeneity.",

This area is characterised by authentic structures, which respresent a valuable cultural heritage and an important element of the national identity.

This paper is the result of research in its structural vocabulary in order better to understand and value these unique landscapes. The complex typological articulation was, generated mainly by natural karst phenomena (karst valleys and fields, small dolinas, dry valleys) as well various stone walls, terraces, and similar features, formed through the process of land cultivation. A considerable diversity of landscape units and patterns bas been identified through particular structures which often turned out to be assets themselves, and which at the same time help to understand and interpret the outstanding value of the island `s landscape.",

    "abstract": "There has been little research on the genesis and development of pyroducts (or lava tubes) originating from Gala´pagos volcanoes. Pyroducts are responsible for the lateral, post-eruptive transport of lava because they are highly effective as thermal insulators. After eruptions terminate, these conduits often become accessible as caves. In March 2014 the 16th International Symposium on Vulcanospeleology brought a large group of vulcanospeleological specialists to the Islands. During the meeting a number of pyroducts were visited and studied in context on the island of Santa Cruz and around Isabella’s Sierra Negra volcano in the western, most active, part of the Gala´pagos. The longest of the caves, Cueva del Cascajo, about 3 km in length, was partly surveyed and nine other caves were visited. Structural features such as thickness of roof, evidence of downcutting, presence of oxbows, secondary ceilings, lavafalls, collapses and pukas were particularly studied for evidence they reveal about developmental stages of pyroducts. The resulting data show that the pyroducts were formed by \"inflation\" with the primary roof consisting of uninterrupted paŻhoehoe sheets. No pyroducts were identified that developed by the crusting-over of channels. The studies strongly confirm inferences drawn from other hot-spot related islands, such as Hawai’i.",

    "abstract": "To study the soil genetic diversity of bacteria and fungi in different vegetation successions (grassland, shrubbery, primary forest and secondary forest) from the karst area, the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology was applied. The results showed that: (1) the diversity of bacterial communities and the fungal communities in karst area were higher than non karst area in each vegetation succession. Compared with the survey from bacterial (the Shannon index was 2.97 in primary forest, 2.91 in secondary forest, 3.18 in shrubbery, 3.14 in grassland and 2.68 in non karst), fungal diversity between karst areas (the Shannon index was 3.56 in primary forest, 3.78 in secondary forest, 3.73 in shrubbery and 3.70 in grassland) and non karst areas (the Shannon index was 3.08) was more evident, which may be related to the alterations of the composition of plant community and the source of carbon in soil with the vegetation succession of karst ecosystem; (2) The comparation of bacterial diversity index and the richness comprehensively evaluated as follows: shrubbery &gt; grassland &gt; primary forest &gt; nsecondary forest. The diversity index and the richness of fungal communities was as follows: secondary forest &gt; shrubbery &gt; grassland &gt; primary forest. The results suggest that the fungal communities have been greatly changed via vegetation successions, but the diversity index and the richness of the bacterial communities have not been seriously affected. The results provide scientific basis for understanding karst surface ecosystem, which contributes to the future aim of protecting the karst from desertification.",

In winter, cold air enters the cave, radically cooling the entrance part of the cave, where for this reason there is permanent cave ice. The summertime circulation is reversed: emerging from the inner part of cave, which has an average temperature of around 4° C, is air which only when it transits through the sub-cooled entrance part is then cooled to around 1° C. This air comes to the surface and in the hollow at the cave entrance maintains a distinct thermal inversion during the warm part of the year. There is a similar air circulation and similar development of annual temperatures observed at the vents, where cave air emerges through rubble spread over cave entrances on slopes or at the bottom of dolines. The stable summer air temperatures of around 1° C in the vents where I conducted measurements indicate that underneath them there is also permafrost or sub-cooled rock and permanent ice. This is created and preserved, just like in the caves, due to the advection of cold air in winter. In Trnovski gozd, such karstic permafrost is found at an altitude of 1,100 m above sea level. The outflow of cold air from the vents in the summer, just like inside the cave, causes a distinct thermal inversion in dolines on the surface.",

    "abstract": "The Lessini Mountains carbonate plateau (Venetian Prealps, Italy) is one of the most important karst areas in Italy. Along with alpine-type caves and well-developed karst landscapes, palaeokarst features are also common. In most cases, palaeokarst is represented by caves and fissures filled by limonitic-haematitic palaeosols (ochres) in which fossiliferous arenite layers are sometimes embedded. These features developed and fossilised during a late Eocene-middle Miocene phase of emersion. Between the Palaeocene and the Oligocene, over a time span partially overlapping the development of palaeokarst, basaltic volcanism took place in the Lessini Mountains. Along with ochre fills, cave passages that were intruded by basalt provide further evidence that a well developed karst network existed in the Lessini Mountains area in the middle-late Palaeogene. Moreover, basalt intrusions provide the only available data for the dating of palaeokarst in the central Lessini Mountains, where fossiliferous layers in ochre beds have not been found. We have started a new survey on palaeokarst in the Lessini plateau, with the aim of identifying ancient features on the basis of unusual fills (namely, ochre and basalt) and morphologies. New instances of basalt intrusions in three caves, Spigola di Canova, Covoli di Velo, and Covolo della Croce, have been recognised; evidence of pre-existing karst features filled by basalt in a previously studied cave (Grotta A Veja) has been identified, and an unusual basalt outcrop that might relate to palaeokarst has also been observed. This paper aims to document the new findings and to discuss previous ones. At the same time, we would like to point out some cautionary observations to prevent a “basalt = palaeokarst” misunderstanding.Key words: palaeokarst, basalt intrusion, cave fills, Lessini Mountains.",

    "abstract": "Palygorskite is fibrous mineral representing the transitional phase between chain silicates and layer silicates with modulated phyllosilicate structure. Although often found in carbonate environments, it forms quite uncommon constituent of cave fills. Palygorskite occurs in cave fills in two forms: (1) allogenic palygorskite which in arid and semiarid conditions can represents substantial constituent of cave fills, often associated with smectite, gypsum, calcite and halite; it is airborne or transported by surface run-off to caves from desert soils and paleosoils, calcretes, dolocretes and related deposits in cave surroundings. (2) Authigenic palygorskite occurs as in situ precipitate in cave fills from percolating water solutions and/or transformation of smectite and kaolinite in dry evaporative conditions and suitable geochemical composition of solutions. In carbonate host-rocks palygorskite fills fissures and faults and often it is found in cave walls. It occurs commonly as part of the “mountain leather” as a result of hydrothermal and/or weathering processes or represents a product of in situ chemical precipitation from percolating meteoric solutions with suitable pH a redox conditions and chemical composition.Key words: palygorskite, caves, karst.Paligorskit v jamah in krasu: pregledPaligorskit je vlaknat mineral, ki je prehodna fazo med inosilikati in listastimi silikati z modulirano strukturo filosilikata. Čeprav je pogost v karbonatnih okoljih, je precej neobičajna sestavina jamskih sedimentov. Paligorskit se v jamah pojavlja v dveh oblikah: (1) kot alogeni paligorskit, ki je v sušnih in polsuhih razmerah lahko znaten sestavni del jamskih sedimentov, pogosto povezanih z montmorillonitom, sadro, kalcitom in halitom; v teh primerih gre za eolski nanos ali pa za transport v jame s površinskim transportom iz puščavskih tal in paleotal, kalkret, dolokret in podobnih sedimentov; (2) kot avtogeni paligorskit se pojavlja v jamah kot »in situ« oborina iz prenikajočih raztopin in/ali z obarjanjem med transformacijo montmorillonita in kaolinita v jamskih sedimentih v suhih razmerah izhlapevanja in primerno geokemično sestavo raztopin. V karbonatnih kamninah paligorskit zapolnjujejo razpoke in prelome in ga pogosto najdemo na jamskih stenah. Običajno se pojavlja kot del “gorskega usnja”, ki je posledica hidrotermalnih in/ali procesov preperevanja. Lahko pa nastane tudi zaradi in situ kemičnega obarjanja iz prenikajočih meteornih raztopin z ustreznim pH, redoks potencialom in kemično sestavo.Ključne besede: paligorskit, jame, kras.",

This article presents the results from an in situ monitoring of microdisplacements across fissure forming the Golyamata Tsepnatina Cave located at the edge of Madara Plateau above the Horseman, NE Bulgaria. Additionally, we studied movements along cracks behind the plateau edge, which are related to the dynamics of peripheral plateau parts and shaped the rock slices. Monitoring involves the use of a 3D extensometer model TM-71 installed in the cave as well as five sets of pin marks installed across the cracks behind the plateau edge. The results obtained since 1990 indicate formation of a new rock slice from the cliff due to the gravitational extension of rock massif. The established horizontal microdisplacements of the rock slice to SSE imply the existence of a possible active fault with left-lateral component of movements at the base of the plateau. We established influences from near and distant earthquakes with epicenters in NE Bulgaria (Provadia), Romania (Vrancea), and Turkey (Izmit). The graphs of established movements mark continuously ongoing process of shear processes along the slice forming cracks.Key words: rock deformations, seismic effects, monitoring, microdisplacements, Madara Plateau, Bulgaria.Spremljanje mikropremikov v jami Goljamata Cepnatina, Visoka planota Madara, SV BolgarijaEdini zgodnjesrednjeveški skalni relief v Evropi, Madarski konjenik, je vključen v Unescovo svetovno dediščino.

It is based on the presumption that the intensity of natural contamination attenuation processes depends on rock disruption/karstification. The method is applied on the Mesozoic rock environment of the most important hydrogeological structure in the southern slopes of the Nízke Tatry Mountains. Hydrograph analyses of groundwater depletion in the gauged or exploited springs were used for assessment of groundwater vulnerability to human and/or natural pollution. Differences in character of individual depletion hydrographs enable assessment an extent of absorption and elimination processes during the groundwater penetration through the rock environment from the infiltration area to the outflow in the spring or exploited source. The depletion hydrographs reflect not only the character (effect) of outflow area but reflect the effects whole infiltration and accumulation area. In total, 68 individual recession curves from 9 gauged springs were analysed. Obtained degrees of groundwater vulnerability are evaluated by 10 degree range of the Kullman´s vulnerability scheme, adjusted by Malík. The reached vulnerability values are consequently applied and assigned to the lithological types of discharge area of gauged springs. This study also describes an existence of individual laminar and turbulent sub-regimes that occur in the karts-fissure rock environment, the type of rock disruption from open micro– to macro fissures - to karst channels and subsequent estimation of the karstification degree.",

    "abstract": "Research on the cave and karst water in the area of Monte Lago polje (Central Apennines) has revealed an articulate drainage pathway, influenced by the karstfication degree and geological setting. A fast drainage occurs from the ponor in the polje to the main temporary resurgence in the valley of San Giovanni, impeding the karst water in achieving thermal equilibrium with the rock. The water temperature in the resurgence decreases to very low values (~3 °C) during the winter, and the daily thermal cycles are clearly recognizable. These inputs of vadose water from the ponor have only a minor influence on the chemo-physical characteristics of San Giovanni spring, the largest emergence in the area, located a few hundred meters downstream in the same valley and fed by the main basal aquifer. The two nearby springs are recharged by different hydrostructures divided by low permeability levels in the Jurassic carbonate succession. This reduces the cross-formational communication mainly for the descending vadose fluxes. The fast drainage of karst water in the transfer vadose zone is due to a high karstfication, confirmed by the typology and distribution of the karst caves. A more regular discharge in the springs fed by the basal aquifer is probably related to a minor karstfication in the lower part of the limestone massifs.Key words: Monte Lago, Central Apennines, Karst, Groundwater monitoring.Kraško polje Monte Lago, študija vpliva geološke zgradbe in stopnje zakraselosti na tok podzemne vode v Centralnih Apeninih (Italija)Raziskave jam in kraške vode na območju kraškega polja Monte Lago (Centralni Apenini) so razkrile obstoj drenažne mreže, na katero vplivata stopnja zakraselosti in geološka zgradba.

Pozimi ima voda v izviru zelo nizko temperaturo (~3 °C), jasno so vidni dnevni temperaturni cikli.

Dva sosednja izvira se napajata iz različnih hidrostruktur, ločenih s plastmi slabše prepustnosti v jurskem karbonatnem zaporedju. To zmanjšuje prehajanje predvsem navzdol tekočih vadoznih vod skozi formacije. Hitro pretakanje kraške vode v vadozni coni je posledica dobre zakraselosti, ki jo potrjujeta tipologija in razpored kraških jam. Bolj enakomeren pretok izvirov, ki se napajajo iz spodnjega vodonosnika, je verjetno povezan z manjšo zakraselostjo v spodnjem delu apnenčastega masiva.Ključne besede: Monte Lago, Centralni Apenini, kras, monitoring podzemne vode.",

Finally, a breakthrough curve in field test is processed with different Gaussian parameters. The results demonstrate how the parameter controls the cutting-off frequency and the filter is well controllable and very efficient in acquiring the primary trend of the curves.Key words: Gaussian filter; convolution; breakthrough curves, cutting-off frequency, noises.Analiza sledilnih krivulj z Gaussovimi filtriSledilne krivulje (krivulja časovne odvisnosti koncentracije povrnjenega sledila) v hidrogeologiji so podobno kot seizmogrami v geofiziki obremenjene z nezaželenimi visokofrekvenčnimi šumi in interferencami. V tem članku uporabimo Gaussov filter, primarno namenjen obdelavi seizmičnih podatkov, za odstanitev visokofrekvenčnih šumov iz sledilnih krivulj. Najprej predstavimo matematične osnove filtriranja, potem Gaussov filter z parametrom 0,2 in 0,5 uporabimo na štirih sledilnih krivuljah, dobljenih v laboratorijskih pogojih. Na koncu z različnimi Gaussovimi parametri obravnavamo sledilno krivuljo, dobljeno pri sledenju v naravi. Z rezultati prikažemo vpliv izbranih parametrov na mejno frekvenco ter prilagodljivost , učinkovitost in uporabnost filtra za izluščenje primarnih značilnosti sledilnih krivulj.Ključne besede: Gaussov filter, konvolucija, sledilne krivulje, mejne frekvence, šum.",

    "abstract": "The new railway line between Divača and Koper/Capodistria in south-western Slovenia is being built, a part of which crosses the southern outskirts of the Classical Karst plateaux. It will run through two tunnels, the northern tunnel T1 (6.7 km long) and the southern T2 (6 km long), which partially cross karst aquifer system. A multi-tracer test with injections of fluorescent dyes uranine and naphthionate, bypassing the karst vadose zone, was carried out to define the directions and dynamics of the underground water flow. The main goals were better understanding of the complex hydrogeological conditions in the area and assessment of possible environmental impacts on the nearby water sources. With tracing of uranine injected into a nearby cave stream, the direction of flow from the northern T1 tunnel mainly towards the Reka-Timavo aquifer system and further towards the Timava/Timavo springs was proved. The peak velocities, as determined from the peaks of the tracer breakthrough curves, range from 29 m/h to 36 m/h. Through the wider and well-connected conduits of the Reka-Timavo system, the peak velocities can reach up to 88 m/h. The recovery of uranine in an intermediate cave, i.e., Jama 1 v Kanjaducah, amounted to approximately 74 %. The northern section of the southern T2 tunnel is a part of a wider bifurcation zone between the Osapska Reka and the Boljunec/Bagnoli springs, where peak flow velocities between 10 and 13 m/h have been determined by tracing of naphthionate injected into a borehole located in the line of the planned tunnel. It has been estimated that about 25 % of the injected naphthionate flew out through the Osapska Reka spring and about 5 % through the Boljunec/ Bagnoli springs. Based on this research, proper monitoring of any potential negative impacts of the new railway line will be made possible. The study presents an approach to better planning of hazard control of traffic routes in complex and highly karstified rock settings.",

    "abstract": "The Harz Mountains in Germany are a south-tilting block of variscan-folded Devonian and Carboniferous rocks thrust over Mesozoic sediment along its northern border. Along the South Harz the overlying, unfolded upper-most Carboniferous, Permian and Buntsandstein (lower Triassic) series are exposed in a wide belt. They include a thick series of Upper Permian (“Zechstein”) evaporitic rocks, dipping with about 10° S to SW, representing a nearly continuous sulfate and carbonate karst area about 90 km long, covering 338 km². In his dissertation, the first author compiled a new geological map for the Zechstein at a scale of 1:10,000 and deduced a tectonic model to advance our understanding of the karstic features. Karstification determines the morphology of the South Harz including over 180 registered caves, thousands of sinkholes, uvalas, sinking creeks and large karstic springs. Specifically, lines of sinkholes appear to follow faults. By detailed mapping of the three lowermost Zechstein cycles, a dense matrix of faults is revealed. 85° to 125° striking faults reoccur every few 500 m, formed during the Harz-lifting compressional phase during the Upper Cretaceous. Many of these faults are reverse with a Nward thrust. This leads to repetitive exposure of the strata, causing the broadening of the Zechstein outcrop beyond what would be caused by the dip of the series alone. In other areas, horstand graben-structures are present, resulting in kilometer-long Lower Buntsandstein ridges. Below ground, the groundwater flowing southward along the dip is diverted into the direction of diachronicalthe strike, thus causing strike-parallel depressions, valleys and sinkhole rows. In the final extension phase, faults striking 150° to 180° have caused graben-structures, allowing groundwater and surface rivers to flow southward, breaking through the escarpment of the overlying Lower Buntsandstein. Therefore, the tectonic structure of the South Harz determines its hydrology and the karst features apparent at the surface. The tectonic situation of the three largest karstic springs, the Salza Spring at Förste, the Rhume Spring, and the Salza Spring at Nordhausen is discussed along with more shallow karstic settings of the Hainholz/Beierstein, the Trogstein and the area of Hainrode.",

Development plans of cities are more frequently based on the implementation of energy efficiency measures, which among other things include the use of renewable energy sources. In the area of Belgrade, research was conducted aiming for assessing the geothermal potentiality of the field and defining the possibility of groundwater exploitation. The research has been directed to groundwater formed in karst aquifers. Geothermal field evaluation was preceded by the formation of geological and hydrogeological bases, then, the development of a conceptual model of karst distribution in the city area and the systematization of data measured in the observation well network. The potentiality assessment is followed by defining of the conditions and possibilities of the exploitation of karst water as a form of geothermal energy in heat pump systems. In the exploitation of karst water in the city, it is significant to establish mechanisms of sustainable management, especially in terms of protection of resources. In recent years, there has been recorded a constant increase in the number of heating and cooling systems of buildings using groundwater as an energy source in the territory of Belgrade. Potential causes of the negative impact of exploitation of karst water are the overexploitation of resources, creating of the effect of \"thermal feedback\" as a result of incompetent disposition, namely restoring of groundwater to the aquifer.",

Petrographic thin sections and geochemical analyses of samples from outcrops and cave wall rock agree with previous interpretations of a mixing zone origin for the replacement dolomite. Further, stable isotope analysis suggests migration of fluids from the underlying basalts along fracture networks in the Seroe Domi Formation. Most of the caves represent remnant phreatic caves based on morphology; however, a number of pseudokarst features were identified. Minimum cliff retreat rates were estimated (5 mm/1000 yrs to 52 mm/1000 yrs) using cave morphologies and elevations. These remnant caves, many of which were previously overlooked, have been used as indicators of diagenetic events within the Seroe Domi Formation and contain significant information when placed in the proper geologic framework.Key words: Flank Margin Cave, Dolomitization, Seroe Domi Formation, Curaçao.Jame v dolomitiziranem profilu formacije Seroe Domin na otoku Curaçao, Nizozemski AntiliDokumentirali smo ostanke jam v dolomitizirani formaciji Seroe Domi na otoku Curaçao in raziskovali njihov nastanek.

    "abstract": "Razvitost znanstvene terminologije je eden od pomembnih kazalcev stanja v posamezni znanstveni veji. Zato je pomenila izdaja Slovenske kraške terminologije leta 1973 pomembno dejanje in prelomnico v slovenskem krasoslovju. Leto pozneje sta izšli tudi podobni terminologiji v srbskem in hrvaškem jeziku, vse to pa je bila posledica odločitve takratne Zveze geografskih organizacij Jugoslavije o jugoslovanskem znanstvenem simpoziju o kraški terminologiji, ki je bil v Ljubljani od 22.-23. oktobra 1971. Za vsem tem je stal prof. Ivan Gams, ki je bil ne samo pobudnik ampak tudi izvajalec te akcije. A tudi po njegovi pobudi so se slovenski krasoslovci v tem pogledu prebudili že deset let prej, leta 1962, ko je bil v okviru Geografskega društva Slovenije prvi posvet na to temo. Začetki samostojne slovenske krasoslovne terminologije segajo celo v drugo polovico 19. stoletja, ko so bili s prvim vodnikom o Postojnski jami avtorja Coste (1863), pisanim v slovenščini, postavljeni njeni prvi znanstveni temelji. Ivan Gams pa je skupaj s sodelavci pred tridesetimi leti z izdajo sodobno zasnovane Slovenske kraške terminologije, opremljene s tujejezičnimi sopomenkami, omogočil njen enakopraven mednarodni položaj ob boku drugih terminologij, s tem pa prispeval tudi k narodni in znanstveni samozavesti. The stage of the scientific terminology is by all means one of the indicators of the development of the scientific branch, to which it belongs. Therefore the publishing of the Slovene karst terminology in 1973 was an important event for further development of Slovene karstology. Still more, the efforts for a comparative national karst terminologies of former common state Yugoslavia were successfully achieved in publishing the Serbian and Croatian karst terminology also, a year later. In fact, the former Association of the geographical societies of Yugoslavia decided to give full support to its subcommission in preparing the project Karst terminology of the Yugoslave nations and to a joint Yugoslave symposium on Karst terminology, held in Ljubljana from 22-23th October 1971, both guided and organised by prof. Ivan Gams, who was also the original initiator of this idea. All this efforts were newertheless combined and connected with the international work of that time to find most appropriate terms and definitions for the karst phenomena and to make them comparable in terms of national terminologies. Ivan Gams was therefore not only a most important promoter of the Slovene karst terminology and one of the leading persons of the scientific karstology in the time concerned but was due to his global ideas also one of the central persons in the international karstology.",

Ker pa se voda ponikalnic pojavlja zaporedno na več niže ležečih poljih, pomeni to prenos in kopičenje onesnaženja po toku navzdol, tudi v izvire, ki so zajeti za oskrbo prebivalstva s pitno vodo. In 1986 and 1987 seven series of samples were taken at 36 to 47 sampling points on Babno, Loško and Cerkniško Polje and on Bloke and at Loški potok in order to find out their physico-chemical properties and their quality. Rainwater flows from the limestone and dolomite landscape around Babno, Loško and Cerkniško polje into springs feeding the sinking streams. The nitrate level at most of the springs was below 4 mg NO3-/l and chloride below 5 mg Cl-/l; the o-phosphate level varied around the value of 0.05 mg PO4 3-/l. The bacteriological analyses of the spring waters showed that they are not of drinking quality and only few springs were seasonally of good quality. Poorer quality was found in springs with populated catchments, such as are Pudobski Izvir, Podgorski and Mežnarjev Studenec and, obviously in all the sinking waters at swallow-holes where the nitrate and chloride level was up to 20 mg/l and phosphate up to 5 mg/l. Flowing over karst poljes this water receives pollution due to habitations and industry. As the water of these sinking streams reappears downstream in several lower-lying karst poljes this results in the transport and accumulation of pollution downstream even in springs that are captured for water supply.",

Jami sta razviti v apnencu iz zgornjega dela spodnjega permija (Kaibab formacija). V najnižjem delu Desert Cave, ki je 12,6 m globoka, jamski rov doseže litološko mejo med Kaibab apnencem in sedimentacijsko brečo (spodnji del Kaibab formacije). Stik breča-apnenec je ena od inicialnih struktur iz freatičnega obdobja razvoja jame, vendar ne pred mezozojskimi narivnimi deformacijami. Površinska razdalja med vhodoma v Desert in Upper Desert Cave je 81 m, jami nista povezani. Desert Cave se nahaja 2 km zahodno od nariva Bird Spring. Prevladujoče smeri razpok v jami so NW-SE in NE-SW. Smer rova je skoraj vzporedna s smerjo razpok NE-SW. Obstaja jasna povezava med javljanjem podorov v jami in moćneje izraženimi razpokami v smeri NW-SE.Desert Cave (72 m) and Upper Desert Cave (62 m) are the longest known caves in Blue Diamond Hill and are situated in one of its canyons. Caves are developed in limestone of latest early Permian age (Kaibab formation). In lowest part of Desert Cave, which is 12,6 m deep, cave passage reaches lithological contact between Kaibab limestone and sedimentary breccia (lower part of Kaibab formation). The contact breccia-limestone is one of initial structures in phreatic period of cave development but not before Mesozoic thrusting tectonics. Surface distance between entrances to Desert and Upper Desert Cave is 81 m, the caves are not connected. Desert Cave is situated 2 km W from Bird Spring thrust. Prevailing fissure directions in the cave are NW-SE and NE-SW. Passage direction is almost parallel with the NE-SW fissures direction. There is obvious connection in occurrence of breakdown in the cave with strongly expressed fissures in NW-SE direction.",

Od ptic jih 75 vrst tu tudi gnezdi. Izpostavljene so vrst evropske ohranitvene pozornosti kot so kosec, hribski škrjanec, podhujka in pisana penica. Pisana penica, poljski škrjanec, rjavi srakoper in velik strnad imajo na Pivških jezerih ene največjih gnezditvenih gostot v državi. Na območju Pivških jezer je bilo doslej ugotovljenih 8 vrst plazilcev in 9 vrst dvoživk. Večina vrst je uvrščena na rdeči seznam ogroženih živali. Metulji dnevniki so relativno dobro raziskani. Za območje je znanih 106 vrst kar znaša 57% vseh v Sloveniji živečih vrst metuljev. Tudi med metulji je veliko ogroženih in ranljivih vrst. Doslej je znanih prek 210 vrst hroščev. Ocenjeno je, da tu živi med 4000 do 6000 vrst hroščev. Veliko ogroženih vrst je vezanih na močvirne travnike jezer, suha kraška travišča ter kamnite griže. Za gozdove in grmišča je značilnih manj ogroženih vrst živali. Naravovarstveno so pomembni ostanki starih hrastovih gozdov. Na območju Pivških jezer je zaradi opuščanja človekove rabe opaziti hitro zaraščanje travišč, kar vodi v zmanjševanje biotske pestrosti. Poleg pravnega zavarovanja Pivških jezer je zato predlagano aktivno upravljanje, ohranjanje in usmerjanje ter spodbujanje dosedanje ekstenzivne kmetijske rabe. The paper gives an overview of the current knowledge of the fauna of the land habitats around the Pivka lakes. So far 20 mammal species and 127 bird species have been identified. Of the bird species, 75 also nest here. Special attention is paid to European conservation species such as the corn crake, woodlark, nightjar and barred warbler. The nesting density of the barred warbler, skylark, red-backed shrike and corn bunting at the Pivka lakes is among the highest in the country. In the area of the Pivka lakes 8 reptile species and 9 amphibian species have been identified. The majority of these species are on the Red List of Threatened Animals. The butterflies have been relatively well researched. 106 species have been identified in the area, which amounts to 57% of all species of butterflies living in Slovenia. Many of them are threatened and vulnerable species. To the present, 210 species of beetles have been identified, live here. Many of the threatened species are connected with the marshy grasslands of the lakes, dry karst grasslands and barren rocky outcrops. There are fewer threatened animal species in the forests and brush. The remains of old oak forests are scientifically important. Due to the abandonment of land use by humans in the area of the Pivka lakes we can observe the rapid overgrowth of pasturelands, which leads to decreased biodiversity. In addition to legal protection of the Pivka lakes it is therefore also recommend active management and conservation as well as preserving and encouragement of the formerly extensive farming practices.",

    "abstract": "Od uveljavitve krasoslovja kot znanosti ob koncu 19. stoletja so se metode proučevanja krasa razvile od klasifi kacije do sistemskega pristopa, ki omogoča napovedovanje v x, y, z in t. Zbiranju informacij, ki naj bi dale odgovor na vprašanje »kaj je to«, so sledila vprašanja »zakaj in kako« ter »kaj če«. Sprememba vprašanj je zahtevala zbiranje novih informacij, ki so spremenile način znanstvenega dojemanja krasa. Celotno vrednotenje razvoja v krasoslovnih študijah zahteva evolucijski pristop. Za sledenje sprememb v dojemanju krasa glede na razvoj uporabljane metodologije lahko defi niramo štiri glavne stopnje s prehodnimi mejami. Po razpravi o zgodovini krasoslovnih študij v Turčiji se avtor sprašuje o vzrokih, zaradi katerih napredek ni bil vzporeden splošnemu razvoju krasoslovnih študij v svetu. Ob upoštevanju dejstva, da je sprememba v dojemanju povzročila premike v pomenu pojmov in izrazov o krasu, predlaga defi nicijo izrazov ne le glede na obliko, temveč na osnovi procesov nastajanja in funkcije.Since its establishment as a science in the end of 19th century, methods applied in the study of karst evolved from classification to a system approach providing prediction in x,v,z and t. Information collected to answer the question “what is it” followed by the questions “why and how” and “what if”. The change in questions required collection of new information which in turn changed perception of karst by related scientists. An overall evaluation of the progress in karst studies postulates an evolutionary character. Four major stages can be defi ned with transitional limits to track the change in perception of karst in accordance with the progress in the applied methodology. After discussing the history of karst studies in Turkey, the author questions the reason why the track did not progress parallel to the general evolution of karst studies in the world. Considering the fact that change in perception has caused shifts in meaning of the concepts and terms of karst, it is proposed to define terms not only on the basis of form but the processes of formation and function.",

    "abstract": "Z današnjega slovenskega ozemlja je najstarejša literatura iz 16. stol. (opis Cerkniškega jezera, raziskave podzemeljskih vodnih zvez), toda alpske in ledene jame se v njej ne pojavijo pred 17. stol. Najpomembnejše in najbolj znano je Valvasorjevo delo “Die Ehre des Herzogthums Crain” (1689). Opisuje 3 jame iz Alp, a nobena ni prava jama. Izjema je izvir Savica, za katerega se je 250 let kasneje izkazalo, da je v resnici izvirna jama. Opisuje tudi nekaj ledenih jam in led v njih. Nekatere izmed teh je stoletje kasneje obiskal B. Hacquet, ki v delu “Oryctographia carniolica …” (1778 – 1789) jamski led razlaga pravilneje. Če upoštevamo Schmidlovo delo “Die Grotten und Höhlen von Adelsberg …” (1854), ki velja za prvo sodobno speleološko delo, lahko od srede 19. stol. dalje govorimo o pravi speleološki literaturi. V Gratzyjevem seznamu kranjskih jam s konca 19. stol. je omenjenih 7 alpskih jam in 30 ledenih jam. Zadnje so večinoma izven alpskega prostora, saj so tam ledene jame običajen pojav. Literatura, ki omenja alpske in ledene jame, je zelo različna, vmes so temeljna speleološka dela o ledenih jamah, kot sta Fuggerjevo »Eishöhlen und Windröhren” in Schwalbejevo “Über Eishöhlen”, pa tudi lokalna literatura, ki npr. poroča o pridobivanju ledu iz jam.The first printed literature mentioning caves in a nowadays Slovenia dates to the 16th century already (description of Cerkniško lake, research of underground water connections) but description of alpine and ice caves does not appear before the 17th century. The most important and the best known is Valvasorʼs work “Die Ehre des Herzogthums Crain” (1689). In the Alps he describes 3 caves, but none of them is a real cave. Exception is a spring of Savica which proved 250 years later to be really a spring cave. He described also some ice caves and ice formations in them. B. Hacquet visited some of the same caves a century later and in his work “Oryctographia carniolica …” (1778 – 1789) explained the formation of ice more realistically. In the middle of the 19th century appears a real speleological literature, as Schmidlʼs work “Die Grotten und Höhlen von Adelsberg …” (1854) is regarded as the fi rst “modern speleological work”. At the end of the 19th century the Gratzyʼs list of caves in Carniola (great part of the todayʼs Slovenia) includes 7 caves from the Alps and 30 ice caves. The last are practically all out of the high mountains, where the ice caves are a normal feature. The 19th century literature including alpine and ice caves is very diversifi ed, there are “classical” speleological works on ice caves as Fuggerʼs “Eishöhlen und Windröhren” or Schwalbeʼs “Über Eishöhlen”, and local literature or reports talking about extracting of ice for example.",

Namen članka je predstaviti tipično kitajsko kraško pokrajino in razložiti termine, ki jih uporabljajo. čeprav se kraško raziskovanje na Kitajskem razvija ločeno od krasoslovja na Zahodu, se v mednarodni kraški terminologiji postopoma uveljavljajo izrazi kitajskega izvora, kot so fengcong, fenglin, shilin in drugi. Vprašanje, kako z vnašanjem novih izrazov v ožjo strokovno javnost, kjer so že uveljavljeni stari termini, ostaja vedno odprto. Včasih je to potrebno, ker ima nov izraz tudi nekoliko obogaten pomen, oziroma združuje več informacij in izboljšuje razumevanje. O primernosti take odločitve naj presodijo nadaljnje razprave, ki morajo izhajati iz poznavanja problema in ne iz sentimentalnosti do izrazov, če so ti imeli do sedaj bolj splošen pomen. Good knowledge of terminology in different languages is indispensable to be able to present correctly the results of scientific work, for international cooperation of experts and for translating professional texts. Purpose of the present article is to represent the typical Chinese karst landscape and to explain the terms used in the country. Although karst researches in China are carried out separately from the karst-sciences of western countries, terms such as fengcong, fenglin, shilin are enforcing gradually into international karst terminology. Question how to introduce new terms into narrower professional public sphere with old terms already established, is still remaining open. Sometimes this is necessary since a new term is of somehow enriched meaning or is gathering more information and improving the understanding. Appropriateness of such decision should be estimated by further discussions, which should be based upon familiarity with the problem and not upon the sentimentality towards the terms, if these have born more general meaning up to this time.",

This damage differs from those, caused by nature in caves and sediments. Small mammals leave different tooth marks when gnawing bones. Maybe the damage was caused by snails? The assumption that snails damage fossil bones was first presented in case of the holes in fossilized Rhinoceros bones from Dolarjeva jama at Logatec.",

Metoda uporablja tradicionalen nabor simbolov, pri čemer ločljivost ustreza ločljivosti inženirskih načrtov. Na karti so natančno predstavljene lokacija, oblika in dimenzija jamskih oblik; npr. vsi stalagmiti z premerom nad 10 cm in vsi bloki z linearno dimenzijo nad 0.5 m so posamično prikazani.

The method envisages that everything that can be seen in the cave which is being surveyed, e.g., corrosional features, cave formations, water bodies, fallen rock blocks, fractures in cave walls, artifi cial (engineering) structures, etc., must be represented on the map. The method employs the traditional system of map symbols; the accuracy of the produced map, however, approaches the accuracy of the engineering survey maps. The maps accurately render positions, shapes and dimensions of cave features: for example all stalagmites with diameters greater than ca. 10 cm, and all rock blocks with linear sizes exceeding 0.5 m are shown on the maps individually. In the report we will elaborate on the most important aspects of this mapping method, including stages of survey and mapping, system of drawing, map symbols.",

    "abstract": "Dolini reke Pivke in Reke tvorita naraven prehod iz zgornjega Posavja v Tržaški zaliv in Kvarnerski zaliv. Strateška pomembnost tega prostora se je v prazgodovini odražala s številnimi gradišči–naselbinami na zavarovanih vrhovih, v kasni antiki z rimskimi obrambnimi zaporami ter v obdobju turških vpadov s protiturškimi tabori. Zaščitna arheološka sondiranja leta 1996 v območju arheološkega spomenika Tabor nad Zagorjem – Šilentabor, Arheološko najdišče, EŠD: 764, so odkrila del ostankov srednjeveške obrambne arhitekture, zlasti pa številne arheološke artefakte, ki potrjujejo v zgodovinskih virih omenjeno gradnjo in življenje znotraj grajskega kompleksa od 15. do 17. stoletja. The valleys of the Pivka and Reka rivers make a natural passage from the upper Posavje to the Trieste and Quarnero Bays. The strategic significance of this area in prehistoric times is shown in the numerous hillforts/settlements on the secured peaks of the hills in Late Antiquity with Roman defence blockades, and in the times of Turkish invasions with forts against the Turks. Rescue sample trenching in 1996 in the area of the Tabor archaeological monument above Zagorje - Šilentabor, archaeological site reference EŠD: 764, revealed part of the remains of a Middle Age defence architectural structure and numerous archaeological artifacts, which confirm construction and life within the castle complex from the 15th to 17th centuries, as mentioned in historical sources.",

    "abstract": "Prispevek obravnava kartiranje onesnaževalcev podtalnice na alpski kraški planoti Velika planina. Kljub temu, da na planoti ni stalne poselitve, je kakovost vode v izvirih pod planoto ogrožena zaradi športne, turistične in živinorejske aktivnosti na planoti. V izvirih so že zabeležili onesnaženje, kar kaže na pomanjkljivosti upravljanja s pitno vodo tudi na neposeljenih območjih alpskega krasa, ki so sicer z vidika varovanja zelo primerna za zaščito. The present paper presents the hazard mapping of groundwater on the Velika planina alpine karst plateau. There are no permanent residents on the plateau. Nevertheless, some serious hazards to the quality of the respective karst springs are arising from sports, tourist and farming activities. Some pollution has been already recorded in springs, showing the shortcomings of drinking water management also in uninhabited alpine karst areas, which are ordinarily very favourable for water protection.",

    "abstract": "Zgornja Pivka je že večkrat v zgodovini odigrala pomembno vlogo prav zaradi svoje strateške lege. Nazadnje se je to pokazalo po prvi svetovni vojni, ko je z uveljavitvijo Rapallske pogodbe pripadla Italiji in tako postala mejno ozemlje. Prek meje se je vzpostavil kontrabant. Čez Pivško kotlino je potekala druga linija Alpskega zidu, mogočnega obrambnega sistema, ki naj bi branil vzhodno mejo pred Jugoslavijo. Naravni prehod v smeri sever-jug, dobra preglednost nad kotlino ter dobri pogoji za oskrbo vojaških enot so bili glavni razlogi za izgradnjo utrdb na Primožu, kjer je bil hkrati komandni center za okoliške bunkerje. Za vojaške potrebe so zgradili vodne zbiralnike, ceste, mostove, smodnišnico, letališče, regulirali strugo reke Pivke in pogozdili burji izpostavljene predele. Vojska je trenirala na Petelinjskem in Palškem jezeru. Tu sta bila vojaška poligona že iz časa Avstro-Ogrske. Na jezerih je izvajala vojaške manevre tudi Jugoslovanska ljudska armada, ki je za razliko od italijanske vojske povzročila veliko večjo škodo. Dno Palškega jezera so 1990. leta sanirali in lastnikom zemljišč izplačali odškodnino, medtem ko najdemo na Petelinjskem jezeru še vedno luknje od granat, topovska gnezda in strelski jarek. Its strategic position has given Upper Pivka (Zgornja Pivka) an important role in history on several occasions. The last of these occurred after the implementation of the Rapallo Treaty at the end of the First World War, when the area was annexed to Italy and turned into borderland. Across the border the ‘Kontrabant’ developed. Through the Pivka Basin (Pivška kotlina) ran the second line of the Alpine Wall, which was a mighty defence system build to protect Italy’s eastern border with Yugoslavia. The natural north-east passage, a good view of the valley, and good conditions for supplying military units were the main reasons for building fortifications on the Primož hill. The command centre for the nearby bunkers was also located there. For military purposes, water reservoirs, roads, bridges, a powder magazine, and an airfield were built; the bed of the Pivka river was regulated, and the parts most exposed to strong winds (“burja”) were forested. Lakes Petelinjsko jezero and Palško jezero were used as training fields by the army. The two military fields had already been in service in Austro-Hungarian times. The Yugoslav People’s Army also used the lakes for its manoeuvres and did much more damage to them than the Italian army had done previously. The bottom of Palško jezero was reconstructed in 1990, and the owners were compensated. On Petelinjsko jezero, however, bomb craters, gunnests, and a trench can still be seen.",

Postavila sem več različnih modelov napajanje-praznjenje. Za vsakega sem pretvorbo vhodnega signala v odziv sistema definirala s funkcijami transferja, ki v matematični obliki odražajo razmere in procese v kraškem sistemu. Primerjava ustreznosti različnih postavljenih modelov je potrdila pomemben vpliv vegetacije ter procesov v ozračju in tleh na količino vode, ki dejansko vstopi v kraški vodonosnik in sem jo izrazila s funkcijo napajanja. Točnost simulacije pa se je povečala tudi z razčlenitvijo napajanja na počasno in hitro komponento, kar se ujema z dvojnim mehanizmom delovanja kraškega sistema: s hitrim pretokom skozi kraško drenažno mrežo in daljšim zadrževanjem v sistemu z uskladiščenjem v conah slabše prepustnosti. In the presented research I tried to find answers to the following questions: what the characteristics of the relation between recharge and discharge of the karst aquifer in the background of the Vipava springs are and which conclusions about the functioning of the karst system can be made based on stated relations between its input and output signal. Several different models of the system recharge-discharge were set. For each the conversion of the input signal to the system response was defined by transfer functions, which express conditions and processes in the karst system in mathematical form. Based on the comparison of the suitability of these different models an important influence of vegetation and processes in atmosphere and soil on the quantity of water that actually enters the karst aquifer and is expressed as recharge function was proved. An increase in the accuracy of the simulation was obtained also by the temporal distribution of recharge in fast and slow component, which is in agreement with the double mechanism of the functioning of the system: fast flow through the karst drainage net and longer retardation in the system with storage of water in less permeable zones.",

S pomočjo računalniškega programa FLAC smo modelirali stabilnost oboka pri hipotetičnem denudacijskem tanjšanju stropa. Uporabili smo dva nabora mehanskih parametrov kamnine. V obeh primerih so deformacije v stropu najmanjše pri debelini stropa 20 m do 30 m, do zrušenja pa pride pri debelini okrog 4 m. To dobro ustreza terenskim opazovanjem delno zrušenih jamskih dvoran.

Application of FLAC computer software enabled modelling of the stability of the chamber’s arched roof during hypothetical denudational lowering of the overlying surface. Modelling was based on two sets of rock property parameters generally attributed to the local parent rock. In both cases the modelled deformation within the arch was at a minimum at a residual ceiling thickness of 20 to 30 m, whereas collapse occurred when the residual ceiling thickness reduced to about 4 m. These modelling results fit well with field observations of partly collapsed cave chambers.",

    "abstract": "This article deals with micro-karstification forming abundant dissolution features in a stalagmite from Küpeli Cave in southern Turkey. Dissolution occurs when cave water enriched with CO2 from the atmosphere and soil seeps into the stalagmite. Water is transmitted from the surface of the stalagmite to the interior by the roughly vertical or diagonal notch-shaped pores formed by the enlargement of intercrystalline pores by dissolution. These slightly elongated pores appear embedded in different parts of the stalagmite and characterize different stages of dissolution during the stalagmite formation. Later, when this water reaches the relatively more permeable growth layer surfaces, it flows along these surfaces, and diffuse dissolution features form. These features include micro-scale pitted and etched surface structures, rounded and enlarged crystal boundaries and intercrystalline pores, and the breakdown of relatively large crystals into small crystals (micritization). When the percolating water is sufficiently saturated with calcium carbonate in the stalagmite, secondary calcite precipitation occurs as rim and pore-filling cements within the pores formed as a result of dissolution. In general, dissolution and calcite re-precipitation as cement are early diagenetic events and occur at different stages of stalagmite development due to seasonal variation in CO2 and CaCO3 contents of the water in the epikarst zone and within the stalagmite. These conditions were probably provided during the wet season.&#x0D;",

    "abstract": "Abiotic and biotic factors, especially microorganisms, play a role in the development of cave formations and the existence of unique characteristics of each cave. Due to the ecological conditions that characterize the cave environments, highly specialized microorganisms that are the main source of diverse bioactive compounds, inhabit these environments. The aim of this study is to determine the role and biotechnological potential of the bacteria isolated from Yarık Sinkhole located in Antalya (Turkey) by screening their ability to induce the CaCO3 precipitation, to hydrolyze urea, to induce calcite dissolution, and screening their possession of NRPS/PKS gene clusters. The most prevalent phylum is the Bacillota (synonym Firmicutes) (75.7 %), while the dominant species is Bacillus pumilus (33 %). All the isolates showed crystal formation on B4 agar medium, and the Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses showed that the crystals are predominately composed of calcium, carbon and oxygen. Ninety-six (96 %) of our isolates have negative ureolytic activity. According to this result and having the ability to induce the CaCO3 precipitation, bac­teria in this environment use other biosynthesis pathways than urea hydrolysis. MgCO3 and CaCO3 were dissolved by 61 % and 59 % of the isolates, respectively. In addition, 5.9 % and 53.7 % of the isolates showed the possession of PKS and NRPS genes, respectively. This result reveals that our isolates have high in­dustrial and biotechnological potential. They may constitute good candidates for further biotechnological applications such as construction of bio-concretes, bioremediation, soil fertility, and production of biologically active secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Proper water resources management requires recognizing and evaluating the factors that affect the quantity and quality of water resources. The Ilam-Sarvak (Upper Cretaceous) and Asmari (Oligocene to Miocene) limestone- dolomite formations in the Zagros structural belt have formed a promising karst groundwater horizon. In the present study, the hydraulic relationship between the karst structures of the Izeh territory in the northeast of Khuzestan province was investigated using hydrogeochemical and isotopic information of springs and wells. The results enabled to understand various components influencing the recharge of water resources. In this study, samples were collected from the karst springs and wells of Mongasht, Shavish-Tanosh and Kamarderaz anticlines and Naal-e-Asbi (Horseshoe) syncline and meteoric water to understand the hydrochemical and isotopic characterization, and hydrogeological and hydraulic behavior of the Izeh karst system. The meteoric and groundwater samples were analyzed to determine major and minor ion concentrations and δ18O and δ2H isotope ratios. Isotopic content ranged from -31.6 to -2.9‰ and from -6.32 to -1.87‰ for δ2H and δ18O, respectively, and d-excess values were high and positive. The study of the isotopic content of water samples of springs and wells in the region shows three groups of water sources. The first group, related to the Mongasht anticline springs, has lower isotopic values, indicating that it is recharged by rainfall at high altitudes and snow melting. The isotopic value of the second group is richer than that of the first group, indicating rainfall recharge as well as groundwater mixing (ex­amples of Naal-e-Asbi syncline and Shavish-Tanosh anticline). The highest value in the third group (samples of Kamarderaz anticline) is attributed to evaporation and longer distance from the recharge site to the discharge point, as well as to the diffu­sion system. The trend of decrease in Sr+2 and increase in Ba+2 in the samples of dolomitic limestone formations (Shavish Ta­nosh and Mongasht anticlines) compared to the water samples of Kamarderaz anticline and Naal-e-Asbi syncline indicates the possibility that karst aquifers of the region are recharged from the Mongasht anticline and that there is a hydraulic relation­ship between these structures. D-excess and δ18O show a linear trend, illustrating the effect of altitude difference on isotopic content and recharge sources. The major and minor changes in the concentration of ions, the isotopic content of groundwa­ter and the relationship between TDS and δ18O and d-excess and δ18O indicate the mixing and recharging of karst aquifers (Shavish-Tanosh, Kamarderaz and Naal-e-Asbi aquifers) from the Mongasht karst aquifer and their hydraulic connection.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the dilution process of the sulfidic groundwater in the Frasassi caves due to the recharge of O2-rich freshwater and its influence on the sulfuric acid speleogenesis and morphogenesis. The drainage pattern and the seasonal changes of the chemo-physical characteristics of the groundwater through a year-long monitoring and the measurements of the groundwater levels are presented. The inflow of water infiltrating from the karst surface influenced the sulfidic groundwater parameters, reflecting the seasonal meteoric cycle. On the contrary, the Sentino River, which represents the local base level, directly influenced the groundwater only in the most external part of the cave. The water level measurements evidenced a low hydraulic gradient (~3‰), due to the high karstification, and also some differences in the permeability depending on the drainage direction. Most cave pools are isolated on the surface and connected to each other through a network of submerged passages. In the present conditions, a surface layer of bicarbonate water forms above the sulfidic water in a large part of the cave, where it impedes subaerial corrosion by released acidic gases. Conversely, the distribution of residual gypsum deposits and corrosional wall features in the upper old cave levels demonstrate that large interfaces between sulfidic water and cave atmosphere existed during some periods of the cave history. Here, the release of acidic gases (CO2 and H2S) and the production of H2SO4 from H2S oxidation caused the widespread subaerial corrosion which significantly contributed to the morphogenesis. The comparison between these residual morphologies and the active processes shows that morphogenesis in the cave has evolved through time, influenced by hydrodynamic conditions, in turn depending on the general morphological and hydrogeological setting of the whole karst area.",

Documents from the Archive of the Karst Research Institute and an inscription in the Tartarus of Postojnska jama gave a first insight into this story (Kempe, 2005). The survey suggested that (in what is now Male jama) a connection could be blasted to shorten the visitor route. Now a further letter dated 5th September, was found shedding light on this mining attempt begun in summer 1833. In the letter the Cave Administration massively attacks the Mine Office. They claim that either the survey was not accurate or that the breakthrough was attempted at a wrong site. In consequence they demanded their expenses back, threatening with an investigation by the precinct administration.

This region is characterized by complex Cenozoic structures and active seismotectonics. In the year 2004 the areas north from Kunming and the NW part of Yunnan were studied. The measurements of the temperature, conductivity and the analyses of carbonate, phosphate and nitrate were performed in Quinglongtan spring and in the accumulation lake that is situated lower than the spring. The springs are situated in the wider zone of the Xiaojiang fault along which left horizontal movements are taking place. Along the wider zone of the Zhongdian fault between the town of Zhongdian and the Yangtze River on the south there are more springs. Tiansheng Qiao (T = 57.5ºC) and Xiageiwenquan (T = 48,3 − 66.8ºC) are thermal springs along which tufa is deposited. The Baishuitai spring has high mineralization and lower temperature (T = 11.1 − 13.3ºC) and deposits calcium carbonate in the form of gours. All studied springs are connected with active fault zones. The studied areas mostly represent the contact areas between carbonate and non-carbonate rocks.",

Six transects, eachcontaining four to five pools, have been surveyed. Three morphological zones have been identified along the selected profiles. Morphological features of the shore grykes along the western Istrian coast are, in fact, closely related to the local tide. High-level pools are affected by karstic processes, and the surface is usually smooth. At their bottom, terrigenous deposits, mainly terra rossa, occur. Seaward, bioerosion prevails and at the bottom of the grykes, sand and rounded pebbles have been found. Chemical/physical parameters suggest that grykes located at lower altitudes are affected by seawater factors, while pools located at increasing altitudes are affected mainly by rainfall and consequentially freshwater or saltwater remaining from rainfalls or storm events. Shore gryke genesis is strongly controlled by geological weakness, along whichthey develop. Their origin is in fact due to local tectonics, while their development is related to the active vertical tectonic subsidence of the study area. Pools located at higher altitudes are mainly affected by solution karst processes, but due to the tectonic downdrop of the area, when the grykes come in contact withsea, they are gradually shaped by marine processes.",

    "abstract": "The Pania di Corfino and Ripa di Soraggio are two minor karst areas in Tuscany, having a surface of only 11 km2, but contain more than 100 known caves. Some caves are old epi-phreatic passages testifying to a discontinuous lowering of base level in the two major valleys that cross the carbonate outcrops: the Serchio di Soraggio and the Fiume rivers, respectively located along the NWand SE borders of the massif. The spatial-altimetric distribution of major caves, whichare found on a vertical range of a few hundreds of meters, and their relationships withthe position of surface alluvial deposits have allowed to infer a first evolutionary framework of karst during the late Quaternary. If we refer to a simple model, where fluvial deposition occurs mainly during cold stages and incision during warm stages, the discrete distribution of cave passages suggests that the different epi-phreatic phases are the responses to the alternation of cold and warm periods. In any case, the re-organization of the river network induced by the tectonic uplift had a relevant effect on cave systems. First, the underground diversion of surface drainage enhanced the downcutting of NWand SE peripheral streams, whichreceived a larger quantity of water throughkarst springs due to the favored morpho-structural setting. Successively, the backward piracy of the allogenic catchments of the karst systems by surface tributaries led to the dewatering of caves and to the present situation.",

    "abstract": "The great cavern of Santo Tomás (La Gran Caverna de Santo Tomás) in Sierra de Qquemado (Los Órganos) in the province Pinar del Río in Cuba has a special place in Cuban speleology. For a very long period this was the longest cave system in the country. It extends in approximately 46 km of dry and flooded subterranean passages at seven levels, and represents a real paradise for karstologists and speleologists - not all cave branches are completely surveyed yet. The cave is partly tourist, but most of the interesting karst features are located in the wild part of the system. Besides the dimensions of the system and some huge cave formations, there are also recorded fossils from the Pleistocene period. The founder of Cuban speleology Antonio Núñez Jiménez in 1990 reported that when the River Santo Tomás drained during extreme dry periods, local people used captured water from the cave for their domestic use. Farmers used another interesting resource for their needs from this cave – nutrient-rich bat guano to fertilize tobacco fields in the foothills of the surrounding mogotes and in the bottom of dolinas. The cave was early in history populated by the early settlers of Cuba, but in recent years it became famous from the Cuban revolutionary period in the 1950s and 1960s. In the nearby village El Moncada in 1984 they founded a speleological school (Escuela National de Espeleología) which gave a boost to many generations of Cuban speleologists. The cave system generally receives high organic input,although there are some places in with evident lower input. Snakes, scorpions, frogs and crabs are frequent guests in the entrance part of the cave. There are some studies dealing with cave fauna from the great cavern of Santo Tomás in more detail, e.g. on crustaceans, but due to the cave size it is expected to add more species on the biodiversity list, and probably it is possible to discover new species in the cave. During the caving expedition we wanted to point out the potential of this and other caves in the area for microbiology and geomicrobiology research. Microbiology studies are not just important to assess the health status of underground habitat, but also to address more general questions related to nutrient cycling and energy fluxes in subtropical zones as, for example, cave air temperature is about 23°C. During the caving expedition (December 17-29, 2011) in the great cavern of Santo Tomás we demonstrated to Cuban speleologists a novel approach which is used in Slovenia for regular monitoring of human impact in the underground for dripping water, active underground rivers and quality of cave air, and examples of meiofauna sampling from cave pools. Participants for this international expedition in the great cavern of Santo Tomás came from Cuba, Italy and Slovenia. Expedition headquarters were located near the cave entrance in the village El Moncada at the speleological centre “Escuela National de Espeleológia Antonio Núñez Jiménez”. From Slovenia, Andreea Oarga and Janez Mulec joined the expedition. Field work in Cuba was coordinated by Galliano Bressan and Héctor Pérez Jiménez. Some activities during the expedition were accomplished in the frame of the project “Promotion of Slovenian Science” MU-PROM/2011-2-003 supported by the Slovenian Research Agency.",

    "abstract": "Walls of submerged caves feeding Florida springs are often lined with a heavy mat of filamentous bacteria, many of which are able to oxidize reduced sulfur in groundwater migrating from the porous bedrock into the cave conduit. To determine changes in water chemistry as water passes through the microbial mat, a simple device made from standard well screen and sealed with a rubber stopper and controllable vents was installed in a hole drilled in the wall of the cave passage. The sampler was sealed in place with marine epoxy. We measured anions in water from the sampler and from the water-filled conduit taken just outside the sampler. Most anions measured viz., Cl−, NO3−, and PO43−, increased slightly between the matrix and conduit waters. However, traces of sulfide were measured in the water from the rock matrix, but not in the conduit. SO42− concentrations in the conduit were about twice that measured in the water from the sampler, about 22 and 11 mg SO42− L−1, respectively, providing further evidence that sulfur oxidation is an important process in the bacterial mats attached to the limestone surfaces in these caves. An additional use of the sampling device is to measure discharge from the local bedrock into the cave conduit.Keywords: sulfur oxidation, bacteria, acid dissolution, groundwater chemistry.DOI:10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.664",

    "abstract": "Gökpınar karst springs are located 8 km to the south of the Gürün district centre, Sivas, Turkey. The springs have two main outlets (Gökpınar-1 and Gökpınar-2) and outflow from Jurassic-Cretaceous Yüceyurt formation (limestone). The total discharge of the springs ranges between 4.5 and 7.8 m3/s.The study area is formed of allocthonous and autocthonous lithological units whose ages range from Upper Devonian to Quaternary. These lithologies are mostly formed of limestones. Yüceyurt formation (limestone), from which Gökpınar karst springs outflow, constitute the main aquifer in the study area and is karstified. The unit has a well developed karst system comprising karren, dolines, ponors, underground channels and caves. The recession (discharge) analysis of the Gökpınar springs was carried out and the storage capacitiesand discharge (recession) coefficients of the Gökpınar-1 and Gökpınar-2 springs were calculated as 141×10^6 m3 and 98×10^6 m3, and 2.71×10^-3 day-1 and 2.98×10^-3 day-1, respectively. The storage capacities and discharge (recession) coefficients obtained suggest that the karst aquifer (Yüceyurt limestone) has large storage capacity, and drainage occurs very slow. The major cations in the study area waters are Ca2+ and Mg2+, and anion is HCO3-. The waters are calcium bicarbonate type. Some of the water chemistry parameters of the Gökpınar springs range as follows: T=10.8–11.1°C, pH=7.65–7.95,EC=270–310 μS/cm, TDS=170–200 mg/L, Ca2+=40.0–54.0 mg/L,Mg2+=4.5–10.0 mg/L, HCO3-=144.0–158.0 mg/L. Temperature, EC, TDS, and Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations of the Gökpınar springs did not show significant variations during the study period.",

The Shuilian cave, more than a kilometre long, formed along the contact of fine bedded metamorphosed calcitized sandy siltstones and calcitized siltstones. The cave has two entrances, the upper one being dry and the lower entrance with a steady water flow. It is situated in the steep slope about 70 m above the river level (1,965 m a.s.l.). In the paper a detailed analysis of rocks that host the cave is presented, and also a comprehensive description of the rock morphology and shapes of the cave conduits. Physico-chemical properties of water from cave and from a nearby spring were measured. The temperature and specific electric conductivity determinations indicate a relatively long underground residence time of water which, however, relatively poorly dissolve slowly dissoluble base rock. This could be the explanation for stagnation of the karst deepening with respect to erosional downcutting of the river Chang. In addition, further research is proposed.",

Karst aquifers within it are very important sources of water supply in the two countries. We therefore decided to compare the characteristics of karst water resources and the approaches to the exploitation and protection of karst aquifers with the aim of searching for the most convenient methods for their research and management. Different characteristics of the two compared areas were established, as well as differences and similarities in the application of various research methods and the management approaches. The findings were summarized in the table which includes the most important parameters of karst water systems and research methods used for their study in the area of Dinaric karst in Serbia and Slovenia. As an example of good practice, two case studies are described in the article. For the Slovene part, vast experiences in the application of tracer tests with artificial tracers are reviewed and the guidelines for its efficient use in the research of karst aquifers are summarized. For the Serbian part, described case study of the detection of the pollution source in the recharge area of an important water source and the preparation of remedial measures are presented as an efficient approach to solve such problems on karst areas.",

    "abstract": "Palaeokarst deposits are most commonly found in excavations, drill holes and naturally exposed at the Earth’s surface. Some caves however intersect palaeokarst deposits. This occurs in large hypogene caves in the USA, thermal caves in Hungary and in many caves in eastern Australia. Palaeokarst deposits in caves respond to cave forming processes in the same way as hostrock: the palaeokarst deposits form cave walls. A range of palaeokarst deposits is exposed in caves including; filled tubes, walls composed of flowstone, large-scale bodies, breccia pipes, dykes, volcaniclastic palaeokarst and crystalline palaeokarst. As well as being exposed in cave walls, palaeokarst deposits can wholly or partly form speleogens (speleogens made from palaeokarst). Records of geological events not preserved elsewhere can occur in palaeokarst deposits in caves. These can be difficult to correlate with conventional geological histories. It is important to be able to distinguish between palaeokarst deposits, relict sediments and phantom rock (in-situ weathered rock, also called ghost rock; Vergari &amp; Quinif 1997). Relict sediments can be distinguished from palaeokarst deposits because the cave walls bound relict sediments while palaeokarst deposits form the cave walls. Palaeokarst can be distinguished from phantom rock, as palaeokarst is unconformable with the hostrock, with structures in the hostrock not continuing across the boundary into the palaeokarst. Hostrock structures and textures do continue across the boundary between unaltered hostrock and phantom rock. Similarly, cave sediments are unconformable or disconformable with the hostrock while phantom rock is conformable with hostrock containing hostrock structures and textures. It has been difficult to explain why palaeokarst occurs in some caves and not others. One explanation worth considering is that palaeokarst deposits are not intersected by caves or sections of caves that contain large perennial streams and/or have undergone large-scale vadose fluvial development capable of escaping from the bounds of structural guidance, such as the caves in the Classical Karst.Key words: palaeokarst, caves, Australia, relict sediments, phantom rock.",

This unusual natural landform and similar others occurring in the same area gave birth to myths and legends. A detailed geomorphological analysis of Masso della Vecchia area has been carried out. The site is placed at about 100 m of altitude on a lower Pleistocene abrasion surface which constitutes the top of the Serra di Poggiardo morphostructural ridge. Locally, the Miocene Pietra Leccese Formation crops out. It is constituted by poorly consolidated, bioturbated, yellowish biomicrites at lower levels rapidly grading upward in massive grainstones rich in glauconite minerals. The entire sequence gently dips northeastward. The geomorphological analysis revealed that the Masso della Vecchia and similar landforms occurring in the area are karstic features produced under a soil cover. Pinnacles, channels, notches, subsoil scallops, half-bells and other typical features have been recognized. The peculiar assemblage of subsoil karst features can be explained taking into account the geological structure, subsoil karst processes and the geomorphological evolution of this area during the Late Pleistocene.Key words: subsoil karren, geoheritage, Salento, Italy.",

    "abstract": "The studied paleokarst corresponds to an uplifted peripheral foreland bulge when Upper Cretaceous diagenetically immature eogenetic carbonates were subaerially exposed, karstified and subsequently overlain by upper Paleocene/lower Eocene palustrine limestone.Among the subsurface paleokarstic features, both vadose and phreatic forms occur. The phreatic caves/cavities include features characteristic of the mixing zone speleogenesis at the interface between freshwater (brackish water) lenses and the underlying seawater. They were found in various positions with respect to the paleokarstic surface, the deepest being about 75 m below the surface. Three indistinct horizons of cavities/caves and intermediate vugs were recognized. Subsequently, all cavities were completely filled with detrital sediments and speleothems in the phreatic and vadose zones. In general, the phreatic cavities of the lower two horizons are geopetally filled with mudstone derived from incomplete dissolution of the host rock and overlain by coarse-grained, blocky calcite. Shallower below the paleokarst surface, a large phreatic cave of the third horizon is filled with flowstone overlain by reddish micritic carbonate sediment with intercalated calcite rafts. In the upper part of the cave, sediments derived from the paleokarst surface are gradually becoming more abundant. Vadose channels, which may also intersect the cave sediments, are mainly filled with \"pedogenic\" material derived from the paleokarst surface. Immediately prior to marine transgression over the paleokarst surface, some cavities were filled with marine-derived microturbidites. In general, the diversity of cave fills and the amount of surface material decrease with distance from the paleokarst surface. Below the paleokarst surface, the δ13C and δ18O values of a host rock and cavity deposits show good correlation with trends significant for meteoric diagenesis. It is shown that deposits associated with phreatic caves can be of great importance for the study of the speleogenetic, geomorphological and hydrogeological evolution of certain paleokarst regions.",

    "abstract": "Radon (Rn) constitutes a good geochemical tracer for neotectonic activity in faults since associated fracturing near the surface favours fluid escape to the atmosphere. In this contribution, we measured the Rn concentration in the air inside karst caves to constraints the recent fault activity in the Cantabrian Mountains (N Spain). Rock formations exhumed during the uplifting of the Cantabrian Mountains record a long history of fracturing, which has the potential to connect deeper sources of Rn with the surface. In this regional study, we correlate Rn measurements with cave survey data and geological structures using a Geographic Information Systems. Thirty-four Rn average concentration was recorded by CR-39 detectors during 8 integrated months. The method is applied to the central part of the Cantabrian Mountains that is built on sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic rocks relatively poor in U. Dominant tectonic structures and Rn concentration are examined in 28 cavities. The concentration of Rn values is higher than 0.5 kBq·m-3 in caves developed preferably following fractures with the direction N30oW, being the concentration greater than 0.8 kBq·m-3 in cavities located less than 200±50 m from subvertical faults with such orientation. Rn anomalies point to relative high connectivity along subvertical fault zones NW-trending, preserving fracture connectivity in the most recent structures in the Cantabrian Mountains. Finally, in the study area there is a low but significant radioactive hazard which is associated to fault zones in a fractured rock massif. It contrasts with other active tectonic settings where the radioactive hazard may come from fault movements.",

They are studied on the basis of their meso- and micro-scale morphology as well as their horizontal pattern, in order to investigate the character of the forming aquifer. Emphasis is given on the morphological description of the Loutra Almopias Cave. Cave morphology is dominated by the presence of cupolas, rock bridges, ridges and “windows”, abrupt terminations of fracture guided passages, pendants, rising channels, pseudonotches, false-floors and spongework. Speleogens indicate a speleogenesis due to slowly natural convecting hot water bodies. Phreatic calcite from the Varathron Cave is analyzed on the basis of the fluid inclusions in order to investigate the physicochemical conditions of the convecting water bodies. This has shown that the calcite was formed at temperatures ranging between 120 and 189 ºC, with a peak around 150 ºC. The fluids were dominated by NaCl of very low salinities (0.2-1.0 wt% NaCl equiv.), showing probably the incorporation of meteoric waters.",

Ker je študijsko območje Finkenberg na turističnem območju, je bilo treba opraviti vrtanje v samo nekaj tednih. Več izvirov od mesta vrtanja so viri oskrbe s pitno vodo. Glede na to, da stopnja in porazdelitev zakraselosti Hochstegenove formacije nista bili znani, je bilo treba za pridobitev dovoljenja za vrtanje nujno opazovati izvire. Da bi dokumentirali vpliv vrtanja na izvirsko vodo, je bilo pri spremljanju izvirov treba upoštevati več fizikalnih in kemijskih parametrov.

    "abstract": "Sthreepura Cave at Kiriwanagama consists of an upper level of cavities in quartzite formed by arenization and a lower level developed in a saprolite formed from the weathering of gneiss sandwiched between two layers of quartzite. The lower level cave is not like most arenization and phantom rock caves as the walls are composed of saprolite, not exhumed unweathered rock. The cave is not a soil pipe as it is not in soil, lacks the characteristic features of soil pipes and has formed directly below, not above an aquiclude. Sthreepura Cave at Kiriwanagama is a network cave in saprolite. Speleogenesis in the lower level began with the development of joint-guided tubes in the saprolite directly below the upper layer of quartzite, probably under phreatic conditions. Later erosion under vadose conditions removed the saprolite to produce a network of passages with a rectangular profile. Widening of the passages ultimately caused ceiling failure producing breakdown chambers, but fallen slabs of quartzite armoured the walls of the Main Passage of the cave protecting them from undercutting.Key words: Sri Lanka, gneiss, network cave, saprolite, arenization.Jama Sthreepura pri Kiriwanagami, južni del osrednje Šri Lanke: Mreža rovov v saprolitu in proterozojskem kvarcituJamo St hreepura pri Kiriwanagami sestavljata gornji nivo arenizacijskih votlin v kvarcitu ter spodnji nivo v saprolitu, ki je nastal s preperevanjem gnajsa med plastmi kvarcita.

The authors are relatively well acquainted with the Western part of Dinaric karst and corresponding \"western\" literature and from this point of view they tried to find out where and when appeared the name Dinara for the mountain as well as for the whole Dinaric chain as we call it nowadays. Based on older literature and maps they found out that the name Dinara appeared in the 16th century in a novel, not in a professional work, while in the 17th (Evliya Çelebi) and during the 18th centuries it became largely used by authors describing Balkans (Fortis 1774, Hacquet 1785). During the 19th century it was a generally adopted name, often as Dinaric Alps. Authors make an appeal to researchers whose topic is Dinaric karst to pay attention to this question; especially to older publications which are not generally known and accessible.Key words: Dinara, Dinaric Mountains, origin of name.Vprašanje izvora imena DinaraPričujoči kratki prispevek na podlagi pregledane literature predstavlja nerešeno vprašanje izvora imena Dinara, kar je lahko tudi izziv za prihodnje raziskovalce.

    "abstract": "The Carlúcio Cave is located on the left bank of the Peruaçu River canyon, in a National Park located in the semiarid zone of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. Although the Carlúcio Cave is in an unfavorable relief position in terms of material importation into its interior, it harbors an important fossil deposit. This paper sought to investigate such fossil assemblage and describe material importation and deposition events. For that purpose, a survey of the existing fossils was conducted, including a description of the deposition sites and taphonomic signatures. A topographic survey was carried out of representative samples and the deposit chronology was established by means of carbon-14 and uranium-series dating. The fossil assemblage comprises mainly terrestrial epigeal mollusk shells, totaling 1,399 individuals, 70% of which are Drymaeus sp. (Bulimuloidea, Bulimulidae). In addition, 20 bones, 57 vegetal deposition sites, four charcoals, one palm fruit and one corncob were recorded. The cave location and morphology and the deposit’s taphonomic signature indicate that the material was carried upward by the rise in water level (WL) of the Peruaçu River due to episodic barriers to the natural river flow, followed by floating and retention of the material once the WL went gradually down. At least four flood events that reached the Carlúcio Cave were identified in the Peruaçu River canyon during the Holocene. This study provides evidence of a mechanism of material transport and accumulation in the cave caused by the rising water flow in connection with flood events in the river canyon.Key words: Cave deposits, Holocene chronology, fluvial geomorphology, Peruaçu River canyon.Naraščanje nivoja vode kot faktor vnosa organskega materiala v jameJama Carlúcio je na levem bregu kanjona reke Peruaçu v nacionalnem parku na polpuščavskem območju province Minas Gerais v jugovzhodni Braziliji. Čeprav je jama v neugodnem reliefnem položaju glede vnosa materiala, v njej ležijo pomembne fosilne najdbe. Ta članek je poskušal raziskati fosile in opisati dogodke vnosa in odlaganja materiala. Zato smo pregledali obstoječe fosile ter med drugim opisali odlagališča in tafonomske podpise. Izvedli smo topografsko raziskavo reprezentativnih vzorcev ter z določanjem starosti z ogljikom C14 in uranovo serijo vzpostavili depozitno kronologijo. Fosilni ostanki obsegajo predvsem kopenske epigealne mehkužce s 1399 posamezniki, od tega 70 % Drymaeus sp. (Bulimuloidea, Bulimulidae). Poleg tega smo opazili 20 kosti, 57 rastlinskih tališč, štiri oglja, eno palmovo sadje in eno koruzo. Lokacija jame, njena morfologija in tafonomske raziskave sedimentov nakazujejo, da je material odneslo navzgor s porastom nivoja vode reke Peruaçu zaradi epizodnih ovir pri naravnem toku reke. Temu sledi lebdenje in zadrževanje snovi, ko je nivo postopoma upadel. V holocenu smo v kanjonu reke Peruaçu identificirali vsaj štiri poplavne dogodke, ki so segli v jamo Carlúcio.

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, Brazil has advanced in the creation of Natural Protected Areas (NPAs), reaching more than 17% of its territory. However, the budget allocated for the effectiveness of NPAs is still insufficient, creating gaps that hinder these areas from fulfilling their purposes. The Cavernas do Peruaçu National Park (PNCP) was created in 1999. Its ecotourism infrastructure was conceived and built from 2011 to 2015 and opened to the public in 2017. The implementation of the PNCP differs from other NPAs under the responsibility of the federal government management in Brazil, since it involves private resources from companies with legal obligations to environmental compensation. In this context, a study on the PNCP was carried out, with primary and secondary data analysed. The research aimed at report the process of the PNCP implementation as well as presenting the current state of management and prospects for this Park. With the results obtained, it was possible to conclude that the experience of a partnership between the public power and the private initiative is a practical possibility for the implementation and management of ecotourism, expanding its socioeconomic sustainability and contributing to the goals of nature conservation.Key words: national parks, ecotourism, natural heritage, archaeological sites.Prispevek zasebnikov pri vzpostavitvi in upravljanju ekoturizma v jamah narodnega parka Cavernas do Šeruaçu, BrazilijaBrazilija je v zadnjih dveh desetletjih razvijala program zaščitenih naravnih območij, ki danes zavzemajo 17 % površine države. Vendar namenska proračunska sredstva namenjena zaščitenim območjem, ne zadoščajo za učinkovito upravljanje in izvajanje zaščite. Narodni park Cavernas do Peruaçu (NPCP) je bil ustanovljen leta 1995. Infrastruktura, zasnovana na ekološkem pristopu, je bila zgrajena med leti 2011 in 2015 in leta 2017 odprta za javnost. NPCP je izjema med zaščitenimi območji v upravljanju brazilske vlade, saj prejema tudi sredstva zasebnih podjetij, ki so zakonsko obvezana dajatev okoljskega nadomestila. V raziskavi poročamo o razvoju, upravljanju in perspektivah parka. Pokažemo, da je javno zasebno partnerstvo mogoče in da lahko bistveno izboljša možnosti učinkovitega upravljanja, utrjuje socialno-ekonomsko vzdržnost območja in prispeva k boljšemu varovanju narave.Ključne besede: narodni parki, ekoturizem, naravna dediščina, arheološka najdišča.",

Different types of pseudokarstic cavity formation can be observed in the area, especially in the sloping periphery of the mud volcanic area, where badlands developed (badland pseudokarst), and rheogene pseudokarst in the mud flows. The liquid mud material gets denser and wimple on the surface of the mud that flows in the trough, it compiles and then covers the liquid mud channel. These micro-size covered tunnels are similarly formed as lava tubes at the lava flows of real volcanic areas. In order to complement the field measurements, we carried out surveys with a DJI Phantom 3 and 4, and Mavic Pro quadcopter to determine the landforms for the photogrammetry. Granular composition tests were carried out on sediment samples collected in the mud volcanic area by a laser diffraction particle analyser.",

The local population was not opposed to afforestation per se, but to the prohibition of usufruct on afforested land, which had major economic consequences for the local population. Authorities did not always take into consideration the annual agricultural processes, local customs, and natural resource needs in their afforestation decisions. The prohibition of usufruct was followed by a shortage of fodder and firewood, which led to forest violations to satisfy demands. Thus, afforestation has undermined the basis of agriculture. In addition, already afforested land remained under common ownership for a relatively long time.",

    "abstract": "To reconstruct the ancient glaciations of a mountainous area, it is necessary to consider together, in their topographic contexts, the forms of erosion and those of accumulation, aiming to model the relative glacial systems, which can be understood on the basis of the interrelationships between the various forms. In the karst areas, the forms of glacial erosion are often easily recognizable, given that the geomorphological dynamic favours their conservation. The very ancient deposition forms, on the other hand, are hardly detectable or absent given that chemical erosion contributes to the decrease in volume of the moraines until their total disappearance. As an exemplary case, the relict forms of the ancient local glacial system of Valon del Malera, developed in jurassic limestone and Main Dolomite (Dolomia Principale), partly preserved in the Lessini Mountains (Prealpi Venete, NE Italy) and partly in the nearby Carega massif (Piccole Dolomiti), are illustrated. The forms of erosion document the dismantling of a segment of a glacial valley due to accelerated erosion phenomena attributable to active tectonics along an important fault system. Other segments of the trough-shaped glacial valley are very well preserved. On the other hand, forms resulting from the “over-imprinting” of some ancient morainic ridges are detectable, due to the fact that in favourable cases the morainic cover has reduced the rate of lowering at the cover-rock interface of the underlying limestone, in comparison with the surrounding rocky surfaces not covered by till deposits, causing the formation of rocky ridges. However, the temporary aquifer hanging within the moraine has favoured the development of grike type covered Karren in the limestone, with isolated spikes or pillars of rock. Ridges mainly or totally formed by rock in place are described, which, according to all evidence, seem to be the result of the “over-imprinting” by ancient moraine ridges partly or totally eroded.",

In the spatial extent of 380 km2, it hosts typical karst landforms, primarily dolines, blind valleys, dry valleys and caves. Dolines are present on 75% of the total area, and the exact number of them within the area outline is 5319. The aim of the study is to determine the guidance factors for the spatial distribution of dolines, primarily morphological, while lithological, tectonic and climatic factors are presented at the basic level. Morphological factors in this study are analysed through morphometrical characteristics and calculations, which include the elevation, the mean topographical slope and the landform classification based on geomorphons. Digital elevation models with resolutions 90 m and 30 m are used. Data sources for doline positions were the topographical maps of 1:25,000 scale.Spatial distribution of dolines in the study area is rather uneven. Three zones (clusters) of higher concentration may be distinguished, where 34% of the total study area hosts 72% of dolines. These three zones are the karsts of the villages Lelić, Bačevci and Robaje, divided by deep canyon valleys. Maximum density of dolines, judging by the Kernel density method, is 33 dolines per km2 in the zone of the Stapar village, at the northwestern outskirt of the study area. The main factors influencing the spatial distribution of dolines are the topographical slope and the phases of morphological/hydrographical evolution of the area.",

Peloponnese, Elassona, Lavrion and Kammena Vourla in Greece are examined and discussed in this work. Carbonate and sulfate samples collected from caves in Aghia Paraskevi and western Peloponnese areas were investigated using methods, such as fluid inclusion, scanning electron microscopy, carbon, sulfur and oxygen stable isotopes, X-ray powder diffraction, and chemical analysis. The examined caves are mainly developed at or in the proximity of the local water table and they are related to hydrothermal springs and geothermal fields. In addition to the documentation of SAS in one case study from Aghia Paraskevi, calcite spar with a homogenization temperature peak at 280°C, indicates an early speleogenetic stage that involves meteoric-origin hydrothermal fluids under deep-seated settings. Sulfur isotope composition of sulfates (–4 ‰) is indicative for pyrite oxidation. The Konitsa caves represent a system developed at multiple altitudes that is related to the evolution of Sarantaporos River. The caves in West Peloponnese are located in two different geotectonic units. However, the caves in both units are active and share common characteristics, such as their development near sea level, morphology and fracture-guided pattern, and the presence of gypsum with δ34S values (average –26 ‰) that are plausibly related to hydrocarbons and bacterial activity. Morphological and geochemical aspects of the caves in these two regions suggest long-lasting, multiphase speleogenetic systems.",

We have also newly explained the formation of parallel channels on the inclined surfaces of denuded rock (Gréolières); the gradual reshaping of the rock surface from a subsoil one to one directly exposed to rain and water creeping along the gently sloping rock (Caussols). Furthermore, the unique shaping of carbonate sandstones, specifically such with large channels (Tourrettes-sur-Loup) is presented for the first time.

In addition, geochemical analyses were conducted in order to determine whether the associated flowstone/stalagmite is suitable for elucidating the timing of bone thanatocoenosis and further palaeoenvironmental analyses. The organic matter (collagen) is poorly preserved. However, we succeeded in amplifying a 94 bp long fragment of the cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for one sample, and in sequencing the amto that of the Cyt b of the cave bear (Ursus deningeri or Ursus spelaeus sensu lato).

Through these interpretations, different conceptual hydrological models about the dynamics and directions of the flow in the aquifer have been proposed and tested.

In this regard, the present study brings a number of new insights through description of the karst development on marbles at the foothills of the Altai Mountains. We studied karst phenomena in the field and in the laboratory where structural-textural properties, mineral composition and quantity of carbonate components were determined. Rivers dissected karst surface and additionally uncovered carbonate rocks. The marble layers are faulted, folded and sheared, consequently containing numerous densely spaced net of discontinuities, which are often parallel. Brittle deformations significantly increased the rocks’ porosity, consequently making it more sensitive to water absorption and freezing thaw effect. Distinct continental climate, with extreme daily and seasonal temperature variations, conditions the pronounced peeling off of the marbles along discontinuities. The diversity of disintegration is conditioned by the massive or oriented structure, cleavage, texture, and type and grain size of the marbles’ mineral constituents. Interaction and alternation of chemical dissolution and mechanical disintegration play the major role on the karren formation and its preservation. The formed karren is mostly destroyed due to peeling off and disintegration of the marbles.",

The horizontal passages usually have large and wide spaces, whereas the inclined ones are relatively small and narrow. The cave minerals in the Ryongmun Cavern are mainly calcite and aragonite. In the cave, stalactites, stalagmites, limestone columns, cave pearls, etc. Are calcite; and, anthodites are aragonite. In the cave, speleothems display a wonderful underground landscape in harmony with the cave bedrock and groundwater (streams, waterfalls and ponds). The main scenes of the underground karst landscape in the cave are stalactites, stalagmites, limestone columns, stone waterfalls anthodites, underground waterfalls, and underground ponds.The deposits that have been formed recently on the surface of speleothems and walls in the cave are mainly moonmilk composed of hydromagnesite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2•4H2O) with an average particle size of 0.55 μm and chemical composition of MgO–29.43% and CaO–6.28%. The moonmilk is present in a white, fine powder form, a hand-rubbed smooth, and a moisture content of 42.0%. Also, the pH is 10.09, which is alkaline. In the Ryongmun Cavern, moonmilk was formed at sites with very low supply of karst water and relatively high wind speeds. The unique underground karst features provide sufficient evidence for geoheritage value of the cave and the characteristics of moonmilk provide a significant implication for management and preservation of the cave environment.",

In these extreme environments, diatoms are restricted to illuminated zones, and are found at the entrance zone and in the lampenflora community. However, the number of identified species is constantly increasing, and new species are being discovered. The genus Luticola is one of the most widely studied genera worldwide and many representatives are characterized as aerophilous and are found in terrestrial habitats. For the first time, Luticola species identified from phototrophic subaerial biofilms of 10 caves in Serbia (cave entrances and lampenflora) based on detailed light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were summarized and discussed. In total 11 representatives of the genus were identified at the species level, and morphological features of Luticola acidoclinata, L. angusta, L. frequentissima, L. dismutica, L. nivalis, L. triundulata, and L. quinquenodis were characterized in detail. For Luticola angusta, electron microscopy images are shown for the first time. Additionally, four new taxa (L. angusta, L. frequentissima, L. kopanjae, and L. poulickovae) were recorded for the diatom flora of Serbia. The study fills an important gap regarding the occurrence and characteristics of Luticola representatives in subaerial habitats.",

A total of 28 samples were collected to analyze clast composition, slag content, grain size, and roundness. The sediment primarily consists of allochthonous Lower Carboniferous material (greywackes, clayey shales) with varying amounts of metallurgical slag, occasionally mixed with autochthonous deposits such as rockfall accumulations and tailings from the excavation of connecting adits. The slag content fluctuates, peaking downstream of the erosive section of the Rudické propadání cave, near the Stará řeka passage connection. Grain size distribution is influenced by both surface and cave morphology, as well as hydraulic conditions. The alternation between erosive and depositional zones, along with the unique karstic and speleorelief features, plays a crucial role in clast mobilization. These features include ponors, erosive and paragenetic corridors, sumps, and rockfalls. Fine particle accumulations are particularly noticeable in front of sumps or dams. Throughout the studied section, the proportion of coarse particles (&gt;10 mm and 5–10 mm) gradually decreases, while finer particle content increases toward the resurgence. The roundness of Carboniferous sediments remains relatively constant, although it is significantly influenced by the presence of well-rounded, weak and ductile slag clasts. Overall, both the slag content and the proportion of well-rounded and rounded clasts in the coarser fractions (&gt;10 mm and 5–10 mm) show a decreasing trend toward the resurgence.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic (As) pollutants are serious threat to water ecological security and human health, especially in karst areas because of their unique hydrogeological characteristics. Physical-chemical analyses of karst water and its sediments at the Lihu subterranean stream, southwest China, were conducted by ICP-MS and XRF to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of arsenic in karst subterranean streams. The results show that inorganic arsenic comprise most of the total arsenic, while organic arsenic including monomethylated arsenic (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic (DMA) are not detected or infinitesimal. The reducing environment in the subterranean stream makes As(III) dominant and accounts for 53% of the inorganic species. Adsorptive behaviour of arsenic occurred and the removal rates of As, As(III) and As(V) in the Lihu subterranean stream are 51%, 36% and 59% respectively after a 25.6 km underground distance. To find out the main influencing factors on arsenic adsorptive process in this underground river, principal component analysis in SPSS and Minitab were applied. Seven main factors, i.e. sediment Fe (Fesed), sediment Al (Alsed), sediment Ca (Cased), particulate organic matter (POM), sediment Mn (Mnsed), water Ca2+ (Ca2+) and water HCO3– (HCO3–) are extracted from thirteen indicators. The rank of those factors for total arsenic and As(III) is Ca_sed &gt; Fe_sed &gt; Ca2+ &gt; POM &gt; Mn_sed &gt; Alsed &gt; HCO3 –, while it is Fesed &gt; Cased &gt; Ca2+ &gt; Mnsed &gt; POM &gt; Alsed &gt; HCO3 – for As(V). Of these seven factors, Fesed, Alsed, Cased, POM, Mnsed and Ca2+ are promoting factors for arsenic adsorption while HCO3– is an inhibiting factor. Calcium and bicarbonate turn out to be the main influencing factors for water arsenic adsorption in the study area, largely because the high calcium and alkaline values in karst water. This finding is an obvious distinction compared with the research findings at a non-karst area.",

High resolution vertical images obtained during recreational use of a small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) seemed to have the potential to answer this need.

For the diameter lesser than 7 cm and the individual karst soils formed at grass meadow and deciduous forest, the values of a and b parameters ranged from -0.135 to -0.160 cm-1 and from 88 to 422 ppmv cm-1, respectively. For the heavy clay soils of coniferous forest, however, no dependence between cCO2 and D was found. To understand the dependence better, a conceptual model was proposed in terms of concentration gradients and fluxes.

    "abstract": "Dye tracing experiments are an active, effective and promising approach to investigate karst aquifers. In this paper, we develop a simple diagnostic model for calculating total recharge of sinks using dye tracing results. The conceptual model is that all sinks are convergent to a major conduit which then branches into several conduits and finally to several springs. Under the assumption that advection is dominant over dispersion at springs, breakthrough curve at a single spring can be used to calculate total recharge. The model is advantageous in that for such a conduit network, it is not necessary to measure breakthrough curves at all springs. Then the model with two dye tracing experiments is used to infer the conduit network in a karst aquifer in Luxi, southwest China. This paper represents a preliminary effort aiming to using dye tracing results to calculate the total recharge of sinks and infer the network of conduits.Preprost model izračuna celokupnega napajanja kraškega sistema na osnovi sledilne krivuljeSledenje podzemnih voda z umetnimi barvili je učinkovita tehnika raziskav kraških vodonosnikov.

Dotok v vrtino je bil arteški, kar je povzročilo umetno recesijo v izviru Banjici. Tekom tega hidrodinamičnega poizkusa je bilo v zaledju izvira veliko padavin, ki so povzročile poplavni val.

Suva Planina in Eastern Serbia, a borehole of 100 m of depth was drilled in the vicinity of a lukewarm spring, Banjica. The borehole had an artesian discharge, which caused artificially generated recession in the adjoining spring Banjica. During this hydrodynamical test, great quantities of precipitation occured in the hinterland of the spring, having the effect of a floodwave. The presence of two types of karst is obvious in the field – confined karst and covered karst. The hydrogeological response to the floodwave during artificially generated recession proved the presence of deep-seated karst also. This can be detected by comparative analysis of the hydrograph of the Banjica spring and the graph of pressures in the borehole. In this way, not only the presence, but also the characteristics of the karst can be proved (e.g. dimensions and types of karst conduits, relative age of karst, size and extension of the aquifer, etc.).",

    "abstract": "The aim of terminology of speleological forms is to describe these forms, and a cave is an assembly of forms. In France, terms of common language were first used, such as entree (« entrance »), draperie (« drapery », « curtain »), etc. and a few terms of scientific origin such as stalagmite. Then speleologists realized that it was possible to describe forms by their geometry. Thus such terms as cone d’eboulis (« talus cone ») or « tube » were used. When the geometry is detailed, the description is more precise: the information is better when we know that there is a « ceiling channel » above the tube or that a stalagmite is presented as a « hollow stalagmite ». Often a « group » of identical forms can be identified in a limited zone, whereas there are no such forms in other parts of the cave. This is often the case with potholes or soda straws for instance. This type of observation improves the quality of description. There is also what can be presented as « associated forms »: Certain speleological forms are associated with one another: a sinkhole corresponds to a resurgence; a stalactite corresponds to a stalagmite. A group and the zone of the cave where it can be observed are also associated forms. Other speleological forms are associated with a geological form: a contact sinkhole between two rocks of different solubility, dip tube, stalactites aligned along a crack. Other forms are associated with a geographical form: a flowing cave opening at the level of a surface stream, deposit of rounded pebbles in a surface stream sinkhole. There are also genetic terms; the most used being « phreatic » and « vadose ». These terms are useful for the interpretation of forms, but they are quite dangerous for the description of forms: if a passage is presented as «vadose », one does not know what are the forms justifying the word for the author. And if a tube is almost always presented as «phreatic », most of them have never been permanently filled with water, and some of them have never been filled with water. Genetic terms are deceptive. They must be avoided when forms are described.",

Vsi izviri, razen Papija, so v jursko-krednih apnencih. Izvir Papi je na stiku jursko-krednih apnencev z lapornatimi apnenci eocenske starosti. Glavne žile, ki dovajajo vodo izvirom, so prelomi in tektonske linije. Ti izviri so razlog, da po ravnini tečejo reke. Prelome lahko razdelimo v narive in normalne prelome. Prelomi se najčešče javljajo na stiku apnencev z ravnino, v čemer je vzrok, da ima ta strukturo tektonskega jarka. Izviri igrajo veliko vlogo pri napajanju ravnine.

There are 5 karstic springs named as Amir, Chenare, Zaz, Honam and Papi. All the springs except the Papi emerge from the Jurassic-Cretaceous limestone.The Papi Spring discharges at the contact of the Jurassic-Cretaceous and the Marly limestone of Eocene age. The springs show variation of discharge during the different periods. Faults and the lineaments are the main avenues for the emergence of the springs. The springs are responsible for the rivers in the plain. The fractures are classified as thrust and normal faults. The faults are mostly formed at the junction of the surrounding carbonate rocks which give a graben structure to the plain. The springs have an important role in recharging the plain. It is due to the fractures and the springs that the plain aquifer has a high potential of water. The discharge of some of the wells is more than 60 l/s.The discharge of the springs varies considerably during the year. Out of these, the Amir , Chenare and Honam springs are considered as permanent springs. The annual discharge of the springs is 111 MCM.

The contemporary use of Grotte and Höhle in the Austro-Hungarian period is determined by linguistic conditions and influence of the Italian (bilingual or even trilingual situation) in the classical Karst region.",

Delovanje geo-ekosistema na krasu je v veliki meri odvisno od odnosov podnebje – prst – rastje, kar vpliva na hitrost razvoja krasa. Večina krasa na Madžarskem je vključenega v gospodarjenje z gozdovi. Sajenje neustreznih gozdnih sestojev ima lahko kot posledico spreminjanje klime in prsti, kar vodi k spremembam intenzivnosti korozije. Prispevek obravnava spremembe gospodarjenja z gozdom v narodnem parku Aggtelek, ki je na seznamu svetovne naravne dediščine, in predlaga ustreznejšo rabo tal.This study represents the changes of Hungarian karst terrains due to human impacts paying special attention to sylviculture. The functioning of the karst geo-ecosystem is considerably determined by the climate-soilvegetation system, which will influence the dynamism of karst development. Most of the Hungarian karst terrains are the scene of sylviculture. The planting of non-adequate forest associations resulted the alteration of climate and soils, which resulted in a change of the intensity of karst corrosion. This paper focuses on the change of sylviculture in the Aggtelek National Park, a World Heritage site, and makes suggestions for optimal land use.",

    "abstract": "Značilnosti epikraške cone so bile preučevane s pomočjo geofizičnih metod, posebej s pomočjo refrakcijske seizmike, kombinirane z električno upornostjo in gravimetrijskimi meritvami. Enake metode so bile uporabljane na obeh področjih, kar omogoča primerljive izsledke. Interpretirane seizmične meje sledijo bazno ploskev epikrasa in z geofizičnega stališča omejujejo epikraško cono, to je cono s primerljivimi nizkimi seizmičnimi hitrostmi (najbolj pogosto 1 000 do 3 000 m s-1). Na Češkem, na devonskem področju Konìprusy, je debelina epikraške cone 5 do 60 m. Epikras v gorovju Zagors pa dosega debelino 180 m (kredni apnenci). Razlike v značaju in debelini epikraške cone so v celoti odvisne od geološke zgradbe in geomorfoloških danosti (reliefa) ter od razvoja obeh področij, v čemer je vzrok različnih možnosti sproščanja nekdanjih pritiskov v apniških pogorjih.Characteristics of epikarst zone were studied by geophysical methods, especially refraction seismics, combined with electrical resistivity and gravimetry measurements. Applied methods were equal in both regions, so comparable results were obtained. The interpreted seismic boundaries follow the basal plane of epikarst (s.l.) and limit the epikarst zone from the geophysical point of view, i.e. zone with comparably low seismic velocities (mostly 1,000 to 3,000 m.s-1). The thickness of epikarst in the Czech Karst - the Konìprusy Devonian - is from 5 to about 60 m. The epikarst in Zagros Mts. reached up to 180 m (Cretaceous lmst.). The differences of character and vertical extent of epikarst zone depend on entirely different geological structure and geomorphological setting (relief) and evolution of both sites, which established different conditions for the release of residual stress in the limestone massifs.",

Območje južno in NW od Idrije izpolnjuje vse pogoje, da postane klasično ozemlje za preučevanje začetnega stadija zakrasevanja, zato smo namenili tej problematiki posebno pozornost. Pri nastajanju kraških objektov je igral pomembno vlogo zlasti sistem prečnoalpskih prelomov in razpok. S teorijo brezen smo med drugim obrazložili nastanek Divjega jezera in pokazali, da so bile vsaj nekatere vrtače zasnovane že v obdobju, ko so kredne apnence še prekrivale slabše vodoprepustne kamenine. Antiklinalne strukture so se izkazale kot najboljši indikator za prisotnost podzemnih kraških prostorov. Na koncu prispevka smo tabelarno predstavili še rezultate 60 kompletnih silikatnih analiz skoraj vseh kamenin na Idrijskem. Geological structure on the Pliocene paleosurface level in the nowadays 1000 m altitude were reconstructed. The lithological and tectonical circumstances in that time played a decisive role in hydrographic net origin and also on Kanomljica, Nikova, Idrijca and Belca rivers piracy. Landscape south and NW from Idrija fulfil all conditions to become classical region for initial karstification stadium examination, for that reason to this problems great attention have been paid. Particularly system of cross alpine faults and fissures played significant role on karst phenomena origin. With potholes theory the origin of Wild Lake have been explained and pointed out, that some dolinas at least have been projected already in period when Cretaceous limestones were covered by worse waterpermeable rocks. Anticline structures proved as the best indicator for karst rooms presence. On article end the results of 60 complete silicate analyses of nearly all Idrija's rocks in table shape are presented.",

Ti dve metodi temeljita na različnih principih: prva temelji na mikrotektonski analizi in se večinoma uporablja na površinskih golicah, medtem je bila druga razvita v namene pručevanja geotehničnih in hidravličnih lastnosti kamnine. Meritve so bile izvedene na površinskih golicah in v raziskovalnem rovu pod njimi, in sicer v dveh različnih sezonah (jesen 95 in poletje 96). Metoda Eraso se pogosto uporablja v regionalnem (mega) merilu za določanje najpogostejših smeri drenaže na krasu. Inženirska metoda pa se uporablja navadno v makro merilu, vendar so rezultati pokazali, da lahko sklepamo tudi na regionalne smeri drenaže.The main goal of the study was to compare the Eraso method and engineering method for determining water drainage. These two methods are based on different principles: the first one is based on microtectonic analysis and is mainly applied on surface outcrops, while the second one was developped with purpose of studying geotechnical and hydraulical properties of the rock. Measurements were carried out on surface outcrops and within underground artificial tunnel in two different seasons (autumn 95 and spring 96). The Eraso method is frequently used in karst area to determine direction of regional drainage (mega scale). The engineering method was developed for studies in macro scale, but from the results is evident, that direction of regional waterflow can be obtained.",

Sledilni poskus je pokazal pretakanje vode iz Lukovškega potoka do izvira Zijala s hitrostjo 0.45 cm/s in nato do izvira Prečne, ki se pomembno obogati z vodo iz kraškega vodonosnika Suhe krajine, s hitrostjo 4.1 cm/s.

Results of the preliminary study of influences of the planned highway sector Trebnje - Hrastje on karst waters are summarized. The study was based on field survey and review of previous researches. Underground water flow from the stream Lukovški potok to the Zijalo spring with average velocity 0.45 cm/s and further on to the Prečna spring with velocity 4.1 cm/s was proved. This second part of flow is significantly enlarged by recharge from the karst aquifer of Suha krajina. At high and highest waters rather faster flow can be expected and at the same time also fast spreading of eventual pollution. Velocity and mode of infiltration of rain directly into the karst underground was not defined yet. Based on the results of tracing test the underground connection between the Bršljinski potok and Lukovški potok can be estimated as questionable.",

Park Škocjanske jame, Slovenia, has been performing a regular and continuous monitoring of radon and its daughter products for about five years now. All measurements are done by the Institute for Occupational Safety, Ljubljana. The accurate evidence of time spent in the cave is kept for every member of the staff. This enables us to combine the data with radon concentration and determine the maximum dose of radiation that one has received during one year working period. According to national regulation and law, stated by National Health Inspector and Ministry of Health, a regular medical survey has been established. Detailed medical exams are performed each year or less frequently in order to prevent health problems. Blood tests enable us to observe radiation impact.

Da bi bolje razumeli geološko zgodovino tega kraškega sistema, smo raziskali stratigrafske podatke ohranjene v zapolnitvi velike vrtače pri največjem izviru v okolici. Vzorci zapolnitve iz naravnih izdankov in iz vrtine so bili analizirani s termoluminiscenco (TL) in 10Be kozmogeno metodo. Fizikalno-kemijske značilnosti zapolnitve so bile določene vizualno, z rentgensko metodo in merjenjem velikosti delcev. Podatki vrtine kažejo, da je debelina alohtonega materiala, ki zapolnjuje vrtačo 36,3 m. Ta material prekriva podorne bloke in sedimente debeline vsaj 15,6 m. Glede na teksturo, strukturo in barvo delimo material, ki zapolnjuje vrtačo na 7 con. Analize 10Be koncentracij kažejo, da material za celotni stolpec zapolnitve izvira iz rezidualnega materiala iz srednjega (Illinoian) in zgornjega Pleistocena (Wisconsian). Rentgenske analize glin kažejo, da zapolnitev vrtače vsebuje enake količine kaolinita in illita, kar je skladno z zemeljskim preperevanjem.The Ozark Plateaus region of southern Missouri is underlain by dominantly carbonate marine platform rocks of Paleozoic age. The region has been sub-aerially exposed since the late Paleozoic and is characterized by extensive karst. To better understand the geologic history of this regional karst system, we examined the stratigraphic record preserved in the fill of a large doline near the largest spring in the region. Samples of fill from natural exposures and drill core were analyzed using thermoluminescence (TL) and 10Be cosmogenic techniques, and the physical/chemical characteristics of the fill material were determined by visual inspection, X-ray analyses, and grain-size measurements. Drill-hole data indicate that the allochthonous doline fill is 36.3 m thick and rests on at least 15.6 m of cave breakdown and sediment. The doline fill is divisible into 7 zones. Analysis of 10Be concentrations suggest that the entire doline fill was derived from local residuum during the middle (Illinoian) to late Pleistocene (Wisconsinan). X-ray diffraction analyses of clays throughout the doline fill indicate that they consist of nearly equal amounts of kaolinite and illite, consistent with terrestrial weathering.",

There the DemänovskáCave system is developed more than 30 km long. The similar karst valley, the Jánska Valley with dozens of underground karst phenomena is situated ten kilometers to the east. The total length of these caves exceeds 30 km. The geomorphological, hydrological, and karst conditions of these two valleys are similar; nevertheless there are several outstanding differencies between two cave systems developed in them. The whole of the Demänovská Cave system is developed within the eastern slope of the DemänovskáValley. On the contrary in the Jánska Valley significant caves are situated on both sides of the valley. Besides this difference the Demänovská Cave system is penetrable through the whole of its length whereas cave system of the Jánska Valley is not penetrable although connection of the underground spaces was proved by various methods. The described state is caused by different geological conditions in these valleys. Both cave systems are developed mostly in the Middle Triassic Gutenstein Limestones. But the Demänovská Valley is situated in the area which is built by monocline of the Krížňanský nappe. In the territory of the Jánska Valley there is the Chočský nappe which is tectonically very complicatedly framed.",

Odprt je bil 15. avgusta 1899, poštne oblasti pa so dovolile uporabo posebnega poštnega žiga (“Adelsberger Grotte / Postojnska jama”). Ta urad je posloval do leta 1927 (z italijanskim žigom “Postumia (Grotte)” po letu 1922), nakar ga je nadomestil nov poštni urad, skoraj kilometer in pol oddaljen od vhoda. Urad je zadnjič posloval 15. avgusta 1945, ko je bila Postojnska jama po končani drugi svetovni vojni ponovno odprta.The only cave post offices to have been situated underground were in Postojnska jama. In 1899 the cave management, responding to the growing use of picture postcards, built a stone post office near Kongresna dvorana 500 m from the entrance. It was open by 15 August 1899, with a special ˝Adelsberger Grotte /Postojnska jama˝ cancellation authorised by the postal authorities. This building remained in use until 1927 (with the Italian ˝Postumia (Grotte)˝ postmark after 1922), when it was replaced by a new building 1,4 km inside the cave. Its last recorded use was 15 August 1945 when the cave was reopened under Jugoslav management.",

V dolomitu je površinska kraška oblikovanost slabše izražena, v krednih apnencih pa so nastale številne vrtače, brezna in požiralniki. Brezna v apnencih in vrtače v dolomitu kažejo genetsko povezanost na narivni kontakt, freatične oblike pa so nastajale globoko pod narivnim pokrovom. The paper discusses karstification along the thrust contact between dolomite and limestone at Idrijski Log and Koševnik (west-central Slovenia). Thrust contact induced the formation of a specific contact karst assemblage. Karst morphology is less strongly expressed within the dolomite, whereas the limestones are deeply karstified, with many dolines, shafts and sinkholes. Shafts in limestone and dolines in dolomite show genetic relationship with the thrust contact, whereas preserved fragments of phreatic features originated deep beneath the thrust plane.",

Subpanonski osameli kras je značilen za ta del Slovenije. Ta kras je razvit na majhnih otokih plitvega apnenca. Subpanonski osameli kras je poseben tip krasa na litotamnijski apnencih, kjer so površinske oblike dobro razvite ni pa znanih daljših jam. Osovniška jama je dolga okrog 290 m in je sedaj najdaljša jama v temu delu Slovenije. Na tem področju vpadajo apnenčeve plasti generalno proti JV pod kotom 20°. Glavne tektonske strukture so v smereh SZ-JV in V-Z. V kamnolomu je grebenski apnenec masiven in razpokan v smereh V-Z, SZ-JV in S-J. Jama generalno sledi smeri SZ-JV. Oblika rovov še zmeraj kaže na oblikovanje v freatičnih pogojih; večinoma pa je izraženo preoblikovanje in oblikovanje rovov v vadozni coni. V nekem obdobju razvoja jame so alohtoni klastični sedimenti napolnjevali zgornje dele jame, kasneje pa so bili skoraj popolnoma izprani. V jami je veliko kapniških tvorb.Osovniška jama has been discovered in 2001 during the exploitation of the Middle Miocene limestone in Pijevci quarry in the E part of Slovenia. Isolated subpanonian karst is typical of this part of Slovenia. This karst developed on small isolated patches of shallow limestone. Subpanonian isolated karst is a special type of karst on Lithothamnian limestone, where the surface karst forms are very well developed but no long caves were known. Osovni¹ka jama is about 290 m long and now is the longest cave in this part of Slovenia. In this area the general dip of limestone beds is towards SE at dip angle 20°. The main tectonic structures of the area are in NW-SE and E-W directions. In the quarry, reef limestone is massive and fissured in E-W, NW-SE and N-S directions. The cave generally follows the NW-SE direction. The shape of channels still shows its formation in phreatic conditions; but mostly the transformation and formation of its channels in the vadose zone is expressed. At some time in this cave development allochtonous clastic sediments filled up the upper parts of the cave; afterwards they were almost entirely washed away. There are a lot of flowstone formations in this cave.",

    "abstract": "Porečje Cerkniščice obsega 46,8 km2 in je reliefno precej pestro. Reliefna pestrost ni posledica velike kamninske pestrosti, saj večino porečja gradi zgornjetriasni dolomit. Glavno vlogo pri tem ima različna pretrtost dolomita. Več raziskovalcev meni, da se rečne terase v porečju Cerkniščice nahajajo v večih nivojih. Z rekonstrukcijo vzdolžnih rečnih profilov Cerkniščice oz. njene predhodnice in njenih glavnih pritokov pa se je pokazalo, da v porečju Cerkniščice pravih večstopenjskih teras ni. Vzdolž toka se namreč pojavljata le dva značilna nivoja: starejši in mlajši. Starejši nivo je 10-40 m višje od mlajšega in predstavlja uravnavo, ki jo je izdelala predhodnica Cerkniščice, ko je le-ta ponikala pri Begunjah in vodo podzemsko odvajala še v smeri proti Logatcu. Mlajši nivo predstavlja dno današnje Cerkniščice in se je začel oblikovati ob koncu Würma v trenutku, ko je voda iz porečja preusmerila tok in začela odtekati proti Cerkniškemu polju. Takrat je bilo ravnotežje zaradi spremembe razmer (nova erozijska baza, krajša odtočna razdalja in s tem večji strmec) v porečju porušeno in prisiljeno se je bilo prilagajati novim razmeram. Da bi ustvarila novo ravnotežje, se je Cerkniščica začela vrezovati v starejši nivo.The Cerkniščica catchement area covers about 46.8 km2, and most of the area is built of upper Triassic dolomite. So, the differences in the surface roughness are mostly not due to variable lithology, but to diffent degrees of tectonically injurred rock. Reconstruction of longitudinal profiles of the main river and of its tributaries revealed that there do not exist multiple terraces, as believed before. Rather, the river formed only two distinct levels. The older one is about 10-40 m higher, a wide, well equilibrated valley. It was formed by the predecessor of the present Cerkniščica, at the time when the river sank in the area of Begunje and continued its way towards Logatec underground. The younger level is controlled by the inrush of the river into Cerkniško polje. Sudden lowering of the erosion base, by the end of Würm, provoked rapid incision into the earlier surface, and the formation of canyon-like entrenchment.",

Cevi zapolnjujejo težko določljive sedimentne sekvence z jasno razvitimi udornimi strukturami. Zapolnitve sestavljajo predcenomanijske, cenomanijsko-turonijske in terciarne odkladnine. Notranja sestava teh zapolnitev kaže na večkratno udiranje. Kredne in predkredne odkladnine so pogosto subvertikalne in imajo neurejeno notranjo strukturo. V prednjih delih nekaterih cevi so sledi manjših udorov, ki sta jih najbrž povzročila nadaljnje zakrasevanje in sufozija v globini. Pokrov terciarnih odkladnin na krednih je ponekod pretrgan in kaže rahel sredobežni naklon, ponekod pa zapolnjuje osrednji del podorne mase. Nastanek teh korozijskih cevi je v zvezi s hidrotermalno dejavnostjo, verjetno od paleogena do miocena, ko je bilo apniško površje še prekrito z rahlo erodiranim pokrovom zgornjekrednih sedimentov platforme. Hidrotermalne kraške oblike so se razvile do vrha apnencev, saj je bila piezometrična gladina v krednem pokrovu. Ko je podpora vodnega pritiska popustila, se je sedimentni pokrov pričel zniževati - udirati.Vertical and subvertical pipes are circular to ovate in shape with diameters from 2-4 m up to tens of metres and with proven depth up to 82 m. Some of them terminate by horizontal cave levels at depth. Pipes are filled with complicated sedimentary sequences with clearly developed collapse structures. The fill is composed of pre-Cenomanian, Cenomanian-Turonian and Tertiary deposits. Internal structures of the fill indicate multiphase collapses. Cretaceous and pre-Cretaceous deposits are often subvertical with chaotic internal texture. In the centre of some of pipes, there are traces of younger collapses, most probably induced by continuing karstification and suffosion at depth. Tertiary deposits overlay the Cretaceous ones unconformably; they show gentler centripetal inclination, but in places they fill the central parts of collapsed fill. The origin of solution pipes is connected with hydrothermal activity most probably during Paleogene to Miocene, when the surface of limestones was still covered by slightly eroded cover of Upper Cretaceous platform sediments. Hydrothermal karst forms developed up to the surface of limestones as the piezometric level was situated within the Cretaceous cover. After the lost of buoyancy support of water, sedimentary cover started to move (collapse) down.",

    "abstract": "The Grotta Gigante houses a geodetic station since 1959, which has the goal to observe deformation of the cave. The instrumentation consists of two ultra-broad-band pendulum type tiltmeters, and two medium-to-longperiod tiltmeters, next to thermometer and pressure gauge. The exceptionally long and continuous time-series of the tiltmeters allows us to demonstrate the existence of several astonishing phenomena that cause the cave to change continuously in shape, also if only to a small amount and which can be recorded with sophisticated instruments, as the ones installed. The movements due to the different causes sum up to produce the complete observed signal, and our goal is to separate and identify the different phenomena. To illustrate the work we do in identifying the different agents, the analogy holds to a musician listening to a symphony-concert and identifying the melody of the first violin, flute, triangle, the violoncello and the double bass, and then identifying the corresponding musicians and instruments on stage. As the music has high and low tones, the deformation of the cave is composed of slow and fast movements, continuous movements, or abrupt, sudden events, that repeat very rarely. Here we show the observation sequence of tilt for the time interval 1966-2012, and discuss the deformation due to the following causes: temperature, underground water-level, sea level of the Adriatic sea, position of sun and moon and vibration of the Earth due some of the greatest mega-earthquakes ever recorded. To illustrate the analogues to music we use to explain the association of different frequency ranges to different causes of deformation signal to the general public of the cave. The results show an excellent example of scientifically sound and important instrumentation installed in a show-cave visited regularly by the public.",

    "abstract": "For proper cave surveying using DistoX, the device needs to be calibrated with adequate accuracy. Calibrating does not require any tools; but, tools to make calibration easier have been developed. Theoretical consideration shows that the use of certain tools enables one to introduce a type of calibration error that goes undetected by the calibration software. In this study, the existence of such errors is experimentally confirmed and their magnitude is estimated. It is demonstrated to be crucial that the DistoX is calibrated and that the calibration is valid, that is, that the device has not changed since it was last calibrated. No part of the DistoX must have moved or changed its magnetization since calibration, not even the battery. The calibration method used and the quality of the resulting calibration are important too. It is highly recommended that the DistoX be checked immediately before surveying a cave and thus avoid the possibility of using an uncalibrated, not validly calibrated, or poorly calibrated device. To complete the check, a few survey shots are measured multiple times with the device at different roll angles, and the back shot of one of the shots is measured. If the device is properly calibrated, the measurements will agree with each other within the acceptable measurement error. This is not the case for a device that is not properly calibrated.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade or two, vulnerability mapping become a useful tool to determine the sensitivity of karst aquifers and allows the analysis of karstic aquifers affected by human activities. The Tettye Catchment, one of the eight catchments of the Mecsek Karst aquifer (SW Hungary), supplies drinking water for Pécs, the fifth most populous city in Hungary. However, due to its partly urbanized character and heterogeneous karstic features, this catchment is highly sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. In this study we aimed to generate resource vulnerability maps and risk maps to assess the role of physical and anthropogenic factors on groundwater vulnerability in the Mecsek Karst. Two formerly validated methods were used, the COP (Concentration, Overlaying layers and Precipitation) and SA (Slovene Approach) methods. The resource vulnerability maps, validated by former tracer tests, were combined with the hazard map obtained from the COST action 620 and EU Water Directive to generate risk maps. Tracer-based transit times were commonly less than 20 days in the majority of the areas of extreme vulnerability. During the current study, a new protocol has been elaborated for the delineation of the protection zones of karstic aquifers. Comparing the two methods, the SA performed better in terms of intrinsic vulnerability mapping, as it had a higher spatial resolution and was more detailed than the COP map and had a more sophisticated vulnerability indexing. In addition, high spatial correlation was revealed between the transit time maps and the SA map. Reassessed risk zonation, with appropriate legal consequences, likely minimizes undesired human activities within the zone of protection, hence maintaining water quality that complies with the protection acts",

    "abstract": "The cave crickets Troglophilus neglectus Krauss, 1879 and T. cavicola (Kollar, 1833) originating from caves in Slovenia were surveyed for gregarines. Two gregarine species were identified. Gregarina troglophili (Golemansky &amp; Lipa, 1991) occurred in both cave cricket species, T. cavicola being reported a new host species. Besides, a new species, Gregarina bernardae sp. n., in­fecting T. neglectus, was identified and described. The two spe­cies often infest the same T. neglectus individuals, but can be well distinguished upon the shape and morphometric indexes of both solitary gregarines and associations. The deutomerite in solitary gamonts of G. troglophili is orbicular to broadly el­liptoid, while in G. bernardae sp. n. it is oblong to dolioform. In associations, the primite deutomerite in G. troglophili is orbicu­lar to broadly elliptoid, while in G. bernardae sp. n. it is shal­lowly oblong to oblong. In contrast to broadly obovoid to finely obdeltoid satellite deutomerite in G. troglophili, it is narrowly dolioform or dolioform to narrowly obdeltoid in G. bernardae sp. n. Both species are new to the faunal list of Slovenia, and to the list of cave-dwelling species in the country. We direct the attention to the parasite diversity of cave-dwelling animals – a promising, but understudied topic that might considerably contribute to the diversity of the subterranean fauna.",

This symposium was about these and other questions connected to carbon in karst and boundaries in karst. It was especially timely both because of rapid advances in the field and the importance of carbon sequestration in global climate change The symposium highlighted recent advances in biology, geology, and hydrology that are helping us understand the dynamics of karst ecosystems, especially with respect to carbon. The talks were organized around seven main themes:• The Upper Boundary – Epikarst• The Lower Boundary – Phreatic Zone• Lateral Inputs — Insurgences• Lateral Outputs — Resurgences• CO2 — Processing and Storage• Organic Carbon — Sources and Quality• Synthesis and Large Scale ModelsSixty participants from seven countries attended the week-long meeting which included an excursion to Carlsbad Caverns National Park. For the first time at a KWI meeting, several participants, who were unable to attend in person, gave their presentations via Skype. The meeting was highlighted by two keynote presentations:• Groundwater Ecology of Alluvial River Flood Plains, Jack Stanford, Flathead Lake Biological Station, Polson, Montana• Karst – Conduit Matrix Exchange and the Karst Hyporheic Zone, John Wilson, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technoloogy, Socorro, New Mexico.Two most distinguished karst scientists, William B.

    "abstract": "Spring discharge records integrate of all the processes and the reactions occurring within a karst basin. A brief summary of the use of discharge records as a means to constrain the internal structure of karst basins, as means to constrain rainfall-runoff models for karst basin, and as a means to determine the value of hydrodynamic parameters of karst basins is presented. Data collected from Devils Icebox, a karst basin spring in Missouri, USA, were used to assess these approaches to characterizing karst basins. For Devils Icebox, most of the discharge responses do not record information about the internal structure of the basin rather the responses record information about the recharge to the basin. A rainfall-runoff model failed to reproduce the data from which model parameters were derived and has little utility in a predictive mode. Use of conservation of mass equations as a means to derive hydrodynamic parameters is a useful approach, although critical data are lacking. More generally, karst hydrologists need quantitative tracer data and long-term, high-resolution temporal data of the input(s) to and the output(s) from karst basins.Keywords: Hydrograph, hydrology, karst.DOI: 10.3986/ac.v42i2-3.671",

Being familiar with the high quality of past meetings organized by the Karst Waters Institute, the editorial board of AC agreed with the proposal and invited Dave as a guest editor. His editorial work was highly efficient and thorough; he found relevant reviewers and provided a high quality reviews for each manuscript. The issue contains high quality review and original research paper, presenting a comprehensive coverage of the role of karst in the global carbon cycle. This issue would not be possible without a wide cooperation of reviewers who provided thorough and thoughtful reviews of all manuscripts. Several manuscripts have been rejected for different reasons, and most of the others were considerably improved after the review.

    "abstract": "Our friend, colleague, supervisor, chairman... our Charlie, who came back from the underground so many times, entered it the last time, without return. On January 25, 2012 the Earth opened for him, as would say the old Romans: “Mundus subterraneus patet”. Charlie will not come back, but for us, his colleagues and friends, he will stay among us for a long time. Wwhenever we will talk about past events, we shall say: “Charlie was with us ... Charlie organised ... it was Charlie’s idea ... Charlie took care for this ...” Archaeologist by education, caver, speleologist, karstologist, professor, “Hofrath”, head of the Speleological institute, co-worker of Vienna’s museum, chair of the International Speleological Union commission, organiser and Nestor of ALCADI ... for sure I cannot enumerate all. Probably I omitted more than I mentioned. For Acta carsologica it is more important to tell a little more about the contacts of Prof. Mais with Slovenia. He was a sort of a bridge between older generation of Austrian speleologists, just to mention G. Abel and H. Trimmel, who cultivated traditionally friendly contacts with Slovene cavers, where late F. Habe was the animator, and younger generation, where friendly contacts and reciprocal visits are no more the main topic, but are replaced by professional contacts and co-operation. Prof. Mais was very active at both sides. In Slovenia he attended professional meetings, congresses, and symposia, especially International Karstological School “Classical Karst”. In the 20 years of school existence he participated ten times, being one of the most frequent participants. I remember well his interesting, attractive and lively presented papers where he always told us something new and surprising related to history of karstology and speleology. He was always prepared to help. He took every question or demand for the advice very seriously, studied it and his answer brought much more than anybody expected; it did not matter whether the question was related to an important Austrian researcher from the 18th century or to a recently edited “karst” stamp. He liked to come to the Karst Institute at Postojna very much. Archives materials from Postojna were good supplement to his studies at Vienna’s archives. He had still many plans and wishes to realize regarding the history of karst research. We discussed open questions on Nagel, Hauer, Penck, Putick. Wwithout Karl’s help maybe we will never get the answers. Wwhen our journal Acta carsologica became oriented more towards international spheres, Prof. Mais co-operated as the author and as the reviewer. Between the years 1994-1999 he published four important papers on karst geomorphology and karst research history in Acta carsologica. At the University of Nova Gorica he was a supervisor of doctoral students, which was a very important help for this young university and even more for still younger programme of karstology. At the end I must mention that not only his professionalknowledge but also his kind-heartedness, understanding, good wiliness, and optimism will be missed the most. Even in the most unpleasant situation, when the group of excursionists waited in front of the cave door and nobody had the key, or when he has to sleep in the car in front of the hotel where he booked the room and had to start to sort the slides at twilight because he was the first speaker at the symposium he remained in good mood. This is Charlie I will keep in my mind: smiling, gentle, and in good humour discussing and explaining complicated professional questions.Andrej Kranjc",

    "abstract": "A large part of t�is issue is dedicated to t�e p�enomena of cave climate.Thermal conditions in caves are t�e result of many interacting processes between eart�'s atmosp�ere, �ydrosp�ere and lit�osp�ere.Alt�oug� cave atmosp�ere is often considered to be static, it s�ows measurable variability in time and space.Understanding of t�e long and s�ort term processes in t�e cave atmosp�ere is important for many ot�er fields of cave researc�, suc� as paleoclimatic studies based on stalagmite proxies, speleogenesis, biospeleology etc.Two years ago, an International Karstological Sc�ool was dedicated to t�e study of cave climate.Some of t�e works presented t�ere are now appearing as articles in t�is issue.They deal wit� various aspects of cave climate, including t�e basic t�eory of t�ermal and atmosp�eric processes in caves, dynamics of barometric caves, radon in caves, CO 2 dynamics in cave, influence of tourism on cave climate etc.However, t�e issue is not exclusively topical; t�ere are ot�er papers t�at bring in t�e diversity w�ic� we believe is one of t�e trademarks of t�is journal.This year Acta Carsologica �as received its Impact Factor (0.59), w�ic� triggered some considerations on our editorial policy.All journals aim at increasing t�eir IF, and starting from its definition, one of t�e goals would be to c�ange t�e policy in a way to publis� a smaller number of papers wit� �ig� citation potential.This would surely narrow t�e scope of t�e journal and t�e diversity of aut�ors.On t�e ot�er �and, we tend to attract young aut�ors presenting t�eir work and aut�ors presenting researc� t�at may not be scientifically cutting edge, but includes interesting field observations not publis�ed previously.Putting t�e two t�ings toget�er brings us to a compromise: we will aim toward �ig�er quality and try to attract t�e best aut�ors in t�e field, but we will not lose t�e diversity of topics and aut�ors t�at t�is journal is known for.We still �ave a lot of potential w�en it comes to marketing, and �ere is w�ere.you can all �elp.We are �appy for every aut�or t�at decides to publis� wit� us.However, t�e number of manuscript s�as increased recently, and keeping in mind t�at limited financial resources do not allow us to publis� more t�an t�ree issues a year, t�e average time from submission to publication �as increased.Acta �as no professional editor or manager.It is done by a team of t�ree (before volume 38 t�ere weretwo of us) as an assignment in addition to our basic job, researc�.Editing brings a lot of work, w�ic� includes all correspondence wit� aut�ors and reviewers (t�ese are sometimes �ard to find), crossc�ecking, proofreading, translation of abstracts, correspondence wit� t�e layout and print production, maintenance of t�e web page etc.Therefore, I would like to ask aut�ors for some patience and understanding w�en we do not answer promptly to your inquiries.We do our best.However we still �ave plans to make t�e journal better.One of t�e primary task is to switc� to electronic submission and editing, w�ic� will above all add to t�e transparency of t�e w�ole editorial process.We �ope t�at it will also increase t�e efficiency of editorial �andling, for t�e good of our team, aut�ors and readers.This is t�e last 2010 issue, coming almost under t�e C�ristmas tree.Let me use t�is opportunity to wis� all t�e best in 2011 to all our readers and aut�ors in t�e name of t�e editorial team.",

But because of them, conduits, which transmit water, are only partly accessible. Difficult access is a reason why many water transmissions have not been explored yet. Because of this, geometry and length of all underground conduits is not known, it can be only predicted. In such a case processes of water flow in karstic conditions are more easily predictable by modeling. Basic physical models are usually used. They are based on the conduit permeability of karst water. We assume conduits with different dimensions, smaller usually presenting areas of full pipe flow (under pressure) and larger open channel flow. We were interested in the hydraulic conditions, when does the change from open channel to full pipe flow occur and when does underground flow from main conduit divide into two neighbouring conduits. The response of a karst aquifer to a flood pulse was not studied in our model, but we observed its behaviour during a constant increase of recharge into the karstic underground.",

Various geological environments of The Western Carpathians were chosen as studying areas. The results of the project confirm that the influence of the contamination source is variable in space and time. An amount of objective and efficient information is necessary to fulfill the requirements for the water treatment. The possibility how to minimize the amount of expensive and intricate methods used by investigation was to connect them with hydrogeological indicating methods (HIM). The correlated relations distinguished between contaminant and physical characteristics of water allow using the obtained local information in larger area and repeating them in higher frequency. The economical benefit is relative to increasing demands on space and time. The base was built on the water conductivity and water temperature measurements set in field. The measured values which were processed basically allow obtaining indirect information about the contamination spreading. By correlation the values with water analyses for a monitoring site from specific studied locality and by added other information from field methods the results can be amplified. It is possible to substitute the intricate and expensive contaminant spreading mapping methods by HIM and monitor the dynamic changes of contamination influences in space and time with denser data net.",

During the baroque times of Volf Engelbert Auersperg the science of karst was not born yet. The researchers had to wait for another century until the most fundamental facts about karst were proved by Carniolan scientists Hacquet, Gruber, and others. Nonetheless Volf collected several important books about karst with famous authors Aldrovandi, Ferrante Imperato, Johann Joachim Becher, Tommasso Buoni, Jakob Joannes Wenceslaus Dobrzensky de Nigro Ponte, and Athanasius Kircher. The special concern was put on the Count Volf Engelbert and his brother Prince Janez Vajkard interests in karst phenomena and their mutual influence on the younger visitors of their Ljublanian palace, especially Schönleben and Valvasor. Volf and Janez owned several manors at now Slovenian and Croatian karst.

Significant groundwater resources that are partly used as a water supply are in carbonate rocks. Detailed temperature and conductivity measurements coupled withdischarge measurements along all streams in the area demonstrate a relatively quick method to lo­cate virtually all important groundwater outflows from carbon­ates. Discharge measurements of streams crossing carbonate strips enabled us to locate and quantify the capacity of ponors and losing parts of streams in various water stages. Thanks to a detailed knowledge of losing and gaining parts of streams, we were able to select appropriate profiles to separate catchments withdiffering hydrologic balances (balanced, gaining, losing). Flow directions in carbonates and recharge and discharge ar­eas were delineated by comparing the specific discharges of individual catchments. Resulting flow directions agree withtracer tests in the area. Our outlined approachcan be used in many other areas to locate hidden inflows into streams and to estimate flow between individual small catchments, and it may partly compensate for tracer tests as it allows flow directions to be estimated from hydrological balance and rock geometry.",

The primary data sources are digital elevation models (DEMs) as continuous surface data, supported with aerial photographs, satellite images and older topographic maps. This study is supplemented with textual information about of historical surfaces. Geomorphologically high quality DEM of Slovenia with 12.5 m resolution uncovered many human impacts to the terrain surface, which could not be perceived before using any classical surveying techniques. Particularly on the karstic areas, changes of the surface as a consequence of highway constructions and developing of the stone quarries are well seen. Additionally is involved a database of natural (ridges, valleys, peaks, sinkholes) and antropogenic features (stone and gravel quarries, standing waters, different types of roads and railways) on the current terrain surface. Even more surface changes were found on the LIDAR-based DEM of 1 m resolution. Some human impacts to the surface changes from prehistory until today were analysed with many visual techniques and confirmed with objective numerical methods. The results show that is the human impact on the Earth’s surface important factor that grows exponentially with time.",

    "abstract": "In Črna Jama, which is part of Postojnska Jama, underground measurement of VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio signals was periodically carried out in 2012 and 2013 for detection of possible pre-seismic and/or other anomalies and to ascertain suitability of VLF monitoring in a natural cave environment. The modulation of the VLF signal was connected with a powerful atmospheric front and changes of the precipitation level. VLF data showed day and night changes and also significant changes between dry and rainy periods when water from the surface reached the cave chamber through about 30 m of limestone roof. During VLF monitoring we did not receive earthquake precursor signals. VLF monitoring in a karst cave could be an option for future research in understanding pre-seismic and other anomalies. On-line connection with other VLF surface or cave monitoring sites in Europe is necessary in future VLF registration. Results of preliminary VLF monitoring showed Črna Jama to be a suitable place for future studies.Key words: VLF radio signals, noise sounds, pre-seismic anomalies, Črna Jama, Slovenia.",

In particular, during the Late Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Modern Age, interesting undertakings linked with natural monuments and peculiarities of the karst environment, have involved famous people, cultural leaders of the time, as well as local inhabitants. Amongst celebrities there are hints that: 1) during the XIV. century Dante Alighieri visited some karst cavities in the mountains, 2) during the XV. century the famous painter Andrea Mantegna painted an image of the Ponte di Veja, a natural bridge, in the Camera degli Sposi of the Ducal Palace of Mantua. Of contemporary cultural leaders: 1) in the XVI. century the pharmacist, Francesco Calceolari, created one of the first Wunderkammer in the world in Verona, an exhibition of curious objects collected in the mountains, 2) in 1739 the local priest, Gregorio Piccoli, starting from a description of paleontological cave fillings, proposed an interesting and in some respects modern interpretation of the geological history of the mountains. The local inhabitants of the mountain have been able not only to solve some of the environmental problems caused by the scarcity of surface water, but also to exploit some of the unusual resources such as ice trapped in caves. They also developed a system of producing ice and of storing it in cylindrical warehouses inspired by the local karst shafts. They understood aspects of the functioning of the karst geosystem, including underground karst hydrology and the dynamics of the epikarstic zone.

V poznem srednjem veku, renesansi in moderni dobi, se z lesinskim krasom srečajo številne zgodovinske osebnosti iz kulturnega življenja in drugih okolij. V XIV. stoletju naj bi tu nekatere jame obiskal Dante Alighieri, slikar Andrea Mantegna je narisal naravni most Ponte di Veja, slika danes krasi poročno dvorano Vojvodske palače v Mantovi. V XVI. stoletju je farmacevt Francesco Calceolari ustvaril prvo sobo čudes (Wunderkammer) na svetu, kjer je predstavil nenavadne predmete iz Lesinskih Alp. Leta 1739 je duhovnik Gregorio Piccoli opisal paleontologijo jamskih sedimentov iz lesinkih jam in predstavil skoraj moderno interpretacijo geološke zgodovine gorovja. Krajevni prebivalci so na izvirne načine reševali težave z oskrbo vode na krasu, po drugi strani pa so s pridom izkoristili naravne vire, ki jih nudi kras, npr. jamski led. Po vzoru kraaških brezen so izdelovali tudi skladišča za led. Prebivalci so razumeli osnovna načela delovanja kraškega okolja, podzemne hidrologije in dinamike epikrasa ter jih izkoriščali v svoj prid že veliko pred razvojem modernega krasoslovja.Ključne besede: človek in kras, razumevanje kraškega okolja, izkoriščanje naravnih virov, Lesinske Alpe, Beneške predalpe, Italija.",

    "abstract": "So far, the longest known unroofed cave in Slovenia has been found on the Slavinski ravnik, southwest of Postojna. From its position on the surface, its shape, and its containing sediments, we can infer its spatial and temporal development, as well as the processes and evolution of the contact karst in its hinterland. The corrosional plain Slavinski ravnik is a small area of the Dinaric Karst in Slovenia, located at the contact between impermeable flysch and karstified carbonate rocks, where many contact karst features formed. Due to erosion, multi-phase regional tectonic uplift, and sedimentation, a paragenetic cave system, active and relict blind valleys have formed. During the geomorphological mapping, elements were examined and drawn using ESRI ArcMap and Golden Software Surfer, and the stages of their formation were observed. During the survey, the active cave system Markov spodmol and Vodna jama v Lozi, the relict unroofed cave Brezstropa jama v Lozi, Biščevci blind valley, Sajevško polje blind valley, Ivačevci blind valley, and Sajevško polje sediment accumulation were studied. The changing hydrological regime, the allogenic sediments, the distribution of active and relict ponors, and the placement of active and relict elements of these contact karst forms, show different stages of formation and subsequent development of the northern border of Slavinski ravnik. The geomorphological map of these contact karst features and their following studies give us an insight into the morphogenesis of the southern karst periphery of the Postojna Basin as an exceptional - relatively small but highly variable Slovenian contact karst site.",

This paper presents an overview of hydrological features that Fortis recorded in two of his works: Saggio d'Osservazzioni sopra l'Isola di Cherso ed Osero (1771) and Viaggio in Dalmazia (1774). These works were a result of several Fortis' travels in the region and were noted in European scientific literature of that time. Fortis revealed to European public the eastern Adriatic coast, a then little-known part of Europe with its wide variety of natural features. Despite the scarce appearance of surface water in karst, numerous interpretations of hydrological features can be found in Fortis’ descriptions of the East Adriatic coast. He often shows a remarkable understanding of karst hydrology even though some of his ideas and explanations are dubious from the present point of view. Although Fortis is not considered a karstologist in the strict sense, his works contain elements of what will eventually become karstology.",

In the field, data from cross-sections of 505 local hollowings with one or more tributary channel junctions were investigated. The shift in the width–depth ratio of the local hollowings was studied as the number of junctions and the size of the hollowing changed. Flow was simulated through CFD in digital model channels, and the nature of the resulting vorticity was interpreted. Field data show that local hollowings emerging in the main channels of the channel systems at the junctions. In the main channels, when only a few tributary channels join in the vicinity of each other, local hollowings deepen during their growth and, most often, gradually become pits (depth is larger than width), as the morphometric analysis suggests. As the number of tributary channels increases, the local hollowing may develop into a kamenitza (width is larger than depth). The model experiment suggests the explanation that more tributary channel junctions result in more extensive vorticity, which contributes to the lateral extension (widening) of this channel section. The distance of the tributary junctions from each other also influences the downstream dimension of the local hollowing. In the field, the larger this distance, the more separated the local hollowings induced by individual tributaries. The model experiment suggests that this may occur because the intense vorticity generated by individual junctions becomes increasingly sectionalized as the tributary channel density decreases.",

A meta-analysis was performed of environmental factors influencing the algal species colonisation in caves and rockshelters. For this purpose, the results of studies about algal colonisation in 82 caves and rockshelters in 11 European, Asian and American countries were analysed. Firstly, 412 species were counted of which Cyanobacteria predominated, followed by Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta, and finally by Rhodophyta. The Shannon Index determined that the diversity of the algal species developing in these places was very high. The most diverse Cyanobacteria genera to appear in the different studied caves and rockshelters are Leptolyngbya with 28 different species, Gloeocapsa with 24 and Phormidium with 23. They are followed by Chroococcus with 18, Aphanothece with 14, Oscillatoria, Nostoc and Scytonema with 10 each and Schizothrix and Tolypothrix with 9 each. The most diverse Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta genera are Chlorella with 9 different species and Diadesmis/Humidophila, Luticola and Nitzschia with 4, respectively. The principal component analysis revealed that both photosynthetically active radiation and relative humidity more actively conditioned the development of some algal species in cave environments than temperature.",

The entrance and exit of the cave are used as tie-in points because the characteristics of the two locations can be directly observed. Parameters used in this study include ground vibration amplification, shear wave velocity, and Poisson’s ratio. The presence of cavities can be characterized by a relatively strong contrast between these physical parameters and their surroundings. The exit of the cave, which can be considered as a sinkhole, has a dominant frequency of 3.2 to 4.6 Hz, which is relatively higher than that of the surrounding area. At the entrance of Cerme Cave, which has a large cavity, a small ground vibration amplification was detected, less than 0.1. The entrance and exit of the cave also exhibit a low shear wave propagation velocity of less than 350 m/s. The presence of a subsurface fluvial channel in Cerme Cave can be characterized by a high Poisson’s ratio of 0.4–0.5, a gain value of less than 0.1, and a shear wave velocity of less than 350 m/s.",

    "abstract": "A 13-month monitoring was carried out in two caves that open up in the north-western sector of the Classical Karst (Gorizia Karst): Antro Casali Neri and Grotta Due Piani. In both, ß + γ radioactivity, radon and CO2 have a seasonal pattern, with maximums in summer and minimums in winter, even if their trends are somewhat different, due to the different morphological and thermal conditions. The increases begin when the outside temperature becomes higher than that of the caves and vice versa, decrease is recorded when outside temperature is below the cave temperature. The more modest daily variations of radon, on the other hand, are evident when its concentration is low. Sometimes they are related to meteorological variations or day/night rhythms, but, in other cases, they have no clearly identifiable causes. In Casali Neri cave the maximum radon activity was 50161 Bq/m3, while the CO2 concentration went off the instrument's scale (&gt; 9999 ppm) only in the first days of August 2021. The highest radioactivity value was also recorded in this cave with 0.85 μSv/h (average of 8 minutes of recording), with peaks up to 1.05 μSv/h. In Due Piani cave, on the other hand, the radon activity was lower, with a maximum of 22138 Bq/m3, however, the CO2 values went off the scale from July to the first days of October 2021. In both cases, in the warm months, radon and CO2 appear to come mainly from the fractured rock of epikarstic zone. Further accumulations can then form in points with poor ventilation. Furthermore, research has shown that high concentrations of these two gases are not only typical of large or deep caves, but also of modest and easily accessible caves.",

Many fossil discoveries exist in the region; one can also find rock paintings and other archaeological remains. A ruiniform landscape, weathered caves and continuous or isolated outcrops characterize the karst. They are cut by diaclasis, fractures and fissures, separated by flattened relief with dolines, uvalas, ponors and blind valleys. The evolution of karst morphology in the region reflects pluviometric and paleoclimatic variations, with faults and fractures from neotectonics events exerting control over water flows. One can observe four geomorphological compartments in this region, each with specific characteristics. The region is an outstanding example of the Brazilian intertropical karst and one of the most important Brazilian mineral deposits of limestone and dolomite. So, delimitating its geomorphological units can facilitate understanding the speleological heritage and guide strategic decisions for sustainable use.",

    "abstract": "The karst rock relief clearly reveals the ways in which the karst surface and caves have been shaped and how they have developed. The oldest traces are the rock features of old karst caves, which were formed under climate conditions entirely different from the current ones, i.e., in the Pleistocene, and which have been dry for a longer period of time. Today, the wind is the prevailing factor in shaping the rock on the surface and in the karst of the White Desert near Farafra in particular, where we can witness the development of an entire range of wind rock features which helps us sort and classify them logically. However, in the wadis near the Qara Oasis a unique rock relief is forming, in which traces of water flow and dissolution of the rock under the sandy deposits are utterly predominant. The rainfall volume is low, however, the heavy rainfall events lasting short periods of time are enough to shape the less resistant rock. The rock features dominating the walls are co-shaped by dissolution and aeolian erosion. Crust forms on those parts of the rock surface that come in contact with water. The bare surfaces, on the other hand, are carved out by the wind. In the places where the crust has flaked off, the wind carves out cups.",

Historically, biospeleology came first, and signalled that biological study was part of speleology, the science of caves. Speleology itself has come to have several meanings beyond the science of caves, but as a discipline it has not fully developed. Speleobiology emphasizes the connection with biology, especially ecology and evolutionary biology. Biospeleology can be construed as the taxonomic and distributional aspects of the biology of caves while speleobiology can be construed as the aspects pertaining to general biological principles such as evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Lago del Capraro doline (Salento peninsula, southern Italy), a valuable Mediterranean Temporary Pond (MTP), has been investigated aiming to define its geomorphological features and to collect data about the local hydraulic regime. At the bottom of the Lago del Capraro doline, in fact, a small temporary pond appears soon after major precipitation events as that one of autumn 2013. The morphological survey shows that this solution doline is placed on a karst plain surface stretching at about 70 m of altitude; the doline has an elliptical shape with the major axis 130 m long whereas the length of the minor axis is about 100 m. It shows a flat bottom, placed at about 65 m above m.s.l., due to the presence of a colluvial sandy clays filling, bordered by steep limestone slopes about 5 m high. Geophysical surveys and a cone dynamic penetrometer test allowed a detailed geological model to be realized. In particular, ERT and seismic refraction models revealed the geometry and the thickness of doline filling deposits as well as the preferential infiltration zones of surface waters. Interestingly, the cone penetrometer test reveals that resistance decreases downward in the filling lower part, most likely because of the active solution process at the doline bottom. The results of this study suggest an increase of surface water infiltration at doline bottom in the next future so that the development of a pond will be an increasingly rare event, partly compensated by the clustering of rainy periods during autumn months as expected in the future by climate models.",

    "abstract": "The aquifers of alpine karst and high karst plateaus are abundant water resources. They are difficult to characterise due to their complex, partly glaciokarstic, evolution in active tectonic environments, and an unsaturated zone up to two kilometres thick. We present and discuss the results of a tracing test in the alpine karst of the Julian Alps (Slovenia), more precisely in the Migovec System, the longest cave system in Slovenia (length = 43 km, depth = 972 m). The cave extends below a mountain ridge that separates the Soča and Sava Valleys, thus forming a topographic divide between the Adriatic and Black Sea basins, which gives the test greater regional significance. In early September 2019, three kilograms of uranine were injected into a perched lake in a remote part of the system, approximately 900 metres below the plateau and 100 metres above the low water table. All known springs in the valleys on either side of the mountain were monitored by manual or instrumental sampling and a field fluorometer. Due to the unexpectedly dry season, no tracer was detected at any site for two months until a heavy rainfall event in early November. Subsequently, about 60-65 % of the tracer mass appeared within 60 hours in the Tolminka River. No tracer was detected at other sites, either becauseit was not present or because it was highly diluted. The study suggests that the lake containing the tracer is bypassed by the vadose flow and that the tracer was only mobilised during large events when the lake became part of the epihreatic flow. The linear peak flow velocity from the injection site to the Tolminka Spring was only about 1.7 m/h. However, assuming that the tracer was only mobilised by the large rain event, the velocity would be 70 m/h. The study highlights the challenges and pitfalls of water tracing in alpine karst systems and suggests ways to avoid them.",

Zanima me, kako je hitrost denudacije odvisna od parametrov kot so naklon površine, količina in intenziteta padavin ter smer in hitrost vetra. Odgovor poiščem v rešitvi diferencialne enačbe, ki opisuje hitrost zniževanja površine. Izkaže se, da se hitrost denudacije ne veča sorazmerno z intenziteto padavin in da nikoli ne preseže določene mejne vrednosti. Dolgotrajno deževje majhne intenzitete povzroča višjo denudacijsko stopnjo, kot niz kratkotrajnih padavin. Hitrost denudacije narašča s hitrostjo vetra, vendar le do določene hitrosti.This paper deals with the question of how the duration of karstic denudation depends on the dip angle, the annual amount of precipitation, the rain intensity, and the prevailing wind direction and speed in case of an initially plane, sloping limestone surface without soil cover. The answer is given by the solution of a differential equation system describing the lowering speed of the rock surface. It turns out that the rate of the denudation does not increase in proportion to the intensity of precipitation and that it can never exceed a maximal value. Furthermore, long, soft rains result in higher annual denudation than short, abundant downpours. With increasing wind-speed the corrosion rate also increases, but above a certain wind speed the dissolution does not become faster. This paper presents numerical examples with diagrams about how these factors affect the expected duration of denudation.",

Even if wide and abundant bibliography related to tides and their behaviour with respect to the external estuaries is available, none dealed with the estuary caves and the related hydrogeology. This paper aims to partially fill this gap presenting a preliminary study done at the Puerto Princesa Underground River (PPUR), in the Palawan Island (Philippines). The data was collected during the last expedition (November 2016) organised by La Venta, in which some of the authors took part. During the survey, the cave has been instrumented with in continuous diver data-logger devices (CTD) recording temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC) and water level fluctuations. Longitudinal and vertical water hydrogeological profiles of the cave were realised with the aim of understanding the dynamics of the waters during different hydrogeological regimes in combination with salt water intrusion. In addition, a bathymetric profile was done to better identify the point where to realise the vertical logs. A significant rainstorm occurred during the expedition, lasting for approximately 12 hours resulting in 80 mm of rain, and its effects gave the researchers the opportunity to analyse the hydrodynamics of the flowing waters during a flood. In normal flow conditions, the longitudinal logs highlighted the presence of freshwater inlets and the vertical logs testified to a clear stratification of the waters (freshwaters at the surface and brackish waters at the bottom). During floods, the EC and T data showed evidence of a fast substitution of the resident waters.Key words: anchialine caves, sea water intrusion, hydrodynamics, karst springs, PPUR, Philippines.Učinek močnega naliva na hidrodinamiko podzemske reke Puerto princese (Palawan, Filipini)Očarljivo in občutljivo okolje, kot so podzemni estuariji, je treba preučevati, razumeti in zaščititi za sedanje in prihodnje generacije. Četudi imamo na voljo široko in bogato bibliografijo o plimovanju in delovanju plimovanja v zunanjih estuarijih, nobeno delo ne obravnava estuarskih jam in s tem povezane hidrogeologije. Namen tega članka je delno zapolniti to vrzel in predstaviti predhodno študijo na podzemni reki Puerto Princesa (PPUR) na otoku Palawan (Filipini). Podatki so bili zbrani med zadnjo ekspedicijo (novembra 2016), ki jo je organizirala La Venta, v kateri so sodelovali tudi nekateri avtorji. V raziskavi je bila jama opremljena z zveznimi merilci (CTD) temperature (T), električne prevodnosti (EC) in nihanja nivojev vode. Vzdolžni in navpični hidrogeološki vodni profili jame so bili izmerjeni, da bi razumeli dinamiko voda med različnimi hidrogeološkimi nivoji in med vdori morske vode. Poleg tega je bil opravljen tudi batimetrični profil, da bi lažje določili, kje izvesti navpične meritve. Med ekspedicijo se je zgodil močan naliv, ki je trajal približno 12 ur, padlo je 80 mm dežja, njegov učinek pa je raziskovalcem omogočil analizo hidrodinamike tekočih voda med poplavo. V običajnih vodostajih so vzdolžne meritve pokazale na dotoke sveže vode, vertikalne meritve pa so pokazale jasno stratifikacijo lastnosti vode (sveža voda na površini in brakična voda na dnu). Med poplavami so podatki EC in T potrdili hitro zamenjavo vode.Ključne besede: anhialine jame, vdor morske vode, hidrodinamika, kraški izviri, PPUR, Filipini.",

    "abstract": "The Appalachian landscape provides an excellent opportunity to examine an environment that promotes sediment subsidence, accumulation and possible preservation: mantled karst. Mantled karst exists along the Blue Ridge-Great Valley margin from south-central Pennsylvania to central Virginia. Topographically, the mantled karst contains low-relief irregular topography with abundant surface depressions, some of which contain ponds, and in places lacks continual surface drainage and springs. Sand and gravel quarries along the valley margin expose predominantly stream flow, hyperconcentrated flow, debris flow and hillslope (colluvial) deposits that mantle karstic Paleozoic bedrock and carbonate residuum. Unconformable and sometimes erosive contacts between carbonate residuum and clastic sediments, and soft-sediment deformation features have been observed within exposures suggesting subsidence into accumulation and/or preservation space created by geochemical dissolution and collapse that continues today. The likelihood of long-term survival in the geological record is dependent upon the relationship between the subsiding sediment and geomorphic base level. The Blue Ridge-Great Valley mantled karst likely contains both short-term accumulation space that is closer to geomorphic base level, thus more prone to removal by fluvial processes, and preservation space, which occurs well below geomorphic base level, where sedimentary sequences may be stored for prolonged periods of time. Ultimately, both accumulation and preservation spaces can provide insight into depositional processes, landscapes and possibly paleoenvironmental conditions, but the geologic record becomes more distorted and fragmented further back into deep time and as this landscape evolves into the future.Key words: karst, sedimentary environments, subsidence, preservation potential, landscape evolution.Razvoj pokritega krasa na robu območja Blue Ridge – Great Valley, ZDA: okolja akumulacije in ohranjanja sedimentovPokriti kras Apalačev nudi izjemne možnosti preučevanja odlaganja, akumulacije in ohranjanja sedimentov. Za pokriti kras na robu območja Blue Ridge – Great Valley med južno-osrednjo Pensilvanijo in osrednjo Virginijo so značilna topografsko razgibana nižavja s številnimi depresijami, ki so lahko tudi ojezerjene, površinski odtok pa je ponekod nepovezan. Kamnolomi peska in grušča vzdolž roba doline razkrivajo različne fluvialne in pobočne sedimente, ki pokrivajo zakrasele paleozojske karbonate in njihov reziduum. Nekonformni in erozijski stiki med karbonatnim reziduumom in klastičnimi sedimenti ter deformacijske oblike v mehkih sedimentih kažejo na akumulacijo in ohranjanje sedimentov v kraških prostorih. Časovna stabilnost sedimentov je odvisna tudi od položaja ugrezanja sedimentov glede na erozijski nivo: prostori akumulacije so blizu erozijskega nivoja in zato podvrženi fluvialnemu odnašanju, prostori ohranjanja pa so pod erozijskim nivojem, zato so tam sedimentna zaporedja ohranjena precej dlje. Preučevanje prostorov akumulacije in prostorov ohranjanja nam omogoča boljše razumevaje razvoja pokrajine in sedimentacijskih procesov v njej. Starejši zapisi so slabše ohranjeni in bolj razdrobljeni.Ključne besede: kras, sedimentacijska okolja, ugrezanje, potencial ohranjanja sedimentov, razvoj površja",

    "abstract": "The Pozzo dei Protei di Monfalcone (northeast Italy) is a cavity developed in Cretaceous limestones (Cenomanian-Turonian) situated near the contact of the north-western zone of the Classical Karst with the Lower Plain of the Isonzo/Soča River. At the bottom of the cave is the groundwater at an average altitude of 1.89 m a.s.l. In consideration of the proximity of the cave with the Adriatic Sea, the possible effects of the tides on the karst aquifer were investigated monitoring groundwater level, electrical conductivity (EC, K25) and water temperature using a CTD diver. Groundwater level daily oscillations show a lag of 4–4.5 hours compared to tides. The electrical conductivity variations that can be correlated to tides are 2–5 μS/cm. Excluding that the cave, given the altimetry, is directly affected by the saltwater wedge, the cyclical variations of the EC would derive from the dispersion at the salt water and fresh water interface and from the mobilization of more mineralized water coming from the rock mass. The hypothesis of mixing fresh and salt water and saline fossil waters in the caves of the area has been verified by a general increase in the chloride ion in this area of the karst aquifer compared to the internal areas of Classical Karst.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the controlling factors of soil organic carbon isotope (δ13CSOC) change and the vegetation succession process is crucial to guide ecological restoration and agricultural cultivation in karst rocky desertification region. However, the information about the combination of C3 and C4 plant distribution and rocky desertification remains unknown. Soils from different landforms, including basin, slope, and plateau, were sampled to investigate the spatial variance of the δ13CSOC distribution characteristics. The contribution of C3 and C4 plant species for δ13CSOC under the different rocky desertification grades (LRD: light rocky desertification; MRD: moderate rocky desertification; and SRD: severe rocky desertification) in Mengzi karst graben basin of Southwest (SW) China was also discussed. The δ13CSOC value decreased with the increase of altitude from basin, slope to plateau. At the same landform, different rocky desertification grades had no significant effect on the δ13CSOC in slope and plateau. Nevertheless, there were significant differences of δ13CSOC C between LRD and SRD in the basin. The C4 plants account for more than 70% in the basin and slope, while C3 plants account for more than 70% in the plateau. This may be due to the long-term cultivation of corn in the historical period in the basin and slope. However, the plateau area is not suitable for the growth of C4 plants such as corn due to the cold climate. In addition, in the same landform, with the aggravation of rocky desertification, the proportion of C4 plants for δ13CSOC increased with the proportion of C3 plants decreased. With the aggravation of rocky desertification, the composition of vegetation species changed from arbour (C3 plants) to small shrubs and herbs (C4 plants).",

    "abstract": "We use the magnitude and centroid period of Rayleigh wave along with the amplitude of fluctuations of water level in a well to calculate effective porosity of a karst aquifer at the site scale. The radial and vertical displacements of Rayleigh wave are first related to the confining pressure of rock, which is then related to fluid pressure via the Gassmann equation. Three seismograms recorded at station 633A of the USARRAY and the induced responses of Well J-17 in the Edwards Aquifer (Texas) allow the calculation of an effective porosity between 17.0 and 24.4 percent, the average of which is close to the total porosity of core samples determined by geophysical well logs. This paper provides an innovative method to measure effective porosity in aquifers. Because of the long wavelengths of Rayleigh wave, the interdisciplinary approach is advantageous in that the resulting effective porosity is at the site scale which includes large conduits or voids.Za izračun efektivne poroznosti kraškega vodonosnika na lokalni ravni smo uporabili velikost in centroidno časovno vrednost Rayleighjevega valovanja, skupaj z amplitudo nihanja vodne gladine v vrtini. Radialni in vertikalni premiki Rayleighjevega valovanja so najprej povezani s tlakom neprepustne kamnine, ki je nato z Gassmannovo enačbo povezan s tlakom tekočine. Trije seizmogrami, evidentirani na postaji 633A USARRAY, in inducirani odzivi vrtine J-17 v vodonosniku Edwards (v Teksasu) omogočajo izračun efektivne poroznosti med 17,0 in 24,4 odstotka, povprečje teh vrednosti pa je blizu poroznosti jedra v vzorcih, ki so bili določeni z geofizikalnimi meritvami v vrtinah. V prispevku je predstavljena inovativna metoda za merjenje efektivne poroznosti v vodonosnikih. Zaradi dolgih valovnih dolžin Rayleighjevega valovanja je interdisciplinarni pristop ugoden, saj efektivna poroznost obravnavanega območja vključuje velike kanale ali praznine.",

    "abstract": "Editorial is a privilege of the editors to share their opinions and news with the readers. It’s been a while since the last editorial was published in Acta Carsologica. In the following, I present my opinion on some issues related to our work and publishing. It was provoked by the Opinion, written by Wolfgang Dreybrodt and published in this issue. We are all aware that the way we do and publish scientific work has been changing fast and dramatically. Rapid progress, broad and productive collaborations, ever better access to sophisticated research equipment, the need for publishing and the search for funds sometimes distract us from deep thinking on the research questions that should be the key element of scientific work. The somehow provoking Opinion opens up many concerns that we all face. It does not reflect the opinion of the editorial board, although I agree with most of them. At some point one might say that times have changed, we need to collaborate and promote our work in order to be seen. However, basic scientific ethics as stressed in the Opinion, should not suffer from the changes. One ethical question facing the editors is whether we should publish in our own journals. A principle answer would be no. Acta Carsologica has an inherent interest in the research at Classical Karst, where most of our editors work. Therefore, we publish in our journal, but we do not interfere into the editorial process of our manuscripts. In times when you have to pay either to read and/or publish a manuscript, new opportunities arise for journals like ours. These journals can attract authors who, for whatever reason, cannot or do not want to spend money on publication and want to keep their work open. However, authors and readers should be aware that publishing is not our main task and that it is difficult to offer such good services as in journals belonging to the large publishing groups. In addition to managing reviews and making decisions, the editors’ tasks often include providing funds for layout and printing, reporting, website maintenance, proofreading, translation, transport, packaging and dispatch of issues. Surely this should not be an excuse for the delays in publication or the long editorial process, but I hope for some understanding of those waiting. We can of course improve. The whole system of scientific publishing is dependent on the review process. The everlasting problem of this and other journals is to get reviewers and then the timely reviews. Looking at the number of publications processed at any time, even in a “narrow” field like ours, we can imagine how many reviewers are needed. Most potential reviewers are busy, active researchers who are aware of the importance of the reviews, but are unable to respond to the requests. If a review takes one day, how many reviews per year can one accept? And, when it comes to selection, why not do a review for a high-ranking journal in which you want to publish your own work. Journals like ours therefore depend on a strong community interested in ensuring that their research field vivid and recognised. Small focused journals provide such a platform. I am asking you all to consider your own role in the karst community and accept the review from our and other karst science journals. This will keep us well and alive, and your work published and seen as well.",

Despite the scientific basis, the proposed definition remains simple enough to be used by cavers and non-specialists. Following this definition, a classification scheme that is also process-based combines the known cave types. Clustering is based on five levels of classification, from which the first two levels define the major cave categories. The rest of the branching is the result of variation in settings and formation agents. A discussion on various classifications and definitions reveals the non-static character of such schemes that tend to change in relation to the progress of research cave census and improved communication of scientists on previously and new discovered caves.",

    "abstract": "One of the unique examples of the development of subsoil karren into a stone forest on the varied geological bedrock of the Lunan surface is revealed to us. Originally of subsoil formation and later denuded, the rounded hills that dissect the karst surface have transformed into a clustered stone forest whose central part usually consists of a larger dissected rock mass with individual stone pillars and teeth at the edge. The geologic profile contains beds of dense, homogeneous and compact fine-grained limestones that alternate with beds of mostly coarse-grained and just as compact dolomitised limestones. These bed properties are also reflected in the exterior of the rock as a diverse relief. The average calcium carbonate content in both types of rocks combined is 97.3%. The rock is thickly bedded to massive; beds are mainly positioned subhorizontally. The contacts between the beds of limestone and dolomitised limestone are sharp and clearly visible, especially in the bottom part of the geologic profile, whereas in the central part, they are often blurred and one type of rock grades continuously into the other. In the areas containing limestone, individual bedding planes are especially visible. As can be inferred, the slightly more porous dolomitised rock, made up of larger particles, disintegrates faster in a more permanently waterlogged acid subsoil environment, where the moisture penetrates it deeper. However, as it takes longer to dissolve, it protrudes from the surface of the dolomitic limestone rock when exposed to moisture from occasional rain. The composition and fracturing of the diverse rock strata decisively influences the shape of the pillars and their rock relief. Larger subsoil rock forms (channels, notches, half-bells) have developed on all rock strata. The diversity of the rock is also reflected by the notches that have formed under the soil along the more rapidly soluble partly dolomite rock strata. Denuded subsoil-shaped pillars are reshaped by rainwater and trickling water. Smaller rock forms carved by rainwater have formed mostly only on evenly composed, fine- grained limestone rock. The tops on such rock are more distinctly conical and blade-like and wider on more slowly soluble rock.",

    "abstract": "Due to various factors influencing diverse rocks, karst phenomena take unique shapes that are most often reflected in the rock relief. Through a series of different developmental factors, new factors first gradually transform the traces of old formations and over time, if they are distinct enough, they can replace them with completely new ones. In places old forms are reflected in the formation of a new rock relief only indirectly. The rock relief of karst phenomena, in this case karren, also develops under the influence of a single factor. Developmentally, rock forms, due to dissection of the surface and lasting of development, often in several layers merge into one another. A development model enables us to discover the overall development of the formation of the selected part of the rocky karst surface. The individual rock forms which have merged into the rock relief represent just one stage of development. Good knowledge of the overall development enables us to discern the development so far and predict future development. A number of development models can be discerned. One of the basic models reveals the manner of the rain-induced formation and development of horizontal and gently sloping carbonate rock strata into karren and stone forests, especially after the disintegration of the upper (thinner) rock strata and the denudation and shaping of the bottom strata. It reveals many characteristics of rock formation, from the sheet flow to the formation of rain flutes, their merging into rain channels and the development of funnel-like notches; that is, developmental transition of rock forms and rock relief in the overall development from the flat surface to its dissection into peaks.",
